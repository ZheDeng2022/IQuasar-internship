      This is a compassionate use protocol of an investigational new drug (IND). The overall&#xD;
      purpose of the treatment is to offer alternative treatment to children who developed&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) and have not responded positively to&#xD;
      currently available medical therapies. PNALD develops in newborns dependent on parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition (PN) and are unable to tolerate adequate enteral feedings to support fluid and&#xD;
      nutritional fluids; although PN is necessary and life sustaining, it can result in severe&#xD;
      liver disease.&#xD;

      1. The overall purpose of the treatment is to offer alternative treatment to children who&#xD;
           developed parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) and have not responded&#xD;
           positively to currently available medical therapies. PNALD develops in newborns&#xD;
           dependent on parenteral nutrition (PN) and are unable to tolerate adequate enteral&#xD;
           feedings to support fluid and nutritional fluids; although PN is necessary and life&#xD;
           sustaining, it can result in severe liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators want to see if a form of intravenous fat mixture, Omegaven, helps in&#xD;
           the treatment of children with PNALD. Experimental data has shown that the intravenous&#xD;
           fat mixture (Intralipid) that is currently being used as a part of newborn PN, may be&#xD;
           contributing to the liver disease. Omegaven is different fat mixture manufactured and&#xD;
           used in Europe in adults. It is different in that it is made from highly refined fish&#xD;
           oil, while Intralipid is made from soybeans. Case control studies only, and not&#xD;
           randomized clinical trials, show that Omegaven may reverse or treat PNALD. Since&#xD;
           Omegaven is not currently approved for use in the United States, treatment IND was&#xD;
           obtained from Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feeding intolerance is a common pathway of a broad array of medical and surgical disease&#xD;
           states encountered in the neonatal population. Consequently, a high percentage of&#xD;
           patients in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) need to rely on PN if they are to&#xD;
           survive and grow. Through decades of research the development of PN has been a great&#xD;
           success in that its use has maintained countless patients in sufficient nutritional&#xD;
           status to recover from medical or surgical conditions. However, one complication of PN&#xD;
           that remains poorly understood and that still causes considerable morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality is PNALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are a wide variety of case scenarios for PNALD. There are scenarios in which&#xD;
           newborns suffer irrecoverable bowel loss from some process (e.g., necrotizing&#xD;
           enterocolitis totalis, mid gut volvulus) and consequently require long term PN as they&#xD;
           await bowel transplant; as a result they almost always also require liver transplant&#xD;
           secondary to PNALD. This further delays their surgery as they wait for two organs&#xD;
           instead of one (Chungfat, Dixler et al. 2007). More commonly, cases involve patients who&#xD;
           have prolonged bowel dysfunction that requires long term use of PN but who slowly&#xD;
           recover and gradually transition to enteral feeds. For these infants the race between&#xD;
           bowel recovery and PNALD progression often decides whether the patient lives or dies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Although the etiology of PNALD is poorly understood and likely to be multi-factorial&#xD;
           (Steinbach, Clark et al. 2008), recent animal research and human case studies suggest&#xD;
           that altering the dose and the composition of the lipid component of PN might alter the&#xD;
           course of PNALD (Alwayn, Gura et al. 2005; Gura, Parsons et al. 2005; Gura, Duggan et&#xD;
           al. 2006; Gura, Lee et al. 2008). The lipid products used for PN in the United States&#xD;
           are derived from soy oil; the brand used at Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital is&#xD;
           Intralipid®. Soy-based PN lipids are rich in omega-6 FA and also contain small amounts&#xD;
           of omega-3 FA in the form of linolenic acid precursor. The potential toxicity of omega-6&#xD;
           fatty acids as it relates to PNALD has been recently revealed (Diamond, Sterescu et al.&#xD;
           2008; de Meijer, Gura et al 2009). This FA composition is sufficient to prevent&#xD;
           essential FA deficiency (EFAD), historically measured as the ratio of specific omega-6&#xD;
           FA in the blood (Gura, Lee et al 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a published article (Gura, Duggan et al. 2006) reporting 2 cases in depth and in a&#xD;
      subsequent paper (Gura, Lee et al. 2008) reporting 18 patients with established PNALD who&#xD;
      required continued PN, investigators replaced the standard soy based lipid component of PN&#xD;
      with a fish oil derived parenteral lipid (Omegaven™) that contains a high percentage (30 to&#xD;
      60%) of omega-3 FA. This therapy, which is still experimental in the United States, was&#xD;
      associated with a gradual but ultimately profound correction of PNALD as indicated by&#xD;
      laboratory markers such as conjugated bilirubin and circulating liver enzymes; the median&#xD;
      time to reduce serum direct bilirubin from &gt;2mg/dl to &lt;2mg/dl was 9.4 weeks. No significant&#xD;
      adverse effects of Omegaven™ in the doses utilized were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is to identify infants with PNALD of moderate severity or worse, defined as&#xD;
      two consecutive measurements of direct bilirubin of 3 mg/dL after being on PN for &gt; 3 weeks&#xD;
      and who are anticipated to require PN for another 3 weeks, which puts them at risk of further&#xD;
      progression of PNALD. For inclusion, other causes of liver disease must be ruled out. Upon&#xD;
      meeting entry criteria, infant families will be offered, through an Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board (IRB) approved consent process, the same treatment protocol for their infants that was&#xD;
      successfully applied in the above cited clinical cases and detailed below. Monitoring for&#xD;
      side effects, complications and disease progression or regression will be instituted. Therapy&#xD;
      will be stopped when direct bilirubin is &lt; 1 mg/dL for 2 weekly measurements or when the&#xD;
      patient is tolerating enough enteral nutrition so that PN is no longer needed. Clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory monitoring will be continued for 2 weeks post Omegaven™ infusion and as indicated&#xD;
      by events thereafter. Additional endpoint criteria are: patients receiving transplants;&#xD;
      AST/ALT, GGTP, C-reactive protein and albumin, mortality, infection rates and types, and&#xD;
      frequency of red blood cell transfusions; if infant worsens with treatment or does not&#xD;
      tolerate treatment with Omegaven, specifically for the adverse event of severe uncontrolled&#xD;
      bleeding as listed in the risk section.&#xD;
