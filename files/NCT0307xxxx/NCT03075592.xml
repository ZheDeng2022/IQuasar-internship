      This study plans to directly address the problem of post-ERCP pancreatitis to gauge the&#xD;
      various factors involved in its development and genetic variability in the immune response to&#xD;
      an isolated pancreatic insult. In addition, the investigators hope to study markers of the&#xD;
      early immune response to this injury and to develop a risk-assessment model.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) is an important diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic tool in the management of pancreatic and biliary diseases. However, it carries up&#xD;
      to 10% risk of developing acute pancreatitis, 10% of which will be severe. Current models to&#xD;
      predict the severity of acute pancreatitis are incomplete and unable to prognosticate early&#xD;
      in the course of the disease because they are based on biomarkers of late immune response.&#xD;
      Recent findings suggest that polymorphisms in the gene coding for MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemotactic&#xD;
      Protein-1) play an important role in the early immune response leading to either mild versus&#xD;
      severe acute pancreatitis of various etiologies.&#xD;

      Participant samples will be stored for an indefinite period of time in the Genomics and&#xD;
      Proteomics Core Laboratories or in the laboratory of Dr. Whitcomb or appropriate core&#xD;
      facility at the University of Pittsburgh. The samples will remain within the research studies&#xD;
      of Dr. Whitcomb. Only authorized samples will be made available to other studies following&#xD;
      IRB guidelines. The primary investigator, Dr. David Whitcomb, will have control over the&#xD;
      blood samples.&#xD;
