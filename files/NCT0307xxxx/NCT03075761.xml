  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      'The PACT trial' is randomized pilot trial to demonstrate the feasibility and potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of a personal &quot;fitness tracker&quot; to improve adherence to an activity regimen&#xD;
      following an initial acute DVT in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility of an innovative intervention of a validated fitness tracker, the Fitbit, to&#xD;
      improve adherence to a 12-week activity regimen in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will be tested in 44 subjects with first, acute, proximal lower extremity deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will consist of a) feasibility indicators determined a priori&#xD;
      (eligibility, consent, adherence, retention) and b) estimates of effect size associated with&#xD;
      the prescribed activity regimen, by describing within-subject change in QoL and potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) pre and post intervention in each group.&#xD;

Lysis 30% and Lysis 60% are measurements of percent amplitude reduction 30 and 60 minutes after maximum amplitude, respectively, on thromboelastography.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Quality of Life from baseline to post intervention of increased physical activity assessed by PedsQL instrument. It consists of structured interview with the parents and the child with 23 items divided among 4 sub-scales to assess function in 4 domains: Physical; Emotional; social; and School. Each item is a statement of a problem, which the subject rates in severity from 0-4, indicating a problem never occurs (score of 0) to almost always occurs (score of 4). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50,3=25,4=0, with higher scores indicating better health related QoL.&#xD;
The positive change from baseline to 6 months correspond to better quality of life.</description>

        <description>Percent Change in Fibrinolysis Biomarker from baseline to post intervention of increased physical activity is measured by thromboelastography (TEG). TEG is often used to predict bleeding and diagnose various bleeding disorders.&#xD;
Lysis 30% and Lysis 60% are measurements of percent amplitude reduction 30 and 60 minutes after maximum amplitude, respectively, on thromboelastography.&#xD;
Decreased clotting ability (negative value) = better outcome Increased clotting ability (positive value)= worse outcome</description>

        <description>Change in Quality of Life from baseline to post intervention of increased physical activity assessed by PedsQL instrument. It consists of structured interview with the parents and the child with 23 items divided among 4 sub-scales to assess function in 4 domains: Physical; Emotional; social; and School. Each item is a statement of a problem, which the subject rates in severity from 0-4, indicating a problem never occurs (score of 0) to almost always occurs (score of 4). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50,3=25,4=0, with higher scores indicating better health related QoL.&#xD;
The positive change from baseline to 6 months correspond to better quality of life.</description>
