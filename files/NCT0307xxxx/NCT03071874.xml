    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a chemotherapy as a possible treatment for Meningiomas&#xD;
      (recurrent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      --AZD2014 (vistusertib)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD2014 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug AZD2014 can shrink or&#xD;
      slow the growth of meningioma. Based on laboratory research, the cellular pathways which are&#xD;
      blocked by AZD2014 are important for the growth and survival of meningiomas. Further,&#xD;
      treatment of meningioma cells in the laboratory has resulted in decreased survival of tumor&#xD;
      cells. As such, the purpose of this research is to see whether treating recurrent grade 2-3&#xD;
      meningioma with AZD2014 will result in tumor size stabilization or shrinkage. The safety of&#xD;
      AZD2014 will also be studied. The physical state, the symptoms, changes in the size of the&#xD;
      tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if&#xD;
      AZD2014 is safe and effective in participants with this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD2014 is being studied in patients with various cancers as a single agent (a drug that is&#xD;
      used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of well known anticancer&#xD;
      therapies. Previous studies have also allowed investigators to determine the best dose and&#xD;
      frequency of AZD2014 to achieve anti-tumor effects while reducing the likelihood of side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

             a MUGA is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing renal disease including glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi&#xD;
             Syndrome or renal tubular acidosis.&#xD;

             msec obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs), family or personal history of long or&#xD;
             short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de&#xD;
             Pointes within 12 months of the patient entering in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled Type II (HbA1c &gt;8% assessed locally) as judged by the&#xD;

             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD2014 is an mTORC1/2 inhibiting&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with AZD2014, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with AZD2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD2014. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca,&#xD;
             CRO staff, and/or staff at the CPU).&#xD;
