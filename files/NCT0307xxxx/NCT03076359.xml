  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to adapt and assess the impact of a traditional healer&#xD;
      training program/intervention on the adherence, retention, and viral load of HIV infected&#xD;
      patients newly initiated on anti-retroviral therapy in rural Mozambique.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incorporating healers as anti-retroviral therapy adherence counselors can help reduce the&#xD;
      crisis of HIV treatment abandonment. Healers are often accused of encouraging patients to&#xD;
      abandon HIV care, but they can also serve as strong advocates for patient health. When&#xD;
      healers were engaged as tuberculosis adherence counselors in South Africa, their patients&#xD;
      were as successful as those supported by non-healer counselors. An innovative solution would&#xD;
      be to engage trained healers as treatment partners to support medication and appointment&#xD;
      adherence for people living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healers are well positioned to address reported patient concerns, including: (1) keeping a&#xD;
      patients HIV status a secret while providing support; (2) assisting with partner disclosure&#xD;
      and initiating community/clinical systems of assistance if gender base violence is&#xD;
      threatened/occurs; and (3) advocating for patients during clinical visits to ensure quality&#xD;
      care is provided. Other programs in sub-Saharan Africa have shown that incorporating healers&#xD;
      into an allopathic health system as adherence supporters for TB treatment is feasible, but&#xD;
      healer use in HIV treatment is not well-documented. This novel intervention would provide&#xD;
      patients newly initiated on ART a choice to nominate a specially trained healer as a&#xD;
      treatment partner, and assess acceptability, feasibility, and patient outcomes using an&#xD;
      interrupted time series quasi-experimental design. Community-based treatment partners can&#xD;
      improve pharmacy adherence and loss to follow up , while decreasing stigma and isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engaging healers to conduct counseling sessions in a community setting to improve ART&#xD;
      adherence necessitates technical clinical and psycho-social training. The ART Adherence&#xD;
      Support Worker Training program will be adapted and used to train healers to be quality&#xD;
      treatment partners and advocates. The training will ensure healers have the knowledge and&#xD;
      skills to effectively: (1) Educate people living with HIV about treatment and HIV care; (2)&#xD;
      Assess serious medication side effects or HIV co-infections; (3) Counsel patients about safer&#xD;
      strategies for partner disclosure (with assistance if needed); (4) Accompany the patient for&#xD;
      each clinical appointment; and (5) Advocate for quality health care delivery when assisting&#xD;
      each patient. The training team will conduct training of the healers. All patients initiating&#xD;
      treatment will be screened for interest in having a healer treatment partner. Control and&#xD;
      intervention patients will be followed for one year, allowing the investigators to compare&#xD;
      outcomes at 12-months to study the effectiveness of healers as adherence partners.&#xD;

    <description>We accessed the percentage of days where participants have medication. For example, if a participant picked up a 30 day supply of medication on August 1st but did not collect their next medication until October 1st, the patient would only be considered retained for 50% of the time.</description>

    <measure>Viral Load</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient viral load at 12 months to assess the impact of the intervention on HIV viral suppression. HIV viral load tests are reported as the number of HIV copies in a milliliter (copies/mL) of blood using a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. If the viral load measurement is high, it generally indicates that HIV is present and replicating. Initial, untreated, and uncontrolled HIV viral loads can range as high as one million or more copies/mL. Viral loads that are consistently less than 200 copies/mL indicate that the virus is adequately suppressed and that the risk of disease progression is low. Viral load results below zero indicate that no virus was detected (this is how the outputs are recorded using the PRC test in the region. We did not assess change in values over time.</description>

The intervention includes: (1) healer visits to the patient at home, healer support for couples counseling, healer provision of nutritional advice, and healer counsel about the importance of adherence. If anything is amiss, the healer will accompany the patient to the health facility for additional clinical services. In addition, the healer will accompany the patient on all regularly scheduled clinical visits.</description>

        <title>Viral Load</title>
        <description>Patient viral load at 12 months to assess the impact of the intervention on HIV viral suppression. HIV viral load tests are reported as the number of HIV copies in a milliliter (copies/mL) of blood using a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. If the viral load measurement is high, it generally indicates that HIV is present and replicating. Initial, untreated, and uncontrolled HIV viral loads can range as high as one million or more copies/mL. Viral loads that are consistently less than 200 copies/mL indicate that the virus is adequately suppressed and that the risk of disease progression is low. Viral load results below zero indicate that no virus was detected (this is how the outputs are recorded using the PRC test in the region. We did not assess change in values over time.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
        <population>While this was one of our primary outcomes, less than 50% of our patients had a viral load within 2 months of the end of their first year in treatment. Laboratory capacity and transportation issues have been a problem in rural Mozambique for many years. While we were hoping this would be solved before the end of our study it was not.</population>
