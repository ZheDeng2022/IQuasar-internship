    <measure>Exploratory Endpoint - Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessments for Active Skin Manifestations</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The physician's global assessment for active skin manifestations recorded the number of ulcers, target lesion noted for endpoint evaluation, diameters of each target lesion and score of evaluation at each visit. The scores ranged from 0 (total resolution) to 4 (no evidence of healing).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Endpoint - Change From Baseline in Patient Global Assessments for Active Skin Manifestations</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The patient global assessment for active skin manifestation recorded the disease and pain severity using a visual analogue to mark the participant's score. Participants were asked to rate their disease severity from &quot;not severe&quot; to &quot;extremely severe&quot; and pain levels from &quot;no pain at all' to &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; in the past one week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Endpoint - Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI questionnaire assessed how much a participant's life is affected through their skin problem in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure and sport activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment- related feelings. Participants responded to the 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) with a total score ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicated that the skin problem had an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas lower scores indicated that the disease has minimal to no effect at all.</description>

    <description>Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), physical and neurological examinations, vital sign measurements, and 12-lead electrocardiograms. The number of participants with adverse events and CS safety measures have been reported.</description>

        <description>The DLQI questionnaire assessed how much a participant's life is affected through their skin problem in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure and sport activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment- related feelings. Participants responded to the 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) with a total score ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicated that the skin problem had an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas lower scores indicated that the disease has minimal to no effect at all.</description>
