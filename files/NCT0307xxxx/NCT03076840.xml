  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hamstring muscle is an important muscle that affect the performance of almost all&#xD;
      activities of daily living. Since this muscle is a large muscle that pass across two major&#xD;
      joints (the hip and knee joint), it is more susceptible to become tight and to lose its&#xD;
      extensibility. On the other hand, there is no agreement on a standard protocol for the&#xD;
      treatment of hamstring tightness. Kinesio tape is one of the options for treatment of&#xD;
      hamstring muscle, it is a safe, passive and non-painful intervention, and if proven to be&#xD;
      effective it will help individuals especially those with poor compliance and poor tolerance&#xD;
      to painful stretching exercises. The aim of the present study is to investigate the acute&#xD;
      effectiveness of Kinesio taping on hamstring muscles extensibility. 96 students with&#xD;
      hamstring tightness will be recruited from the University of Dammam to participate in this&#xD;
      prospective experimental study. All participants will be assigned randomly to either a&#xD;
      Kinesio tape group, Sham tape group and control group. Outcome measures will be the hamstring&#xD;
      length measurement by using active knee extension test and strength measurement for hamstring&#xD;
      and quadriceps muscles by using a handheld dynamometer. Outcome measurement will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and 15 minutes after the intervention.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, pre-post experimental study with three groups (Kinesio tape group, sham tape&#xD;
      group and control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted at the laboratory of University of Dammam one session (half an hour)&#xD;
      for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      96 students with hamstring tightness were recruited from the University of Dammam as a sample&#xD;
      of convenience to participate in this study. These students were enrolled in the study based&#xD;
      on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Female student with an age of 18-25 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Body mass index between 18-30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. students with reduced hamstring length (hamstring tightness) as defined by the&#xD;
           literature (popliteal angle less than 160 degree)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. lower limb musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. abdominal , lower limb and spinal surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. previous injury or trauma to hamstring muscle, hip, knee And ankle joint&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Skin allergy, disease or hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Low back pain or any neurological impairment in the lower extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Body mass index above 30 or below 18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A poster announcement was published at University of Dammam, 96 female students were&#xD;
      recruited from a convenience sampling of students. The possible participants were approached&#xD;
      and the idea of the research (the duration of the participation, the length of treatment&#xD;
      session, the goal of the research, any possible risks including skin irritation or allergy&#xD;
      from the Kinesio tape) were explained to the student. The students were instructed about&#xD;
      dealing with any skin irritation by removing the tape and applying ice in the area for 10-15&#xD;
      min, students were informed that there is no compensation for any skin reaction due the&#xD;
      Kinesio tape, although this may be less likely to happen . The students were given the chance&#xD;
      to ask questions. If the students agree to participate in the research, they were given the&#xD;
      consent form to read and ask a question again for any details and then they were asked to&#xD;
      sign the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, the subjects were scanned for the eligibility of fitting the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria by the primary researcher, This was done in a safe and secured room in the&#xD;
      laboratories of physical therapy department where the evaluation and intervention procedures&#xD;
      were taken place. If the students fit the eligibility, then the students were undergoing a&#xD;
      tape allergy test by applying a small piece of Kinesio tape to the patient skin for 10&#xD;
      minute. If the students pass this test by having no allergy reaction, then they were enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. Students age, height, weight and body mass index(BMI) were recorded, then the&#xD;
      students were undergo a 5 minute walking as a warming up to pre-condition the muscles before&#xD;
      the examination. Then, hamstring length measurement, strength measurement of hamstring and&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle were done (All students data will be coded and stored with the primary&#xD;
      researcher through a secured password to ensure the student data confidentiality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hamstring length measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hamstring muscle length was measured by using the active knee extension test&#xD;
           (AKE)(Active knee extension is reliable and associated with minimal pelvic and lumber&#xD;
           motion. Therefore, it considers a suitable and preferable test for evaluating the length&#xD;
           of hamstring muscle. The knee extension angle (popliteal angle) was measured by using a&#xD;
           conventional goniometer which is a reliable tool for measuring the range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hamstring length measurement was performed with the student in a supine position&#xD;
           with 90-degree hip flexion touching the horizontal bar apparatus.The non-tested lower&#xD;
           limb was secured with a strap attached to the table. While the student maintains the&#xD;
           contact between her thigh and the horizontal bar apparatus, she was asked to extend the&#xD;
           leg as much as possible. The angle of the knee joint was measured by the researcher with&#xD;
           a goniometer. The measurements were done three times, and the mean value were recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength were measured by the primary researcher by using&#xD;
      the handheld dynamometer. The hamstring strength measurement was done with the student in&#xD;
      prone position, then the student was asked to flex the knee as hard as possible while the&#xD;
      researcher try to prevent the movement with the handheld dynamometer just proximal to the&#xD;
      medial malleolus. The quadriceps strength measurement was done with the same procedure but&#xD;
      from sitting position and the student was asked to extend the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing all of the baseline outcome measures (hamstring length measurement and the&#xD;
      strength measurement), the student were given a number and were assigned randomly to either&#xD;
      the Kinesio tape group or the sham tape group or the control group. Each group fellow their&#xD;
      program. The outcome measurements were repeated after 15 min at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      treatment period&#xD;
