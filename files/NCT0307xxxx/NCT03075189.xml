  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to approximately 38 (unknown drop-out rate) geriatric patients (at least 65 years old) are&#xD;
      recruited from a Geriatric ward at Slagelse Sygehus. After inclusion and baseline&#xD;
      measurements, each individual will be randomized into either an intervention or control group&#xD;
      arranged in blocks of 8 The intervention group (n≤19) will receive protein enriched&#xD;
      snacks/dishes in the morning and late evening, before bedtime. Moreover, upon discharge the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive individual dietary counseling focusing on choosing&#xD;
      protein-rich foods and on protein rich meals. The control group (n≤19) will receive normal&#xD;
      hospital food without enrichment and no dietary counseling at discharge. In both groups the&#xD;
      following data will be obtained: recorded protein intake, anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      (weight, height, body composition estimated with bioimpedance), functional ability (De Morton&#xD;
      Mobility Index (DEMMI) and Barthels ADL-index), hand grip strength, sarkopenic status&#xD;
      (SARC-F), quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), length of stay (LOS) and readmissions (within 30 days&#xD;
      after discharge). During hospitalization food intake will be registered, as well as 24 hour&#xD;
      recall interviews and food frequency questionnaires will be done at follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be performed at baseline, on the day of discharge and 4 weeks after&#xD;
      discharge (follow up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is change in protein intake from Baseline to 4 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that serving of individually selected protein enriched snack/dish in the&#xD;
      morning and before bedtime during hospitalization results in higher protein intake during&#xD;
      hospitalization and that this experience combined with dietary counseling at discharge,&#xD;
      results in a higher protein intake at 28 days after discharge. Further, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      the increased protein intake will affect functional level, hand grip strength, sarcopenic&#xD;
      status and quality of life in geriatric patients and will lead to shorter LOS and fewer&#xD;
      readmission frequency.&#xD;
