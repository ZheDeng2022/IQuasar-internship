      The investigators intend to undertake a study to investigate the effect of radiotherapy on&#xD;
      deep inferior epigastric perforator flap reconstructions (DIEP). Adjuvant post-mastectomy&#xD;
      radiotherapy (PMRT) is offered to women at high risk of chest wall recurrence. The perceived&#xD;
      detrimental effect of radiotherapy on an immediate breast reconstruction and the &quot;one-off&quot;&#xD;
      nature of autologous reconstruction leads some surgeons to recommend delayed reconstruction&#xD;
      after mastectomy or to use a temporising implant with a view to planned exchange to&#xD;
      autologous reconstruction after radiotherapy. However, there remains significant uncertainty&#xD;
      in the literature about the impact of radiotherapy on autologous reconstructions. This study&#xD;
      is a mixed methology study using patient reported outcome measures (PROMS), applanation&#xD;
      tonometry (measure of breast compressibility), semi-structured interviews and 3 dimensional&#xD;
      photography analysis to compare the aesthetic and impact on quality of life on the following&#xD;
      groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unilateral skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction and&#xD;
           PMRT (cases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unilateral SSM with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction and no PMRT (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Unilateral simple mastectomy, PMRT, and subsequent delayed DIEP flap reconstruction&#xD;
           (controls)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1997, breast cancer has been the most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 31% of&#xD;
      all new cancers in women. According to the latest statistics published by Cancer Research UK,&#xD;
      approximately 50,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010(1). In the UK, 53% of&#xD;
      women with symptomatic breast cancer and 27% of those with screen-detected breast cancer are&#xD;
      treated surgically with mastectomy; therefore approximately 21,500 undergo a therapeutic&#xD;
      mastectomy each year (2). Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE) recommend that immediate breast reconstruction is offered to women during&#xD;
      the same operation as their mastectomy (3). The UK National Mastectomy and Breast&#xD;
      Reconstruction Audit Second Report 2009 (4) states that 21% of their cohort underwent&#xD;
      immediate breast reconstruction, thus one would expect approximately 4500 women to undergo&#xD;
      immediate reconstruction each year in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A breast reconstruction should mimic the natural appearance of the breast in shape, volume&#xD;
      and compliance, together giving a symmetrical result. Breast reconstruction ranges from&#xD;
      implant-based methods to autologous free flap reconstruction, such as the deep inferior&#xD;
      epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap, which was first popularised by Allen in 1994(5). In our&#xD;
      unit, the DIEP flap has become one of the most reliable and popular methods of breast&#xD;
      reconstruction, with flap failure rate of less than 1%. We, like others, view it as the&#xD;
      current &quot;gold standard&quot; in breast reconstruction(6)(7)(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) is offered to women at high risk of chest wall&#xD;
      recurrence. The perceived detrimental effect of radiotherapy on an immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction and the &quot;one-off&quot; nature of autologous reconstruction leads some surgeons to&#xD;
      recommend delayed reconstruction after mastectomy or to use a temporising implant with a view&#xD;
      to planned exchange to autologous reconstruction after radiotherapy. However, there remains&#xD;
      significant uncertainty in the literature about the impact of radiotherapy on autologous&#xD;
      reconstructions . Initially, small case series supported the clinical bias that radiotherapy&#xD;
      is detrimental to the autologous reconstruction but, more recently, larger series have&#xD;
      challenged this view. Each study has flaws, such as being underpowered, having insufficient&#xD;
      duration of follow up, not reporting patient satisfaction or not measuring volume objectively&#xD;
      such that residual questions remain. A recent systematic review by Kelley et al attempted to&#xD;
      address questions related to complications and flap compromise as a result of radiation&#xD;
      delivery before or after autologous breast reconstruction. The review analysed 20 articles&#xD;
      with over 1,500 flap reconstructions. No significant differences in measurable postoperative&#xD;
      complications including total flap loss, wound healing complications, infection, haematoma,&#xD;
      seroma, and fat necrosis were found in comparing patients who underwent PMRT before or after&#xD;
      autologous reconstruction. However, differences in cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction&#xD;
      in the irradiated and unirradiated flap reconstruction groups were not adequately addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The heterogeneity of opinion in the literature on the impact of radiotherapy makes patient&#xD;
      information and decision-making difficult. It may be that the detrimental effect of&#xD;
      radiotherapy is outweighed in terms of patient satisfaction by the benefit of immediate&#xD;
      reconstruction with a definitive reconstruction and that surgeons' concerns are overvalued,&#xD;
      yet it is upon this anecdotal surgeon-reported outcome that patient decision making is based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an era when breast cancer patients are more likely to survive their disease (85% for 5&#xD;
      year survival), the physical and psychological effects of treatment, especially long term&#xD;
      effects, are very relevant. A woman with residual dissatisfaction with her reconstructed&#xD;
      breast has a constant reminder of her disease and treatment. Optimising reconstructive&#xD;
      outcomes is a major issue in survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons strive to attain the best possible reconstructive outcomes and are aware of the&#xD;
      effects of radiotherapy on an autologous flap. They therefore often advise against any&#xD;
      procedure which may have a detrimental impact on &quot;their&quot; flap. However, from a patient&#xD;
      perspective, by having a delayed reconstruction the treatment pathway is prolonged by several&#xD;
      months, if not years, and requires an additional operation(s) compared to those who undergo&#xD;
      immediate reconstruction and PMRT. There remains significant uncertainty in the literature&#xD;
      about the magnitude of the impact of radiotherapy from a surgeon's perspective and very&#xD;
      little is known about the patients' preferences in terms of detrimental impact on flap vs&#xD;
      effect of the prolonged pathway on their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By objectively assessing irradiated autologous flap reconstructions and comparing with&#xD;
      unirradiated patients we will understand further the impact of radiotherapy on an autologous&#xD;
      flap. By quantifying the difference in patient satisfaction, and understanding the&#xD;
      perspective of patients who have PMRT to an immediate or delayed reconstruction we will&#xD;
      understand further the impact of both pathways on their lives, the reconstruction and their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the result. This, we believe, will enable clinicians to better inform&#xD;
      patients, empowering them in their decision-making about the best timing for breast&#xD;
      reconstruction and potentially enabling more women to undergo immediate definitive breast&#xD;
      reconstruction with DIEP flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to enrol patients who have undergone unilateral mastectomy and DIEP reconstruction.&#xD;
      Patients will fall into one of four possible groups depending on the decision made by the&#xD;
      surgeon and patient pre-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unilateral skin sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction and&#xD;
           PMRT (cases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Unilateral SSM with immediate DIEP flap reconstruction and no PMRT (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Unilateral simple mastectomy, PMRT, and subsequent delayed DIEP flap reconstruction&#xD;
           (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unilateral SSM with temporizing implant, PMRT and subsequent conversion to DIEP&#xD;
           (controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a mixed methods case control study using both quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative research methods. Initially a prospective study was planned, however for those&#xD;
      patients who undergo a delayed reconstruction the whole oncological and reconstructive&#xD;
      process can take several years. Secondly the number of patients who are currently undergoing&#xD;
      radiotherapy to their DIEP breast reconstruction is relatively small. For these reasons it&#xD;
      was decided that a truly prospective study would not be practical but prospective data&#xD;
      collection from a recent cohort of patients would yield a greater study population.&#xD;
