      A randomized controlled trial to test the potential safety and efficacy of LCSD in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure due to non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy at the University of Cape&#xD;
      Town. Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation (LCSD) is a surgical intervention that modulates&#xD;
      the autonomic innervation of the cardiac system. This is important because: a] sympathetic&#xD;
      and parasympathetic tone has a profound effect on the threshold for ventricular&#xD;
      tachyarrhythmias-the main cause of sudden cardiac death in this population; and b] autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction (which is characterized by an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic&#xD;
      activation), plays an important detrimental role in the pathophysiology and progression of&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;

      STUDY SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      TITLE Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation (LCSD) for Cardiomyopathy Study DESIGN Phase II&#xD;
      feasibility parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) AIMS Assess the feasibility and safety&#xD;
      of LCSD in patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure OUTCOME MEASURES Recruitment rates,&#xD;
      retention, follow-up and safety POPULATION 30 patients with heart failure secondary to&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy ELIGIBILITY Adult participants with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      DURATION 18 months follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive LCSD in addition to optimal medical therapy in the&#xD;
      intervention arm (15 patients) and optimal medical therapy in the active control arm (15&#xD;
      patients). Participants would be recruited from both inpatient and outpatient general medical&#xD;
      and cardiology wards and clinics at Groote Schuur Hospital where patients with the syndrome&#xD;
      of heart failure are frequently referred for subspecialty evaluation and management. Eligible&#xD;
      patients who meet the inclusion criteria would be randomized to undergo LCSD in addition to&#xD;
      optimal medical therapy (intervention arm) or receive standard optimal medical therapy&#xD;
      (active placebo). Optimal therapy for patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure&#xD;
      currently consists of an ace-inhibitor or angiotensinogen receptor blocker, beta-blocker,&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with or without a loop diuretic, and digoxin. All&#xD;
      patients in the study would receive an implantable loop recorder to allow for the accurate&#xD;
      determination of episodes of symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In&#xD;
      order not to lose all of the clinical outcome information obtained in the pilot phase of the&#xD;
      study, we would propose only assessing the pre-specified feasibility and safety aspects of&#xD;
      the study and keeping the data on efficacy outcomes blinded for inclusion in the fully&#xD;
      powered main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LCSD procedure The procedure involves the surgical removal of the lower half of the left&#xD;
      stellate ganglion (T1) and thoracic ganglia (T2-T4), thereby removing the pro-arrhythmic&#xD;
      noradrenergic input to the ventricles (3). LCSD raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold&#xD;
      without impairing cardiac contractility or reducing heart rate. LCSD results in&#xD;
      pre-ganglionic denervation, thus preventing re-innervation and producing permanent&#xD;
      antifibrillatory effects. This procedure can be performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic&#xD;
      surgery (VATS) usually in less than 45 minutes and will be conducted by thoracic surgeons at&#xD;
      Groote Schuur Hospital. The lead thoracic surgeon (J.R.) has a large experience in performing&#xD;
      this procedure for the indication of hyperhidrosis in over 200 patients (personal&#xD;
      communication). This experienced thoracic surgeon will lead a team of thoracic surgeons&#xD;
      (T.P., L.M.) to perform the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantable loop recorder (ILR) insertion The implantable loop recorder is a small device&#xD;
      that will be inserted at the end of the LCSD procedure by the thoracic surgeon or after&#xD;
      enrolment in the optimal medical therapy arm by a cardiologist. This loop recorder is&#xD;
      inserted under sterile conditions in the catheter laboratory or operating theatre. In the&#xD;
      catheter laboratory, the device is inserted under local anaesthetic, subcutaneously over the&#xD;
      left precordium and usually takes less than 15 minutes. The implantable loop recorder is a&#xD;
      well-established device to quantify and detect atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias with&#xD;
      an excellent safety record. The device has a battery life of up to 3 years and can be removed&#xD;
      via a small skin incision at the end of the study. Implantable loop recorder insertion does&#xD;
      not carry risk of known major complications. There is a minimal risk (&lt;1%) of complications&#xD;
      (infection, bleeding) as the device is implanted subcutaneously. Potential complications&#xD;
      include superficial skin infections that readily responds to antibiotics. Device removal is&#xD;
      easy to perform and is seldom required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal Medical Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function&#xD;
      will receive guideline and evidence based optimal tolerated medical therapy. The level of&#xD;
      risk associated with optimal medical therapy is considered very low. For the majority of&#xD;
      patients with heart failure and depressed left ventricular systolic function this will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A renin angiotensin system blocker at highest tolerated doses (e.g., enalapril 10mg&#xD;
           twice daily or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (e.g., Spironolactone 25-50mg daily or&#xD;
           equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A Beta-blocker (e.g., Carvedilol 25mg twice daily or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The use of a loop diuretic and digitalis will be clinically driven and used at the&#xD;
           discretion of the attending clinician&#xD;
