  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the fluid changes in the body using a device called&#xD;
      the µ-Cor System, an investigational device. The µ-Cor System will record the fluid changes&#xD;
      in the body, as well as ECG (electrocardiogram or an electrical tracing of your heart rhythm)&#xD;
      heart rate, breathing rate, posture and activity at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information collected by the µ-Cor System will then be compared to the actual fluid&#xD;
      removed through dialysis and to the information collected by an FDA (Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) cleared device called ZOE (NonInvasive Medical Technologies), a monitor which&#xD;
      also measures the fluid changes in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to document any differences in measurement of thoracic&#xD;
      impedance obtained from the µ-Cor System and the ZOE system. Thoracic impedance is a measure&#xD;
      of the electrical activity in the chest that varies with changes in body size and&#xD;
      composition, fluid volume, breathing status and other variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of the amount of fluid removed during dialysis will also be compared between the&#xD;
      µ-Cor System, the ZOE system and the actual fluid removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of the µ-Cor System to measure thoracic impedance will be tested by placing the&#xD;
      device randomly at one of two locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Arm 1: side location- below left axilla&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Arm 2: front location - upper left pectoral area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the µ-Cor System and the ZOE System will be worn simultaneously during one dialysis&#xD;
      session. The ZOE system device is placed on the chest- 2 points: 1 at the base of your neck&#xD;
      and 1 in your mid chest.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The µ-Cor System is intended to record, store, transmit, and display the following&#xD;
      physiological data to medical professionals: thoracic impedance, ECG, heart rate, respiration&#xD;
      rate, activity and posture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The µ-Cor System is indicated for patients who are 21 years of age or older who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have fluid-management problems,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are taking diuretic medication,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are living with heart failure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are living with end-stage renal disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are recovering from a coronary artery disease-related event, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are suffering from recurrent dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This clinical trial is intended to provide evidence of substantial equivalence between&#xD;
           the µ-Cor System and the ZOE System in the ability to measure thoracic impedance, by&#xD;
           comparing the correlation between µ Cor measurement and ultrafiltration volume (UFV) as&#xD;
           compared with the correlation between ZOE measurement and UFV. The actual UFV changes&#xD;
           will be used to arbitrate any differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of the µ-Cor System to measure thoracic impedance will be demonstrated at 2&#xD;
           body locations: side location (below left axilla, Study Arm 1), and front location&#xD;
           (upper left pectoral area, Study Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty patients undergoing hemodialysis (n = 40) in 2 study arms with at least 50% enrollment&#xD;
      of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) in each arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Arm 1: 20 patients undergoing hemodialysis, with at least 10 of these patients&#xD;
           having CHF, will have the µ-Cor device placed on the side location&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Arm 2: 20 patients undergoing hemodialysis, with at least 10 of these patients&#xD;
           having CHF, will have the µ-Cor device placed on the front location&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will wear the µ-Cor device and will be connected to the ZOE monitor during one&#xD;
      hemodialysis session in the clinic. Patients will be randomly allocated to Study Arm 1 or&#xD;
      Study Arm 2, with randomization stratified by CHF status (CHF or non-CHF). During the&#xD;
      hemodialysis session, the patient will wear 1 µ-Cor device and will be connected&#xD;
      simultaneously to 1 ZOE monitor (via 2 ZOE electrodes) for comparative measurements and UFV&#xD;
      correlation, from at least 15 minutes before the start of dialysis to at least 15 minutes&#xD;
      after the end of the dialysis session. The µ-Cor will record measurements during the dialysis&#xD;
      session, including at least the 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the session. ZOE (Z0)&#xD;
      values will be measured every 6 minutes (± 1 minute) during the dialysis session. ZOE (Z0)&#xD;
      values also will be measured every 3 minutes (± 1 minute) before and after the session, for a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 measurements. The UFV during the course of hemodialysis will be measured by&#xD;
      automated readings provided by the dialysis machine every 6 minutes (± 1 minute). 10. Any IV&#xD;
      infusions administered, oral fluid or solid intake, and urine output during the course of&#xD;
      hemodialysis will be recorded. Weight, blood pressure, and heart rate will be recorded before&#xD;
      and after the dialysis session.The patient's involvement in the study ends after the&#xD;
      completion of all procedures planned for the hemodialysis session.&#xD;
