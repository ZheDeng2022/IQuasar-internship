  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will access whether breast cancer patients and oncologists can become more hopeful&#xD;
      after participating in a &quot;hope enhancement workshop.&quot; Several validated tools, Adult Hope&#xD;
      Scale (AHS), Herth Hope Index (HHI), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI)&quot; and other quality of&#xD;
      life parameter surveys, will be administered at specified intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed research is to study the impact of hope interventions on the coping&#xD;
      behavior of women with advanced breast cancer and physicians who provide care to patients&#xD;
      with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the investigator's contention, that improved hopefulness among cancer patients can be&#xD;
      manifest in improved Quality of Life (QOL). The challenge is to find specific interventions&#xD;
      that can optimize hopefulness and thereby direct individuals to adopt behavior styles that&#xD;
      contribute to a positive effect on QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate single-day interventions and hope applications will be developed for patients&#xD;
      and oncologists, respectively. What will be common for each workshop is that there will be an&#xD;
      experienced counselor designated as &quot;coordinator&quot; who will be in charge of implementing the&#xD;
      program and monitoring group dynamics. The interventions will be structured with the program&#xD;
      advancing from the identification of goals to the development of directions reasonable&#xD;
      pathways for achieving the delineated goals. In addition to goal-directed exercises, the&#xD;
      workshop will employ narrative techniques which utilize literary triggers as a springboard&#xD;
      for reflective writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smartphone-based application will prompt study participants on a daily basis to engage in&#xD;
      additional, short activities designed to augment hopefulness, assess progress in achieving&#xD;
      goals, and identifying challenges. In addition, the application will allow sustained&#xD;
      interaction of workshop participants through social media exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course materials will be sent to study participants one week prior to the conduct of the&#xD;
      workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment of hopefulness will be carried out via the aforementioned validated&#xD;
      scales on the day of the workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-assessment of hopefulness will occur at the end of the day and at the 3- month interval&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
