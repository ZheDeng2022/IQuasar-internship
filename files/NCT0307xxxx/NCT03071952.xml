      The primary objective of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of AAIR (Atrial-paced&#xD;
      Atrial-sensed Inhibitory Rate-Modulated) pacing treatment for heart failure (HF) patients&#xD;
      with chronotropic incompetence (CI) in terms of exercise tolerance and quality of life.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study will assess the changes in cardiac function associated with changes&#xD;
      of physical exercise intensity and heart rate in AAIR pacing mode compared with AAI pacing&#xD;
      mode.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CI is the inability of the heart to increase its rate in response to increased physical&#xD;
      activity or metabolic demand, leading to exercise intolerance and poor quality of life.&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that patients with CI have a high risk of cardiac morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Recent studies further demonstrate a high incidence of CI in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure, which is also confirmed by CI in Heart Failure Study Phase I. However, clinical&#xD;
      attention is often paid to heart failure symptoms instead CI-related symptom. Thus, patients&#xD;
      with heart failure are often not tested for CI, even though the CI incidence is high in these&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, such patients could gain significant improvements in exercise tolerance&#xD;
      and quality of life once they get diagnosed followed by effective therapy for CI and&#xD;
      long-term management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to establish clinical evidence that AAIR pacing is beneficial to treat&#xD;
      CI-caused symptoms in heart failure patients, which will improve the life quality of such&#xD;
      patients and further support the expansion of Brady therapy indications to the population of&#xD;
      HF with CI in existing markets and also potential markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CI is rarely seen and has different definition among various animal species. It is impossible&#xD;
      to use animals to get wanted data for AAIR pacing treatment to CI. Thus, a human clinical&#xD;
      study is necessary. Furthermore, exercise testings, such as 6 minutes hall walk (6MHW) and&#xD;
      treadmill, allow objective evaluation of exercise capacity and exertional symptoms, which&#xD;
      have been suggested as other investigations for HF in &quot;ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012&quot;. Therefore, exercise testings will be&#xD;
      applied upon physicians' need or judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, this study is to assess the effect of AAIR pacing treatment for HF patients with CI&#xD;
      in terms of exercise tolerance and quality of life. Specifically, the study will assess the&#xD;
      changes in cardiac function associated with changes of physical exercise intensity and heart&#xD;
      rate in AAIR pacing mode compared with AAI pacing mode. Secondly, the study will look at&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in terms of NYHA class, 6MHW, blood BNP, Echo measurements following&#xD;
      pacemaker therapy for 1 year. 6MHW and treadmill tests have been suggested as other&#xD;
      investigations for HF in &quot;ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic&#xD;
      heart failure 2012&quot; and will be performed upon physicians' need or judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 30 subjects that meet the indication for pacing therapy.&#xD;
      Consented subjects will receive pacing therapy and two follow-ups in the following one year.&#xD;
