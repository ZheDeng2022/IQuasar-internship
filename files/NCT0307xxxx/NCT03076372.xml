  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MM-310 is a liposomal formulation of a docetaxel prodrug that targets the EphA2 receptor on&#xD;
      cancer cells. Docetaxel is an approved chemotherapeutic drug.This study is a Phase 1&#xD;
      open-label study of MM-310 in patients with solid tumors. In the first part of the study,&#xD;
      MM-310 will be assessed as a monotherapy until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is established.&#xD;
      After an MTD of MM-310 as a monotherapy is established, an expansion cohort and MM-310 in&#xD;
      combination with other therapies will be assessed.&#xD;
