      There is no consensus of the therapeutic efficacy and safety between suburothelial injection&#xD;
      and trigonal injection of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) in treatment of interstitial&#xD;
      cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) It is unmet to clarify which injection method is&#xD;
      superior in clinical efficacy and patient safety. This study was designed in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind trial to test the therapeutic effects and adverse events between intravesical&#xD;
      BoNTA injection into suburothelium and trigone. The results of this study might provide&#xD;
      clinical evidence for a better therapeutic regimen of BoNT-A in the treatment of IC/PBS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a debilitating&#xD;
      chronic disease of unknown etiology characterized by urgency frequency and suprapubic pain at&#xD;
      full bladder. Current treatments are usually unsuccessful in completely eradicating bladder&#xD;
      pain and increasing bladder capacity. Intravesical resiniferatoxin once was considered to be&#xD;
      effective but this has not been shown in a large scale multiple center trial. Several oral&#xD;
      medication such as pentosanpolysulphate (PPS), amitryptynine, cyclosporin have been tried but&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy have been proven ineffective. Intravesical treatment with heparin,&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate, bacillus Calmette-Guerin, dimethylsulphoxide,&#xD;
      resiniferatoxin, or botulinum toxin A has been shown early effectiveness in some patients.&#xD;
      However, the placebo effect should be weighed and randomized, double-blind trials should be&#xD;
      undertaken to demonstrate the actual therapeutic effects of these therapeutic modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has been widely reported in its efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of neurogenic and idiopathic detrusor overactivity (DO) with satisfactory results,&#xD;
      there have only been few studies using BoNT-A in treatment of IC/PBS. In recent basic&#xD;
      researches, BoNT-A has been shown to inhibit not only the release of acetylcholine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine, but also that of nerve growth factor, adenosine triphosphate, substance P and&#xD;
      calcitonin gene-related peptide from the nerve fibers and urothelium. In clinical&#xD;
      experiments, BoNT-A has been shown to reduce DO, impaired bladder sensation, and decrease&#xD;
      visceral pain in chronic inflammatory diseases. These results suggest that BoNT-A treatment&#xD;
      can modulate sensory transmission as well as reduce detrusor contractility. Although BoNT-A&#xD;
      injection seems promising in treating symptoms of IC/PBS, long term results did not provide&#xD;
      successful outcome. The limited successful result is possibly due to inadequate distribution&#xD;
      of BoNT-A delivered to the bladder wall, inadequate dose of toxin, or lacking of some&#xD;
      promoting factors to enhance the therapeutic effect of BoNT-A. Repeated intravesical BoNT-A&#xD;
      injections was recently performed in refractory IC/PBS and the therapeutic effects seems&#xD;
      promising. About 70% of the patients with non-ulcer type IC/PBS may benefit from repeated&#xD;
      BoNT-A injections every 6 months. Immunohistochemistry study also confirmed the reduction of&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers and pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad expressions after&#xD;
      repeated BoNT-A injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the injection sites of BoNT-A for IC/BPS bladders, there is no consensus.&#xD;
      Suburothelial injection and Trigonal injection have all been used in treatment of IC/BPS and&#xD;
      the short-term and long-term results are equivalent. It is unmet to clarify which injection&#xD;
      method is superior in clinical efficacy and patient safety. This study was designed in a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind trial to test the therapeutic effects and adverse events between&#xD;
      intravesical BoNTA injection into suburothelium and trigone. The results of this study might&#xD;
      provide clinical evidence for a better therapeutic regimen of BoNT-A in the treatment of&#xD;
      IC/PBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients with IC/PBS who have failed previous treatments for at least 6 months&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. A diagnosis of IC/PBS has been established based on&#xD;
      characteristic symptoms and cystoscopic findings of glomerulations, petechia, or mucosal&#xD;
      fissures after hydrodistention. All patients have been treated with at least two types of&#xD;
      treatment modalities including non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, oral PPS, intravesical&#xD;
      instillation of heparin, hyaluronic acid, or tricyclic antidepressant for at least 6 months&#xD;
      but the symptoms remained unchanged or relapsed. They will be investigated thoroughly on&#xD;
      enrollment and will be excluded if not meeting the inclusion criteria of NIDDK. However, in&#xD;
      this study the patients with Hunner's ulcer will not be included because previous study has&#xD;
      shown that ulcer type IC/BPS does not respond to intravesical BoNT-A injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be requested to keep a 3-day voiding diary prior to treatment to record the&#xD;
      functional bladder capacity (FBC) and the number of urinary frequency and nocturnal. The IC&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed by the O'Leary-Sant symptom and problem indexes. The pain score&#xD;
      will be reported by patient self-assessment using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      system. Videourodynamic study and potassium chloride (KCl) sensitivity test will be routinely&#xD;
      performed and patients will be informed of the possible complications associated with BoNT-A&#xD;
      injection such as generalized muscle weakness, difficult urination, transient urinary&#xD;
      retention, or urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videourodynamic study will be performed by standard procedures using a 6 Fr dual channel&#xD;
      catheter and an 8 Fr rectal balloon catheter. Cystometric study will be performed with normal&#xD;
      saline at a filling rate of 20 ml/min. All descriptions and terminology in this report are in&#xD;
      accordance with the recommendations of the International Continence Society. After the&#xD;
      videourodynamic study, 40ml KCl solution of 0.4M will be infused slowly into the bladder and&#xD;
      the test will be regarded as positive when painful (of ≧2 VAS score) or urgency sensation&#xD;
      (urgency severity score increased by ≧1) is elicited compared to normal saline infusion&#xD;
      during urodynamic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed in Hualien Tzu chi General.The study should be approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) and ethics committee of the university and will be&#xD;
      registered in ClinicalTrial.gov. Each patient will be informed about the study rationale and&#xD;
      procedures, and written, informed consent will be obtained before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be admitted for the treatment. They will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive intravesical injection of 100U of BoNT-A (BOTOX, Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA) into the&#xD;
      trigone (the treatment group) or suburothelium (the comparative group) immediately followed&#xD;
      by cystoscopic hydrodistention under intravenous general anesthesia in the operation room.&#xD;
      Blood (10ml) and urine samples (30ml) will be collected before intravesical injection and&#xD;
      after bladder hydrodistention. Bladder wall biopsies will also be performed after&#xD;
      hydrodistention. The patients will be allocated to treatment or control group by the permuted&#xD;
      block randomization code which is centrally controlled by a clinical pharmacist who prepares&#xD;
      the solution for injection. The intravesical injection was performed by a urology attending&#xD;
      doctor without recording the injection mode in the medical chart. The principle investigator,&#xD;
      patients, and study nurse did not know the injection mode to the patients' bladder to keep&#xD;
      the study in a double-blind condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each vial of BoNT-A will be diluted with 10 ml of normal saline, resulting in 10U BoNT-A per&#xD;
      1.0 ml. Patients assigned for suburothelial BoNT-A injections received 20 injections in the&#xD;
      bladder body whereas those assigned trigonal injections will receive 10 sites injections at&#xD;
      the trigonal area (5 injections behind interureteric ridge and 5 inside the trigone). The&#xD;
      injection needle will be inserted about 1mm into the urothelium at the bladder wall, using a&#xD;
      23 gauge needle and rigid cystoscopic injection instrument (22 Fr, Richard Wolf, and&#xD;
      Knittlingen, Germany). Cystoscopic hydrodistention will be performed to an intravesical&#xD;
      pressure of 80 cm water for 15 minutes and the maximal bladder capacity (MBC) under&#xD;
      hydrodistention will be recorded. Bladder biopsies will be taken at the four sites about 2cm&#xD;
      lateral and posterior to the ureteral orifice after hydrodistention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the BoNT-A injections, a 14 Fr urethral Foley catheter will be indwelled for one night&#xD;
      and patients will be discharged on the next day. Oral antibiotics will be prescribed for 7&#xD;
      days. Patients will be followed up in the outpatient clinic 2 weeks and 4 weeks later. Then&#xD;
      the patients will be followed up at out-patient clinic at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the 3-day voiding diary and symptom inventory using the O'Leary-Sant symptom score,&#xD;
      as well as information on FBC, daily urinary frequency, nocturia, and pain VAS will be&#xD;
      recorded at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. The largest voided volume in the 3-day&#xD;
      voiding diary will be considered as a measure of FBC. At 8-week follow-up after the&#xD;
      intravesical injection patients will be questioned of the current bladder condition and a&#xD;
      urodynamics study with KCl test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urodynamic study will be performed at baseline and 12 weeks after intravesical treatment.&#xD;
      The urodynamic parameters include first sensation of bladder filling (FSF), urge sensation&#xD;
      (US), cystometric bladder capacity (CBC), detrusor pressure (Pdet), maximum flow rate (Qmax)&#xD;
      during voiding and postvoid residual (PVR). KCl test will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point of this study is the reduction of bladder pain at 8-week follow-up. If&#xD;
      patient has a reduction of VAS pain score of 2 or more, they will be considered as&#xD;
      successfully treated. The treatment outcome will also be assessed by the global response&#xD;
      assessment (GRA) to evaluate the overall perception of treatment result. The result will be&#xD;
      considered as excellent when patients report improvement in the GRA by &gt;2 or patients become&#xD;
      free of bladder pain (VAS=0). The outcome will be considered improved if there is improvement&#xD;
      in the GRA by =1. Patients with excellent and improved results will be considered as having&#xD;
      subjectively successful result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of voiding diary, urodynamic study, IC symptom score and pain VAS will be&#xD;
      compared between baseline and 8-week end-point. Long-term successful results will be assessed&#xD;
      by self-reported improved GRA and pain VAS at 6 months and further. Data will be compared&#xD;
      between treatment and placebo groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients still feel bladder pain and unsuccessful results at the end-point, repeated&#xD;
      BoNT-A injection will be given at 3 months in the same procedure. At the same time, bladder&#xD;
      biopsy, urine and blood samples will also be collected for further study. . If patient does&#xD;
      not want to receive repeat BoNT-A injection, intravesical hyaluronic acid instillations will&#xD;
      be proceeded.&#xD;
