  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor or inadequate bowel preparation is one of the most common reasons for a repeated or&#xD;
      failed colonoscopy. Preparation methods shown to be effective include the use of either&#xD;
      bowel-cleansing devices or oral laxatives. Despite the acceptable effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      both bowel-cleansing methods, very few studies have been performed to evaluate which method&#xD;
      is more effective. The main aim is to perform an observational study followed by propensity&#xD;
      score modeling to evaluate and compare the quality of bowel preparation with the use of&#xD;
      Aquanet bowel-cleansing devices versus the use of oral Sodium picosulfate solution. The study&#xD;
      will involve 314 patients requiring a colonoscopy, between 14 and 90 years of age and with&#xD;
      more than three bowel movements per week for the past one month. Outcomes of interest being&#xD;
      the quality of bowel preparation evaluated through the Boston Bowel Preparation (BBP) scale.&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesized that the bowel preparation with Aquanet bowel-cleansing device&#xD;
      for colonoscopy will provide a better outcome for the patient than with conventional methods.&#xD;

      The study will compare the quality of pre-endoscopic bowel preparation using a&#xD;
      bowel-cleansing device with oral Sodium picosulfate solution. The study will be described in&#xD;
      accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in&#xD;
      Epidemiology) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: The study will undergo full review by the local Institutional Review Board,&#xD;
      all potential participants being provided with informed consent. Study protocol will only be&#xD;
      initiated after consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings: Data will be collected from June 2014 to February 2015 at the Portuguese Charitable&#xD;
      Hospital, located in Sao Jose do Rio Preto/SP, Brazil. The Kaiser clinic, a private&#xD;
      institution, will pay for the Aquanet devices. The Aquanet devices were designed and tested&#xD;
      by Prime Pacific Health Innovations Corporation&#xD;
      (http://www.primepacifichealth.com/aquanet-family-of-colon-hydrotherapy-devices/), and&#xD;
      approved by the various regulatory authorities for market approval and licensing including&#xD;
      FDA , Health Canada, and the European Union&#xD;
      (&lt;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm?ID=K000031&gt;, last accessed&#xD;
      October 2016). The Aquanet devices have been on the market since 2001. The procedure lasts&#xD;
      for 40-60 min, using filtered, ultraviolet treated water. Water pressure is derived from&#xD;
      gravity or from a pump with an upper safe limit of two psi (per square inch) of pressure&#xD;
      inside the colon. The device cleanses the large bowel through a series of fill and empty&#xD;
      cycles by hydrating the colon, stimulating peristalsis and evacuating bowel contents. The&#xD;
      process keeps the body hydrated without losing electrolytes. No adverse events have been&#xD;
      reported for the Aquanet devices and there have also been no complaints received to its&#xD;
      safety. It may cause mild abdominal discomfort during water infusion in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Inclusion criteria will involve all patients requiring a colonoscopy, those&#xD;
      between 14 and 90 years of age, and with more than three bowel movements per week for the&#xD;
      past one month. Patients will be excluded with following conditions: Pregnancy (confirmed by&#xD;
      a pregnancy test), acute abdomen syndrome, prior colorectal surgery, hemorrhoids or&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures, known bowel diseases (colon cancer history, toxic megacolon, toxic&#xD;
      colitis, idiopathic pseudo obstruction, hypo-motility syndrome), other gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders (active ulcer, output obstruction, retention, gastroparesis, ileus), previous upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery (gastrectomy, gastric band, gastric bypass), uncontrolled angina&#xD;
      and/or myocardial infarction (MI) within the last three months, congestive heart failure&#xD;
      (CHF) or uncontrolled hypertension, renal impairment (serum, creatinine and potassium must be&#xD;
      within normal limits) or known hypersensitivity to active ingredients. A total of 314&#xD;
      patients will be part of this analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables: Major outcome of interest will be the quality of bowel preparation as&#xD;
      measured through the Boston Bowel Preparation (BBP) scale. Bowel preparation will be&#xD;
      evaluated in three segments: The right segment (cecum and ascending colons), transverse&#xD;
      segment (transverse colon including liver and splenic angles), and the left segment&#xD;
      (descending and sigmoid colons and rectum). Each segment will be evaluated on a scale from&#xD;
      0-3, and the final score for an individual was the sum of scores for all three segments.&#xD;
      Using this score, 0 was the minimum score corresponding to an unprepared colon and 9 was the&#xD;
      maximum score corresponding to an excellent preparation without any residual traces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicting variables: Main predictor will be the methods of bowel preparation. The bowel&#xD;
      preparation will be done using either Sodium picosulfate or the bowel-cleansing device. On&#xD;
      the eve of the examination, all participants on Sodium picosulfate will be given four tablets&#xD;
      of Dulcolax with tea or water in the morning, liquid diet (juice, tea or water) at lunch, two&#xD;
      capsules of 25mg Dramamine Capsgel in the afternoon, Sodium picosulfate dissolved in 150mL of&#xD;
      cold water thirty minutes after, followed by drinking at least five 250-ml cups of water or&#xD;
      other light liquids until midnight, with absolute fasting up to the time when the colonoscopy&#xD;
      will be performed. For bowel preparation with the bowel cleansing device, intestinal lavage&#xD;
      will be performed with the device, making use of water, pressure, and gravity to enhance&#xD;
      bowel cleansing. The water used in this procedure will be previously triple-filtered by&#xD;
      passage on carbon, micro-pellets and ultraviolet light. The preparation will be carried out&#xD;
      by a trained nurse. All endoscopic procedures will be performed by an endoscopist who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the method of preparation.&#xD;
