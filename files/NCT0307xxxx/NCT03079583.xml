      To assess the efficacy of the zinc biofortified rice on plasma zinc concentrations in infants&#xD;
      from a rural area of Bangladesh.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Around the world and estimated 30% of the population is at risk of Zinc&#xD;
      deficiency, mainly due to monotonous plant base diets and the poor bioavailability of this&#xD;
      sources. One staple food crop which is low in zinc content is rice. Therefore, zinc&#xD;
      deficiency is highly common in Asia. Zinc plays a major role in child growth and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral development. Furthermore, it is linked to infection control and normal immune&#xD;
      response. One way to add extra zinc to someone's diet is zinc bio fortification of staple&#xD;
      crops, which can be a cost saving sustainable approach to improve zinc nutrition. However,&#xD;
      data on long-term intake of biofortified crops with zinc is scarce and efficacy of newly&#xD;
      developed rice crops high in zinc are not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective is to assess the efficacy of a newly developed zinc biofortified&#xD;
      rice variety on plasma zinc concentrations in children in a rural area of Bangladesh when&#xD;
      compared to their controls in a 9 month randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double randomized control trial. Study population: Stunted children whom are&#xD;
      zinc deficient at start of the study intervention determined by plasma zinc levels &lt;9.9&#xD;
      µmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The difference in zinc status between the intervention and&#xD;
      control group expressed in blood plasma zinc levels. Plasma zinc will be measured 4 times&#xD;
      during the intervention period. Besides plasma zinc other zinc biomarkers will be tested for&#xD;
      their usefulness.&#xD;
