    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are cancers originating in the thymus gland. Platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy is standard treatment for them. But not uncommonly, the disease returns and&#xD;
      people need more treatment to keep the cancer from growing. The drug Avelumab could help the&#xD;
      immune system fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if avelumab is safe and well-tolerated, and is effective in treating relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with thymoma or thymic carcinoma that has returned or progressed&#xD;
      after platinum-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scan: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy: a needle removes a piece of tumor. Samples can be from a previous procedure,&#xD;
           although it is desirable to undergo a new biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have treatment in 2-week cycles. They will continue until the side effects&#xD;
      are not tolerable or their disease gets worse. Visits at the following time points are&#xD;
      required per protocol. Patients who respond to treatment or have durable stability after at&#xD;
      least 12 months of therapy may undergo a dose de-escalation regimen to continue on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 2 weeks: Participants will get avelumab by infusion in a vein (IV). They will get&#xD;
           diphenhydramine (benadryl) and acetaminophen (tylenol) by mouth or IV before receiving&#xD;
           avelumab to decrease the chances of developing a reaction to avelumab. They will have&#xD;
           blood, urine, and heart tests periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycles 4 and 7, then every 6 weeks: Scans will be performed to look for shrinkage or&#xD;
           growth of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 4: Participants will be offered a chance to undergo a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-4 weeks after stopping treatment: Blood, urine, and heart tests will be performed.&#xD;
           Participants might undergo a scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 weeks after stopping treatment: Blood, urine, and heart tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 6 months after stopping treatment, then every 3 months: Participants will have&#xD;
           scans andcan allow genetic testing on their blood and tissue samples.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymic&#xD;
      epithelial tumors (TETs). However more than half of these patients experience disease&#xD;
      recurrence and require second-line therapy. There are no approved drugs for treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent thymoma and thymic carcinoma and new therapeutic options are needed for patients&#xD;
      who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. The clinical activity&#xD;
      of checkpoint blockade targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has been&#xD;
      demonstrated against various tumor types. We have demonstrated the ability of avelumab to&#xD;
      induce major responses in patients with advanced thymoma in a phase I dose escalation study.&#xD;
      Further investigation of avelumab in patients with TETs is needed to define the clinical&#xD;
      activity and safety of immune checkpoint blockade in patients with TETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and tolerability of avelumab in participants with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the objective response rate (ORR) to avelumab in participants with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with histologically confirmed, unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma who have&#xD;
      previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen with&#xD;
      progressive disease prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is permitted if the reason for&#xD;
      discontinuation was not disease progression or life-threatening adverse events (laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities alone with prior therapy will not exclude participants from this trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function&#xD;
&#xD;
      No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      No prior thymic tumor-associated autoimmune disease with the exception of pure red cell&#xD;
      aplasia and vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-arm, pilot study to determine the clinical activity and safety of&#xD;
      treatment with avelumab in participants with relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously once every two weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression or development of intolerable adverse events. The two week period will&#xD;
      constitute one cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per the study team s discretion, participants who respond to treatment or have durable&#xD;
      stability after at least 12 months of therapy may undergo a dose de-escalation regimen to&#xD;
      continue on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed after completion of every third cycle (6 weeks) using RECIST&#xD;
      criteria, version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When possible, a tumor biopsy will be conducted pre-treatment and on C4D43 to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment-related, intra-tumoral changes.&#xD;

             to confirm postmenopausal status a FSH level will be included at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Avelumab is in the class of agents&#xD;
             known as antineoplastics/monoclonal antibodies with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in&#xD;
&#xD;
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Avelumab, breastfeeding should be&#xD;

             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the participants inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-oncology vaccine therapies for prevention of infection disease (e.g. seasonal flu&#xD;
             vaccine, human papilloma virus vaccine) within 4 weeks of study drug administration&#xD;

             also prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines (e.g. inactivated&#xD;
             influenza vaccines) and vaccinations against COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive TET participants are ineligible because of the risk of developing&#xD;
             opportunistic infections after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Prior&#xD;
             cases of disseminated herpes virus and fungal infections have been documented in this&#xD;
             patient population.&#xD;
