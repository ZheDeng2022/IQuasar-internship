  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will be exposed to ambient air near a roadway under the conditions of with&#xD;
      and without a facemask and their responses will be evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 50 healthy nonsmoking adults (20-65 years old) into a protocol&#xD;
      involving 2 separate 5 day long &quot;study blocks&quot;. Each block will consist of 5 separate 2&#xD;
      hour-long &quot;exposure periods&quot; conducted 5 days in a row (Monday - Friday; start: 8 am to end:&#xD;
      10 am) (Table 2: Study flow chart). Investigators will enroll 2 patients to undergo the trial&#xD;
      study blocks simultaneously (one subject starting block 1 in the active intervention by&#xD;
      wearing the facemask and the other wearing no facemask to begin block 1). Day 1 (Monday) of&#xD;
      each study block will occur in a non-polluted clean indoor setting (Research Exam Room, Suite&#xD;
      A 1310; Lobby A, Dominos Farms). All subsequent exposure periods (days 2-5, Tuesday through&#xD;
      Friday) of each study block will all take place at the same designated &quot;exposure site&quot;, an&#xD;
      Ann Arbor Transportation Association (AATA) parking lot area nearby several busy roadways in&#xD;
      Ann Arbor MI. To complete the entire study, each subject will perform 2 separate study&#xD;
      blocks. Minimal total study duration is 2 weeks (washout period = 2 days over weekend) to a&#xD;
      maximal period of 6 weeks (wash out period = 5 weeks). During one block, subjects will wear&#xD;
      an N-95 respirator facemask (active intervention) during all exposure periods (days 1-5, even&#xD;
      during day 1 indoor exposures). Subjects will remove the mask at the end of the study day&#xD;
      after all testing is completed. Active versus control intervention ordering will be performed&#xD;
      in a randomized single-blind cross-over order. During the other block subjects will wear no&#xD;
      facemask (control) during exposure periods. While subjects will necessarily be aware of the&#xD;
      intervention type, the study investigators responsible for evaluating the results will be&#xD;
      blinded to the intervention type during all data analyses (i.e., single blind trial).&#xD;
      Throughout all exposure periods, subjects will wear ambulatory BP monitors (ABPM) and ECG&#xD;
      Holter monitors to determine brachial BP/aortic hemodynamics measured every 10 minutes and&#xD;
      heart rate variability (HRV) metrics measured continuously and averaged into 10 minute epochs&#xD;
      corresponding to same time periods as the BP levels, respectively. Air pollution exposures&#xD;
      (PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particle (UFP) count), ambient temperature levels,&#xD;
      and noise intensity will be measured continuously at the near-roadway exposure site during&#xD;
      all exposure periods (Days 2-5). All environmental exposure metrics will also be averaged&#xD;
      into 10 minute epochs during the exposure periods corresponding to the health outcome times.&#xD;
      Following completion of exposure periods on day 4 (Thursday), subjects will have endothelial&#xD;
      function measured by endoPAT (RHI) immediately post-exposures at the near-roadway site, after&#xD;
      lying supine resting 5 minutes on a portable support. Patients will wear facemask throughout&#xD;
      RHI testing when in the active intervention block. On the final day 5 of each study block,&#xD;
      all subjects will have blood drawn. A sub-group (n=20) of subjects (enrolled on a first-come&#xD;
      basis) will have SNS activity measured by MSNA. After blood draws on each study visit day&#xD;
      subjects will remove the facemasks and can thereafter carry on with their routine daily&#xD;
      activities. However, subjects will be asked to not deviate from their usual lifestyle during&#xD;
      each study block. Subjects will be specifically directed to not significantly change their&#xD;
      lifestyle (e.g., diet, sleep patterns) and/or any routine activity (e.g., exercise regimen,&#xD;
      work, commutes, travel) throughout each study block.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Age 18-65 years old. People older than 65 years are excluded as the impact of PM2.5&#xD;
             on their BP is not known from our prior studies (which included younger individuals)&#xD;
             and they have age-related increases in BP and SNS activity which may alter their&#xD;
             associations with PM2.5 exposures and thus produce too heterogeneous a population to&#xD;
             evaluate the linkages between PM2.5 and health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Self-reported nonsmoker (100% abstinence for at least 1 year) living in non-smoking&#xD;
             households (no one living in the household that smokes indoors) and no known routine&#xD;
             exposures to air pollutants by known point sources at home, travel or occupationally&#xD;
             (e.g., fumes, dust, secondhand smoke). Smoking and other exposures may alter any&#xD;
             effect that ambient PM2.5 has on the health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Able to understand the informed consent, legally provide informed consent, and able&#xD;
             to participate for the entire duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Any facial hair (beard or mustache) that does not allow for proper fitting and air&#xD;
             tight seal of the N95 facemask during the study that would compromise the ability of&#xD;
             the mask to prevent exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Any prior cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart&#xD;
             failure (CHF), stroke, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), aneurysms, any&#xD;
             revascularization)*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Prior diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Prior diagnosis of chronic lung diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease&#xD;
             (COPD))*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Prior diagnosis of neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease, autonomic failure,&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy, seizure disorder) or other conditions at discretion of&#xD;
             investigators*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  6. Prior diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, any type of dialysis*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7. Active or history of any known cancer*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  8. History of HIV*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  9. Being treated for any infection with antibiotics within past month*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  10. Mental health issue(s) including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia,&#xD;
             or other conditions at discretion of investigators*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  11. Prior diagnosis of any other chronic or acute medical condition(s) at discretion&#xD;
             of investigators that may lead to alteration of baseline SNS activity, BP, or insulin&#xD;
             sensitivity and thereby potentially impact the association of PM2.5 with study&#xD;
             outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12. Medications for high BP or that alter BP. Any medications for cholesterol (e.g.,&#xD;
             statins). Any medications that alter blood glucose (e.g., diabetes medication)*.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  13. Any medications or over the counter pills that may alter the association between&#xD;
             ambient PM2.5 and the health outcomes of BP, SNS activity and insulin sensitivity by&#xD;
             discretion of investigators*. No over the counter pills taken on routine basis (&gt;2&#xD;
             times per week as standing dosage) including: anti-oxidants (vitamin C, E), NSAIDS,&#xD;
             fish oil supplements, folic acid supplements, multivitamins, or other over the counter&#xD;
             pills, herbs, or complimentary therapies under the discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
             These pills can be stopped for 3 months on an elective basis and then the individual&#xD;
             can enter the study. Other medications for chronic stable conditions that are not&#xD;
             listed in exclusion criteria and that are not likely to influence the study results&#xD;
             can be taken or continued as long as their doses have been stable for 3 months prior&#xD;
             to entering the study. Estrogen or birth control can be used (any type) as long as the&#xD;
             dosing has been stable for past 3 months. Medications or over the counter drugs used&#xD;
             on an as needed basis (such as Tylenol or aspirin) are fine as long as not routinely&#xD;
             taken &gt;2 times per week)* Planned major change in lifestyle including work, activity,&#xD;
             exercise, diet, weight during course of study*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  14. Screening visit BP ≥140/90 mm Hg (as measured by the automated office BP device-&#xD;
             BpTru)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  15. Screening visit arm circumference ≥17 inches (makes home BP monitoring inaccurate&#xD;
             as the cuff of the commercially-available devices will not fit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  16. Screening visit pregnancy (positive urine pregnancy test in women &lt;50 years of&#xD;
             age) and any plan to become pregnant during the study period&#xD;
