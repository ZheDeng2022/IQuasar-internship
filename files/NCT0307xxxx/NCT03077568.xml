      A randomized controlled trial is needed to strengthen the evidence in the area of web-based&#xD;
      self-management programs for stress-reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim for the study is to compare the effects of the web-application that supports&#xD;
      behavior change in stress-management to a waiting list group in persons with perceived&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This study will have the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines will be used for reporting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Different sectors in the region will be included. Three different high-schools in&#xD;
      Västerås City, social services authority in Västerås municipality, a large private company in&#xD;
      the region, three different clinics within the county council and the municipality of Köping&#xD;
      have signed the attestation of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention is the program for web-based stress self-management My Stress&#xD;
      Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: After informed consent the participants will, during approximately 2-4 months by&#xD;
      their own go through the web-based program for stress self-management. The waiting-list group&#xD;
      will also get access to My Stress Control after post-measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data-analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used for demographic data. Missing data will be&#xD;
      replaced as recommended for the different measurements included, commonly by using the mean&#xD;
      for responded items within the sub scale. Inferential analyses will be conducted by using&#xD;
      multivariate statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out analysis will be conducted by comparing pre-interventions measures for those who&#xD;
      completed the program with those who did not.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial is needed to strengthen the evidence in the area of web-based&#xD;
      self-management programs for stress-reduction. The program to be evaluated is named My Stress&#xD;
      Control, and is designed to educate the users in how stress can affect their health, provide&#xD;
      tools to handle stress and also educate the users in a problem-solving method to prevent and&#xD;
      manage stress-related problems in the future. My Stress Control is a self-administered and&#xD;
      fully automated web-application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim for the study is to compare the effect of the web-application that supports&#xD;
      behavior change in stress-management to a waiting list group in persons with perceived&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This study will have the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines will be used for reporting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: Different sectors in the region will be included. Three different high-schools in&#xD;
      Västerås City, social services authority in Västerås municipality, a large private company in&#xD;
      the region, three different clinics within the county council and the municipality of Köping&#xD;
      have signed the attestation of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power: Power has been calculated by using a study comparing acceptance and commitment therapy&#xD;
      with a wait-list group with the primary outcome stress, measured with PSS-14 (Cohen, Kamark,&#xD;
      &amp; Mermelstein, 1983). More specifically the power was calculated by using the scores of a&#xD;
      group who reported lower stress-levels than 25 on PSS-14 (Brinkborg, Michaneck, Hessel, &amp;&#xD;
      Berglund, 2011). The calculation has been adjusted for both between-group comparison as well&#xD;
      as for within-group comparison. An estimated effect size of .40 with power equal to .80 and a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05, gives an estimated population size of 98 individuals in each&#xD;
      group. With an estimated dropout rate of 20% the population needed in each group is 118&#xD;
      persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Since the included worksites are different to its kind, and to number of&#xD;
      employees, randomization will be done by quotation with a 6-person block randomization. The&#xD;
      block randomization will make the sample percentage similar to the included worksites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention is the program for web-based stress self-management My Stress&#xD;
      Control. My Stress Control starts with screening for stress levels according to Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen et al., 1983), with a cut of score of 17 (Brinkborg et al., 2011)&#xD;
      for accessing the program. To avoid to include users with more extended problems with anxiety&#xD;
      and depression, a screening is done with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)&#xD;
      (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983). Users scoring 11 or higher on either of the two subscales are&#xD;
      recommended to seek support from traditional healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The security of the web-application is high and all information is encrypted. IP addresses&#xD;
      who tries to log in without access are banned after a certain number of trials. The more&#xD;
      secure https is used instead of the less secure http. All requests towards the server will be&#xD;
      logged and all stored data have backup being done continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the theoretical framework of the self-management program there are several useful&#xD;
      health psychological theories. Regarding behavior change in stress context three theories&#xD;
      arise as more important; The Transactional Theory of Stress and Coping (TTC) (Lazarus &amp;&#xD;
      Folkman, 1984), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1989), The Transtheoretical Model&#xD;
      (TTM) and the Theory of Stages of Change (SoC) (Evers et al., 2006), and the Theory of&#xD;
      Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior(Madden, Ellen, &amp; Ajzen, 1992). The&#xD;
      theories play a crucial role in tailoring and assessing stress. Studies show that web-based&#xD;
      programs using these theories are more successful than other web-based programs for behavior&#xD;
      change (Webb, Joseph, Yardley, &amp; Michie, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is sensitive to how the user formulates a guided functional behavior analysis&#xD;
      that also tailors the program by recommending possible preferable stress-management&#xD;
      techniques for each user. These stress-management techniques are specific behavior change&#xD;
      techniques to support the user in situations where they experience stress or to prevent and&#xD;
      handle consequences of stress. The user has the opportunity to take part of all&#xD;
      stress-management techniques included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stress-management techniques included are: assertiveness training (Imamura et al., 2014),&#xD;
      cognitive restructuring (Welbourne, Eggerth, Hartley, Andrew, &amp; Sanches, 2007), pleasant&#xD;
      activity scheduling (Mazzucchelli, Kane, &amp; Rees, 2010), relaxation (Ponce et al., 2008),&#xD;
      time-management (Häfner &amp; Stock, 2010), stimulus control and sleep restriction to improve&#xD;
      sleep (Thiart, Lehr, Ebert, Berking, &amp; Riper, 2015) and physical activity (Lindegård,&#xD;
      Jonsdottir, Börjesson, Lindwall, &amp; Gerber, 2015). All techniques have shown to be effective&#xD;
      in stress-management both in traditional face-to-face therapy and delivered in applications&#xD;
      or on the web. Few programs have combined several techniques, and most programs use only one&#xD;
      technique. No program combining all techniques included in My Stress Control has been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used behavior modification techniques found in a meta-analysis of changing&#xD;
      health behaviors via the Internet were to provide information about the consequences of the&#xD;
      behavior, self-monitoring of behavior and identification of barriers and facilitators for&#xD;
      behavior(Evers, Prochaska, Driskell, Cummins, &amp; Velicer, 2003). In another study it is also&#xD;
      stated that treatment that includes self-monitoring of the behavior and at least one of the&#xD;
      following five behavioral change methods has been shown more effective than behavior&#xD;
      modification treatment without these techniques; encourage intention formulation, specific&#xD;
      goal-setting, feedback on performance and reevaluation of goals (Michie, Abraham,&#xD;
      Whittington, McAteer, &amp; Gupta, 2009). These techniques are central in the stress-management&#xD;
      program. These behavior modification techniques are more general techniques for behavior&#xD;
      change than the specific behavior change techniques for stress-management, and are used in&#xD;
      several parts of My Stress Control. They are for example used to support the user to handle&#xD;
      the specific techniques for stress management mentioned above. For example: Goal setting and&#xD;
      self-monitoring is used as assignments in all the stress-management techniques in My Stress&#xD;
      Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, by using the web-based, self-management program My Stress Control, the individuals are&#xD;
      supposed to receive support to develop skills to better cope with their work related stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: After informed consent the participants will, during approximately 2-4 months by&#xD;
      their own go through the web-based program for stress self-management. The waiting-list group&#xD;
      will also get access to My Stress Control after post-measurements. Reminders to send in the&#xD;
      questionnaires will be sent out two weeks for the questionnaires answered before the&#xD;
      intervention and two and four weeks after estimated time for the questionnaires answered&#xD;
      during and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data-analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used for demographic data. Missing data will be&#xD;
      replaced as recommended for the different measurements included, commonly by using the mean&#xD;
      for responded items within the sub scale. Inferential analyses will be conducted by using&#xD;
      multivariate statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-out analysis will be conducted by comparing pre-interventions measures for those who&#xD;
      completed the program with those who did not.&#xD;
