  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part safety study of Vigil, Atezolizumab and their combination in patients who&#xD;
      have tumor harvested at surgery and successful manufacturing of Vigil but are ineligible for&#xD;
      CL-PTL-119 (the VITAL study) or previously randomized to placebo, and also in patients who&#xD;
      have recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover study of Vigil, the checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor Atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents, in patients with epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, or other gynecological cancers (i.e., cervical, uterine). Eligible patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles of Atezolizumab alone,&#xD;
      followed by combination treatment with the two agents. Patients may continue on single agent&#xD;
      Atezolizumab until disease progression, only if pre-approved by Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended as a companion study to protocol CL-PTL-119, A Randomized, Double&#xD;
      Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 2 trial of Vigil Engineered Autologous Tumor Cell&#xD;
      Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response&#xD;
      following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy, otherwise known as the VITAL study. Patients who&#xD;
      have tumor harvested at surgery and Vigil successfully manufactured, but then are ineligible&#xD;
      for randomization onto the VITAL study or previously randomized to placebo, and also in&#xD;
      patients who have recurrent ovarian cancer will be offered the opportunity to participate in&#xD;
      this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled will either be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with recurrent ovarian disease. Furthermore, subjects who have previously&#xD;
           received Vigil on this study may be considered for re-procurement for manufacture of&#xD;
           Vigil (after consultation and approval from Sponsor) and re-enrolled into Part 2, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with ovarian cancer who failed to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol&#xD;
           CL-PTL-119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical response following primary&#xD;
           debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who failed to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol CL-PTL-119 because of&#xD;
           a histologic diagnosis of another gynecological cancer (i.e., cervical, uterine) and not&#xD;
           ovarian cancer, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who were randomized on Protocol CL-PTL 119 and were subsequently unblinded at&#xD;
           recurrence and were assigned to the placebo arm.&#xD;
