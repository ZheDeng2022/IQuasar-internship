  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first part of a larger project aiming at improving the following outcomes in&#xD;
      older cancer patients receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT): quality of life,&#xD;
      functioning and need for professional help (dependency). To achieve this, the investigators&#xD;
      will develop and test a geriatric assessment (GA) with management (GAM) intervention&#xD;
      targeting patients at risk of negative outcomes as defined. The problems and needs that older&#xD;
      patients experience before, during and after EBRT are poorly described. Furthermore, although&#xD;
      GA is the recommended approach to assess older cancer patients' vulnerability, very few&#xD;
      studies have investigated its benefit and feasibility in a radiotherapy setting and there is&#xD;
      no universal recipe for how an efficient GAM intervention should be applied in this setting.&#xD;
      Before defining and testing an intervention, the investigators will therefore conduct an&#xD;
      observational study addressing older patients &gt;= 65 years referred for either palliative or&#xD;
      curative EBRT. The main objectives are to identify patients at risk for negative outcomes,&#xD;
      and to test the feasibility of GA in the community service and at a radiotherapy department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GA includes a systematic assessment of area where older people often have problems, i.e.&#xD;
      assessment of comorbidity, medication, functional status and physical functioning, cognitive&#xD;
      function, nutritional status, and depression. In this observational study, the assessment&#xD;
      will be performed using well-established instruments and tests before start and after&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy. The patient will be followed-up by repeated assessments at week&#xD;
      2, 8 and 16 post treatment. Quality of life (QoL) questionnaires will be filled in by&#xD;
      self-report at the same points in time. Follow-up data will also include information on the&#xD;
      patients' use of health services (home-, nursing home and hospital care). Additionally&#xD;
      available diagnostic CT scans will also be used for analyses of nutritional status and body&#xD;
      composition. Eligible patients will be included at the Radiotherapy Unit, Innlandet Hospital&#xD;
      Trust after having given written informed consent. A project nurse (cancer nurse) will&#xD;
      perform the assessments at the Radiotherapy Unit, whereas follow-up assessments will be&#xD;
      performed by community cancer nurses. All municipalities in the hospital catchment area are&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. The study will be conducted in co-operation with several&#xD;
      national and international partners, including partners from the local municipalities&#xD;
