      This phase I/II studies the side effects of avelumab and trabectedin and how well they work&#xD;
      in treating patients with leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as trabectedin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      avelumab and trabectedin may work better in treating patients with liposarcoma or&#xD;
      leiomyosarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of trabectedin and avelumab in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the objective response rate of advanced L-type sarcoma patients receiving the&#xD;
      combination regimen of avelumab and trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further explore the clinical activity and safety profile of avelumab and trabectedin as&#xD;
      a combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab will be administered every 2 weeks. Trabectedin will be administered every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for the first two doses (Week 1 and Week 4), and then every four weeks (Week 7, Week 11,…)&#xD;
      moving forward. After Cycle 2 of trabectedin, dosing may extend to every 5 weeks at&#xD;
      investigator discretion, for management of trabectedin-associated toxicity only. Delays of&#xD;
      trabectedin beyond 5 weeks may be allowed but require written approval from the&#xD;
      Sponsor-Investigator. On days where both drugs are scheduled to be administered, avelumab&#xD;
      will be administered first. This will continue until unacceptable toxicity or confirmed&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every&#xD;
      12 weeks for 2 years.&#xD;
