    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 2-arm clinical trial in healthy infants in Bangladesh. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine&#xD;
      when delivered at 6 months. In addition, the study will establish the equality of MR vaccine&#xD;
      seroconversion administered at 9 months following administration of an earlier MR vaccine&#xD;
      dose at 6 months of age compared to MR vaccine dose administered at 9 months without previous&#xD;
      MR vaccination. This study will also provide additional data on safety and tolerance of MR&#xD;
      vaccine given at 6 months, and impact of maternal antibodies on immunogenicity of MR vaccine&#xD;
      at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To assess immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 6 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To assess immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 9 months of age among children without&#xD;
                prior measles and rubella vaccination, compared with MR vaccine immunogenicity&#xD;
                among those who had a prior MR vaccination at 6 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To assess the frequency of adverse reactions following administration of MR vaccine&#xD;
                at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare the immunogenicity of the MR vaccine first dose administered at 6 months&#xD;
                vs at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To assess the proportion of mothers with undetectable, detectable and protective&#xD;
                levels of measles and rubella antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To determine the extent of variation in measles antibodies in women of child&#xD;
                bearing age in a population with a long standing measles vaccination program&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. To determine the extent of variation in rubella antibodies in women of child&#xD;
                bearing age in a population where rubella vaccine have been recently introduced&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. To determine if variation in antibody levels in infants at 6 months is&#xD;
                predominately explained by variation in starting antibody levels in the mother in&#xD;
                this population&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. To estimate the half-life of decay of measles and rubella antibodies in infants&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In countries with low levels of circulating measles virus, and lower risk for measles&#xD;
      infection, measles containing vaccine first dose (MCV1) is recommended at 12 months of age.&#xD;
      In countries with high risk for measles, MCV1 is recommended at 9 months. In the past decade,&#xD;
      many countries have been experiencing measles outbreaks with a high proportion of cases among&#xD;
      infants &lt; 9 months of age, below the recommended age of routine MCV1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent publications suggest that this may be due to the fact that the majority of infants now&#xD;
      are born to mothers with vaccine induced immunity to measles, and who lose maternal&#xD;
      antibodies much earlier, by age of 4-6 months. For example, in a measles outbreak in Malawi&#xD;
      in 2010, 14% (17,858) of the estimated 134,000 cases occurred in children 0-8 months. In&#xD;
      2013, in a measles outbreak in Sri Lanka approximately 34% of measles cases were in children&#xD;
      6-12 months of age. Furthermore, in 2013 Jordan experienced a large measles outbreak with&#xD;
      high proportion of young infants affected (6-9 months). WHO measles outbreak response&#xD;
      guidelines recommend vaccinating children as young as 6 months during outbreaks. As an&#xD;
      example, in response to a measles outbreak, Sri Lanka and Jordan conducted outbreak response&#xD;
      immunization (ORI) that included infants 6 months of age despite the limited evidence on&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MR vaccine at that age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some researchers suggest that routine MCV should be given before age of 9 months based on&#xD;
      published data showing that infants born to mothers with vaccine induced measles immunity are&#xD;
      born with lower concentration of maternal measles antibodies (MMA) and lose protection&#xD;
      against measles infection at an earlier age. Measles vaccine immunogenicity depends on&#xD;
      several factors, including presence of maternal measles antibodies (i.e., passively acquired&#xD;
      measles antibodies may neutralize vaccine virus before a complete immune response develops&#xD;
      resulting in primary vaccine failure.), maturity of immune system of the vaccine recipient,&#xD;
      and strain of the measles vaccine used. So any decisions to alter the age of MCV1 dose should&#xD;
      balance the potential risk of primary vaccine failure against the risk of measles infection&#xD;
      and measles related complications, including death. Immunogenicity of measles vaccine given&#xD;
      at 6 months is well studied; however, data on immunogenicity of combined MR vaccine&#xD;
      administered at 6 months and its impact on MR vaccine effectiveness given at 9 months, is&#xD;
      limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the number of infants born to mothers with vaccine induced immunity has been steadily&#xD;
      increasing and most countries will be using MR vaccine routinely in the Expanded Program of&#xD;
      Immunization (EPI), it is timely to conduct a study to assess immunogenicity of MR vaccine&#xD;
      given at 6 months and its impact on a subsequent 9 month MR dose. The first dose of MCV given&#xD;
      at 6 months is frequently referred to as MCV-0, indicating that two subsequent doses are&#xD;
      needed to attain population seroprotection levels necessary to stop endemic transmission of&#xD;
      the measles virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the accuracy of interpretation of study results blood samples of mothers of&#xD;
      enrolled infants will be tested for measles and rubella antibodies. This will also enable us&#xD;
      to determine the proportion of mothers with undetectable, detectable and protective levels of&#xD;
      antibodies, and to assess the relationship between the level of antibodies in mothers and&#xD;
      their infants' maternal antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in a single site in rural Bangladesh at Matlab. Matlab is a&#xD;
      major rural field site for icddr,b, where for the past 50 years continuous health and&#xD;
      demographic information was collected on &gt;200,000 population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2007 to 2010, icddr,b, the Ministry of Health (MOH) in collaboration with other&#xD;
      international organizations conducted several randomized vaccine effectiveness studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 2-arm clinical trial. 620 children will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized at 6 months of age to one of two study arms. The primary objectives&#xD;
      of this study are to assess the immunogenicity of MR vaccine at 6 months, and assess equality&#xD;
      of MR vaccine seroconversion administered at 9 months following administration of an earlier&#xD;
      MR vaccine dose at 6 months of age compared with MR vaccine dose administered at 9 months&#xD;
      only without previous MR vaccination. The study will enroll generally healthy 6 month old&#xD;
      infants living in Matlab and who have never received an MR vaccine dose and have no history&#xD;
      of measles or rubella. Participants will be followed to 11 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two arms. Infants in Study Arm A&#xD;
      will receive MR vaccine at 6 months of age (at enrolment) and at 9 months. Infants in Study&#xD;
      arm B will receive MR vaccine only at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens will be collected from all infants at 6, 9 and 11 months of age. The 6 month&#xD;
      sample is a pre-vaccination sample and mainly will be used to determine maternal antibody&#xD;
      levels. For arm A, the sample collected at 9 months before the second MR dose will be used to&#xD;
      assess antibody levels after the first MR dose at 6 months of age. For study Arm B, the 9&#xD;
      month sample will be used to assess measles and rubella antibody decay rate. The sample&#xD;
      collected at 11 months will be used to assess immune response to either a two dose or a one&#xD;
      dose schedule (arms A and B, respectively).&#xD;
