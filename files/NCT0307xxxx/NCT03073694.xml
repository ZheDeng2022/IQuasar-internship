      The purpose of this trial is to compare the morbidity and mortality of CRS-HIPEC using&#xD;
      mitomycin-C versus melphalan for colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis. Morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality will measured using the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) score, Common&#xD;
      terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE version 4.03), and the Clavien-Dindo&#xD;
      Classification.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dissemination of cancer (peritoneal carcinomatosis) from&#xD;
      gastrointestinal malignancies, meaning tumor deposits along the inside abdominal or pelvic&#xD;
      wall and surfaces of the intestines and organs, has historically been considered a terminal&#xD;
      disease. Although peritoneal surface tumors can respond to systemic therapy as a sole form of&#xD;
      treatment, patient survival remains poor and cure is considered impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A plasma-peritoneal barrier makes systemic therapy relatively ineffective against peritoneal&#xD;
      surface disease. In the 1990's, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal&#xD;
      therapy (CRS-HIPEC) began to be popularized as a more effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has several advantages. High-dose chemotherapy can&#xD;
      be used due to the plasma-peritoneal barrier resulting in little absorption into the blood&#xD;
      stream. Hyperthermia itself has cytotoxic effects and can increase the depth of tumor&#xD;
      penetration by the chemotherapeutic agent up to 3 mm and moreover can potentiate its&#xD;
      antineoplastic effects. Although CRS-HIPEC has been considered standard treatment for&#xD;
      ruptured appendiceal neoplasms and primary peritoneal mesothelioma, in the past decade its&#xD;
      indications have broadened to other peritoneal surface malignant processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, morbidity and mortality associated with CRS-HIPEC was considerably higher than&#xD;
      other complex operations, and thus its use was often discouraged. However, in recent times,&#xD;
      especially in high-volume centers, morbidity and mortality has drastically improved. Due to&#xD;
      recent improvements in mortality after major surgical interventions, including HIPEC, the&#xD;
      focus has shifted toward other endpoints besides efficacy, such as morbidity, quality of life&#xD;
      and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While HIPEC is universally felt to be a vital component after cytoreductive surgery, there is&#xD;
      a lack of consensus on the optimal regimen, especially the chemotherapeutic agent that should&#xD;
      be used. In the United States, the most commonly used agent during HIPEC is mitomycin-C,&#xD;
      however, it remains unknown if mitomycin-C is the optimal drug to use with regards to&#xD;
      toxicity and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized prospective studies are needed comparing the toxicity and effectiveness of HIPEC&#xD;
      with mitomycin-C to other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To compare morbidity and mortality after CRS-HIPEC utilizing mitomycin-C versus&#xD;
      melphalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: In this study, patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: Arm 1.)&#xD;
      Mitomycin-C initial dose of 15 mg/m2, 45 minutes into the perfusion a maintenance dose of 5&#xD;
      mg/m2 will be administered; or Arm 2): Melphalan 60 mg/m2 45 minutes into the perfusion.&#xD;
      Morbidity will be measured during immediate and short-term surgical recovery (up to 90 days&#xD;
      post-hospital discharge). Mortality will be measured beginning with the date of surgery and&#xD;
      ending with the date of participant death.&#xD;
