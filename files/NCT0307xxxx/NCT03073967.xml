      Randomized, open-label, multi-center, comparative trial to assess the efficacy and safety in&#xD;
      immunocompromised subjects with acyclovir resistant or acyclovir susceptible mucocutaneous&#xD;
      HSV infection, treated with pritelivir 100 mg once daily (following a loading dose of 400 mg&#xD;
      as first dose to rapidly reach steady-state plasma concentration) or foscarnet 40 mg/kg every&#xD;
      8 hours or 60 mg/kg every 12 hours.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial comprises 5 Parts, Part A, B, C, D and E. Part A and Part B (Phase 2) have been&#xD;
      closed in November 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, comparative design to assess the&#xD;
           efficacy and safety in subjects with ACV-resistant mucocutaneous HSV infection, treated&#xD;
           with oral pritelivir or intravenous foscarnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B is an open-label, multi-center design to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           pritelivir in subjects with ACV-resistant-mucocutaneous HSV and who either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. present with foscarnet-resistance/intolerance, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. developed foscarnet resistance/intolerance during treatment in Part A (no&#xD;
                improvement after at least 5 days of foscarnet therapy or intolerance to foscarnet&#xD;
                requiring cessation of foscarnet treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts C, D and E (Phase 3) are currently being set-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, comparative design to assess the&#xD;
           efficacy and safety of oral pritelivir in subjects with acyclovir resistent (ACV-R)&#xD;
           mucocutaneous HSV episodes. Subjects with ACV-R mucocutaneous HSV infection will be&#xD;
           randomized 1:1 to receive either oral pritelivir or iv foscarnet. The trial is designed&#xD;
           to show superiority of pritelivir against foscarnet in obtaining clinical cure, i.e.&#xD;
           number of subjects with all lesions healed within 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part D is an open-label, multi-center (performed in the same trial sites as Part C)&#xD;
           design to assess the efficacy and safety of pritelivir in subjects with ACV-R&#xD;
           mucocutaneous HSV episodes and who in addition either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. present with foscarnet resistance/intolerance already at Screening for inclusion,&#xD;
                or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. developed foscarnet resistance/intolerance during treatment in Part C (no&#xD;
                improvement after at least 7 days of foscarnet treatment or intolerance to&#xD;
                foscarnet requiring cessation of foscarnet treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part E is an open-label, multi-center (performed in the same trial sites as Part C)&#xD;
           design to assess the safety and efficacy of pritelivir in subjects with acyclovir&#xD;
           susceptible (ACV-S) mucocutaneous HSV episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pritelivir trial medication will be given orally as single daily doses of 100 mg (following a&#xD;
      loading dose of 400 mg as first dose) until all mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to&#xD;
      28 days, whichever is earlier. A prolongation up to a maximum of 42 days may be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foscarnet will be given as intermittent infusions at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or 60&#xD;
      mg/kg every 12 hours (to be adjusted in case of renal impairment) for a minimum of 1 hour&#xD;
      duration until all mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to 28 days, whichever is&#xD;
      earlier. A prolongation up to a maximum of 42 days may be possible.&#xD;
