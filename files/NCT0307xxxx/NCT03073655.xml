  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears are most common of shoulder pain and functional limitations. Kinesio tape&#xD;
      (KT) are frequently used in the conservative treatment of shoulder pathology. Even if some&#xD;
      studies showed that KT is effective on pain, we think that it is due to positive thoughts of&#xD;
      the patients about KT. The aim of the study to investigate the effectiveness KT application&#xD;
      with different verbal inputs on pain, function and range of motion (ROM) on patient with&#xD;
      rotator cuff tear. 97 patients (Group 1, n=32; Group 2, n=33, Group 3, n=32) were randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups according to verbal input given to patients about the effectiveness of KT;&#xD;
      Group 1 (it has been limited evidence of KT is effective), Group 2 (it has been not known&#xD;
      that KT is effective or not), Group 3 (it has been known that KT has excellent result). The&#xD;
      same standard KT was applied to 3 groups. The rest, night and pain in activity were assessed&#xD;
      by Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) before, after 30 min and 24 hours after KT application. ROM&#xD;
      assessed by goniometer and the function was evaluated by Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder&#xD;
      and Hand (DASH) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score (ASES) before and 24 hours&#xD;
      of KT application. Minimal clinically important difference and effective were calculated for&#xD;
      the assessments used in the study.&#xD;

    <description>Pain intensity was assessed using the VAS; each patient was asked the pain during the rest, activity, and at night (on a 0 -10 numerical pain rating scale with zero corresponding to no pain and 10 corresponding to terrible pain). The rest, night and pain in activity were assessed by VAS before, after 30 min and 24 hours after KT application</description>

    <measure>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) was evaluated before and 24 hours of KT application.</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire is a 30-item scale of disability symptoms used to assess a patient's health status. The scores obtained from all items are then used to calculate a score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) was evaluated before and 24 hours of KT application.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score was evaluated before and 24 hours of KT application.</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score) consists of 2 sections: a patient self-evaluation component and an assessment performed by a physician. The patient self-evaluation section has 11 items that can be used to generate a score. These items are divided into 2 areas: pain (1 item) and function (0 items). The function questions ask patients whether they can perform 10 daily life activities. Additionally, they are asked whether they can do their usual work and take part in normal sporting activity. Scores on the ASES range from 0 (absence of function) to 100 (normal function). The four-point Likert scale for the function questions ranges from 0 (unable to do) to 3 (not hard). American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery score was evaluated before and 24 hours of KT application.</description>
