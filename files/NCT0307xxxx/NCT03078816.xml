      Dystonia is a movement disorder seen in both children and adults that is characterized by&#xD;
      &quot;sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements,&#xD;
      postures, or both.&quot; Secondary dystonia is far more common in pediatric populations than&#xD;
      primary dystonia, and far more recalcitrant to standard pharmacologic and surgical treatments&#xD;
      including Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). There exists a large unmet need to develop new&#xD;
      therapeutics, treatment strategies, and outcome measures for pediatric secondary dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing to investigate the ventralis oralis posterior nucleus (Vop)&#xD;
      of the thalamus as a new target for DBS in secondary dystonia. Prior to the development of&#xD;
      DBS, the main surgical treatment of dystonia was thalamotomy. Although there were many&#xD;
      different targets in the thalamus, often done in staged procedures, the most common and&#xD;
      successful targeted nuclei was the Vop, which is traditionally thought to be the pallidal&#xD;
      receiving area. Previous lesioning of Vop produced improvements in dystonia but intolerable&#xD;
      side effects, especially when implanted bilaterally. However, given that secondary dystonia&#xD;
      patients were often reported to have superior results to primary dystonia it is reasonable to&#xD;
      believe that if the side effects can be modulated, that targeting of the Vop nucleus with DBS&#xD;
      could be a viable alternative to Globus Pallidus interna (GPi). Given that Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation is a treatment that is inherently adjustable, it is conceivable that settings on&#xD;
      the Deep Brain Stimulation could be adjusted to allow for clinical benefit with minimal side&#xD;
      effects. Indeed, there have been several scattered successful case reports attesting to this&#xD;
      possibility.&#xD;

      Dystonia is a movement disorder seen in both children and adults that is characterized by&#xD;
      &quot;sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements,&#xD;
      postures, or both.&quot; Secondary dystonia has evolved to refer to dystonia resulting from damage&#xD;
      to the nervous system or degenerative disease processes. While primary dystonia is generally&#xD;
      thought to arise from genetic causes, secondary dystonias have a variety of causes including&#xD;
      perinatal injuries (cerebral palsy), central nervous system infections, traumatic brain&#xD;
      injuries, and many different metabolic, neurodegenerative, and mitochondrial conditions.&#xD;
      Secondary dystonia is far more common in pediatric populations than primary dystonia, and far&#xD;
      more recalcitrant to standard pharmacologic and surgical treatments including Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation. Given that most treatments for dystonia are developed for primary dystonia and&#xD;
      then applied to secondary dystonia, it is not surprising that this effectiveness gap exists.&#xD;
      Thus, there exists a large unmet need to develop new therapeutics, treatment strategies, and&#xD;
      outcome measures for pediatric secondary dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one such therapeutic intervention that has potential to&#xD;
      improve secondary dystonia. DBS is a surgical treatment for several different movement&#xD;
      disorders that evolved from functional stereotactic neurosurgery techniques initially used to&#xD;
      lesion specific deep brain structures. While Essential Tremor and Idiopathic Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease have predictable and consistent response rates to DBS in carefully selected patients,&#xD;
      response rates of dystonia have been much more inconsistent. One predictor of success has&#xD;
      been the presence of DYT-1 mutation, the most common known genetic cause of primary dystonia.&#xD;
      Success rates in DYT-1 dystonia are consistently high with reductions in dystonia typically&#xD;
      greater than 80%. However, the results in secondary dystonia have been much more modest and&#xD;
      inconsistent. A recent meta-analysis found that on average, dystonia symptoms as measured by&#xD;
      common rating scales improve 23% following DBS for dystonic cerebral palsy (the most common&#xD;
      cause of secondary dystonia), however there are frequent cases of non-responders.&#xD;
      Additionally, there have been very few examination, radiological or laboratory predictors of&#xD;
      good response to DBS, except for genetic confirmation of DYT-119. However, across both&#xD;
      primary and secondary dystonia, younger age at the time of surgery (less than 21 years old)&#xD;
      and shorter duration of symptoms (less than 15 years) have been shown to be the most likely&#xD;
      predictive factors for a good postoperative outcome. This has led many to suggest that DBS&#xD;
      should be offered earlier in the course of intractable dystonia, prior to the development of&#xD;
      permanent complications such as orthopedic contractures. Thus, we are setting an upper age&#xD;
      limit of 25 to account for the concern that earlier implantation leads to improved outcomes.&#xD;
      The lower age limit of 7 reflects the fact that the current humanitarian exemption for DBS&#xD;
      for dystonia currently goes down to age 7. Thus, there exists a need to both improve patient&#xD;
      selection as well as application of DBS for secondary dystonia in children.&#xD;
