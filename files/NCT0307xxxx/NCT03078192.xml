    <textblock>
      This study seeks to deploy several forms of 129Xe MRI contrast as well as emerging&#xD;
      conventional proton MRI technqiues for imaging lung structure and perfusion. Specifically,&#xD;
      the 129Xe MRI scans will provide 3D images of ventilation and gas exchange, and spectroscopic&#xD;
      indices will be evaluated to test gas exchange dynamics with high temporal resolution. The&#xD;
      conventional 1H MRI scans will include a free-breathing ultra-short echo time (UTE) scan that&#xD;
      provides images similar to that of a CT scan. In addition, to characterize perfusion and&#xD;
      vascular dimensions directly, patients will undergo a gadolinium-enhanced perfusion scan.&#xD;

      This study seeks to deploy several forms of 129Xe MRI contrast as well as emerging&#xD;
      conventional proton MRI technqiues for imaging lung structure and perfusion. Specifically,&#xD;
      the 129Xe MRI scans will provide 3D images of ventilation and gas exchange, and spectroscopic&#xD;
      indices will be evaluated to test gas exchange dynamics with high temporal resolution. The&#xD;
      conventional 1H MRI scans will include a free-breathing ultra-short echo time (UTE) scan that&#xD;
      provides images similar to that of a CT scan. In addition, to characterize perfusion and&#xD;
      vascular dimensions directly, patients will undergo a gadolinium-enhanced perfusion scan. The&#xD;
      overall aims of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Perform 129Xe MRI scans in cohorts of patients with PVD, isolated left sided heart&#xD;
      failure and isolated lung disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Deploy and optimize 129Xe gas exchange MR spectroscopy and imaging, 129Xe ventilation&#xD;
      MRI, structural 1H UTE MRI, and breath-hold 1H perfusion MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Conduct comprehensive 1H-129Xe MRI in 10 patients with pure pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) 1.3 Conduct comprehensive MRI in 10 patients with pure left heart failure&#xD;
      1.4 Conduct comprehensive MRI in 10 patients with pure lung disease but no pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension 1.5 Conduct comprehensive MRI in 5 patients with Chronic thromboembolic&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) pre and post PTE surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Develop diagnostic criteria for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of 129Xe&#xD;
      MRI for the diagnosis of PVD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Develop quantification/scoring methods based on PAH, left heart disease, and lung disease&#xD;
      MRI 2.2 Develop reader training materials and train 3 expert readers 2.3 Begin prospective&#xD;
      recruitment of 92 patients being evaluated for PAH for MRI scans. These patients may be asked&#xD;
      to return for a second scan in the study, at a time no earlier than 48hr after their last&#xD;
      xenon dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Perform a larger, single-blind study testing the diagnostic accuracy of 129Xe MRI for&#xD;
      diagnosis of PVD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Trained readers will evaluate 129Xe MRI, while blinded to the subject's disease state and&#xD;
      will determine the presence and severity of PVD 3.2 Diagnostic accuracy of 129Xe MRI will be&#xD;
      compared to the gold standard of hemodynamic and clinical criteria of PAH&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For this PFTs are not necessary, so they are ancillary&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. However, they are a standard way to characterize patients for publications, etc, so we&#xD;
           would like to get them if we can. Getting them from the medical record is perfectly&#xD;
           adequate for this pur-pose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. If PFTs are not available from the medical record, they are not so critical as to pre-vent&#xD;
      us from enrolling the subject. In publications we will simply acknowledge the realities of&#xD;
      COVID for this missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an single-blinded, open-label study enrolling volunteers and patients with pure&#xD;
      PAH (10 subjects), pure left heart disease (10 subjects) and pure lung disease (10 subjects)&#xD;
      [Aim 1] followed by a larger cohort of 92 subjects being evaluated for PAH [Aim 2]. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to consent to 127 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on testing whether the proposed diagnostic test based on&#xD;
      Xe MRI has accuracy comparable to imaging diagnostic procedures in clinical practice, such as&#xD;
      mammography. To this end, the investigator proposes to test the hypotheses H0: AUC = 0.72 vs.&#xD;
      H1: AUC &gt; 0.85, where area under the curve (AUC) is a summary measure of diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      obtained as the the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which&#xD;
      displays the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity for our proposed Xe MRI based&#xD;
      diagnostic test. Here AUC = 0.72 represents a moderately accurate test while AUC = 0.85&#xD;
      represents accuracy comparable to clinical mammography. Based on a one sided, one sample test&#xD;
      with variances approximated using the binormal model, the investigator estimates a minimum&#xD;
      sample size of 46 normals and 46 with disease will be required to test the above hypotheses&#xD;
      at a significance level of 5% with 80% power.&#xD;
