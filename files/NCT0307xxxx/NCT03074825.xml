  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chiauranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking Aurora kinase B（Aurora&#xD;
      B）、VEGFR/PDGFR/c-Kit、CSF-1R targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in the meantime, exploring the&#xD;
      latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
