  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of relationship education (RE) for&#xD;
      individuals and couples participating in Project Harmony.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although considerable research supports the positive effects of relationship education (RE)&#xD;
      on relationship satisfaction and communication skills, the majority of existing research&#xD;
      designs have favored pre/post or quasi-experimental designs. Furthermore, gaps in the&#xD;
      empirical bases for RE remain regarding programmatic moderators that influence change.&#xD;
      Consequently, there has been less emphasis on understanding which program elements contribute&#xD;
      to positive change within couple relationships. To this end, Project Harmony seeks to conduct&#xD;
      an impact local evaluation design utilizing a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of relationship education between low income, ethnically diverse individuals&#xD;
      and couples in the treatment group compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary&#xD;
      research questions are focused on investigating mechanisms and moderators of change for the&#xD;
      target population. Participants (individuals and couples) in Project Harmony will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the treatment or wait-list control group.&#xD;
