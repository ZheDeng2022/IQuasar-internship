  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral feeding tubes in newborns are used for feeding preterm and low birth weight babies in&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care units as they often do not suck effectively owing to lack of&#xD;
      coordination between sucking, swallowing and breathing due to neurological immaturity and&#xD;
      delayed gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feeding tubes could be inserted by the nasogastric (NG) route or by the orogastric (OG)&#xD;
      route. Both routes are used in different Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Both methods&#xD;
      are associated with different adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since newborn infants are obligate nose breathers, nasogastric tube (NGT) can lead to partial&#xD;
      nasal obstruction which might increase airway resistance and work of breathing although they&#xD;
      are easy to secure to the face than orally placed tubes. Orogastric tubes (OGT), on the other&#xD;
      hand, may not lead to the potential risk of increased work of breathing associated with NGT&#xD;
      but are more frequently malpositioned and can loop inside the mouth. Also there is increased&#xD;
      possibility of apnea and bradycardia due to vagal stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite so many years of continuing debate, the evidence of superiority of one method over&#xD;
      another is not proven. Very few studies have tried to look into this matter and there are no&#xD;
      consensus guidelines. This study is being conducted to compare the rate and type of adverse&#xD;
      events in OG versus NG feeds in preterm neonates ≤ 32 weeks and postmenstrual age (PMA) ≤ 36&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm neonates born at ≤ 32 weeks with PMA≤ 36 weeks who require feeding tube as a route&#xD;
      for enteral feeding once they are out of respiratory support ( i.e ventilation or CPAP) are&#xD;
      eligible candidates. Feeding tube insertion episode (FTIE) is defined as episode of insertion&#xD;
      of OG or NG tube. FTIE will be randomized into NG or OG routes. Primary outcome is frequency&#xD;
      of desaturation and bradycardia in each group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After written informed consent by either of the parent, preterm neonate (≤32 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age and PMA ≤36weeks) fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study if they require tube feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each episode of insertion of either NGT or OGT will be labelled as Feeding tube insertion&#xD;
      episode (FTIE) in the study. Total of 160 FTIE will be done in study period, 80 FTIEs in&#xD;
      preterm neonates of &lt;30 weeks gestational age and 80 FTIE in preterm neonates of ≥30 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of FTIE (whether NG or OG) will be randomized into 2 groups by computer generated&#xD;
      random sequence in blocks of 4 each. Stratification will be done as per Gestational age&lt; 30&#xD;
      weeks and ≥ 30 weeks. Randomization sequence will be stored in sealed opaque envelope which&#xD;
      was kept with one person who will not involved in care of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tube insertion will be done by NICU nursing staff who are already trained and validated in&#xD;
      putting tube. Length of NGT/OGT insertion will be calculated by distance from bridge of nose&#xD;
      to ear lobe and then from ear lobe to midway between xiphisternum and umbilicus (NEMU&#xD;
      method). Correct tube placement will be checked by first aspirating and then pushing in 2 ml&#xD;
      air and listening by stethoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each FTIE will be followed till the tube required to be changed for any reason, or tube&#xD;
      feeding terminated due to graduation to direct feeds by paladay or breast. If the tube is&#xD;
      changed for any reason, the reinsertion of the tube will be taken as a fresh FTIE, and again&#xD;
      followed as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To record adverse events, heart rate and oxygen saturations will be recorded in the monitor&#xD;
      till the time tube remained in situ. Bradycardia is defined as Heart rate &lt; 100/min.&#xD;
      Desaturation is defined as SpO2 &lt; 85%. Alarms on the multifunction monitors (Philips MP 20&#xD;
      Neonatal) will be set with lower limit of Heart rate as 100/min and lower limit of saturation&#xD;
      as 85%. Episodes will be recorded on a proforma lying at bedside by the duty nurse on the&#xD;
      data collection form which include demographic parameters notably name, age, sex, IP No,&#xD;
      gestational age at birth in weeks+ days, PMA at enrollment (weeks+ days), method of feeding&#xD;
      (OG or NG) along with clinical parameters in the form of desaturation episodes/hr and&#xD;
      bradycardia episodes/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a tube remained in situ for more than 24 hours, a new sheet will be taken. Each time&#xD;
      monitor give alarm for desaturation and/ or bradycardia, nurse will check the baby and&#xD;
      monitor. If the waveform showed regular trend and probe is attached properly to baby, episode&#xD;
      will be recorded. Since the duration of NG and OG tubes may vary, the number of episodes of&#xD;
      bradycardia and /or desaturation episodes/hr will be compared.&#xD;
