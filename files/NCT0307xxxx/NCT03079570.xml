      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a chronic, progressive eye disease. AMD is one of&#xD;
      the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness among elderly populations in&#xD;
      economically developed countries . Due to the aging of the population, the incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence of AMD is likely to increase substantially over the next decade, potentially&#xD;
      posing a significant impact on society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMD is a complex and progressive degenerative disease, with both genetic and environmental&#xD;
      risk factors. AMD affects the outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruch's&#xD;
      membrane, and choroid. The retina is among the most metabolically active tissues in the body,&#xD;
      in part due to rods, which frequently discard their outer segments tips, and the RPE, which&#xD;
      phagocytoses the discarded tips . The retina's metabolism causes accumulation of toxic&#xD;
      by-product by the following: 1. Energy metabolism (oxidative stress); 2. Visual cycle&#xD;
      modulator (lipofuscin); 3. Local inflammation (complement activation). The local&#xD;
      inflammation, and the accumulation of lipofuscin material within the RPE, may lead to drusen&#xD;
      formation, RPE dysfunction, and degeneration of macular rods and cones, finally leading to&#xD;
      the irreversible loss of vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMD occurs in two forms - a non-exudative &quot;dry&quot; form and an exudative &quot;wet&quot; form.&#xD;
      Non-exudative AMD accounts for 80-90% of AMD cases and it involves a diverse phenotype that&#xD;
      may include drusen and/or RPE pigmentation abnormalities. Advanced non-exudative AMD is&#xD;
      characterized by geographic atrophy, which is characterized by the presence of an expanding&#xD;
      region of irreversible RPE and photoreceptor loss in the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, there are no approved treatments for non-exudative AMD. The clinical&#xD;
      development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of non-exudative AMD is limited by slow&#xD;
      disease progression, unsuitability of commonly used efficacy endpoints such as visual acuity,&#xD;
      and difficulty in identifying those subjects with early stages of disease most likely to&#xD;
      progress. Visual function testing may prove to be useful tools in detecting the early&#xD;
      non-exudative AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In early age-related macular degeneration, outer retinal metabolism is known to be&#xD;
      compromised. The detection of a flickering stimulus imposes a higher metabolic requirement&#xD;
      than does a static stimulus , . Inability to detect a flickering stimuli may identify earlier&#xD;
      stages of disease than the inability to detect static stimuli. Early work by Mayer, et.al.&#xD;
      has shown that AMD subjects experience functional deficits in the mid range of visual&#xD;
      phenomenon most notably at 10HZ and 14Hz. Phipps, et.al. found early AMD subjects to have&#xD;
      larger deficits for flickering than static stimuli . Later work has shown that a flicker test&#xD;
      based on mid-range frequencies has been shown to have effective diagnostic and&#xD;
      reproducibility characteristics relative to other functional tests . In addition to the&#xD;
      diagnostic potential of flicker stimuli, this test has been shown to be predictive of AMD&#xD;
      progression and correlated to AMD severity . Therefore, a flicker test may prove useful in&#xD;
      identifying early dysfunction in macular performance and for assessment treatment in future&#xD;
      interventional clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) is a type of flicker test that involves increasing the&#xD;
      frequency of a flashing stimulus until that stimulus appears static to an observer. The&#xD;
      frequency at which critical flicker fusion occurs is recorded as a patient specific endpoint&#xD;
      of visual function. In this study, we will investigate CFF across a wide range of luminance&#xD;
      levels, from photopic to scotopic ranges, in young and old subjects with normal ocular&#xD;
      health. The impact of age on CFF threshold will be the focus of this study, with the primary&#xD;
      objective being to highlight luminance levels where maximum differences between young and old&#xD;
      subjects occur.&#xD;
