    <textblock>
      This biomarker study is a follow-up to CPLATFRM2201. The goal of CBASICHR0005 is to collect&#xD;
      another urine sample, interval clinical information, and an optional DNA sample from as many&#xD;
      of the original 80 patients as possible. This new information will transform the data&#xD;
      obtained in PLATFRM2201 from a cross-section to a temporal profile, which will (a) further&#xD;
      enable the identification of biomarkers predictive of faster progression, and (b) satisfy the&#xD;
      FDA's recommendation to perform &quot;natural history studies&quot; in rare diseases.&#xD;

        The study population will be males and females comprised of up to 80 Alport subjects who&#xD;
        participated in CPLATFRM2201 study as well as up to 20 pediatric and adolescent healthy&#xD;
        volunteers (including healthy siblings of Alport subjects) that have met all other&#xD;
        eligibility criteria.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the&#xD;
        requirements of the study and able to provide written informed consent (parent or legal&#xD;
        guardian for pediatric and adolescent subjects), which must be obtained before any&#xD;
        assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alport Subject-Specific Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in CPLATFRM2201&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physically able to provide a single first-morning urine sample of at least 30 mL (one&#xD;
             ounce). Alport patients who have initiated dialysis therapy since participation in&#xD;
             CPLATFRM2201 are exempt from this criterion and may still participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteer-Specific Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Male and Female Volunteers (may include healthy siblings of Alport patients) aged 5 to 15&#xD;
        years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alport Subject-Specific Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • None&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Volunteer-Specific Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5&#xD;
             halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local&#xD;
             regulations, and for any other limitation of participation in an investigational trial&#xD;
             based on local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of one of more of (a) hematuria (gross or microscopic), (b)audiological&#xD;
             deficits, (c) fixed (non-orthostatic) proteinuria, or (d) reduced renal filtration&#xD;
             function with serum creatinine (Cr) above the upper limit of the normal age-specific&#xD;
             reference range, on at least 2 prior occasions (serum Cr need not be measured&#xD;
             specifically for eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other clinically significant underlying medical conditions as judged by the PI.&#xD;
