  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate two new biomarkers in sputum samples. These are PiP3&#xD;
      (phosphoinositolphospat ) and phosphor proteins, representing important proteins within&#xD;
      inflammatory situations of the lung.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the study, sputum samples will be collected at 3 repetitive occasions in a 3 week&#xD;
      interval of the different donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to assess for biomarker specificity and reproducibility in the two groups&#xD;
      (smokers and non-smokers). The methods for measurement shall be validated by repetitive&#xD;
      measurement of the sputum samples, i.e. comparison of multiple measurements of the same&#xD;
      sample and comparison of different samples from the same donor.&#xD;

        during the entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle of the&#xD;
        female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks&#xD;
        prior to the first visit until at least 72 hours after the last visit -, implants,&#xD;
        injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs (intrauterine device) or&#xD;
        double-barrier methods, i.e. any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel,&#xD;
        diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap).&#xD;

             packyear&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers need to be non-smoking since at least a year with a smoking history of no&#xD;
             more than 1 packyear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume at one second)≥80% predicted and FEV1/FVC (forced&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the&#xD;
                  outcome of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to,&#xD;
                  cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological&#xD;
                  disease, neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including&#xD;
                  but not confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis&#xD;
                  or cystic fibrosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
