      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the Patellar tendon and Achilles tendon&#xD;
      structures among children, adolescents and adults with different weight status. That in order&#xD;
      to improve our understanding on the impact of acute and overused loads on tendon structure;&#xD;
      and, in developing strategies to reduce tendon's injuries following physical exercises.&#xD;

      Studies showed that the probability of tendon abnormalities is higher in obese subjects&#xD;
      compared to normal weight peer. Adiposity has been recognized as a risk factor for&#xD;
      alterations in load- bearing tendons; and, different impact of loading exercises on tendon&#xD;
      structure has been reported for obese individuals compared to normal weight individuals. The&#xD;
      aim of the current study is to evaluate the Patellar tendon and Achilles tendon structures&#xD;
      among children, adolescents and adults with different weight status. That in order to improve&#xD;
      our understanding on the impact of acute and overused loads on tendon structure; and, in&#xD;
      developing strategies to reduce tendon's injuries following physical exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tendon structure would be evaluated with UTC-imaging ultrasound device. UTC imaging allows&#xD;
      for three-dimensional imaging of the tendon, semi- quantification of structure, and&#xD;
      calculation of tendon dimensions. The resultant UTC analysis quantify the tendon into four&#xD;
      echo types (I-IV) based on the stability of pixel brightness over contiguous images allowing&#xD;
      inferences to be made on the alignment of tendon bundles. Briefly, echo types I and II&#xD;
      correspond with relatively high stability in gray-scale pixel brightness over contiguous&#xD;
      images due to one resulting US signal transmission. These echo types correspond with aligned&#xD;
      fibrillar structure (AFS) within the tendon. Echo types III and IV are generated by multiple&#xD;
      signal transmission that interfere as a consequence of multiple interfaces. These echo types&#xD;
      represent a disorganized amorphous fibrillar structure that has non parallel Ô¨Åber&#xD;
      arrangement. For this study, the relative percentage and (muscle cross section area (mCSA) of&#xD;
      these parameters were the main outcomes investigated. A linear-array US transducer&#xD;
      (SmartProbe, A 10- megahertz (MHz) linear-array transducer, USA) mounted within a customized&#xD;
      tracking device with motor drive and built-in acoustic stand off pad (UTC Tracker, UTC&#xD;
      Imaging, Netherlands) was placed on the skin, perpendicular to the long axis of the tendon&#xD;
      (Achilles or patellar), ensuring that the calcaneus or inferior pole of the patella was&#xD;
      visible. Coupling gel was applied between the transducer, standoff pad, and skin to ensure&#xD;
      maximum contact. Once a clear transverse image of the tendon and bony landmark was&#xD;
      established, the motor drive automatically moved the transducer over the length of the tendon&#xD;
      capturing a transverse grayscale US image every 0.2 mm over a distance of 12 cm. By&#xD;
      compounding these images, a gray-scale US image data block is rendered that allows the tendon&#xD;
      to be viewed in three planes: transverse, sagittal, and coronal (UTC2010, UTC Imaging). From&#xD;
      this data block, each tendon was classified as either normal or pathological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant would be measured at both Achilles tendons and both Patellar tendons (total&#xD;
      time 10min) while prone position (for the Achilles tendon) and in sitting position (for&#xD;
      Patellar tendon). Each screening is for 45sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in different ages and different weight status would be measured for tendon&#xD;
           structure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tendon structure would be evaluated following single and multiple (up to 12 weeks)&#xD;
           aerobic and anaerobic exercises.&#xD;
