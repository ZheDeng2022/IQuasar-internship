  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement is one of the most successful surgical procedures of modern times, with&#xD;
      over 80,000 performed each year in the UK. However, up to 5% of all primary hip replacements&#xD;
      need to be revised within the first 10 years, and in many cases malposition of the acetabular&#xD;
      (hip socket) component is implicated in the early failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard method of positioning the acetabular component is for the surgeon to be guided&#xD;
      by a combination of the visible anatomical landmarks within the surgical field, and the wider&#xD;
      environment of the operating theatre. The advent of 3D printing has led to the development of&#xD;
      custom-made surgical guides which can be used during surgery, in order to assist the surgeon&#xD;
      in the positioning of instruments and devices. These surgical guides are manufactured based&#xD;
      on CT or MRI imaging, and are designed to clearly indicate to the surgeon the desired&#xD;
      location and orientation of bony cuts and implant positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the hypothesis that an acetabular alignment guide combined with&#xD;
      three-dimensional CT-based planning using the Corin OPS™ (Optimised Positioning System),&#xD;
      provides more accurate component alignment following primary total hip replacement compared&#xD;
      with the current standard treatment, with the aim of improving patient outcomes and reducing&#xD;
      the risk of complications of total hip replacement.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement is one of the most successful surgical procedures of modern times, with&#xD;
      over 80,000 performed each year in the UK. The vast majority of patients experience dramatic&#xD;
      pain relief and improvement in function for many years. Despite this, however, there remains&#xD;
      a significant risk of complications, including dislocation, leg length discrepancy,&#xD;
      squeaking, and premature wear and failure of the implant. It is known that such complications&#xD;
      are more likely to occur if the acetabular component is incorrectly positioned during the&#xD;
      surgery. Up to 5% of all primary hip replacements need to be revised within the first 10&#xD;
      years, and in many cases malposition of the acetabular (hip socket) component is implicated&#xD;
      in the early failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Corin OPS™ offers such a custom-made acetabular alignment guide. Prior to the patient's&#xD;
      surgery, a CT scan of the patient's pelvis &amp; legs is performed, and the images are used to&#xD;
      produce a 3D computer model of the patient as they stand with a &quot;virtual&quot; hip replacement in&#xD;
      place. Four additional X-rays of the pelvis and lumbar spine are also taken, with the patient&#xD;
      adopting various predetermined &quot;functional&quot; positions (e.g. sitting in a chair, about to&#xD;
      stand up). From these X-rays, the changes in the pelvic and femoral orientations can be&#xD;
      measured for these functional positions. This data is then used to drive a simulation of the&#xD;
      movement of the 3D computer model. The orientation of the components of the virtual hip&#xD;
      replacement are then adjusted to optimise the biomechanical function of the joint. Once the&#xD;
      proposed implant positions have been reviewed and approved by the surgeon, a custom-made&#xD;
      acetabular orientation guide is 3-D printed and sterilised. During the surgery, this guide is&#xD;
      fitted into the patient's acetabulum prior to implanting the components. Using a simple&#xD;
      system of two sterile laser pointers, the orientation indicated by the guide can then be&#xD;
      reproduced when the definitive acetabular component is implanted. There is no published data,&#xD;
      however, on the accuracy of acetabular component positioning using this particular method.&#xD;
      The standard of care in the UK for acetabular component positioning is the &quot;freehand&#xD;
      technique&quot;, where the surgeon is to be guided by a combination of the visible anatomical&#xD;
      landmarks within the surgical field, and the wider environment of the operating theatre. It&#xD;
      is important that the impact of this acetabular guide on acetabular component positioning be&#xD;
      assessed in order to determine whether this intervention is likely to improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes and reduce the risk of complications of total hip replacement.&#xD;
