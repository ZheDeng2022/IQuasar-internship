  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled in one of three dose arms ( 4ml, Saline Placebo&#xD;
      and 4ml 2x). The estimated enrollment period is 6 months. Each subject will receive 1&#xD;
      injection and be evaluated for efficacy and safety during a 6 month observation period. The&#xD;
      study is expected to be completed within 12 months, inclusive of enrollment and follow-up for&#xD;
      all subjects.&#xD;
