  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a pair of immunotherapies as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      malignant pleural mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tremelimumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab or tremelimumab&#xD;
      as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying if the study drug can help your cancer&#xD;
      compared to the usual approach to treating malignant pleural mesothelioma . Durvalumab is a&#xD;
      drug that blocks a protein often produced by cancer cells or surrounding cells to suppress&#xD;
      immune cells from attacking cancer cells. Tremelimumab blocks a receptor on immune cells that&#xD;
      normally suppresses immune attack. These two study drugs have been used alone for&#xD;
      mesothelioma but the combination has not yet been tested for mesothelioma. These two drugs&#xD;
      have been used for cancers such as melanoma and have been effective than using either drug&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any study-specific procedures not&#xD;
             considered part of routine medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or medically inoperable&#xD;
             malignant pleural mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease progression after treatment with at least one line of chemotherapy that&#xD;
             included a first-line platinum agent in combination with an anti-folate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease according to modified RECIST for pleural&#xD;
             malignant mesothelioma. (Bone metastases are not considered measurable.) Prior&#xD;
             radiation to the only site of measurable disease will make the participant ineligible&#xD;
             unless the lesion has been demonstrated to grow after completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing and able to undergo a biopsy at the start of this study&#xD;
             and an on-treatment biopsy if safe and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have be at least 28 days from any major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non&#xD;
             sterilized male partner must agree to use at least one highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such&#xD;
             precautions for 180 days after the last dose of investigational product. Male partners&#xD;
             of a female subject must also agree to use male condom plus spermicide throughout this&#xD;
             period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a&#xD;
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the&#xD;
             trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, occasional&#xD;
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception. Female patients should refrain from breastfeeding throughout this&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile&#xD;
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or&#xD;
             post-menopausal (defined as greater than or equal to 12 months with no menses without&#xD;
             an alternative medical cause)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-sterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180&#xD;
             days after the last dose of investigational product. Not engaging in sexual activity&#xD;
             for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable&#xD;
             practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method&#xD;
             are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm&#xD;
             donation throughout this period. Female partners of a male subject must use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception throughout this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
