      The project will evaluate the potential benefit of the use of bone replacement graft as an&#xD;
      adjunct to surgical therapy of peri-implantitis. The project will be conducted as a two-armed&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial of 5-year duration in 7 clinical centers. 140&#xD;
      systemically healthy patients diagnosed with peri-implantitis will randomly assigned to be&#xD;
      treated with or without bone replacement graft. Outcome measures include assessments of&#xD;
      inflammation, probing depth, recession, radiological parameters and PROMs.&#xD;

      Objective The overall objective of the project is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the&#xD;
      use of a bone substitute material in reconstructive surgical therapy of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis-associated osseous defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of a bone substitute material in reconstructive therapy of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis increases the likelihood to achieve treatment success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance for clinical practice The project will provide significant contribution to the&#xD;
      understanding of outcomes using reconstructive procedures in treatment of peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population, design and treatment procedures The project will be conducted as a&#xD;
      two-armed randomized controlled clinical trial of 5-year duration in 7 clinical centers. 140&#xD;
      systemically healthy patients with implants ≥1 year in function and diagnosed with advanced&#xD;
      peri-implantitis at ≥1 implants will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      ≥1 implant (≥1 year of function) presenting with PPD ≥7 mm and BoP/Pus. Confirmed bone loss&#xD;
      ≥3 mm at same implant(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Treated for peri-implantitis during previous 6 months Intake of systemic&#xD;
      or local antibiotics during previous 6 months Systemic conditions affecting peri-implant&#xD;
      tissues Systemic conditions impeding surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures Surgical procedures will be performed one month after a baseline&#xD;
      examination and initiation of plaque control. Three days before surgery a 10-day systemic&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen will be initiated. Full thickness flaps will be elevated and inflamed&#xD;
      tissues will be removed. The implant surfaces will be cleaned with mini-gauze soaked in&#xD;
      saline. The osseous defect should be ≤4 mm wide and &gt;3 mm deep. The defect should in addition&#xD;
      to the mesial and distal bone walls preferably exhibit at least a lingual or a buccal bone&#xD;
      wall. The randomly assigned treatment strategy, stratified for smoking, will be revealed&#xD;
      after debridement. Test procedure: The defect will be filled with Bio-Oss Collagen® and the&#xD;
      flaps will be sutured to their previous position. Control procedure: Flaps will be sutured to&#xD;
      their previous position. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks after treatment, followed by a&#xD;
      6-week control. Clinical examinations will be performed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months&#xD;
      after therapy. Maintenance therapy will be provided based on individual needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments One calibrated examiner in each clinical center will perform the&#xD;
      assessments. The following variables will be assessed at four sites around the implant:&#xD;
      Plaque, probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP), probing attachment level (PAL)&#xD;
      and recession (REC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment success Treatment success will be defined as the absence of BoP/Pus, PPD ≤5 mm and&#xD;
      ≤1 mm recession. Peri-implant sites showing BoP and PPD ≥6 mm at re-examination will be&#xD;
      scheduled for further treatment. Patient-related outcome variables will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up and include esthetic and functional appreciation, pain or discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic assessments Intra-oral radiographs will be obtained prior to surgery (baseline)&#xD;
      and at 1-, 3- and 5-year re-examinations. Analysis of radiographs will be performed by&#xD;
      specialists in oral-maxillofacial radiology. The examiners will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      procedures. The assessment will include defect fill and crestal bone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation A total of 122 patients (61 per group) will provide a power of 80% with&#xD;
      alpha set at 0.05 to detect a difference of 1 mm in mean PPD change between groups, given a&#xD;
      SD of 1.97 (Carcuac et al., 2016). 140 individuals will be included to compensate for&#xD;
      drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Mean changes for the various variables and the proportion of sites fulfilling&#xD;
      the criteria for treatment success will be calculated. A multilevel model with the clinical&#xD;
      center as the highest level and the implant as the lowest will be built to test the influence&#xD;
      of measured factors on the outcomes and to compensate for potential clustering of data. Data&#xD;
      analysis including multilevel modeling will be conducted in collaboration with a&#xD;
      biostatistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
