  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial comparing plug-unplug (PUP) catheter&#xD;
      management, continuous drainage (CD) catheter systems and patients that do not get discharged&#xD;
      with catheters (reference) after pelvic reconstructive surgery. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess impact on activity. The secondary objectives are to compare the rate of&#xD;
      urinary tract infection between the groups, duration of time (days) it takes for patients to&#xD;
      resume normal voiding, impact on post-operative pain and satisfaction with surgery experience&#xD;
      and post-operative recovery. The investigators hypothesize that patient activity/mobility one&#xD;
      week after surgery between the two methods of managing the transurethral catheter will be&#xD;
      different between arms. Subjects will be recruited at the Hartford Hospital Division of&#xD;
      Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery during preoperative consultation for pelvic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery with 1:1:1 assignment and randomization for PUP and CD groups only.&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, baseline activity will be assessed using the Activity Assessment Scale, as&#xD;
      well as postoperative expectations. Prior to hospital discharge, patients will undergo a&#xD;
      postoperative voiding trial (PVT) per regular clinical practice. Upon failure of PVT,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms in which participants receive a&#xD;
      catheter: PUP or CD. The investigator responsible for data collection will remain blinded to&#xD;
      the treatment assignment throughout the study. Subjects who pass the PVT test and therefore&#xD;
      do not require a catheter will be assigned to the reference arm (Arm C). Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed after hospital discharge and assessed using the same pre- and post-operative&#xD;
      questionnaires as participants randomized to the CD and PUP arms and will comprise the first&#xD;
      32 consenting patients who do not require a catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to CD will have a 16F transurethral catheter attached to a leg bag and&#xD;
      receive teaching regarding home maintenance. Subjects randomized to PUP will have the same&#xD;
      16F transurethral catheter placed with a plastic plug and instructed to unplug and drain the&#xD;
      catheter when they feel the urge to void, or at least every four hours throughout the day.&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups will be provided a large bag for gravity-based drainage during the&#xD;
      night. Subjects also will be encouraged to call the research team with any catheter-related&#xD;
      questions or concerns including symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI). Subjects with&#xD;
      symptoms of UTI (e.g., dysuria, urgency, frequency, and/or hematuria) will be evaluated and&#xD;
      treated per standard of care. All participants will then return for an office voiding trial&#xD;
      (OVT) five to seven days after hospital discharge, following the same protocol as the PVT. At&#xD;
      this time urinalysis will be obtained. Only those participants who endorse symptoms of UTI&#xD;
      will have a urine specimen collected and sent for culture. This is in line with the current&#xD;
      clinical practice by the investigators. Participants will be treated for UTI based on culture&#xD;
      results or if there is high clinical suspicion at the time of office follow-up. Participants&#xD;
      who fail the OVT will be discharged home with bladder drainage per standard of care and&#xD;
      undergo routine follow-up until they pass a repeat voiding trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will complete a post-operative questionnaire assessing pain, impact on activity&#xD;
      and satisfaction. Outcomes will be followed for up to six weeks after initial OVT if it is&#xD;
      failed; however, no additional research-associated visits will be necessary from study&#xD;
      participants beyond the initial office visit.&#xD;
