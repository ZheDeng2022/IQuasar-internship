      This study evaluates if melanoma patients who report their side effects to immunotherapy&#xD;
      weekly by the use of ePRO-CTCAE will experience an overall reduction of grade 3 and 4 events&#xD;
      with 50% compared to routine monitoring carried out every 3 weeks.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Melanoma patients who report their side effects to immunotherapy by the use of PRO-CTCAE&#xD;
      (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) will experience an overall reduction of&#xD;
      grade 3 and 4 events with 50% compared to routine monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary endpoint: To examine if the electronic tool PRO-CTCAE used on a weekly basis by&#xD;
           patients receiving immunotherapy to supplement standard AE monitoring, results in&#xD;
           cutting the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events during treatment by 50% compared to&#xD;
           patients who get a standard AE monitoring schedule every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary endpoints: 1)To examine if the time patients experience grade 2 or higher&#xD;
           toxicity, differs in the two groups 2)To examine if more symptoms are reported in the&#xD;
           intervention group 3) To examine if there is a difference between the 2 group when it&#xD;
           comes to number of extra out-patient visits, days in hospital, telephone consultations&#xD;
           and days in prednisone therapy 4) To examine if PRO-CTCAE is implementable in daily&#xD;
           practice (will be explored in study 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratoty endpoint: To examine, using both qualitative and quantitative data,&#xD;
           patients´ and clinicians´ experiences with the e-Health intervention to monitor side&#xD;
           effects during treatment with immunotherapy in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are about to receive immunotherapy for the treatment of malignant melanoma&#xD;
      at the Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital (OUH), will be asked to&#xD;
      participate. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      either the intervention arm (the use of PRO-CTCAE) or the control arm (standard AE monitoring&#xD;
      schedule). Approximately 70 patients in each arm. Inclusion will take place between September&#xD;
      2016 and July 2018. Patients in the intervention arm will report their events weekly for the&#xD;
      first 12 weeks of treatment. Clinical staff and patients in the intervention arm will receive&#xD;
      instructions on how to use the Ambuflex system to complete the electronic PRO-CTCAE&#xD;
      questionnaire (patients) and include the reports in daily practice (clinical staff).&#xD;
      Assistance from clinical staff will be provided to patients when needed. Moreover, hospital&#xD;
      staff will receive education and written instructions on how to handle the weekly feedback&#xD;
      form the patients in the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: Studies show that 16% of patients treated with Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab experience&#xD;
      grade 3 or 4 side effects during treatment. When it comes to Ipilimumab, the number is 27%&#xD;
      and when the drugs are combined the number is as high as 55 %. It is however not all adverse&#xD;
      events which the patients can report themselves and when biochemical AEs are deducted, it is&#xD;
      estimated that the numbers suitable for self-reporting are as follows:&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab 10%, Ipilimumab 20%, Combination therapy 40%.The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      the randomized trial is to reduce the frequency of grade 3 or 4 side effects from 10% to 5%&#xD;
      for pembrolizumab /Nivolumab, from 20% to 10 % for Ipilimumab and from 40% to 20% for the&#xD;
      combination theory. Realistically, 140 patients can be included in the course of 2 year&#xD;
      according to the Danish Melanoma Group. A level of significance of 0.2 is accepted reaching a&#xD;
      power of 0.61 for Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab, 0.80 for Ipilimumab) and 0,96 for the combination&#xD;
      therapy. These numbers are acceptable due to the fact that this is a pilot study; PRO-CTCAE&#xD;
      has not been used in connection with immunotherapy prior to this study and only in a few&#xD;
      projects with other patients in Denmark. Moreover, it is prioritized that the Department of&#xD;
      Oncology, OUH is the only site, so that the applicant can make sure that all relevant&#xD;
      patients are recruited and that clinicians are constantly reminded of the project. Also, the&#xD;
      applicant will be able to teach both patients and clinicians on how to use the tool. All in&#xD;
      all, the collection of data will be easier and of a higher quality when the study is only&#xD;
      being conducted in one site.&#xD;
