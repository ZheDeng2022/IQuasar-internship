             diarrhoea that would, in the judgement of the PI and the Sponsor's study&#xD;
             Physician/Medical Monitor, interfere with the subject's participation in the study&#xD;

                  limit of normal, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphate and/or bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (an isolated&#xD;
                  bilirubin 1.5 x upper limit of normal is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated&#xD;
                  and direct bilirubin is &lt; 35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject has active neoplastic disease or history of any neoplastic disease within 5&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Subject has any other acute or chronic illness which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator or Sponsor's study Physician/Medical Monitor, could pose a threat or harm&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. The subject has used nicotine-containing products (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
