  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of selexipag on the physical&#xD;
      activity of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in their daily life, by using&#xD;
      a wearable wrist device (actigraph). The actigraph will collect data on daily life physical&#xD;
      activity in the patient's real environment. In addition, the PAH symptoms and their impacts&#xD;
      will be assessed by using an electronic patient reported outcome measure in the patient's&#xD;
      real environment. Patients will be assigned randomly to either selexipag or placebo.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (data analysis was done during 14-Days each for Baseline and for Week 24 and mean value reported)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to Week 24 of the DLPA activity parameters for daily time spent in non-sedentary activity (NSA) (as defined by Freedson '98 and Koster '16) and daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as defined by Freedson '98 were reported. These variables were assessed by actigraphy and were expressed in minutes. Freedson 1998 established ranges of activity counts obtained from a hip worn accelerometer corresponding to commonly employed MET categories. Based on this work, threshold between sedentary and NSA was defined. This threshold is often referred to as Freedson's 1998 publication. Koster 2016 defined the threshold between sedentary and NSA based on wrist-worn accelerometers on non-dominant hand, respectively. Positive change from baseline means improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-Symptoms and Impact (PAH-SYMPACT) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PAH-SYMPACT has 2 main parts: symptoms (cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular) and impact (physical impacts and cognitive/emotional). The symptom part is a questionnaire completed daily for 7 consecutive days and contains 11 items. The impact part has a 7-day recall period and is completed on 7th day of symptoms questionnaire data collection period. It contains 11 items pertaining to impact of PAH. The average Cardiopulmonary Symptoms and cardiovascular symptoms domain scores are determined based on daily scores of 6 and 5 items, respectively, reported on a 5-point Likert scale with score range from 0=best to 4=worst. The Physical impacts and Cognitive/emotional domain consists of 7 items reported on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 to 4). The value 0 = &quot;not at all&quot;/&quot;with no difficulty at all&quot; and value 4 = &quot;very much&quot;/&quot;extremely&quot;/ &quot;not able at all&quot;. Mean value on each of 7-day period was calculated for each specific domain score and corresponding mean change from baseline was reported.</description>

    <description>The WHO FC of pulmonary hypertension is a physical activity rating scale as follows: Class I (No limitation of physical activity); Class II (Slight limitation of physical activity); Class III (Marked limitation of physical activity); and Class IV (Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms). The change from baseline in WHO FC was classified into &quot;Improved&quot;, &quot;No change&quot; and &quot;Worsened&quot; compared to baseline. Deterioration, No Change, and Improvement are based on shift of risk category (I, II, III, IV) from baseline in WHO Functional Class.</description>

Then, the dose is increased in increments of 200 mcg b.i.d., usually at weekly intervals, depending on the dose tolerability. Up-titration is followed by a stable maintenance treatment period at the highest tolerated dose, from Week 13 to Week 24.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Actigraphy Assessed Daily Life Physical Activity (DLPA) for Variables Expressed in Minutes</title>
        <description>Change from baseline to Week 24 of the DLPA activity parameters for daily time spent in non-sedentary activity (NSA) (as defined by Freedson '98 and Koster '16) and daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as defined by Freedson '98 were reported. These variables were assessed by actigraphy and were expressed in minutes. Freedson 1998 established ranges of activity counts obtained from a hip worn accelerometer corresponding to commonly employed MET categories. Based on this work, threshold between sedentary and NSA was defined. This threshold is often referred to as Freedson's 1998 publication. Koster 2016 defined the threshold between sedentary and NSA based on wrist-worn accelerometers on non-dominant hand, respectively. Positive change from baseline means improvement.</description>

        <description>PAH-SYMPACT has 2 main parts: symptoms (cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular) and impact (physical impacts and cognitive/emotional). The symptom part is a questionnaire completed daily for 7 consecutive days and contains 11 items. The impact part has a 7-day recall period and is completed on 7th day of symptoms questionnaire data collection period. It contains 11 items pertaining to impact of PAH. The average Cardiopulmonary Symptoms and cardiovascular symptoms domain scores are determined based on daily scores of 6 and 5 items, respectively, reported on a 5-point Likert scale with score range from 0=best to 4=worst. The Physical impacts and Cognitive/emotional domain consists of 7 items reported on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 to 4). The value 0 = &quot;not at all&quot;/&quot;with no difficulty at all&quot; and value 4 = &quot;very much&quot;/&quot;extremely&quot;/ &quot;not able at all&quot;. Mean value on each of 7-day period was calculated for each specific domain score and corresponding mean change from baseline was reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline to Week 24 in World Health Organization Functional Class (WHO FC)</title>
        <description>The WHO FC of pulmonary hypertension is a physical activity rating scale as follows: Class I (No limitation of physical activity); Class II (Slight limitation of physical activity); Class III (Marked limitation of physical activity); and Class IV (Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms). The change from baseline in WHO FC was classified into &quot;Improved&quot;, &quot;No change&quot; and &quot;Worsened&quot; compared to baseline. Deterioration, No Change, and Improvement are based on shift of risk category (I, II, III, IV) from baseline in WHO Functional Class.</description>

        <population>The FAS included all participants randomly assigned to a study treatment. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) included all participants who were with assessments at both baseline and post-baseline time point.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>No hypothesis testing was planned for this exploratory study. Data for sleep outcome measures were not reported because the sleep episodes were not identified due to unexpected inaccuracy in automated sleep detection algorithm which resulted in missing/unreliable sleep data which would mislead the design of future trials and the interpretation of sleep results.</limitations_and_caveats>
