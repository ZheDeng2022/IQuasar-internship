    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new drug Pembrolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy, for Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. The chemotherapy regimen is&#xD;
      called &quot;ICE&quot; and includes three drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      is currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of some patients&#xD;
      with melanoma, lung cancer and head and neck cancer, but has not yet been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. The 'ICE' regimen of chemotherapy is&#xD;
      currently FDA approved for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma, but has not&#xD;
      yet been investigated in combination with pembrolizumab for this disease. For patients who&#xD;
      have a relapse of their Hodgkin's lymphoma, retreatment with chemotherapy followed by a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant is recommended. We know that obtaining a complete remission (not able to&#xD;
      detect any disease on scans) is very important prior to proceeding to the stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. Patients with negative scans have a lower chance of the disease coming back and a&#xD;
      higher chance of achieving a long-term cure.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the complete response rate by fludeoxyglucose- positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (AHSCT) with the combination of pembrolizumab and ifosfamide, carboplatin,&#xD;
      etoposide (ICE) salvage chemotherapy for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with salvage&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version (v)4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the event free survival (EFS) at 2 years from start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the overall survival (OS) at 2 years from start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize PD-1 pathway specific expression and correlate with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize serum biomarkers of immune and inflammatory response during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To characterize levels of soluble PD-L1 related to treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize T-lymphocyte subset changes to treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlation of chromosome 9p24.1 mutations for&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the effect on stem cell harvest following treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV over&#xD;
      60 minutes on days 1-3 of courses 1-2, carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 2 of courses&#xD;
      1-2, and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 2 of courses 1-2. Pembrolizumab in combination&#xD;
      with ICE chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for 2 courses, patients will then receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as monotherapy on course 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
