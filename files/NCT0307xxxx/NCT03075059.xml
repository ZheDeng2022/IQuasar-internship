      1. Determine preoperative and postoperative levels of anxiety for pediatric patients ages&#xD;
           6-17 related to outpatient surgical intervention using the validated Psychosocial Risk&#xD;
           Assessment in Pediatrics (PRAP) assessment tool, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for&#xD;
           Adults(STAI-AD), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-CH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine preoperative and postoperative levels of anxiety for parent/guardian of&#xD;
           pediatric patients ages 6 - 17 related to outpatient surgical intervention using the&#xD;
           validate PsychosocialRisk Assessment in Pediatrics (PRAP) assessment tool and the&#xD;
           State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess if additional Child Life intervention offered pre-operatively to one group&#xD;
           demonstrates differences in PRAP scores compared to control group&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional study with two groups of patients scheduled for&#xD;
      outpatient surgery at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Participants&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment will be identified and screened upon diagnosis and/or at the time of&#xD;
      referral for surgery until patient enrollment is completed. Based on a power analysis, using&#xD;
      average scores and norms for the validated tool with a projected difference of four points&#xD;
      difference between groups, minimum enrollment is 22 per group, 44 patients total to detect a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference based on established parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be identified in the outpatient clinic setting once a physician&#xD;
      and family has agreed to pursue surgical invention. The research team will consent either&#xD;
      during clinical evaluation or following surgical consent obtainment. All questions will be&#xD;
      answered prior to obtaining signed study consent. Once consent is received, Child Life will&#xD;
      be paged to observe the patient and caregiver along with the physician provider in order to&#xD;
      observe and assess behavior required to complete the PRAP assessment form. Additionally, the&#xD;
      patient and parent/guardian will be asked to complete the STAI-CH and STAI-AD assessments as&#xD;
      appropriate per age. After the completion of the assessments the patient and family will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Only the Child Life Specialist and&#xD;
      research staff facilitating the intervention will be unblinded as to which patients are in&#xD;
      which group, which is necessary for conducting the study. All other study staff will remain&#xD;
      blinded. For patients randomized to the intervention group, the Child Life specialist will&#xD;
      reach out via telephone to offer support and expertise in helping prepare their child and&#xD;
      themselves for outpatient surgery to help decrease anxiety and increase coping. Concepts&#xD;
      covered will include: developmentally appropriate language for explaining surgery and related&#xD;
      procedures, potential coping skills to ease separation for caregivers and pediatric patients.&#xD;
      Additionally, written materials (attached) covering the same information will be sent via&#xD;
      mail or email covering the same information discussed in the phone conversation to serve as a&#xD;
      refresher and resource before the day of surgery. On the day of surgery, the patient will&#xD;
      receive standard of care (SOC) Child Life Services available to all patients. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the control group will not receive the preoperative phone call or written&#xD;
      materials and will only receive SOC Child Life services on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical induction or day of the procedure, the Child Life Specialist will complete&#xD;
      the PRAP and document in EPIC per SOC procedures. The Child Life Specialist will also attend&#xD;
      the postoperative and complete the third PRAP based on feedback from the patient,&#xD;
      family/caregiver and providing surgeon. At this postoperative time the patient and&#xD;
      parent/guardian will be asked to complete the STAI-CH and STAI-AD assessments as appropriate&#xD;
      per age for the second time. Once data is collected, analysis will compare PRAP, STAI-CH, and&#xD;
      STAI-AD scores between groups at all three points on the timeline. Information gained may be&#xD;
      used to help direct and develop interventions to help decrease patient and family anxiety and&#xD;
      increase coping related to surgical intervention&#xD;
