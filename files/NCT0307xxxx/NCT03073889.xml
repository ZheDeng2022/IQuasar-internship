  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty ASA I or II patients, scheduled for aneurysm clipping were enrolled in this&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, controlled study. Those patients were randomly divided into 3&#xD;
      groups: Group B (Scalp nerve block before skin incision n=15), Group I (Scalp infiltration&#xD;
      before incision n=15), respectively with 0.75% of ropivacaine, and Group C (the control&#xD;
      group, n=15). Opioids were used to control haemodynamic responses.All patients received the&#xD;
      same general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After intubation, in group B, scalp block was performed by blocking the nerves that innervate&#xD;
      the scalp, including the supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal,&#xD;
      greater occipital and lesser occipital nerves, and skin along the incision was infiltrated&#xD;
      with 0.75% ropivacaine (group I, n = 15), respectively. For group C, there is no treatment.&#xD;
      All patients received the same general anesthesia. The depth of anaesthesia was adjusted to&#xD;
      maintain a BIS of 40-60. Characteristics of patients were recorded. Heart rate (HR) and mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded preoperatively, after induction, before skin incision,&#xD;
      the moment of incision, after skin incision. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-10, CRP were measured&#xD;
      before surgery, skin incision,after the surgery. Postoperative pain scores (VAS) for 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 24, 48 hours after recovery of consciousness were also recorded. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications ( nausea, vomiting, infection, and other adverse events) were monitored after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For group B, the scalp block was performed bilaterally with 0.75% ropivacaine by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. The supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves emerge from the orbit, and a&#xD;
      needle was introduced above the eyebrow perpendicular to the skin with ropivacaine and was&#xD;
      then gradually withdrawn with simultaneous injection of solutions throughout the entire. The&#xD;
      zygomaticotemporal nerve emerge lateral to the orbit, equal to the position of pterion, this&#xD;
      nerve was blocked with ropivacaine. The auriculotemporal nerve was blocked bilaterally&#xD;
      anterior to the ear at the level of the tragus, the needle was introduced perpendicularly to&#xD;
      the skin and infiltration was performed deep to the fascia and superficially as the needle&#xD;
      was withdrawn. Care must be taken to avoid destroying superficial temporal artery. The&#xD;
      greater, lesser, and third occipital nerves may be blocked using a needle, with infiltration&#xD;
      along the superior nuchal line, approximately halfway between the occipital protuberance and&#xD;
      the mastoid process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group I patients, neurosurgeons infiltrated the planned incision by a needle penetrated&#xD;
      deeply to the skin with 0.75% ropivacaine throughout the entire thickness of the&#xD;
      scalp.Neither scalp block nor local infiltration was performed in the control group (group&#xD;
      C).&#xD;
