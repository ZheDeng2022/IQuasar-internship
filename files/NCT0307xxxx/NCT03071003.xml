  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensorion are the study sponsor and the objective of this study is to investigate the safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SENS 401 in humans after a single and repeat dose&#xD;
      administration and to confirm that, there is no interconversion of the (R) enantiomer to the&#xD;
      (S) enantiomer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study only involves the one drug, referred to as SENS-401.The key objective is to assess&#xD;
      the safety of SENS 401 after multiple doses in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population who are eligible to take part in the study are healthy male and female,&#xD;
      non-smoking volunteers, aged between 18 and 50 years, as determined by screening tests at&#xD;
      Simbec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the trial will last for about 3 weeks (from first screening to final end of&#xD;
      study visit).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double blind, multiple dose, safety and PK study. Three cohorts of 12&#xD;
      subjects will be administered with three different dose regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments will be carried out within 14 days before administration of the&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product (IMP). Eligible subjects will be asked to return for the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: 12 subjects will receive 29 mg SENS-401 or placebo once daily for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: 12 subjects will receive 29 mg SENS-401 or placebo twice daily for 6 days and a&#xD;
      single dose of 29 mg SENS-401 or placebo in the morning on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3: 12 subjects will receive 43.5 mg SENS-401 or placebo twice daily for 6 days and a&#xD;
      single dose of 43.5 mg SENS-401 or placebo in the morning on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to attend Simbec 5-7 days after administration of the last dose for a&#xD;
      post study visit. If they are withdrawn from the study, they will still be asked to attend&#xD;
      for an end of study assessment. Subjects may be asked to return again if we need to follow&#xD;
      them up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy males and females (non pregnant/non lactating) between 18 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female subject of child bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at the&#xD;
             screening visit and willing to use 2 effective methods of contraception, from first&#xD;
             dose until 3 months afterwards (i.e., until 3 months after last SENS-401 dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subject of non child bearing potential with negative pregnancy test at the&#xD;
             screening visit. For the purposes of this study, this is defined as the subject being&#xD;
             amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months or at least 4 months post surgical&#xD;
             sterilisation (including bilateral fallopian tube ligation or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
             with or without hysterectomy) and levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) falling&#xD;
             within the respective pathology reference range. In the event a subject's menopause&#xD;
             status has been clearly established (for example, the subject indicates she has been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH levels are not consistent with a post menopausal&#xD;
             condition, determination of subject eligibility will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator following consultation with the Sponsor's Responsible Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Male subject willing to use 2 effective methods of contraception, (unless anatomically&#xD;
             sterile) from first dose until 3 months afterwards (i.e., until 3 months after last&#xD;
             SENS-401 dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 30 kg/m2. If Asians are included, BMI&#xD;
             values will be modified to 16-23 kg/m2 (this range is considered as normal in Asian&#xD;
             population). BMI = body weight (kg)/height (m)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and&#xD;
             urine examination values within 14 days of the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen, determined within 14 days of&#xD;
             the first dose (a positive alcohol result may be repeated at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject with negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             (Hep B) and hepatitis C virus antibody (Hep C) results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12 lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
             (ECG) determined within 14 days of the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in blood pressure or pulse&#xD;
             determined within 14 days of the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject is a non smoker or ex smoker who has not smoked in the last 3 months&#xD;
             (determined by urine cotinine &lt; 500 ng/mL at screening visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject is available to complete the study (including all follow up visits) and comply&#xD;
             with study restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject satisfies a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject provides written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject with a clinically significant history of gastrointestinal disorder likely to&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Subject with a clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject with inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language&#xD;
             problem, poor mental development or impaired cerebral function).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject participation in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 4&#xD;
             months or a marketed drug clinical study within the previous 3 months. (N.B. washout&#xD;
             period between studies is defined as the period of time elapsed between the last dose&#xD;
             of the previous study and the first dose of the next study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject donated 450 mL or more blood within the previous 3 months.&#xD;
