  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab and bevacizumab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with rare solid tumors. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab when given in combination with bevacizumab (atezo&#xD;
      bev).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of atezo bev. II. To evaluate the safety of atezo + bev.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY BIOMARKER OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify biomarkers that are predictive of response to atezo bev (i.e., predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers), are associated with progression to a more severe disease state (i.e., prognostic&#xD;
      biomarkers), are associated with resistance to atezo bev, are associated with susceptibility&#xD;
      to developing adverse events, can provide evidence of study treatment activity, or can&#xD;
      increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>Will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (modified RECIST for pleural mesothelioma). Will be defined as a complete response or partial response on two consecutive occasions 4 weeks apart as determined by an independent radiologist. For each tumor group, the best response rate and its 95% exact confidence interval will be estimated using the Clopper and Pearson method. The combination treatment will be assessed by performing the independent binomial test comparing the best response rate versus the historical control for each tumor group. The Bayesian classification and information sharing method proposed by Lee and Chen may be applied.</description>

    <description>The relationship between biomarkers in blood and tumor tissue and efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, or other biomarker endpoints will be assessed. Summary statistics for biomarkers and their corresponding changes (or percent changes) from baseline will be tabulated by planned study day and dose in each tumor group. The time-course of biomarker measures will be investigated graphically. If there is indication of meaningful pattern over time, further analysis (eg, by linear mixed model) may be performed to characterize the relationship. Methods such as, but not limited to, logistic regression will be used to explore possible associations between biomarker measures and clinical outcomes.</description>
