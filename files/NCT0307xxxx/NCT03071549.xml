  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne patients were included in this randomized controlled trial. Each patient received four&#xD;
      treatment sessions two weeks apart. 20% azelaic acid combined with 20% salicylic acid were&#xD;
      applied to the one side of the face while 25% trichloroacetic acid was applied to the other&#xD;
      side. Evaluation was done by counting number of non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions&#xD;
      before, after two and after four treatment sessions. The dermoscope was used in evaluating&#xD;
      the degree of improvement of erythema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study included 34 patients with mild and moderate acne vulgaris. The patients were&#xD;
      recruited from the dermatology outpatient clinic of Kasr AlAiny hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the Ethical committee of the Faculty of Medicine Cairo University&#xD;
      and the Ethical committee of the Dermatology department Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing an informed consent, patients were subjected to history taking, clinical&#xD;
      examination and grading of their acne by global acne grading score, photography, dermoscopic&#xD;
      examination and chemical peeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient was photographed from front, lateral and side view before each session and two weeks&#xD;
      after the 4th session. All photographs were taken using a digital camera (Nikon AW1,&#xD;
      Indonesia) with identical lightening and patient positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dermoscopy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cheek was split as four quadrants and photography of dermoscopic figures was taken before&#xD;
      every session and two weeks after the 4th session (Using Dermalite DL3N Gen, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemical peeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin degreasing was performed before every session using acetone. Trichloroacetic acid 25%&#xD;
      was applied on one side of the face and azaleic acid 20% with salicylic acid 20% to the other&#xD;
      side of the face randomly. Randomization was done through a computer-generated random&#xD;
      sequence prepared by a statistician; Allocation was concealed in sequentially numbered,&#xD;
      sealed, opaque envelopes, and kept by a nurse not involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A gauze was used to apply the peel. The gauze was soaked with the peel. The peel was applied&#xD;
      uniformly starting from medial to lateral. The peel was left on each side for around 60&#xD;
      seconds. The patients were asked to wash their faces using tape water for neutralization of&#xD;
      the peel until the burning sensation is eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received 4 sessions 2 weeks apart. As a post procedure care, the patients were asked&#xD;
      to apply sun screens immediately after the procedure until their next session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other topical or systemic treatment was used during sessions. Patients will receive 4&#xD;
      peeling sessions 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
