    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well nelfinavir mesylate works in treating patients&#xD;
      with kaposi sarcoma. Nelfinavir mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of a therapeutic escalation strategy consisting of standard dose&#xD;
      nelfinavir (nelfinavir mesylate), followed by high dose nelfinavir, for the treatment of&#xD;
      Kaposi sarcoma (KS) tumor lesions. With 36 evaluable participants, the null hypothesis will&#xD;
      be rejected if 11 or more participants respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of high dose nelfinavir among participants with KS. II. To assess&#xD;
      the effect of nelfinavir on Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic gene&#xD;
      expression in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate nelfinavir and the primary active metabolite, M8, concentrations with tumor&#xD;
      response, antiviral response, and adverse effects in participants with KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the effect of nelfinavir on KSHV copy number in saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of nelfinavir on KSHV copy number in PBMC and plasma. II. To assess&#xD;
      the effect of nelfinavir on herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) copy number in saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD DOSE NELFINAVIR MESYLATE: Patients receive standard dose nelfinavir mesylate orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks in the absence of progressive disease (PD). Patients with&#xD;
      PD at 4 weeks proceed to high-dose nelfinavir mesylate. At week 8, if there is stable disease&#xD;
      (SD) or partial response (PR), patients advance to high-dose nelfinavir mesylate. Patients&#xD;
      discontinue standard dose nelfinavir mesylate 4 weeks after documentation of complete&#xD;
      response (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIGH DOSE NELFINAVIR MESYLATE: Patients with PD continue to receive high-dose nelfinavir&#xD;
      mesylate PO BID for 4 more weeks. If there is PD documented after 4 weeks at the high dose&#xD;
      level, nelfinavir mesylate is discontinued. If there is SD or PR, patients continue receiving&#xD;
      nelfinavir mesylate for 16 weeks. If there is CR, patients discontinue high-dose nelfinavir&#xD;
      mesylate 4 weeks after documentation of CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used for changes in the relative abundance of all latent and lytic viral mRNA relative to cellular mRNA by expression array, and changes in the percentage of cells staining for K8.1 (lytic) and LANA (latent) antigens by immunohistochemistry.

    <description>Trough nelfinavir/M8 concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals. This outcome will also be displayed graphically as a trend in drug levels over time. The relationship between dose and drug exposure of nelfinavir/M8 and the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects will be determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r2) or appropriate non-parametric statistics for dichotomous and categorical variables (e.g., Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance by ranks).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with KSHV detection in plasma (viremia) and oral shedding will be calculated at baseline and on NFV treatment. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) using a binomial distribution will be used to evaluate the detection of KSHV in plasma and PBMC specimens over time. Log10 transformations will be applied to the viral load data, and the median log viral load will be estimated for each participant prior to treatment and at time points post treatment. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used to assess change over time with respect to these measures.</description>
