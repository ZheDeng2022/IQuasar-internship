      Administration of preoperative oral carbohydrates are suggested to reduce insulin resistance&#xD;
      due to surgical stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether preoperative oral carbohydrate loading can&#xD;
      contribute to lower incidence of postoperative discomfort and to reduce complications in&#xD;
      elective lung cancer patients undergoing video assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS).&#xD;

      Fasting from 6-12hours before elective surgery is still standard of care in many&#xD;
      departements, including our departement in Oslo University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is a trauma that triggers a catabolic stress response with high emissions of hormones&#xD;
      and immune activation. These activations can affect brain, heart, muscles and liver. The&#xD;
      metabolic changes may in addition influence development of pain, tissue damage, ileus,&#xD;
      tachycardia and other hemodynamic disturbances. Preoperative fasting has shown an increase of&#xD;
      surgical stress and to impact catabolic processes which secondarily may lead to insulin&#xD;
      resistance and hyperglycemia in non-diabetic patients. Insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia&#xD;
      are known to increase the incidence of postoperative infections. Previous studies have also&#xD;
      shown that prolonged fasting increases the incidence of gastrointestinal problems. A 12 hour&#xD;
      fast before surgery has shown delayed recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that patients undergoing lung cancer surgery suffer from multiple symptoms&#xD;
      and experience discomfort in the postoperative phase. Symptoms include dyspnea, fatigue,&#xD;
      pain, weakness, cough, dry mouth, nervousness, difficulty sleeping,&#xD;
      stomach-/intestinal-problems and lack of appetite. Carbohydrate-rich supplements have shown a&#xD;
      positive effect on other perioperative symptoms and measures, but is to our knowledge&#xD;
      currently not investigated in lung cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to explore the possible advantages of preoperative oral&#xD;
      carbohydrate loading in lung cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether preoperative carbohydrate loading&#xD;
      with PreOp® provides less postoperative discomfort in the early postoperative phase measured&#xD;
      by Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40), a validated and widely used measure of quality of&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to investigate if preoperative loading with carbohydrates affect the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative complications such as stomach-/intestinal problems and heart&#xD;
      rhythm disorder, in addition to contribute to faster mobilization and to reduce hospital&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may provide important data regarding the lung cancer patients perioperative&#xD;
      symptoms, complications and well-being when using a carbohydrate-rich supplement as&#xD;
      intervention to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the intervention group will be given 800ml of a oral carbohydrate supplement,&#xD;
      PreOp®, the night before surgery and 400ml of the same supplement, PreOp®, 2-4 hours prior to&#xD;
      surgery. The control group will be fasted from 24h, the night before surgery, in accordance&#xD;
      to the departements standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups, the interventional and the control group, will follow the department's&#xD;
      perioperative course with regard to anesthetic and surgical procedures.&#xD;
