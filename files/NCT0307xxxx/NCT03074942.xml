  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately, 5% of the patients with asthma suffer a difficult-to-control severe variant of&#xD;
      the disease. Despite being treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICs), long-acting&#xD;
      β2-agonists (LABA), oral corticosteroids or omalizumab, one or more components of the control&#xD;
      concept (symptoms, exacerbations, bronchial obstruction) remain to be resolved. Omalizumab&#xD;
      has been proven to safely reduce asthma exacerbations and to decease symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life in severe allergic asthmatics. However, approximately 25% of the treated patients fail&#xD;
      to respond to this monoclonal antibody. The rest of them show different degrees of response,&#xD;
      although the rate of asthmatics who achieve control of the disease is unknown because&#xD;
      clinical trials of omalizumab have been carried out to assess the impact of the drug on&#xD;
      exacerbations, symptoms or even pulmonary function, but its effect on control was not&#xD;
      evaluated. Therefore, there is a need to find new therapeutic options for those severe&#xD;
      asthmatics who remain uncontrolled despite having received all the recommended therapies&#xD;
      (including omalizumab). Reslizumab is a humanized anti-interleukin-5 (IL-5) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (mAb) that has been recently found to reduce exacerbations and to improve pulmonary&#xD;
      function and symptoms in patients with severe asthma and high peripheral eosinophil counts.&#xD;
      It would be important to demonstrate that Reslizumab is able to improve the clinical&#xD;
      condition of severe asthma patients with no therapeutic options.&#xD;
