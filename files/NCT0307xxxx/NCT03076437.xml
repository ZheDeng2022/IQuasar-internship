  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) will be&#xD;
      infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. The&#xD;
      patients will be monitored after infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells for adverse&#xD;
      events, persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell therapy for&#xD;
      patients with B cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 1 and 80 years of age, who have relapsed or refractory CD19-expressing&#xD;
      B-cell malignancies (leukemia or lymphoma) that have not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant who meet all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have adequate organ functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood from patients will be collected for isolation of peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which will be transduced with a lentiviral or retroviral vector&#xD;
      encoding anti-CD19 CAR containing a CD28 or 4-1BB and a CD3 zeta as costimulatory domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen to prepare their immune&#xD;
      system to accept modified T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an infusion of their own modified T cells. They will remain in the&#xD;
      hospital to be monitored for adverse events until they have recovered from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the persistence of modified T cells&#xD;
      and efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite progress has been made to date in the treatment of patients with B cell malignancies,&#xD;
      including leukemia and lymphoma, many patients with relapsed or refractory diseases do not&#xD;
      respond to the standard treatments. It has been shown that anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells&#xD;
      may be an effective approach to treat the relapsed or refractory diseases. The procedure&#xD;
      involves collecting PBMCs from the patients and modifying the T cells to attack the malignant&#xD;
      B cells. In this trial, autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) containing the signaling domains of CD28 or 4-1BB and CD3-zeta will be&#xD;
      infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia. The&#xD;
      patients will be pretreated with a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen before the&#xD;
      infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and will be monitored for adverse events, persistence of&#xD;
      anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and the treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and feasibility of the administration of anti-CD19 CAR transduced T&#xD;
      cells in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the treatment regimen can result in clinical regression of B-cell&#xD;
      malignancies in the patients as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the in vivo persistency of the anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells.&#xD;
