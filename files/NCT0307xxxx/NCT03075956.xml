  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estetrol (E4) is being developed in two indications supporting women health care: first E4 is&#xD;
      combined with a progestin, [drospirenone (DRSP)] and is used as a new combined oral&#xD;
      contraceptive (COC) for the prevention of pregnancy and secondly, E4 is used alone as new&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the treatment of menopause related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current clinical trial is designed to collect more detailed information about the PK&#xD;
      profile, safety and tolerability of different dosages of E4, given orally as a solid tablet.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized, two-period, single and multiple oral dose&#xD;
      study in 27 healthy female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening period, eligible subjects (n=27) will receive a single oral dose of 5, 15,&#xD;
      or 45 mg E4 (Period 1). After at least 14-day washout, 18 subjects will continue the study&#xD;
      (Period 2). They will receive 15 mg E4 once daily for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
