  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This is an open label single-arm, single-institution stud to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
           safety of SGI-110 in Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) Myeloproliferative Neoplasms&#xD;
           (MPN) (excluding PV, ET and primary/secondary myelofibrosis). The study will enroll&#xD;
           approximately 50 patients at the Weill Cornell Medical College.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment onto this clinical study is expected to be completed in approximately 36&#xD;
           months. The total study duration will depend on individual response, evidence of disease&#xD;
           progression and tolerance. Participants will be followed monthly for six months after&#xD;
           removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed diagnosis of Ph- MPN and had&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No chemotherapy or radiation treatment within 2 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects meet other protocol-defined criteria related to baseline screening procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The active metabolite of SGI-110 (2'-deoxy-5-azacytidylyl-(3'→5')-2'-deoxyguanosine sodium&#xD;
      salt), a dinucleotide, is decitabine, an FDA-approved agent for the treatment of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes. SGI-110 is resistant to modification by cytidine deaminase, a&#xD;
      common pathway of decitabine metabolism and deactivation[1]. The molecular weight of SGI-110&#xD;
      and decitabine are 580 Da and 228 Da, respectively. Therefore, the molar equivalent dose of 1&#xD;
      mg of decitabine is approximately 2.5 mg of SGI-110. SGI-110's activity was demonstrated with&#xD;
      the same preclinical pharmacodynamic assays used to demonstrate decitabine's efficacy e.g.,&#xD;
      re-expression of p15, p16, and MLH1 and induction of fetal hemoglobin, in vivo. In xenograft&#xD;
      studies, SGI-110 demonstrates promising preclinical activity in both hematologic and solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro evidence suggests that SGI-110 has a longer half-life than decitabine in the&#xD;
      presence of cytidine deaminase. These promising observations suggest that SGI-110 may have&#xD;
      improved pharmaceutical properties and biological activities that could extend decitabine's&#xD;
      current clinical utility. SGI-110 has shown to be better tolerated in mice than decitabine&#xD;
      and is as effective in vivo in inducing p16 expression, reducing DNA methylation at the p16&#xD;
      promoter region, and retarding EJ6 human bladder cancer tumor growth in athymic mice[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGI-110 has been developed for subcutaneous administration. SGI-110 is pharmacologically&#xD;
      active both in vitro and in vivo in a variety of tumor cells and murine xenograft models when&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously. Treatment is well tolerated via the subcutaneous route in murine&#xD;
      xenografts. When administered subcutaneously to non-human primates, SGI-110 releases&#xD;
      decitabine slowly compared to other species, possibly prolonging the effect over longer&#xD;
      periods. SGI-110 has been developed as a non-aqueous formulation to ensure formulation&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SGI-110 has been studied in a first-in-human, single-agent study (SGI-110-01).5 This study&#xD;
      was a Phase 1/2, dose escalation, multicenter study of two subcutaneous regimens of SGI-110&#xD;
      in subjects with intermediate or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). This study had two parts, a Dose Escalation Segment and a Dose Expansion&#xD;
      Segment. The study evaluated the biological activity, preliminary safety, and efficacy of&#xD;
      SGI-110 with two dosing schedules in intermediate to high risk MDS or relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      AML subjects, while the Dose Expansion Segment further evaluated safety and efficacy at the&#xD;
      recommended dose. The study was based on a 3 + 3 design within each regimen. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 2 dosing regimens of SGI-110 with the following&#xD;
      starting doses: Regimen 1: 3 mg/m2/day subcutaneously on Days 1-5 of a 28-day course, Regimen&#xD;
      2: 6 mg/m2 subcutaneously Weekly x 3 on Days 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day course. The minimum dose&#xD;
      achieving maximal biological activity or biologically effective dose (BED) for the daily&#xD;
      regimen was reached at 60 mg/m2 daily on Days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study disease: MPN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Philadelphia chromosome negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (PHN-MPN) comprise a group of&#xD;
      myeloid neoplasms with varying clinical, morphologic and laboratory features and a wide range&#xD;
      of survival. According to 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the MDS/MPN&#xD;
      overlap syndromes include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (aCML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia(JMML) and&#xD;
      myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U). In a recent&#xD;
      retrospective study from MD Anderson Cancer Center, the median survival of patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of MDS/MPN unclassifiable was 12.4 months[3] .There is no effective therapy for&#xD;
      PHN-MPN and this represents an unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MDS/MPN overlap syndromes can present with a wide range of hematological and clinical&#xD;
      manifestations and individual patients may exhibit a combination of features characteristic&#xD;
      of both MDS and MPN. For example, while transfusion-dependent anemia is generally present,&#xD;
      other hematological laboratory abnormalities can range from leukopenia to leukocytosis and&#xD;
      from thrombocytopenia to thrombocytosis. Unlike with MDS, significant splenomegaly is often&#xD;
      present in patients with PHN-MPN. Also, patients may have a constellation of constitutional&#xD;
      findings, including fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats and other unpleasant&#xD;
      symptoms that lead generally to poor quality of life. Thus, while improving overall survival&#xD;
      is a critical goal of therapy, effective therapy for this group of patients will include also&#xD;
      agents that can be demonstrated to improve as many of the disease-related clinical issues as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single arm, open-label study of SGI-110 in patients with MPN. SGI-110 will be&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously at a dose of 60 mg/m2 on days 1-5, repeated every 28 days.&#xD;
      Toxicity will be evaluated using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      Active Version 4. The frequency of toxicities per organ system will be tabulated using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. All patients who receive any amount of the study drug will be&#xD;
      evaluable for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and pre-treatment criteria Screening Procedures Screening procedures and tests will&#xD;
      be performed within 14 days before treatment administration with the exception of informed&#xD;
      consent, bone marrow biopsy which may be performed within 28 days of the first dose of study&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of written informed consent. The ICF must be signed and dated by the subjects&#xD;
           before collection of any samples or performance of any study-specific evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete medical history, including demographics (date of birth, sex, race). A disease&#xD;
           history, including the date of initial diagnosis and list of prior treatments and&#xD;
           responses to these treatments, also will be recorded. Concurrent medical signs and&#xD;
           symptoms must be documented to establish baseline conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record all study-procedure related AEs from the time of informed consent and then&#xD;
           treatment-emergent AEs after the start of study drug administration (Course 1, Day 1)&#xD;
           through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator's confirmation of eligibility. Perform all necessary procedures and&#xD;
           evaluations to document that the subject meets each eligibility criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete physical exam including weight and examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs include resting systolic/diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate,&#xD;
           resting respiration rate, body temperature and pulse oximetry. Assess after the subject&#xD;
           has rested in the sitting position for at least three minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12-lead ECG (rhythm, atrial rate, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and&#xD;
           QT/QTc (QtcF), morphology and overall interpretation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample collection for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum or urine pregnancy test: for female subjects of child-bearing potential only.&#xD;
           Results must be negative for the subject to be eligible for enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agent Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      • SGI-110 administered at dose level of 60 mg/m2 SC daily on Days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
      However, treatment delays are allowed per section 6.3.1 SGI-110 is administered by SC&#xD;
      injection preferably in the abdominal area. The total amount (in mg) of SGI-110 to be&#xD;
      administered will be determined based on the body surface area (BSA). In calculating the BSA,&#xD;
      actual heights and weights should be used. There will be no adjustments to &quot;ideal&quot; body&#xD;
      weight. The institutional standard for calculating BSA is acceptable. Dose adjustment should&#xD;
      be made for a +/- 10% weight change at the beginning of each cycle The site(s) of SGI-110 SC&#xD;
      injections will be captured on the dosing CRF. Investigators are prohibited from supplying&#xD;
      SGI-110 to any subjects not properly enrolled in this study or to any physicians or&#xD;
      scientists except those designated as sub-investigators on Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      Form 1572. The investigator must ensure that subjects receive SGI-110 only from personnel who&#xD;
      fully understand the procedures for administering the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and&#xD;
      tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue&#xD;
      until one of the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression to acute leukemia unless, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
           investigator, the subject is experiencing clinical benefit from SGI-110 despite&#xD;
           laboratory evidence of progression to acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the medication&#xD;
           regimen and/or documentation requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant decides to withdraw from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant&#xD;
           unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed monthly for six months after removal from study or until death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will&#xD;
      be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event. Post-study case report&#xD;
      forms will capture information including subsequent treatments, response to subsequent&#xD;
      therapy, and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event List(s) for SGI-110&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common AEs suspected by the investigators in Study SGI-110-01 to be related to the&#xD;
      drug and observed to date in the MDS/AML population are: injection site pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia and diarrhea. Based on the mechanism of action of the drug&#xD;
      and its active form decitabine, myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia)&#xD;
      and the related consequences such as infection (e.g. pneumonia), sepsis, and bleeding are the&#xD;
      most likely risks for the drug. Mucositis has also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and burning at the injection site has been reported that are related to dose and volume&#xD;
      of injection as well as the speed of injection. Care must be taken to avoid intradermal&#xD;
      injection. Ice packs will be applied prior to injection of SGI-110 and the drug will be&#xD;
      injected slowly, over 30-60 seconds. If the injection site events are reported at subsequent&#xD;
      injections despite slow injection and the use of ice packs, pre-treatment with topical or&#xD;
      systemic analgesics can be considered.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.1 Participants must have confirmed diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome negative MPN&#xD;
        neoplasm based on WHO classification (reference) including Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia&#xD;
        (CNL), atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (aCML), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML),&#xD;
        MPN/MDS overlap syndromes, accelerated phase myelofibrosis and MPN unclassifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.2 Age minimum of 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
        available on the use of SGI-110 in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded&#xD;
        from this study but may be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.3 ECOG performance status &lt;3&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.4 Participants must have normal organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal unless attributable&#xD;
             to underlying disease, hemolysis or documented Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal unless attributable&#xD;
             to underlying disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5add &lt; or = 1.5X institutional upper limit of normal or creatinine&#xD;
             clearance add using Cockcroft Gault &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine&#xD;
             levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVEF &lt; 40 % is allowed as long as there is no NY class III/IV heart failure or&#xD;
             uncontrolled arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.5 The effects of SGI-110 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
        because oncological agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
        and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
        control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
        study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.1.6 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
        document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.1 Participants who have had any chemotherapy (investigational or FDA approved)&#xD;
        (hydroxyurea is permitted) or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study entry or those who&#xD;
        have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks&#xD;
        earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.2 Participants may not be treated with any other investigational agents while on this&#xD;
        study unless approved by the principal investigator AND the sponsors of BOTH&#xD;
        investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.3 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to decitabine or SGI-110.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.4 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, infection,&#xD;
        symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
        psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SGI-110 is a hypomethylating agent with&#xD;
        the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
        potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother&#xD;
        with SGI-110, breastfeeding should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.2.5 Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
        following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if&#xD;
        they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be&#xD;
        at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are&#xD;
        eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer in situ, and&#xD;
        basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
