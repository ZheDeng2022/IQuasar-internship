  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and fatigue are characterized by peripheral and central mechanisms including low&#xD;
      pain thresholds, temporal summation, peripheral and central sensitization. This application&#xD;
      will focus on central factors of chronic pain and fatigue. Functional brain imaging will be&#xD;
      used to characterized brain and spinal cord abnormalities that contribute to the mechanisms&#xD;
      of these disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic fatigue (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) are a chronic musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      disorder that predominantly afflicts women. Frequently associated insomnia, cognitive&#xD;
      abnormalities, and fatigue may lead to early disability. No consistent soft tissue&#xD;
      abnormalities have been identified so far in these patients. The cause of these disorders is&#xD;
      unknown, no highly effective treatment is available and the current methods of diagnosis are&#xD;
      imprecise and unreliable. The Investigators previously used quantitative sensory testing to&#xD;
      improve upon diagnoses of these disorders by supplementing the current procedure of&#xD;
      manipulating defined pressure points by hand and noting the presence or absence of pain. The&#xD;
      quantitative methods of evaluation involve repetitive application of brief, non-injurious&#xD;
      thermal/mechanical stimulation that normally produces a moderate degree of temporal summation&#xD;
      of sensation intensity. The patients and normal control subjects will verbally rate the&#xD;
      magnitude of late sensations elicited by each stimulus, using a numerical scale. Chronic pain&#xD;
      in these patients results, at least partially, from exaggerated activation of central&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as a result of enhanced input from unmyelinated&#xD;
      peripheral afferent nerve fibers supplying deep tissues. Temporal summation of second pain&#xD;
      can lead to central sensitization with subsequent signs of hyperalgesia and allodynia.&#xD;
      Functional brain imaging of ME/CFS and FM patients, as proposed in this study, will be used&#xD;
      to document their ratings of repetitive experimental stimuli and the resulting pain&#xD;
      augmentation. Successful completion of this study will provide a new method for the&#xD;
      evaluation of chronic pain/fatigue mechanism and their response to therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Numerical ratings from 0 to 100 are tied to verbal descriptors in increments of 5, to standardize the scale, and ratings in increments of 5 are permitted. Ratings of 0 and 15 designate non-painful sensations of warmth (5 = threshold for warmth, 15 = suprathreshold warmth). A rating of 20 = threshold for heat pain, 30 = very weak pain, 40 = weak pain, 50 = moderate pain, 60 = slightly strong pain, 70 = strong pain, 80 = very strong pain, 90 = extreme strong pain, and 100 = the most intense pain imaginable</description>
