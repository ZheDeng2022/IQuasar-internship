    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand what happens to platelets and blood clotting&#xD;
      factors in burn patients over time. This study will also examine the role of microparticles&#xD;
      (MPs), nanoparticles (NPs), and micro RNA in burns. The investigators will be looking at&#xD;
      small particles of cells that are released into the blood. These particles have been found to&#xD;
      be important in a variety of different diseases. The investigators believe that MPs, NPs, and&#xD;
      micro RNA may play a role in development of inflammation, and infections in burn patients.&#xD;
      Thus, hopefully, this study will help understand how to minimize transfusions and bleeding in&#xD;
      burn patients as well as how to reduce inflammation and infections in burn patients.&#xD;

      Trauma injury is the leading cause of death in people 1-44 years old in the US. Burn injury&#xD;
      is a particularly debilitating form of trauma. In the U.S. the incidence of burn injury is&#xD;
      estimated to be greater than 2 million cases per year. Burns account for ~ 300,000 deaths&#xD;
      worldwide every year. In 1996, the cost of caring for burn patients in the U.S. was estimated&#xD;
      at $573 million per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notably, 20-40% of trauma deaths that occur after hospital admission involve massive&#xD;
      bleeding. Hemorrhage is the second most common cause of early in-hospital mortality&#xD;
      accounting for a large portion of trauma deaths that occur within the first 24 hours.&#xD;
      Resuscitation has dramatically changed over the last decade or so. Nowadays, we are&#xD;
      substituting the normal saline and the other resuscitating fluids with blood products. This&#xD;
      early administration of blood products during resuscitation is referred to as damage control&#xD;
      resuscitation (DCR). The goal of DCR is to prevent and immediately correct trauma associated&#xD;
      coagulopathy. DCR was initially practiced in the military where a balanced ratio of&#xD;
      FFP:platelets:RBCs of 1:1:1 was employed. DCR has resulted in improved outcomes in both the&#xD;
      military as well as civilian trauma setting as compared to previous resuscitation patterns.&#xD;
      Despite the early use of a 1:1:1 ratio, a 1:1:2 ratio also became commonly used. Thus, the&#xD;
      Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) study was done to&#xD;
      investigate the best ratio of products to use during resuscitation. The PROPPR study found no&#xD;
      differences in mortality between the 1:1:1 and the 1:1:2 groups at 24 hours or at 30 days.&#xD;
      Additionally, there was no difference in complications between the two groups. Notably,&#xD;
      exsanguination was significantly decreased in the 1:1:1 group and more patients in the 1:1:1&#xD;
      group reached hemostasis. The Prospective Observational Multicenter Major Trauma Transfusion&#xD;
      (PROMMTT) study showed that early transfusion (within minutes of arriving at hospital) was&#xD;
      associated with improved 6-hour survival. Furthermore, patients with increased plasma to RBC&#xD;
      ratios (&gt;1:2) were found to have improved 30-day survival as compared to patients who&#xD;
      received lower plasma to RBC ratios (&lt;1:2). Notably, 1-day and 30-day survival were found to&#xD;
      be increased when patients received higher ratios of platelets to RBCs. Delayed but balanced&#xD;
      transfusion ratios did not have the same protective effect as receiving plasma early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there have been few studies on the effects of hemorrhage during burn and soft tissue&#xD;
      excision and optimal blood product resuscitation. It is unclear whether DCR is optimal in&#xD;
      burn patients. Moreover, it is unknown exactly what is happening in burn patients with&#xD;
      respect to coagulation, platelet function, and microparticles (MPs). Patients with burns and&#xD;
      soft tissue injuries typically have considerable bleeding during surgeries. Intraoperative&#xD;
      blood loss is estimated at 9.2% of blood volume for every 1% of total body surface area&#xD;
      (TBSA) burn excised in adults. In children undergoing burn excision, blood loss is estimated&#xD;
      as 2% of blood volume for every 1% TBSA excised in extremities and trunk and 5% of blood&#xD;
      volume for each 1% TBSA excised for the face. Moreover, early complete excision and grafting&#xD;
      of major burns has been shown to decrease transfusions, infections, and mortality in&#xD;
      children. Interestingly, many burn surgeons anecdotally report that their burn patients&#xD;
      develop microvascular bleeding during the surgery. This phenomenon may be indicative of&#xD;
      development of coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several prospective studies looking at perioperative coagulation status in&#xD;
      burn patients. These studies show that the coagulation proteins (FV, FVIII, FIX, and&#xD;
      fibrinogen) decrease during surgery. Notably, in most cases, the factor levels were still&#xD;
      within &quot;normal&quot; reference ranges. FVIII and fibrinogen are acute phase reactants and were&#xD;
      elevated in the burn patients preoperatively. These studies were performed before the&#xD;
      adoption of DCR. Additionally, several studies have shown that antithrombin, protein S, and&#xD;
      protein C (the natural anticoagulants) levels decrease in burn injuries. A recent study by&#xD;
      Palmieri et al. looked at compared a transfusion ratio of 1:1 RBCs:FFP to 4:1 RBCs:FFP in&#xD;
      children with &gt;20% TBSA burns. In their study of 16 children, they found a trend toward&#xD;
      increased length of stay (LOS), peak PELOD score (measure of organ dysfunction), increased&#xD;
      time to wound healing, and increased infection rates in the 4:1 group; however, the&#xD;
      differences were not statistically significant. Notably, they found that the 1: 1 ratio was&#xD;
      safe in the burn patients and that the 1:1 ratio was also less expensive ($26,635 versus&#xD;
      $34,485). A recent study by Pidcoke et al. showed that current blood product resuscitation&#xD;
      during burn and soft tissue excision is not hemostatic. Thus, the effect of using a balanced&#xD;
      resuscitation ratio of blood products including platelets in burn patients has not been well&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, platelet dysfunction is believed to play a role in the development of trauma&#xD;
      associated coagulopathy (TAC). The effect of burns on patients' platelets count and activity&#xD;
      is unknown. Upon hospital admission, burn patients typically have normal platelet counts. By&#xD;
      days 3-5, the patients' platelet counts usually drop, especially in burns of large TBSA. In&#xD;
      severe burn patients, platelet mediators, such as platelet factor 4 (PF4) and thromboxane B2&#xD;
      (TxB2), have been found to be elevated. This is thought to be attributable to platelet&#xD;
      activation and consumption. Thus, further investigation of the effect of burns on platelets&#xD;
      will offer further insight into the transfusion needs of burn patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study done by Lu et al. on the development of TAC in burn patients, TAC was defined as&#xD;
      an INR ≥ 1.3, aPTT ≥ 1.5 times the mean normal limit, and normal platelet counts, no patient&#xD;
      presented with TAC upon admission. Only few changes in INR and aPTT values were observed over&#xD;
      time. Further studies are needed; however, the authors may have underdiagnosed TAC in the&#xD;
      burn patients based upon their definition of TAC. It is likely that platelets and MPs play a&#xD;
      significant role in the development of TAC as well as the bleeding seen in burn patients&#xD;
      during excision and grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPs are small vesicles (&lt; 1 µm) that resemble their parent cell in terms of similar surface&#xD;
      proteins and membrane lipids. Interestingly, all blood cells can release MPs. The most&#xD;
      abundant MPs in the blood are platelet MPs (PMPs). PMPs have been found to have 50- to&#xD;
      100-fold higher procoagulant activity than activated whole platelets. PMPs are formed via&#xD;
      five mechanisms: 1) platelet activation and subsequent shedding of membrane fragments, 2)&#xD;
      complement mediated membrane attack, 3) high shear forces, 4) senescence and apoptosis of&#xD;
      platelets and megakaryocytes, and 5) platelet cytoskeletal abnormalities. In the PROMMTT&#xD;
      study, patient were found to have increased levels of MPs derived from endothelial cells,&#xD;
      RBCs, and leukocytes as well as increased levels of tissue factor bearing MPs (TF-MPs).&#xD;
      Notably, coagulopathic trauma patients were found to have much lower levels of PMPs, TF-MPs,&#xD;
      and thrombin generation in addition to more bleeding and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further understand the role of PMPs, Matijevic et al. examined PMPs in plasma. They&#xD;
      compared thawed plasma at day 5 to freshly thawed fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at day 0. They&#xD;
      found that the majority of MPs were indeed PMPs and that day 5 plasma had a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      MPs and a 29% decrease in procoagulant activity. A recent prospective observational study of&#xD;
      trauma patients found that patients with low levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) positive PMPs&#xD;
      had impaired clot formation and were more likely to receive more RBC transfusions during the&#xD;
      first 24 hours following injury. These studies suggest that PMPs may play an important&#xD;
      previously overlooked role in TAC. The role of MPs in burn patients is unknown. It is likely&#xD;
      that MPs play a significant and overlooked role in the coagulation and development of&#xD;
      coagulopathies in burn patients. Further studies are needed to further evaluate the role of&#xD;
      MPs particularly the number, identity, size, and contribution to coagulation in burn&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery with burn excision and grafting, patients remain hospitalized for various&#xD;
      lengths of time. This often depends upon the TBSA burned, smoke inhalation, and infectious&#xD;
      complications, and other complicating medical problems. Based upon previous studies, burn&#xD;
      patients are thought to become hypercoagulable. This hypercoagulable state has been&#xD;
      attributed to increased levels of some clotting factors (FV, FVIII), platelets, and&#xD;
      fibrinogen, and decreased levels of antithrombin, protein S, and protein C. Notably, the&#xD;
      incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in burn patients is low.&#xD;
      A study using the National Burn Repository database found the rate of venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      (VTE) to be 0.61%. Another study found the rate to be 0.25% for DVT and 0.05% for PE. Yet&#xD;
      another study which used duplex ultrasonography to screen burn patients for DVT on admission&#xD;
      and at discharge found a prevalence of 6.1%. Thus, the rate of VTE in burn patients is&#xD;
      thought to be much higher than previously expected due to asymptomatic DVTs as well as the&#xD;
      difficulty in diagnosing DVTs in this population due to overlapping symptoms between DVTs and&#xD;
      burns (ex. extremity swelling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several published reports of VTE in burn patients. Recently, Van Haren et al.&#xD;
      studied the coagulation status of 24 burn patients over the course of their hospital stay&#xD;
      using thromboelastography (TEG) and standard laboratory coagulation tests. Notably, repeat&#xD;
      samples taken one week after admission were found to be hypercoagulable (decreased R and K&#xD;
      times, increased α angle and increased MA) and levels of fibrinogen, protein S, protein C,&#xD;
      and antithrombin were found to be increased. Two patients that were hypercoagulable (TEG&#xD;
      showing decreased R time) at admission were found to later develop VTE despite&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapy. Surprisingly, prophylactic use of anticoagulation is not overall&#xD;
      common in burn patients. A survey of burn centers showed that about one quarter of USA&#xD;
      centers did not use any form of VTE prophylaxis. Thus, additional studies are needed to&#xD;
      further explore the coagulation status and various coagulation and anticoagulation factor&#xD;
      levels of burn patients throughout their hospital course. Only by understanding what is&#xD;
      physiologically taking place in these patients can we offer the best therapeutic treatment&#xD;
      (no anticoagulation versus anticoagulation, and if so, which one?).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to further understand the physiologic changes that occur&#xD;
      initially in burn patients and how the coagulation status of the burn patient changes over&#xD;
      time. In addition to changes in coagulation and anticoagulation proteins, this study will&#xD;
      focus on the effect of burns on platelets and MPs. We will also examine the MP populations&#xD;
      and characterize the identity, size, PS content of the MPs and elucidate their effect on&#xD;
      coagulation parameters as well as inflammation.&#xD;
