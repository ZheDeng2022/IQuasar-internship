  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Functional Medicine (FM) approach to diabetes care focuses on identifying and treating the&#xD;
      etiologies for &quot;imbalances in the core physiological systems.&quot;(1) If underlying triggers and&#xD;
      imbalances can be identified, the FM approach to addressing &quot;root causes&quot;(1) can be utilized&#xD;
      through the use of specialized testing to treat and potentially reverse diabetes. If the FM&#xD;
      approach is successful, the impact on diabetes disease burden as well as diabetes-associated&#xD;
      health care costs could be significant. This project will assess the clinical as well as cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of a FM approach to diabetes care compared to a usual care approach for&#xD;
      patients with diabetes on insulin for 5 years or less.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label clinical trial with a 1:1&#xD;
      randomization of patients with diabetes who have been on insulin less than 5 years to receive&#xD;
      either Functional Medicine care in addition to usual care or to continue usual care delivered&#xD;
      by an endocrinologist. The total number of patients planned for enrollment is 90, 45 in each&#xD;
      arm. Patient recruitment will begin in the Cleveland Clinic main campus Endocrinology clinics&#xD;
      and may later include Endocrinology practices at other Cleveland Clinic Health System sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following voluntary informed consent, study subjects will complete a screening/baseline&#xD;
      visit. After this visit, patients will be randomized to continuing usual care delivered by&#xD;
      endocrinologists or to FM plus usual care. Once randomization occurs, the patient will&#xD;
      continue to remain under the care of their endocrinologist and any other usual physicians. If&#xD;
      randomized to the FM plus usual care group, subjects will receive additional care through a&#xD;
      functional medicine physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stratified randomization procedure will be used to allocate patients into the two groups&#xD;
      according to the strata: Total Daily Insulin dose &lt; = 50 units vs. &gt; 50 units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects: In addition to usual care provided by the endocrinologist, study visits will&#xD;
      occur at screening/baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Lab data/Biometrics (if not&#xD;
      recorded within 1 month time frame) will be obtained at this time. Quality of life&#xD;
      instruments (Diabetes Distress Scale, SPADE, PHQ-9 and MSQ; Appendices D, E, F and G) will&#xD;
      also be administered. At baseline, the 12 month visit, and the 24 month visit, a Body Fat&#xD;
      Analysis by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) will be performed. There will also be 10&#xD;
      cc of blood collected for plasma and serum samples as well as 10 cc of urine and&#xD;
      approximately 1 gram of stool for the bio repository if patient agrees to provide the&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care subjects only: Subjects randomized to the usual care arm will receive a&#xD;
      nutritional education session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FM plus usual care subjects only: Subjects randomized to the FM plus usual care arm will be&#xD;
      evaluated using the functional medicine approach to diabetes outlined in the Functional&#xD;
      Medicine Diagnostic and Treatment Approach to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardio-Metabolic&#xD;
      Syndrome. Subjects randomized to the FM plus usual care arm will also receive nutrition&#xD;
      therapy and dietary supplements. These will be prescribed and monitored at all Functional&#xD;
      Medicine study visits. An estimated total of 50ml of blood will be collected from those&#xD;
      subjects in this arm of the study at each designated visit. In addition, subjects may be&#xD;
      asked to provide a urine and stool sample. Functional Medicine labs will be used in part to&#xD;
      determine which supplements will be recommended.&#xD;
