    <textblock>
      The current study is aimed at evaluating nutrition interventions to be implemented for&#xD;
      improving health and nutritional status of female garments workers in 4 selected garment&#xD;
      factories in Bangladesh. The interventions will attempt to increase either energy intake and&#xD;
      or iron intake by female garments workers and expected to implement the interventions as&#xD;
      planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Provision of a once weekly iron/folate supplement, and nutritionally improved, daily hot&#xD;
           lunch including multi-nutrient fortified rice plus a nutrition and health behavior&#xD;
           change communications (BCC) program in intervention factory compared with a control&#xD;
           factory which will provide regular lunch meal plus a nutrition and health behavior&#xD;
           change communications (BCC) program for 10 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provision of a twice weekly iron/folate supplement plus a nutrition and health BCC&#xD;
           program in an intervention factory compared with a control factory with only nutrition&#xD;
           and health BCC program for 10 months; on the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prevalence of anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nutrition knowledge and practices as per key messages of the BCC program&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Worker satisfaction with the modified lunch and/or iron/folate supplementation, and&#xD;
                the BCC program&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods Impact Survey Design To determine the impact of this program on&#xD;
      the main outcomes (i.e., prevalence of anemia and dietary intake practices) we will use a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental, controlled, pre-post design for both sets of interventions (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are using a quasi-experimental design as it is not possible to identify a large pool of&#xD;
      factories from which to randomly sample and assign factories to a control or intervention&#xD;
      group. To minimize possible selection bias, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To the extent possible, factories will be selected based on specified criteria, to&#xD;
      minimize major differences in response to the intervention among them (as described in&#xD;
      selection of factories section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Select individual women for pre-post studies based on matching or equivalence on key&#xD;
      characteristics (eg, age); iii. Use difference-in-difference analysis to test impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Description Two types of interventions will be tested against controls in a&#xD;
      total of 4 factories. Among factories that already provide a hot lunch to workers, one&#xD;
      intervention and one control factory will be selected, and among factories that do not&#xD;
      provide hot lunches, one intervention and one control factory will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention with hot lunch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a selected garment factory that already provides a hot lunch meal to workers, the&#xD;
      intervention will consist of a nutritionally enhanced lunch meal program (increased dietary&#xD;
      diversity plus inclusion of multi-nutrient fortified rice), provision of a weekly iron/folate&#xD;
      supplement to female workers, and a BCC program conducted in the factory setting focused on&#xD;
      improving health and nutrition for women and children, with a focus on anemia prevention.&#xD;
      Change Associates will measure the nutritionally improved or enhanced diet and individual&#xD;
      consumption. The BCC program builds on an existing program called 'HERhealth' that is&#xD;
      currently being implemented by BSR and Change Associates in garment factories in Bangladesh.&#xD;
      The HERhealth program will be enhanced to include modules on nutrition (balanced&#xD;
      diets/dietary diversity, iron/folate rich foods), infant and young child nutrition (IYCN),&#xD;
      and an overview module on anemia prevention, hand-washing with soap and dietary diversity at&#xD;
      the very beginning of the intervention. Existing factory-run child day cares will also be&#xD;
      enhanced by including additional training for the day care workers on Early Childhood&#xD;
      Development methods and health and hygiene practices, and the improvement of facilities with&#xD;
      regard to hygiene and sanitation. One control factory will also be included, where only the&#xD;
      standard HERhealth modules will be implemented. After the completion of the endline impact&#xD;
      survey, the additional BCC modules on nutrition and IYCF, and technical advice on improving&#xD;
      the lunch program and day care centers, will be delivered as appropriate and desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention without lunch program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a selected garment factory that does not have a lunch program, the intervention will&#xD;
      consist of the twice weekly provision of iron/folate supplements to female workers, and the&#xD;
      enhanced HERhealth program, as described above, including the same enhancements to the&#xD;
      existing child day care program. One control factory will be selected where only the standard&#xD;
      HERhealth modules will be implemented. As noted above, the additional intervention components&#xD;
      of the enhanced HERhealth program will be implemented in the control factory after completing&#xD;
      the endline impact survey, as appropriate and desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary components of the intervention (lunch and supplements) Lunch meal Based on&#xD;
      information compiled from menus from 7 factories currently serving hot lunches to factory&#xD;
      workers the average frequency and estimated serving size of different food groups is&#xD;
      summarized in Table 1. Rice and dal are served in large bowls to each table and workers can&#xD;
      consume as much of these as they choose, and the serving size shown is an estimate. Other&#xD;
      menu items are served individually in fixed portion sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the dietary modifications, food service for the garment factories will procure&#xD;
      multi-nutrient fortified , vitamin A fortified vegetable oil, and iodized salt for use in&#xD;
      preparing the lunch meals, if they are not already doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavior Change Communications Component This uses a peer-education model whereby one module&#xD;
      is introduced each month to the peer educators selected from among the factory workers; the&#xD;
      master trainers conduct each session in groups of 24-30 peer educators. For each module,&#xD;
      there are 3 hour regular training sessions and a one hour refresher training in the&#xD;
      subsequent month, i.e. a total of 4 hours over 2 months for every module. Peer educators are&#xD;
      selected from among the workers based on leadership qualities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the outreach to factory workers, the factory management then schedule one weekly&#xD;
      15-minute session for the peer educators with approximately 15 of their respective&#xD;
      colleagues. Additionally, factories will have visibility and awareness tools on the project&#xD;
      board and relevant areas (i.e. hand washing chart in bathroom and wash areas) for continuous&#xD;
      refreshers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Enhanced HERhealth Curriculum will consist of the following modules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Summary module&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Health, Hygiene and Personal Health&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutrition and Dietary Diversity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maternal Nutrition and Hygiene (some focus on anemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) + Breastfeeding (BF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Reproductive Health and Family Planning&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sexually Transmitted Infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of factories&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the large commitment required on the part of factory management to introduce hot meals,&#xD;
      the selection of factories and assignment to study groups will not be done through random&#xD;
      allocation. Randomization would help to minimize bias in sample selection (that is, to&#xD;
      minimize the chance that differences in outcomes, or response to treatment, between the&#xD;
      groups occurs due to existing differences between the groups). To minimize such differences,&#xD;
      we will use a set of matching criteria to guide the selection, as summarized below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Willingness to participate in the program and comply with research requirements over a&#xD;
           10-12 month period. Specifically, the requirements are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. They would consider providing an improved hot lunch (Treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Willing to fully participate in the HERhealth program&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Willing to make data available on absenteeism&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Willing to allow data to be collected from selected workers in a baseline/endline&#xD;
                survey and on a monthly basis for monitoring purposes throughout the pilot project&#xD;
                period&#xD;
&#xD;
           To the extent possible, for purposes of matching:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Factory has approximately - 1500- 6000 workers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Factory has similar ratio of women: men (e.g., 60:40 to 70:30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Factory produces similar garment products (e.g., woven vs. knit clothing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Factory has a day care facility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample-size for the survey was calculated for anemia with a consideration of 10-15%&#xD;
      absolute reduction in the prevalence from the baseline as a result of the impact of&#xD;
      interventions compared to the control. Considering a 5% level of significance, 80% power and&#xD;
      20% non-response, the minimum sample-size was 328 female garment workers per factory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of key outcomes Anemia: Hemoglobin will be measured in capillary blood samples&#xD;
      using portable HemoCue machine at baseline after enrolment and at the end of 10 months to&#xD;
      assess anemia in female garment workers. Single finger prick method will be used to assess&#xD;
      haemoglobin status in field. The cut-off levels of haemoglobin that are considered to define&#xD;
      anemia: &lt;110 g/L for pregnant and &lt;120 g/L for non-pregnant non-lactating or lactating women&#xD;
      as the survey areas are at the sea level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absenteeism: Collect data from factory Human Resources and management on worker absenteeism.&#xD;
      Data should be collected on a continuous basis (i.e., complete data throughout the&#xD;
      intervention). Ideally data will be restricted to individual factory workers identified as&#xD;
      being female, or to individuals in worker lines that are predominantly female. Ideally, data&#xD;
      will be restricted to unscheduled time off, as opposed to vacation time or lay off time for&#xD;
      non-permanent staff. Health related absenteeism can be monitored through collection of data&#xD;
      from the factory doctor's office. However, the latter will only account for employees that&#xD;
      request to leave work during the course of a work day, and does not include those that don't&#xD;
      attend work. Health related absenteeism questions can also be applied directly to the sample&#xD;
      of women included in the baseline/endline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worker retention: Human resources will be consulted for ongoing data on the number of female&#xD;
      garment worker staff members who leave their employment positions throughout the intervention&#xD;
      period. They may also be consulted on the number of female garment workers hired and trained&#xD;
      to replace workers who have left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required number of survey respondents will be randomly selected from the list of female&#xD;
      workers available with the study factories. The place of interview inside the factory and&#xD;
      prior appointment for interview will be noted by our field workers beforehand in consultation&#xD;
      with the individual respondent and/or her supervisor. For hemoglobin estimation, the required&#xD;
      number of female workers will be randomly selected from the list of survey participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For key informant interviews, around 2-3 respondents per factory will be tentatively selected&#xD;
      resulting in a total of 8-12 key informant interviews. An iterative process will be followed&#xD;
      for key informant interviews until saturation of information is reached. In addition to note&#xD;
      taking by Research Assistants, audio recording of the interviews will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools/measurements Questionnaire/ guideline/ checklist For the survey, a&#xD;
      pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire will be used by the research staff to interview of&#xD;
      selected female garments workers. Necessary guidelines highlighting areas of interests will&#xD;
      be used for key informant interviews after necessary field test. Investigators and a trained&#xD;
      Field Research Officer (FRO) will conduct the interviews. A checklist will be used by the&#xD;
      Field Research Assistants (FRAs) for observation of the study factories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Prior to implementation of the study, necessary approval of the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) of icddr,b will be obtained for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Data entry and cleaning Survey data will be double entered into computer using&#xD;
      SPSS (version 17). Checks for errors of entered data will be done manually and errors&#xD;
      detected will be corrected immediately. In addition, data will be validated by a series of&#xD;
      logical and range checks, producing summary statistics and tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The survey data will be analysed using SPSS (version 17) / STATA software&#xD;
      (version 12). The summary statistics would be expressed as means with standard deviations,&#xD;
      medians or percentages, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate. To assess&#xD;
      differences in mean among the factories, ANOVA and for categorical outcomes, chi-square&#xD;
      statistical comparisons of proportions with 95% confidence intervals, will be calculated. A&#xD;
      difference-of-difference (DID) analysis of quantitative outcome data will be done. To&#xD;
      identify significant predictors associated with the main outcome indicators, bivariate and&#xD;
      multiple regression analyses will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic analysis will be followed for qualitative information collected through key&#xD;
      informant interview, observation and record review. Following preparation of transcript,&#xD;
      responses will be coded according to themes (a priori), sub themes and emergent issues, if&#xD;
      any. Triangulation of data derived from different methods will be carried out to validate&#xD;
      qualitative information.&#xD;
