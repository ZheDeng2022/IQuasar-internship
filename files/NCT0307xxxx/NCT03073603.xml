  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural history research in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) suggests that risk of relapses and new&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) changes diminish significantly as people age, especially in&#xD;
      MS patients 55 or older. Thus, the need to continue MS medicines that reduce relapses and new&#xD;
      MRI lesions may also decrease as people age, especially in those who have not had relapses or&#xD;
      MRI scan changes for prolonged times. This study plans to learn more about the safety of&#xD;
      stopping MS medication in this population, as compared to continuing on the medication.&#xD;

      Participants will be randomized to one of the 2 groups of research subjects. One of these&#xD;
      groups will stay on their current MS medication, and one group will discontinue their&#xD;
      medication. They will also have some extra assessments done at their regular routine MS&#xD;
      clinic appointment and every 6 months for the next 2 years. The following items will be done&#xD;
      in addition to any assessments or procedures they are already having done as part of their&#xD;
      clinical care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some questionnaires about the participant's quality of life including questions about&#xD;
           health, mood, thinking, and social life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some questionnaires about the participant's MS symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A test of the participant's attention, concentration, and thinking that involves adding&#xD;
           and repeating numbers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A test of the participant's physical symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Along with the MRIs the participants get as part of their routine care, they will also&#xD;
           have one 6 months from their start in the study as part of the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of patients with new disease activity upon discontinuation of therapy vs. those continuing therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then every 6 months for 2 years with one exception at 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>In multiple sclerosis patients 55 years of age or older, who have not had evidence of new relapses for at least five years or brain MRI lesions for at least three years while continuously taking a disease modifying therapy, the risk of having a new relapse or brain MRI lesion is no higher over a two year period of time in those who discontinue vs. those who continue disease modifying therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the patient's Quality of Life using the MSIS-29 Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then every 6 months for 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) will be collected to assess changes in quality of life from the patient's perspective. The MSIS has 29 questions. Each question asks the participant to rank how impacted they are in a certain aspect of their life. The options are 1 through 4. 1 indicates not at all impacted while the 4 indicated extremely impacted. The lower the final score, the less impacted the participant is overall. We will compare the groups for those who have had a change of eight points or more (considered a meaningful change) over the two years of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Number of New T2 Lesions on MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then every 6 months for 2 years with one exception at 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>MRIs will be reviewed to determine the total number of new T2 lesions that develop for each subject over the course of the study. Lesion counts will be performed by the central MRI facility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Change in Physical Disability using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then every 6 months for 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is a neurological examination performed by a blinded rater. This assessment is collected at each study visit. Increase in the EDSS score shows disease activity or progression, with a change confirmed six months later considered to be significant. We will assess percentage of those who have had such a confirmed change at six months, anytime over the two year period of the study.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the Patient's Disability using Patient-Determined Disease Steps</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then every 6 months for 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Determined Disease Steps will be collected to assess changes in disability from the patient's perspective. This outcome measure is a single question. The scores range from 0 to 8, and a participant with a low score has less perceived disability than a participant with a higher score.</description>
