      The investigator's are conducting a randomized, blinded study to determine if the&#xD;
      extra-capsular local infiltration analgesic (LIA) administration of 20ml 0.25%&#xD;
      bupivacaine-epinephrine can improve the postoperative pain management of hip arthroscopy&#xD;
      patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to the LIA group or non-LIA group prior to&#xD;
      surgery. Participants, anesthesiologists and PACU nurses will be blinded to group assignment,&#xD;
      however the surgeon administering the LIA will be unblinded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hip arthroscopy is a growing field in orthopedic medicine that has gained momentum in recent&#xD;
      years as a treatment for an array of hip pathologies including labral tears, chondral&#xD;
      injuries, loose bodies, hip instability, femoroacetabular impingement, extraarticular&#xD;
      lesions, synovial abnormalities, ruptured ligamentum teres, osteonecrosis, and&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis. With this increased rate of hip arthroscopy has come an&#xD;
      interest in adequate postoperative pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of strategies to improve post-operative orthopedic pain management. One&#xD;
      common technique is the femoral block, during which a patient receives an ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      injection of local analgesia administered in close proximity to the nerve. In the hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy setting, postoperative femoral nerve blocks have been shown to significantly&#xD;
      decrease pain, reduce opioid related symptoms like nausea, and have higher pain satisfaction&#xD;
      scores than patients using only morphine. However, this option can be costly as it is a&#xD;
      separate procedure billed by the anesthesiologist. Regional nerve blocks also carry the risk&#xD;
      of residual parasthesia and permanent nerve damage, however rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to circumvent these limitations is through local infiltration analgesia (LIA), a&#xD;
      technique that has been described for post-operative pain management in orthopedic modalities&#xD;
      like total knee arthroscopy (TKA) and total hip arthroscopy (THA). Injection of analgesic&#xD;
      directly to the surgical site can easily be incorporated as a brief step in the surgical&#xD;
      procedure at a minimal cost to the patient. In THA and TKA, LIA has resulted in promising&#xD;
      decreases in pain and opioid consumption. However, interpretation of these results in the&#xD;
      context of hip arthroscopy has been confounded by the fundamental differences between THA/TKA&#xD;
      and hip arthroscopy, the array of different strategies used in LIA (eg. continuous&#xD;
      infiltration via a catheter vs. a single shot), and a lack of placebo or control group, and&#xD;
      the specific location of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of hip arthroscopy, a previous group tested intra-portal injections with mixed&#xD;
      results. LIA targeting the highly innervated hip capsule, which is cut to access the joint&#xD;
      during arthroscopy, may be more efficacious at limiting postoperative pain. LIA injection&#xD;
      into the hip capsule can occur under direct visualization after capsular repair. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, no studies have assessed the outcomes of this extracapsular LIA technique in the&#xD;
      hip arthroscopy setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documented risks involved with LIA are limited to the continuous infiltration via catheter.&#xD;
      This approach has the risk of infection at the catheter site as well as cartilage damage. Our&#xD;
      proposed technique avoids use of catheters and associated infection. The proposed single dose&#xD;
      of 0.25% 20mL bupivacaine epinephrine a fraction of the dosages used in previous LIA studies&#xD;
      to avoid chondral damage.&#xD;
