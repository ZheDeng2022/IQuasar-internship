  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent worldwide and the leading cause of mortality of&#xD;
      citizens, external counter pulsation (ECP) has been elucidated that it may release angina&#xD;
      symptoms and improve the prognosis of CAD, however, no multi-center control clinical study&#xD;
      has been reported for further recommendation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of ECP on CAD. To address this assumption, investigators enroll participants with stable CAD&#xD;
      and randomize them into control or ECP group, the ECP intervention will be carried out with a&#xD;
      standard protocol which involves 35 one-hour sessions (5 days a week) for continuous 7 weeks,&#xD;
      and the follow-up will last for 1 year. The primary endpoint is the 1-year composite&#xD;
      cardiovascular events (CCE), secondary endpoints include frequency of angina pectoris, heart&#xD;
      function, biomarkers of arteriosclerosis, exercise tolerance and endothelial function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAD is the leading cause of non-tumor mortality in most countries, ECP is a non-invasive&#xD;
      method which consists of three sets of pneumatic cuffs attached to each of the patient's legs&#xD;
      at the calf and lower and upper thigh. The inflation of the cuffs is triggered by a computer,&#xD;
      and timing of the inflation is based on the R wave of the electrocardiogram. The ECP&#xD;
      therapist adjusts the inflation and deflation timing to provide optimal blood movement per a&#xD;
      finger plethysmogram waveform reading. This produces a retrograde flow of blood in the aorta&#xD;
      resulting in a diastolic augmentation of blood flow and also an increase in venous return,&#xD;
      which leads to an improved coronary perfusion pressure during diastole. Cumulative evidences&#xD;
      demonstrate that ECP can improve life quality and release refractory angina which is not&#xD;
      optimally controlled despite optimal medical management and coronary revascularization in&#xD;
      patients with CAD, though the previous multi-center control trial (PROBE-EECP) had been&#xD;
      designed, no result about the effect of ECP on the prognosis of CAD has been reported. Thus,&#xD;
      this study is designed to enroll 380 participants with stable CAD after evaluation of&#xD;
      frequency of angina pectoris, heart function, biomarkers of arteriosclerosis, exercise&#xD;
      tolerance and endothelial function, participants will be randomized into ECP intervention&#xD;
      group or control group. All participants receive Guideline-driven standard medical treatment,&#xD;
      ECP will be carried out with a standard protocol which involves 35 one-hour sessions (5 days&#xD;
      a week) for continuous 7 weeks. Up to the end of ECP intervention, CCE will be follow up to 1&#xD;
      year, meanwhile, items as above will be retested for comparison.&#xD;
