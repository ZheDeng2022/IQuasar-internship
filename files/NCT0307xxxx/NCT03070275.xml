      Systemically healthy volunteers with no active periodontal disease are recruited from&#xD;
      referrals to the Dept. of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Biology of Implants,&#xD;
      Aristotle Univ of Thessaloniki for implant therapy. After signing a consent form,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into two treatment groups. Group-A (NA=10) will receive&#xD;
      crestal placement of implants following a two-stage protocol in combination with a biocomplex&#xD;
      comprising autologous alveolar bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived&#xD;
      reagents, produced in clean room facilities and seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with&#xD;
      autologous fibrin glue. In Group-B (NB=10) implants are placed on the alveolar crest&#xD;
      following a two-stage protocol and the manufacturer's guidelines. Intra-surgical clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic assessments are performed at the time of implant placement (T0) and at the&#xD;
      two-stage surgery (T1). Changes in mucosa thickness, width of keratinized tissues, marginal&#xD;
      bone and bone thickness at the surgical site will be determined at T0-T1. Groups will be&#xD;
      further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical site at T0&#xD;
      [thin mucosa (≤2.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (&gt;2.5mm) for Groups-AII/-BII]. A linear&#xD;
      mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine changes in the&#xD;
      dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two stage-implants placed either&#xD;
      conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex.&#xD;

      Aims &amp; Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study describes a novel method to preserve the crestal bone at two-stage dental&#xD;
      implants using autologous aBMMSCs, free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room&#xD;
      facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded into commercially available&#xD;
      collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece) that are stabilized over the implant platform upon&#xD;
      surgical implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel method based on histotechnology in crestal&#xD;
      bone preservation at two-stage dental implants, as compared to conventional surgical implant&#xD;
      placement following the manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary, changes in the peri-implant soft tissues will be also determined between implant&#xD;
      placement and exposure and will be compared between the experimental and the conventional&#xD;
      surgical treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will be derived from alveolar bone marrow of the alveolar bone under local&#xD;
      anaesthesia in each patient belonging to the Experimental Group (Group-A). Briefly, after a&#xD;
      thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill&#xD;
      will be performed in the alveolar bone of an intraoral edentulous site other than the implant&#xD;
      site and a 2x8 mm or 3cc approximately of an osseous core will be harvested. The area and the&#xD;
      biopsy will be copiously irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to&#xD;
      achieve primary closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in&#xD;
      sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece&#xD;
      (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict&#xD;
      clinical grade expansion protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013; Bakopoulou et al. in preparation).&#xD;
      Since MSCs will be isolated and expanded in vitro in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant&#xD;
      clean rooms (Biohellenika facilities) meeting the quality guidelines set by the European&#xD;
      Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for autologous&#xD;
      transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy applications.&#xD;
      In Biohellenika facilities, 40ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject in&#xD;
      Group-A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the isolation&#xD;
      and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin glue will&#xD;
      be used to load the BM-MSCs onto a commercially available collagen fleece. At the day of the&#xD;
      surgical placement of the implants and chairside, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched&#xD;
      with fibrin glue) will be delivered in an insulin syringe containing 10x10E6 cells/200μl&#xD;
      fibrin and will be gently loaded onto the collagen fleece and activated with the addition of&#xD;
      CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex will be sutured onto the lingual flap using bioresorbable&#xD;
      sutures (5-0 Coated VicrylTM (polyglactin 910), reverse cutting 3/8 circle - 16mm, Ethicon,&#xD;
      Johnson &amp; Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and will be thus gently stabilized over the&#xD;
      implant platform head partially covering the buccal bone. Handling of the scaffold will be&#xD;
      done with care to avoid doing any harm to the viable cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Control Group (Group-B), the implants will be placed crestally following the&#xD;
      manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting materials. One system of&#xD;
      implants will be consistently used throughout the study in both groups (Osseotite, Certain,&#xD;
      parallel wall, Biomet 3i, Palm Beach Gardens, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end&#xD;
      of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for 5 days)&#xD;
      will be prescribed to both Groups. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      twice daily and avoid brushing and chewing hard in the treated area for two weeks. During&#xD;
      this 2-week period, patients will be followed on a weekly basis to record uneventful healing,&#xD;
      and after that patients will discontinue rinsing with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral&#xD;
      hygiene. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three to four months to have their implants&#xD;
      exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at baseline (T0: surgical implant placement) and T1 (implant&#xD;
      exposure at 3-4 months). Clinical recordings will be determined by a single calibrated&#xD;
      examiner using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA)&#xD;
      with an endo-stop attached on it and all measurements will be digitalised using an electronic&#xD;
      caliper. A customised metallic caliper will measure the thickness of the bone at the&#xD;
      buccal/lingual aspects of the implant. At T0 and T1, clinical recordings will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thickness of mucosa at the top of the alveolar ridge and 2- and 4mm apically, on the&#xD;
           buccal and the lingual aspects of the ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Width of keratinized mucosa buccally and lingually of the implantation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thickness of buccal and lingual bone at 0, 3- and 6mm from the implant shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Level of of the buccal and lingual marginal bone, in relation to the implant shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardised digital radiographs will be collected at T0 and T1 to linearly determine changes&#xD;
      (in mm) in the height of the alveolar bone between the implant shoulder and teh alveolar&#xD;
      crest using the VixWin™ Platinum|Gendex software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups will be further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical&#xD;
      site at T0 [thin mucosa (≤2.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (&gt;2.5mm) for&#xD;
      Groups-AII/-BII] and all the parameters will be determined and compared on the basis of the&#xD;
      surgical approach and mucosa thickness at the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine&#xD;
      changes in the dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two&#xD;
      stage-implants placed either conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex.&#xD;
