      One hundred and twenty patients will be randomized to Interscalene block or Paracoracoid&#xD;
      Subscapularis plane block. The study will evaluate the efficacy and duration of blocks in the&#xD;
      2 groups with regards to postoperative analgesia and degree of respiratory depression.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain after arthroscopic shoulder surgery can be severe in 30- 70% of the&#xD;
      patients in the first twenty-four to forty-eight post-operative hours . Single injection&#xD;
      interscalene block (ISB) is commonly offered to decrease postoperative pain following&#xD;
      shoulder surgery with many associated benefits like reduced opioid consumption, nausea and&#xD;
      decreased Postoperative Acute Care Unit (PACU) stay. The adverse events of the ISB may be&#xD;
      reduced with ultrasound guidance but are not completely eliminated. One of the major concerns&#xD;
      is the phrenic nerve involvement resulting in diaphragm paresis, which has major implication&#xD;
      in patients with respiratory compromise. One of the alternatives is blockade of the&#xD;
      suprascapular nerve in the suprascapular fossa and the axillary nerve as it curves around the&#xD;
      humeral neck. Although researchers from Australia have reported a good outcome with it an&#xD;
      earlier study done by us had a suboptimal effect (102994), possibly because the nerves were&#xD;
      blocked after the articular branches had exited the main trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are studies currently ongoing with blocks being done more proximally in our center but&#xD;
      that requires 2 injections. The investigators did an anatomical study on Fresh frozen&#xD;
      cadavers and noted that drugs delivered superficial to the Fascia of Subscapularis muscles&#xD;
      stains the Axillary Nerve, Upper subscapular nerve and possibly suprascapular nerve before it&#xD;
      enters the suprascapular fossa&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent to which the two techniques differ in terms of overall analgesia has not been&#xD;
      evaluated. With this background, The investigators want to compare the analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      interscalene block versus Paracoracoid Subscapularis plane block when combined with&#xD;
      superficial cervical plexus block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the paracoracoid&#xD;
      subscapularis plane block with interscalene block to control pain after arthroscopic shoulder&#xD;
      surgery. The primary outcome will be duration of analgesia provided by the regional blocks.&#xD;
      The duration is defined as the time from the end of injection of local anesthetic to the time&#xD;
      when patient requests rescue analgesia (pain score greater than 6 out of 10). The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include measurement of degree of respiratory depression via Pulmonary Function Test&#xD;
      and ultrasound assessment of diaphragmatic function, first 24 and 48th hour pain scores, time&#xD;
      needed to perform each type of block, and post-operative opioid requirement (24 hour&#xD;
      analgesic consumption) and the failure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracoracoid Subscapularis plane block results in comparable analgesia to interscalene blocks&#xD;
      sparing the Phrenic nerve&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Paracoracoid Subscapularis Plane block results in better preserved diaphragm function&#xD;
           compared to interscalene block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The failure rate is similar between the two groups (null hypothesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The postoperative opioid consumption is similar between the 2 groups (null hypothesis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After institutional approval and informed consent, 120, patients of either sex belonging to&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthetists (ASA) physical status 1 to 3 scheduled for elective&#xD;
      arthroscopic shoulder surgery will be included in the study. Patients receiving chronic&#xD;
      narcotic therapy, patients with major respiratory morbidity, morbid obesity or patients with&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathies and who cannot provide an informed consent will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. Patients will be educated regarding the numerical rating score (NRS) on a scale of 0&#xD;
      to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain ever experienced and their preoperative NRS&#xD;
      scores will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of 2 groups using a web based randomization. All&#xD;
      procedures will be done in the block room using sterile precautions, standard monitors and&#xD;
      intravenous sedation as per the standard practice at our hospital. The baseline respiratory&#xD;
      function will be measured with bedside spirometry, which will be repeated at 3 time points:&#xD;
      Pre block, 20 minutes post block and about 60 minutes after arrival in the PACU post-surgery.&#xD;
      Patients diaphragm thickness will be measured on both sides of the chest, with the patient&#xD;
      seated, at the anterior axillary line using a high frequency linear probe positioned&#xD;
      vertically and the position of the probe will be marked on the skin on both sides to ensure&#xD;
      comparable measurements. Patients will be asked to take a big breath 3 times+/-sniffs and&#xD;
      loops of diaphragm movements will be recorded on the ultrasound machine. The point where the&#xD;
      diaphragm peels off from the chest wall will be noted on the ultrasound and the thickness of&#xD;
      the diaphragm will be measured using the caliper available on the US machine. The thickness&#xD;
      will be averaged out between 3 measurements. These measurements will be repeated on the&#xD;
      contralateral side. Once this is completed, patients will be connected to the standard&#xD;
      monitors (EKG, Pulse oximetry and NIBP) and they will receive supplemental oxygen. All&#xD;
      patients will receive titrated doses of intravenous fentanyl and midazolam for conscious&#xD;
      sedation as per the standard practice at our institution. All patients will be positioned&#xD;
      supine with 45 degree head up tilt with a rolled blanket under the ipsilateral side to allow&#xD;
      slight rotation to the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive interscalene block with 15mL of ropivacaine 0.5% at the level of C6&#xD;
      ventral ramus as identified with the 7-12MHz linear probe positioned horizontally.&#xD;
      Neurostimulation with 0.6mA should result in contractions of the deltoid and biceps. A total&#xD;
      of 15mL will be injected with repeated aspirations to rule out intravascular placement of the&#xD;
      needle tip. Once this is done, the needle tip will be moved to the lateral edge of&#xD;
      sternocleidomastoid muscle and additional 3mL of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected between&#xD;
      the deep fascia of the sternocleidomastoid and deep investing fascia of the neck (superficial&#xD;
      cervical plexus block SCP). The start and finish time will be recorded. In addition, probe&#xD;
      will be moved similar to the group two and skin infiltration with saline will be done to&#xD;
      blind the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive paracoracoid subscapularis plane block with the ultrasound probe&#xD;
      positioned on the head of the humerus in the sagittal plane. The probe is then moved medial&#xD;
      to locate the coracoid process. Pectoralis major, pectoralis minor and subscapularis muscle&#xD;
      in the scapular fossa are identified. Using a 50mm 22G block needle 15ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine&#xD;
      will be deposited anterior to the fascia of subscapularis muscle after eliciting a motor&#xD;
      response with 0.6mA current delivered through the needle. Following this, superficial&#xD;
      cervical plexus block will be done using 3mL of 0.5% ropivacaine similar to group 1. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a small band-aid in the 2 locations of possible needle entry to blind&#xD;
      the observer to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent observer will document the motor and sensory block 20 minutes after the block&#xD;
      injection is completed for each group. Patients will then have a bedside spirometry repeated.&#xD;
      They will be in the sitting position. Ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm will be done&#xD;
      bilaterally at the anterior axillary line posteriorly positioning the probe exactly where it&#xD;
      had been marked pre-block. The thickness of the diaphragm will be assessed using an average&#xD;
      from three deep inspirations/sniffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of block performance, number of attempts for block and the time for the onset&#xD;
      of sensory block will be recorded after the performance of the block, by a blinded observer.&#xD;
      The failure rate of nerve block will be determined by the blinded observer at 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients with failed blocks will be excluded from the efficacy part of the study. After&#xD;
      performance of the blocks, the patient will be moved to the operating room for the surgery&#xD;
      under general anesthesia according to the choice of the anesthesiologist (LMA vs.&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation) using fentanyl 2-3µg/Kg, propofol 2 mg/kg followed by maintenance&#xD;
      with desflurane/sevoflurane in air-oxygen mixture. Vasopressors and opioids will be&#xD;
      administered as needed titrated to the clinical effect. Total dose of narcotic used will be&#xD;
      recorded. The patients will be assessed for the site and severity of pain at rest and&#xD;
      movement after arrival in the PACU and at 2 hourly intervals till discharge from PACU.&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with a diary to document pain scores every 6 hourly thereafter&#xD;
      until 24 hours after their time of arrival in PACU (time 0). Patients will be contacted by&#xD;
      one of the investigators to ensure that their pain is well controlled and to get their pain&#xD;
      scores and ongoing narcotic consumption at 9PM day of surgery and at 7AM on postoperative day&#xD;
      1. They will be reminded to fill in the data sheet and to mail it back to us. The&#xD;
      investigators will inquire about the precise time point of when the block wore off. The&#xD;
      investigators will also seek information about persisting neurological deficits at the 7AM&#xD;
      call. If pain is severe (&gt;7/10) on arrival to PACU, it will be defined as failure of the&#xD;
      technique and they will be given intravenous hydromorphone 0.2-0.4mg titrated to effect in&#xD;
      the PACU. An emergency telephone number will be provided in case of any medical problems&#xD;
      until 24 h after performance of the blocks. All patients will be followed up 24 and 48 hours&#xD;
      later to find out if there are any persisting neurological deficits as per the standard&#xD;
      practice at our institution. The investigator at this point will collect data regarding&#xD;
      duration of block, time to first rescue analgesia, total analgesic requirement and occurrence&#xD;
      of any complications related to nerve block. Patients will be given instructions during this&#xD;
      call to contact us if they develop new onset neurological deficits/symptoms in the following&#xD;
      4 weeks. Patient satisfaction will be documented at 24 hours on a visual analogue scale where&#xD;
      0 is totally dissatisfied and 100 is totally satisfied. The total participation time for the&#xD;
      patients is for 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented as the mean +/- SD and median (min, max) for all continuous data&#xD;
      including duration in hours, respiratory function, pain, and patient satisfaction at all time&#xD;
      points for both groups. Statistical comparisons between-group will be made using an ANCOVA&#xD;
      where block group is the fixed effect, the endpoint is the dependent variable and the&#xD;
      pre-block score is the covariate. This will produce an adjusted mean between-group difference&#xD;
      with 95%CI. The adjustment by pre-block score will also providing a more precise estimate of&#xD;
      the effect. If the lower boundary of the 95%CI from the adjusted mean difference for duration&#xD;
      is greater than 2 hours the investigator will declare that the SPB is superior to the ISB.&#xD;
      Because it will be of interest to institutions in terms of resource use and cost, the&#xD;
      procedure-related data like time to administer each block, time to sensory onset, total&#xD;
      narcotic dose, and number of attempts will be presented using mean +/-SD, median (min, max)&#xD;
      and mean difference with 95%CI. Nominal data like failure rate and complications will be&#xD;
      described using proportions. Site and severity of pain at rest and with movement will be&#xD;
      presented using line graphs to support hypothetical expected locations of pain given what the&#xD;
      investigator know about anatomical innervation related to the type of block administered.&#xD;
