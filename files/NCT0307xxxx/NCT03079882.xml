  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten percent of American adults, more than 20 million people, have chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
      which in the advanced state of end stage renal disease is most desirably and cost-effectively&#xD;
      treated by kidney transplantation. However, 20-30% of transplanted kidneys fail in living&#xD;
      recipients by 10 years, owing largely to insufficient monitoring methods. The goal of the&#xD;
      proposed research is to improve noninvasive kidney transplant monitoring using a new&#xD;
      ultrasound-based imaging method called Viscoelastic Response (VisR) ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is the most desirable and cost effective treatment for end stage renal&#xD;
      disease, but 20-30% of allografts fail in living recipients by 10 years, and prolonging graft&#xD;
      health is one of the major unmet needs for transplant patients. Although graft health is&#xD;
      extended by preemptive treatments that prevent irreversible damage, intervention is&#xD;
      inadequately motivated by current transplant monitoring methods. Noninvasive methods,&#xD;
      including changes in serial serum creatinine levels, lack sensitivity and specificity. In the&#xD;
      absence of reliable noninvasive biomarkers, invasive biopsy remains the standard for&#xD;
      assessing transplant health, but surveillance or &quot;protocol&quot; biopsies are associated with&#xD;
      morbidity and cost and are therefore controversial in stable, unsensitized patients. The lack&#xD;
      of a demonstrated, noninvasive biomarker for allograft health - one that identifies early&#xD;
      graft degeneration with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to motivate appropriate biopsy&#xD;
      and enable timely intervention - represents a major gap in renal transplant management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fill this gap, the proposed re-search aims to demonstrate Viscoelastic Response (VisR)&#xD;
      ultrasound, a novel acoustic radiation force (ARF)-based technology that noninvasively&#xD;
      interrogates the viscoelastic properties of tissue, for monitoring renal allograft health.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in vivo VisR ultrasound delineates renal allograft&#xD;
      dysfunction earlier and with greater sensitivity and specificity than serum creatinine&#xD;
      concentration in renal allograft recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will determine which VisR outcome metrics detect&#xD;
      renal allograft dysfunction clinically by performing serial VisR imaging in living donor (LD)&#xD;
      and deceased donor (DD) transplant recipients. Imaging results will be compared to biopsy&#xD;
      findings to determine VisR's ability to detect dysfunction. The investigators will also&#xD;
      compare serial VisR and serum creatinine outcomes in terms of ability to detect renal&#xD;
      allograft dysfunction and the timeliness of detection.&#xD;

        This unblinded, open-label, exploratory study will be conducted in 100 consecutively&#xD;
        evaluable patients (50 with renal allografts from living donors and 50 with allografts from&#xD;
        deceased donors). Patients will be recruited from those already undergoing renal transplant&#xD;
        surgery for end stage renal disease based on the standard of care at UNC Hospitals.&#xD;
        Potential study participants will be patients 18 years of age or older who have been&#xD;
        selected by their treating physician to be in need of renal transplant surgery for end&#xD;
        stage renal disease at University of North Carolina Hospitals' Nephrology Transplant&#xD;
        clinic. Participants will be enrolled in two groups, as living or deceased donor&#xD;
        recipients. There will be no intervention beyond VisR ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
