    <textblock>
      GAPcare (Geriatric Acute &amp; Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention) is an&#xD;
      early stage investigation that surveys older adults who present to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      for any illness to determine the feasibility of an Emergency Department (ED)-based&#xD;
      multidisciplinary intervention for preventing recurrent falls in older adults. In this&#xD;
      observational study, older adults will be approached during routine clinical care in the ED&#xD;
      and asked about prior falls, prior experiences having falls treated in the inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient setting, and the investigators will solicit feedback on potential improvement to&#xD;
      care in the ED setting for falls.&#xD;
