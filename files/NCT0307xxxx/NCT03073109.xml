    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to describe the outcomes related to physical activity, activity of&#xD;
      disease, quality of life, work productivity and safety in Latin-American patients with&#xD;
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) treated with tofacitinib or biological DMARDs after failure to&#xD;
      respond to conventional DMARDs in real-life conditions. This will be a non-interventional,&#xD;
      hybrid study (prospective and retrospective data collection) comparing tofacitinib to&#xD;
      biologic DMARD treatments in patients with RA after failure of conventional DMARDs. The&#xD;
      population will be composed by adult patients over 18 years of age diagnosed with RA and who&#xD;
      have been prescribed tofacitinib or any biological DMARDs.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) Score at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Disease activity was assessed using RAPID3, which was based on participant-reported multi-dimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ). RAPID3 included 3 core data set measures of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate. Physical function=mean of scores from 10 individual questions on activities of daily living (each question scored from '0'=no difficulty to '3'=much difficulty), scores were transformed to give a total score=0 to 10, higher scores=greater difficulty. Pain and global estimate of health measured on Likert scale from '0'=no pain/feeling very well to '10'=pain as bad as it could be/ feeling very poorly, higher scores=greater difficulty/ worsening of condition. RAPID3 composite score: mean of physical function, pain, and global assessment scores, ranging from 0 to 10, higher values=greater disease activity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adapted Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status of participants was assessed using adapted HAQ-DI. Adapted HAQ-DI is a participant-reported questionnaire for the assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities due to rheumatoid arthritis: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by total number of domains answered. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty, higher scores indicating worse functioning. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life- 5 Dimension-3 Levels (EQ-5D-3L) Index Score at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, participant-administered measure of self-reported health outcomes. It consists of two parts: EQ-5D index score (Part I) and the EQ-VAS (Part II). For Part I, i.e. EQ-5D-3L index score, participants rated their current health state on 5 single-item dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with each dimension having three levels of measure: 1= no problems, 2= some problems and 3= extreme problems. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total index score range of 0 to 1.00; higher scores indicating a better health state. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI:RA) Scores at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>WPAI-RA: 6-questions participant rated questionnaire that measures effect of participant's RA on general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities. Consisted of 6 questions, a binary question on current employment, 3 questions on hours of work and work-loss, and 2 questions based on 0-10 point scale to judge how RA affected productivity at work and outside of work (0 = no effect on work and 10 = completely prevented from working). It yielded four sub-scores: percent work time missed due to health (absenteeism), percent impairment while working (presenteeism), percent overall work impairment due to health (work productivity loss) and percent activity impairment due to health (daily activity impairment/loss). Sub-scores were expressed as an impairment percentage range from 0 to 100, where 0 = no impairment, 100 = completely impaired, higher scores=greater impairment and less productivity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted and unadjusted mean.</description>

    <measure>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-joints Count (DAS28) at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints and painful joints using the 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (measured in millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment of disease activity according to 100-millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores=worsening of condition). DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. DAS28 scores ranged from 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted and unadjusted mean.</description>

        <description>Disease activity was assessed using RAPID3, which was based on participant-reported multi-dimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ). RAPID3 included 3 core data set measures of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate. Physical function=mean of scores from 10 individual questions on activities of daily living (each question scored from '0'=no difficulty to '3'=much difficulty), scores were transformed to give a total score=0 to 10, higher scores=greater difficulty. Pain and global estimate of health measured on Likert scale from '0'=no pain/feeling very well to '10'=pain as bad as it could be/ feeling very poorly, higher scores=greater difficulty/ worsening of condition. RAPID3 composite score: mean of physical function, pain, and global assessment scores, ranging from 0 to 10, higher values=greater disease activity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

        <title>Adapted Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>Functional status of participants was assessed using adapted HAQ-DI. Adapted HAQ-DI is a participant-reported questionnaire for the assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities due to rheumatoid arthritis: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by total number of domains answered. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty, higher scores indicating worse functioning. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

          <description>Functional status of participants was assessed using adapted HAQ-DI. Adapted HAQ-DI is a participant-reported questionnaire for the assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities due to rheumatoid arthritis: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3, where 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by total number of domains answered. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 3, where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty, higher scores indicating worse functioning. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, participant-administered measure of self-reported health outcomes. It consists of two parts: EQ-5D index score (Part I) and the EQ-VAS (Part II). For Part I, i.e. EQ-5D-3L index score, participants rated their current health state on 5 single-item dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression with each dimension having three levels of measure: 1= no problems, 2= some problems and 3= extreme problems. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total index score range of 0 to 1.00; higher scores indicating a better health state. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted (consider impact of co-variables) and unadjusted mean (does not consider co-variables impact).</description>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI:RA) Scores at Month 6</title>
        <description>WPAI-RA: 6-questions participant rated questionnaire that measures effect of participant's RA on general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities. Consisted of 6 questions, a binary question on current employment, 3 questions on hours of work and work-loss, and 2 questions based on 0-10 point scale to judge how RA affected productivity at work and outside of work (0 = no effect on work and 10 = completely prevented from working). It yielded four sub-scores: percent work time missed due to health (absenteeism), percent impairment while working (presenteeism), percent overall work impairment due to health (work productivity loss) and percent activity impairment due to health (daily activity impairment/loss). Sub-scores were expressed as an impairment percentage range from 0 to 100, where 0 = no impairment, 100 = completely impaired, higher scores=greater impairment and less productivity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted and unadjusted mean.</description>

            <description>Participants with RA treated with tofacitinib after failure of conventional DMARDs were assessed for patient-reported outcomes in this study. Data for these participants was collected for approximately 2.5 years (from 15 March 2017 to 16 September 2019) and participants were followed up to 6 months. The co-variables considered for adjusted mean were participant access, years since diagnosis, age, chloroquine concomitant, interruption of treatment, time to supply, access limitation, neutrophils, start treatment, methotrexate concomitant and chloroquine concomitant.</description>

        <description>WPAI-RA: 6-questions participant rated questionnaire that measures effect of participant's RA on general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities. Consisted of 6 questions, a binary question on current employment, 3 questions on hours of work and work-loss, and 2 questions based on 0-10 point scale to judge how RA affected productivity at work and outside of work (0 = no effect on work and 10 = completely prevented from working). It yielded four sub-scores: percent work time missed due to health (absenteeism), percent impairment while working (presenteeism), percent overall work impairment due to health (work productivity loss) and percent activity impairment due to health (daily activity impairment/loss). Sub-scores were expressed as an impairment percentage range from 0 to 100, where 0 = no impairment, 100 = completely impaired, higher numbers=greater impairment and less productivity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted and unadjusted mean.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on participants included in the study. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' = only those participants who had data available for this OM. 'Number analyzed' = participants evaluable for this OM at specified categories.</population>

        <title>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-joints Count (DAS28) at Month 6</title>
        <description>DAS28 calculated from the number of swollen joints and painful joints using the 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (measured in millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment of disease activity according to 100-millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores=worsening of condition). DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. DAS28 scores ranged from 0 to 10; higher scores indicated greater affectation due to disease activity. Data has been provided in terms of adjusted and unadjusted mean.</description>
