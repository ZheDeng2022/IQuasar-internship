  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent and disabling disease, that affects mostly women and its&#xD;
      main characteristic is chronic pain. Several studies have shown that hydrotherapy is&#xD;
      effective in the improvement of symptoms and quality of life of this population; other&#xD;
      studies have shown that Pain Therapeutic Education (PTE) is also effective in this sense. PTE&#xD;
      is one cheap, easy to apply intervention, with very positive results in chronic pain&#xD;
      situations. However, there is a lack of studies that have shown the effects of this&#xD;
      intervention on FM. Hence, this study will aim to verify the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      hydrotherapy and PTE on women with FM. Sixty women will be randomly allocated in two groups:&#xD;
      hydrotherapy and hydrotherapy + PTE. Before treatment start, the investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      pain (visual analogue scale, presence of myofascial trigger points and pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold over the scalene, upper trapezius, infraspinatus, piriformis, iliopsoas and soleus,&#xD;
      bilaterally), quality of life (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and medical outcomes study&#xD;
      36-item short-form health survey), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (Beck&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale). Hydrotherapy treatment will last 12 weeks. Women will be evaluated other 3 times:&#xD;
      after 6 and 12 weeks (treatment middle and end) and 12 weeks after treatment completion&#xD;
      (follow-up). Women in the hydrotherapy group will receive a folder with explanations on FM.&#xD;
      Women in the hydrotherapy + PTE will participate of 4 meetings over 12 treatment weeks, in&#xD;
      which themes like pain physiology, pain chronification and exacerbation and pain&#xD;
      self-management, as well as information on FM will be approached. Statistical analysis will&#xD;
      include qualitative and quantitative variable description. Correlation among variables will&#xD;
      also be analyzed. Level of significance will be set at 5%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will select at least 80 women with fibromyalgia (FM) for this study, in&#xD;
      which pain (through pressure pain threshold and number of active myofascial trigger points),&#xD;
      quality of life, FM impact on quality of life and function, depression, anxiety and quality&#xD;
      of sleep will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluating the volunteer, the participant will be randomly allocated to one of two&#xD;
      groups: hydrotherapy treatment (HT), and hydrotherapy treatment together with pain&#xD;
      therapeutic education (HT+PTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers will perform 12 weeks of hydrotherapy treatment, in which the investigators&#xD;
      will perform global exercises for upper and lower limbs and trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers in the HT+PTE group will receive, throughout the 12 weeks of HT, 4 sessions of&#xD;
      PTE, in which the investigators will teach pain neurophysiology, pain chronification and pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation sessions will take place before treatment, after 6 and 12 weeks of HT and after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment ending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all evaluations sessions, the investigators will collect data on those aspects previously&#xD;
      described.&#xD;

During the 12 weeks of hydrotherapy treatment, volunteers will also receive 4 sessions of Pain Therapeutic Education, which is also known as Pain Neuroscience Education, which involves patient education on pain neurophysiology, pain chronification and amplification mechanisms, and chronic pain management. These sessions will be performed in specific dates scheduled according to the volunteers' availability, and with intervals that can last from one to two weeks.</description>
