      1. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 1.1 Justification The purpose of the project is to examine the&#xD;
           effect of breathing biofeedback and thoughts about stress on performance under stress&#xD;
           and cigarette cravings. Smoking rates in the United States have been steadily going down&#xD;
           over the past 50 years, and now 16.8% of adults smoke (Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
           Prevention, 2015). Most smokers try to quit, but end up going back to smoking&#xD;
           (Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Piasecki, 2006; Rafful et al., 2013). The reasons people&#xD;
           go back to smoking may have something to do with stress in their lives, particularly for&#xD;
           women who smoke. This study wants to see if we can reduce temporary stress and lower&#xD;
           craving to smoke after stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Description of the Research Project Approximately 60 adult women will participate in&#xD;
           the study. Participants must be between 18 and 65 years old, able to read English&#xD;
           fluently, and must agree to engage in the research procedures (stress protocol,&#xD;
           physiological assessment, breathing training, questionnaires) to participate. People who&#xD;
           are taking medications that interfere with physiological assessment are excluded from&#xD;
           participating including people with: self-identified substance use problems,&#xD;
           self-identified psychosis, morbid obesity (BMI&gt;40), and people who take anti-cholinergic&#xD;
           medication, beta blockers, Ritalin, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants or&#xD;
           bupropion, varenicline, antipsychotic medication, or nicotine replacement therapy.&#xD;
           People who have a cardiac rhythm abnormality or major neurological problem are also&#xD;
           excluded from the study. Also, participants may not participate if they are pregnant or&#xD;
           color-blind. Participation is strictly voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PROGRESSION OF THIS STUDY 2.1 Procedures The study visit procedures will take place at&#xD;
           the Emotion and Psychopathology Laboratory at Rutgers University, located at the Rutgers&#xD;
           Institute for Health, Healthcare Policy, and Aging Research. Participants will first&#xD;
           complete some questionnaires and provide some basic information about themselves&#xD;
           (demographic information, responses to emotion and stress, and smoking history). Next,&#xD;
           participants will engage in a baseline psychophysiological assessment where&#xD;
           investigators will examine heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure. Next,&#xD;
           investigators will either ask participants to sit quietly for 30 minutes while&#xD;
           completing a computer task and watching short videos, or practice a specific deep&#xD;
           breathing exercise for 30 minutes. Then participants will do three tasks on a computer.&#xD;
           The tasks will ask participants to trace different shapes, answer math problems while&#xD;
           receiving feedback about how they're doing, and identify colors and words on a screen.&#xD;
           Finally, participants will be asked to sit quietly for 15 minutes before investigators&#xD;
           remove the psychophysiological recording equipment. One week after the study visit,&#xD;
           investigators will contact participants via phone to ask them some questions about the&#xD;
           study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Duration of the study This study visit will last approximately 3 hours. Length of the&#xD;
      visit may vary because each individual may complete procedures at a different pace. The phone&#xD;
      call after the study visit will last approximately 10-15 minutes.&#xD;

      Objectives Aim 1: Examine the effect of using cognitive reappraisal and HRVb in a single&#xD;
      session on stress task performance. Investigators expect that participants assigned to&#xD;
      practice both cognitive reappraisal and HRVb will demonstrate greater cognitive performance&#xD;
      and persistence on stressful tasks during a laboratory visit in contrast to a control group&#xD;
      of female smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the effect of using cognitive reappraisal and HRVb on short-term HRV, craving,&#xD;
      and affect. Investigators expect that participants assigned to practice both cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal and HRVb will exhibit the greatest HRV adaptations, and demonstrate less reactive&#xD;
      craving and affect by the end of the visit than participants randomized to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Background and Rationale Twenty percent of all deaths in the United States, or more than&#xD;
      480,000 deaths each year, are attributable to smoking (USDHHS, 2014). Cigarette smoking&#xD;
      remains the leading preventable cause of death, with 16.8% of adults currently smoking (CDC,&#xD;
      2015) and over 16 million Americans living with a smoking-related disease (USDHHS, 2014).&#xD;
      Smoking remains difficult to quit; even with the best available current treatments, quit&#xD;
      attempts are successful 35% of the time or less (Garrison &amp; Dugan, 2009). Smoking cessation&#xD;
      and relapse to smoking is by far the most frequent path of cigarette use for smokers&#xD;
      (Garcia-Rodriguez et al., 2013; Piasecki, 2006; Rafful et al., 2013). Stress has been&#xD;
      implicated as a primary mechanism in smoking relapse (McKee et al., 2003; Baer et al., 1989;&#xD;
      Cohen &amp; Lichtenstein, 1990), often triggering increases in negative affect (Shiffman, 2005;&#xD;
      Shiffman &amp; Waters, 2004) and exposing difficulties in emotion regulation (Farris, Zvolensky,&#xD;
      &amp; Schmidt, 2015). Evidence suggests that stress prospectively predicts smoking lapse&#xD;
      (Shiffman &amp; Waters, 2004) and lapses triggered by stress progress more quickly to relapse&#xD;
      (Shiffman et al., 1996), suggesting deficits in the ability to cope with stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, women's smoking habits show trends that are different from men's: reports have&#xD;
      shown that women consume more cigarettes than men (Hammond, 2009; Ng et al., 2014) and are&#xD;
      less likely to successfully quit smoking than men (Cepeda-Benito et al., 2004; Perkins, 2001;&#xD;
      Piper et al., 2010). While stress has been implicated in relapse for all smokers, recent&#xD;
      evidence indicates that stress is a principal factor in promoting relapse to smoking in&#xD;
      females, in part because women appear to be more strongly predisposed to stress responses&#xD;
      (Torres &amp; O'Dell, 2016). It is therefore likely that women are at particular risk for relapse&#xD;
      due to stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive reappraisal has demonstrated positive effects on stress responding and&#xD;
      smoking-related outcomes. Cognitive reappraisal is the reframing of a situation in order to&#xD;
      influence one's emotional response to it (Gross, 1998). Compared with acceptance and&#xD;
      suppression, reappraisal as measured by the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross &amp;&#xD;
      John, 2003) is associated with overall lower craving and negative affect during craving&#xD;
      inductions and stress tasks, as well as improved performance on a cognitive stress task&#xD;
      (Szasz, Szentagotai, &amp; Hofmann, 2012). Fucito, Juliano, and Toll (2010) found that frequent&#xD;
      reappraisal on the ERQ was cross-sectionally associated with smoking fewer cigarettes. Recent&#xD;
      evidence has indicated that reappraising stress-related arousal improves cognitive&#xD;
      performance and physiological reactivity (Jamieson et al., 2012; 2013). Evidence thus far&#xD;
      suggests that the use of cognitive reappraisal in particular as a self-regulation strategy&#xD;
      may have positive implications for smoking behavior, including cigarette craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRVb has also shown promising evidence on stress outcomes. Utilizing behavioral&#xD;
      self-regulation strategies such as heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVb) to increase&#xD;
      heart rate variability (HRV) shows promise in coping with stress. HRV is a measure of&#xD;
      fluctuation from the mean heart rate, representing the interaction between sympathetic and&#xD;
      parasympathetic influences on the cardiac system (Siepmann et al., 2008), and serving as a&#xD;
      biomarker of autonomic nervous system functioning (Zucker et al., 2009). HRV biofeedback&#xD;
      training aims to improve adaptability to and recovery from fight or flight situations by&#xD;
      increasing HRV (Gevirtz, 2013). A single session of HRVb improves adaptability to stress as&#xD;
      measured with improved cognitive performance in a lab-induced stress task (Prinsloo et al.,&#xD;
      2010). Several weeks of HRVb practice have shown reductions in substance craving (Penzlin et&#xD;
      al., 2015; Eddie et al., 2014) and food craving (Meule et al., 2012), although no studies to&#xD;
      date have examined the effect of a single session of HRVb practice on cigarette craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assesses whether combining a cognitive and behavioral approach to improve stress&#xD;
      responding in smokers may be especially efficacious. No other study to date has examined&#xD;
      examined potential additive benefits of combining both strategies. Combining both cognitive&#xD;
      and behavioral self-regulation skills for stress adaptation is consistent with&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral theory upon which evidence-based treatments for Axis I pathology were&#xD;
      developed, as behavioral (e.g., HRVb) and cognitive (e.g., reappraisal) approaches to&#xD;
      self-management allow the individual to target both internal and external stimuli when coping&#xD;
      with stress (Rokke &amp; Rehm, 2001). Beyond psychological effects of stress, the combination of&#xD;
      such approaches has implications for informing smoking cessation treatments, as it has been&#xD;
      previously noted that current treatments for substance addiction &quot;are failing to address&#xD;
      important factors that are active in sustaining [such] pathology, because phenomena that lead&#xD;
      to relapse... are mediated by physiological as well as cognitive processes&quot; (Eddie,&#xD;
      Vaschillo, Vaschillo, &amp; Lehrer, 2015, p. 266). In order to further improve cessation rates,&#xD;
      cognitive reappraisal instruction and HRVb can be incorporated at low cost into standard&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment, which currently consists of pharmacotherapy and smoking&#xD;
      cessation counseling according to the Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al., 2008). HRVb&#xD;
      technology ranges from free smartphone applications (e.g., Elite HRV) to sophisticated&#xD;
      devices available for purchase online (e.g. EmWave), making it an affordable and feasible&#xD;
      addition to enhance current smoking cessation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no studies to date have explored the effects of HRVb in a single session on smoking&#xD;
      craving, this study will be the first to address the potential use of a relatively new&#xD;
      technology for its short-term effects on variables that increase lapse risk, such as affect,&#xD;
      craving, and stress responding. This pilot study will assess the efficacy of practicing HRVb&#xD;
      using a device that is available to the general public that has not been previously tested&#xD;
      for its short-term effects on craving. Combining HRVb training prior to a stressful task,&#xD;
      followed by cognitive reappraisal during a task, has also never been explored for its&#xD;
      additive effects above the use of either strategy alone. Both strategies would allow for a&#xD;
      more comprehensive approach to managing stress responding, both cognitively and&#xD;
      physiologically. Moreover, promising research on self-regulatory strategies like cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal has not compared it with HRVb to assess relative efficacy in improving stress&#xD;
      responding, or in assessing its relative efficacy in improving smoking-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design This study is a single-session experimental trial using two&#xD;
           interventions (heart rate variability biofeedback and cognitive reappraisal of stress)&#xD;
           as independent variables and examining smoking craving, affect, and heart rate&#xD;
           variability as dependent variables. The laboratory visit includes a baseline&#xD;
           questionnaire, pre-test and post-test measures of smoking craving, affect, and heart&#xD;
           rate variability. Participants will be randomized to practice both interventions, or to&#xD;
           a control group that undergoes all procedures excluding the two interventions&#xD;
           (independent variables).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample Participants will consist of 60 English-speaking females ages 18-65. As this is&#xD;
           an experimental study with both between-subjects and within-subjects measurements, 60&#xD;
           participants will be sufficient for a power level of .8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement/Instrumentation Objective Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate variability will be measured as one of the primary outcome measures of this study.&#xD;
      As heart rate variability is susceptible to several other environmental and mental factors&#xD;
      that affect the sympathetic nervous system, additional measures need to be taken to ensure&#xD;
      the validity of the heart rate variability data. As secondary measures, blood pressure and&#xD;
      breath carbon monoxide will be recorded. Specifically, the following measures will be used&#xD;
      for data collection, all of which are non-invasive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV will be examined using electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
           measurement with Biopac Acqknowledge software. Electrodes will be placed on the torso of&#xD;
           each participant by a trained, same-sex research staff member in order to detect heart&#xD;
           rate, cardiac impedance, and respiration rate. HRV data cleaning will follow standard&#xD;
           guidelines (Bernston et al., 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Pressure (BP). An inflating arm cuff will be used to detect blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiration. To control for compensatory breathing that may lead to hyperventilation&#xD;
           when reducing breathing rate during biofeedback practice, respiration belts will be&#xD;
           attached around participants' ribcage to monitor breathing rate and tidal volume. 800mL&#xD;
           spirobag calibration will follow standard guidelines, asking participants to inflate and&#xD;
           deflate the bag five times in order to obtain an accurate estimate of tidal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carbon monoxide (CO). A standard carbon monoxide monitor will be used to detect carbon&#xD;
           monoxide levels in participants' breath, as an objective measure of cigarette smoking.&#xD;
           This will be used for eligibility purposes (establishing that participants are not light&#xD;
           smokers) and to ensure that participants have been abstinent from smoking for at least&#xD;
           12 hours prior to the start of the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation One of the interventions examined in this study is heart rate variability&#xD;
      biofeedback, which involves breathing at a slow and steady rate and receiving feedback from a&#xD;
      device about one's heart rate. The EmWave2® HRVb device (HeartMath®, Boulder Creek, Colorado)&#xD;
      will be used for HRVb practice and will serve as an additional measure of HRV for the HRVb&#xD;
      group. The EmWave2® device trains the user in HRVb and provides readings of HRV, time&#xD;
      elapsed, and varying levels of physiological coherence (Edwards, 2014). Repeated use of the&#xD;
      device has demonstrated clinically significant improvement in performance on tests of&#xD;
      executive functioning associated with emotional dysregulation (O'neill &amp; Findlay, 2014) and&#xD;
      statistically significant increases on measures of general health and mindfulness (Edwards,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Self-Report Measures After consenting procedures are complete, participants will be&#xD;
      directed to a website (Qualtrics) where they will complete a battery of baseline self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires. Qualtrics is an online-based, private research company that specializes in&#xD;
      data collection. All data entered through Qualtrics will be connected only to participants'&#xD;
      unique identifying numbers that will not be associated with any identifying information&#xD;
      (e.g., name or contact information). Participants will fill out self-report questionnaires&#xD;
      that assess demographic information, smoking history and behavior, clinical symptoms, emotion&#xD;
      regulation, and other mental health-related indices. (See Attachment 7 for the study&#xD;
      measures.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the following measures will be administered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics. General demographic information will be collected, including sex/gender,&#xD;
           age, height, weight, hormonal contraceptive use, menstruation pattern, sexual&#xD;
           orientation, race/ethnicity, education/career history, and mental health history.&#xD;
           Additionally, several items assessing DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa will be&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Timeline Followback (TLFB). The TLFB will be used to quantify daily smoking behavior&#xD;
           over the past 30 days, as a measure of smoking heaviness. It has demonstrated high&#xD;
           test-retest reliability for 30-day intervals in cigarette smokers (Robinson et al.,&#xD;
           2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). The FTND is among the most widely&#xD;
           used measures of nicotine dependence, with confirmed reliability in different settings&#xD;
           and populations that smoke cigarettes (Agrawal et al., 2011; Fagerstrom, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Reasons for Smoking Questionnaire (RFS). The RFS has been used for over 30 years to&#xD;
           assess smokers' motives for smoking, and has demonstrated good convergent validity and&#xD;
           internal consistency (Currie, 2004) and adequate test-retest reliability (Tate, Schmitz,&#xD;
           &amp; Stanton, 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The BDI-II is a 21-item measure of depression&#xD;
           that has demonstrated reliability and stability (Beck, Steer, et al., 1988; Beck, Steer,&#xD;
           &amp; Brown, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The ERQ is a validated measure of emotion&#xD;
           regulation strategies with good test-retest reliability (Gross &amp; John, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS is the most widely used measure of the&#xD;
           perception of stress, and was designed for use in community samples (Cohen, Kamarck &amp;&#xD;
           Mermelstein, 1983). Higher PSS scores are associated with failure to quit smoking,&#xD;
           greater vulnerability to depression, and more colds (Cohen et al. 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The GAD-7 is a brief, validated measure of&#xD;
           generalized anxiety with demonstrated reliability that has been recommended for clinical&#xD;
           practice and research (Spitzer et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Social Desirability Scale (SDS). The SDS-16 measures social desirability, which is&#xD;
           helpful in studies with objective and subjective outcomes with potential inconsistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The DERS will be used to measure&#xD;
           problems with emotion regulation within six domains: nonacceptance of emotional&#xD;
           responses, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, impulse control&#xD;
           difficulties, lack of emotion awareness, limited access to emotion regulation&#xD;
           strategies, and lack of emotion clarity. It has been shown to have good internal&#xD;
           consistency, validity, and test-retest reliability (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS). The RRS will be used to measure the degree to&#xD;
           which individuals respond in ruminative ways during depressed moods. It has been&#xD;
           demonstrated to have strong inter-item consistency (Treynor, Gonzalez, &amp; Nolen-Hoeksema,&#xD;
           2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Emotional Cascade Assessment Measure (ECAM). The ECAM will be used to measure how&#xD;
           individuals respond to upsetting situations, and the degree to which they engage in&#xD;
           emotional cascades (Selby &amp; Joiner, 2009). This measure is currently being validated in&#xD;
           our lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (EQ). The EQ will be used to assess&#xD;
           overconsumption of food as a response to emotional, cognitive, and social cues, as food&#xD;
           cravings and weight gain are common concerns for smokers who want to quit. Several&#xD;
           subscales have been shown to have adequate test-retest reliability, and the&#xD;
           disinhibition subscale predicts weight gain (Cuntz et al., 2001; Foster et al., 1998).&#xD;
           The cognitive restraint subscale has demonstrated construct validity (Karlsson et al.,&#xD;
           2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BDI-II includes an item that measures an individual's suicidality. If at any point a&#xD;
      participant indicates they are feeling significantly suicidal, a message will pop-up at the&#xD;
      end of the survey, informing the study staff of the individual's risk for high suicidality.&#xD;
      Study staff will then perform a brief assessment and intervention to determine if further&#xD;
      professional attention is required to keep the participant safe. (See &quot;Protection Against&#xD;
      Potential Risks&quot; and Appendix 2 for more detailed information.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Self-Report Measures At multiple points throughout the study, additional&#xD;
      self-report measures will be used to assess smoking craving and affect, which are the&#xD;
      subjective outcomes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a 20-item measure of affect that&#xD;
           has demonstrated test-retest reliability, as well as good convergent and divergent&#xD;
           validity (Watson, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Questionnaire on Smoking Urges-Brief (QSU-B; Cox, Tiffany, &amp; Christen, 2001) is a&#xD;
           10-item measure of smoking urges and cravings, where a higher score indicates a stronger&#xD;
           craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, several subscales of the Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM; Peacock &amp; Wong, 1989) will&#xD;
      be used as a manipulation check for the cognitive restructuring intervention. The SAM has&#xD;
      demonstrated reliability and good internal consistency of its subscales (Carpenter, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer Stress Tasks Participants will first have ten minutes to complete a Mirror Tracing&#xD;
      Task (MTT; Quinn, Brandon, &amp; Copeland, 1996) that measures persistence on a stressful task,&#xD;
      which is associated with nicotine dependence treatment outcome (Brandon et al., 2003) and can&#xD;
      distinguish cigarette smokers from non-smokers (Quinn et al., 1996). The MTT involves tracing&#xD;
      three shapes displayed on a computer screen, using the mouse of the computer screen. A&#xD;
      buzzing sound indicates whether the shape is being traced incorrectly. As the primary purpose&#xD;
      of this task in the study is to induce stress, participants will be instructed to complete&#xD;
      the task without the option of termination for ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, participants will complete the validated Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST; Dedovic&#xD;
      et al., 2005) which involves mental arithmetic with negative feedback from the investigator,&#xD;
      who will be a female member of study staff. The MIST was specifically designed for eliciting&#xD;
      psychosocial stress when participant movement is restricted and has demonstrated effects on&#xD;
      biological indices of stress, including cortisol (Dedovic et al., 2005) and brain areas&#xD;
      associated with the limbic system (Dedovic et al., 2009) and HPA axis (Zschucke et al.,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, a computerized Stroop task (Stroop, 1935) will be implemented to induce mental stress.&#xD;
      The Stoop task is a well-known and validated measure of mental stress and cognitive&#xD;
      performance that involves reading words and identifying colors on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Detailed study procedures Interested participants will complete a phone interview for&#xD;
      eligibility. Participants referred from the Tobacco Dependence Program will have provided a&#xD;
      breath carbon monoxide sample meeting eligibility criteria, which is at least 15ppm.&#xD;
      Participants recruited from other sources will be asked to provide a breath sample during a&#xD;
      5-minute visit to the laboratory in order to confirm smoking status at least one day prior to&#xD;
      the scheduled study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be scheduled for a 2.5-hour visit and asked to refrain from&#xD;
      alcohol, tobacco, or e-cigarette use for 12 hours prior to their appointment time. The study&#xD;
      visit will consist of a breath CO test to confirm tobacco abstinence in the past 12 hours&#xD;
      (indicated by a breath CO level of less than 10ppm. Evidence shows that daily smokers who&#xD;
      have not yet smoked the first cigarette of the day exhibit expired CO levels between 9 and&#xD;
      11ppm (Adan, Prat, &amp; Sanchez-Turet, 2004). Interested participants who are not CO-eligible&#xD;
      will be rescheduled for another study visit day. CO confirmation of study eligibility will be&#xD;
      followed by the informed consent process, and finally the completion of a baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire packet (detailed below). They will also be instrumented with the BioPac&#xD;
      psychophysiology stations by a trained female study staff member. They will then be asked to&#xD;
      conduct a baseline psychophysiological assessment for 10 minutes, which is done in order to&#xD;
      provide a comparison for the effects of the interventions and stress tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions, blocked by age and level of&#xD;
      motivation to quit smoking in the next 30 days. Participants ages 18-39 will be randomized&#xD;
      separately from participants ages 40-65. Blocking randomization by age group will reduce age&#xD;
      confounds within the sample of adult women, as age is correlated with smoking behavior and&#xD;
      heart rate variability (Zhang, 2007). Motivation to quit smoking in the next 30 days, on a&#xD;
      scale of 1-10, will be assessed in the initial phone interview to block randomization by&#xD;
      level of motivation to quit (1-5 versus 6-10). Participants will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of two study conditions reflecting the presence or absence of the interventions: 1) HRVb and&#xD;
      cognitive reappraisal instructions, or 2) Sitting quietly while engaging in a neutral control&#xD;
      task and no reappraisal instructions. HRVb will involve paced breathing as guided by a moving&#xD;
      light on a portable biofeedback device (described below). The neutral control tasks will&#xD;
      involve pressing a computer key whenever a shape appears on the computer screen, which will&#xD;
      occur approximately every minute. To maintain a neutral control condition for 30 minutes, a&#xD;
      neutral nature video will supplement the task to prevent significant participant boredom or&#xD;
      frustration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive reappraisal instructions will explain the function of the stress response as an&#xD;
      adaptation to effectively overcome challenges, following an example by Jamieson, Nock, and&#xD;
      Mendes (2012). Remaining study visit procedures are detailed in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debriefing Following the completion of computer tasks, 15 minute recovery period, and removal&#xD;
      of psychophysiological recording equipment, participants will be debriefed about the study&#xD;
      and its purposes. They also will be provided with a Debriefing/Resources Sheet with&#xD;
      information and contact information about mental health. Participants will then be&#xD;
      compensated for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff member will review the Resources Sheet with the individual and provide the&#xD;
      participant with a physical copy to take home with them. The Resource Sheet (attachment 9)&#xD;
      will include information on resources specific to Rutgers and central New Jersey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protections Against Potential Risks Every effort will be made to minimize any risks&#xD;
      associated with participation. Our procedures are generally non-invasive and pose little to&#xD;
      no physical risk to the participants. As such, the risks involved with participation in this&#xD;
      study are minor, though there are a few concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires. Some of the content of the questionnaires for this proposed project may&#xD;
           be distressing for participants to answer (e.g. questions about substance use,&#xD;
           self-injury, etc.), although risks from their use is likely to be uncommon as these&#xD;
           measures have commonly been used in previous studies without incident. Though distress&#xD;
           while answering questions from self-report measures is not extremely likely,&#xD;
           participants will be informed that they are not required to answer any questions that&#xD;
           they do not wish to answer, and that they may end their participation in the study at&#xD;
           any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suicide Risk. Although the risk of suicidal participants in this study is relatively&#xD;
           low, it is imperative that any participant identified at high suicide risk, when&#xD;
           answering the BDI-II during the study visit, be approached with appropriate evaluation&#xD;
           and intervention procedures. Participants whose risk is determined to be serious&#xD;
           (defined as endorsement of suicide plans or preparation, or imminent suicidal intent)&#xD;
           will be referred to appropriate mental health providers for suicidal crisis&#xD;
           intervention. If a participant endorses imminent suicide risk during an assessment, he&#xD;
           or she will be voluntarily escorted to Rutgers University Counseling Center for further&#xD;
           assessment. If necessary, Rutgers Campus Police will be contacted for transport of the&#xD;
           participant for further mental health assessment, particularly in cases where imminent&#xD;
           suicide risk is indicated and the participant refuses to undergo additional screening.&#xD;
           The suicide risk assessment procedures, as well as the appropriate actions to be taken&#xD;
           according to suicide risk are described in the Appendix 2. These potential actions will&#xD;
           also be described in the informed consent form so that participants are aware prior to&#xD;
           the clinical interviews. In the case that a participant exhibits suicidal ideation, the&#xD;
           assessor will contact Dr. Selby to ensure that appropriate safety measures are taken&#xD;
           prior to the participant leaving the lab. Importantly, research has found that&#xD;
           conducting a suicide risk assessment on people who are not suicidal will not cause them&#xD;
           to experience suicidality, and furthermore those who are experiencing suicidal ideation&#xD;
           frequently report feeling better following a suicide risk assessment. This assessment&#xD;
           approach has been used successfully in previous research to protect human subjects who&#xD;
           were potentially experiencing suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Confidentiality. Procedures will be completed once for each participant throughout the&#xD;
           project period. There is a minimal risk that confidential information could be breached.&#xD;
           The identifying information of all participants will not be included in the same survey&#xD;
           as the self-report questionnaires or in the same file as their consent forms (for&#xD;
           in-person participants). Confidentiality will be maintained in the reporting of all&#xD;
           results. The information gathered will be used only for scientific purposes and will be&#xD;
           reported only in aggregate form of group totals or averages. All physical data forms&#xD;
           (from in-person participants) will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the primary&#xD;
           investigator's lab. All personnel will be carefully trained by the investigators&#xD;
           regarding the collection and storage of sensitive information. Data entered into&#xD;
           statistical databases will be kept in investigators' lab space, and will be kept in&#xD;
           locked space to which only investigators and authorized personnel will have access. All&#xD;
           electronic data downloaded from participant surveys will be stored on a secure server in&#xD;
           the investigator's lab (further details described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data Security. Participants will provide electronic data via online surveys as part of&#xD;
           their participation in the laboratory. There is small risk that data could be&#xD;
           compromised. Each questionnaire survey and electronic data set will be numbered, and the&#xD;
           in-person informed consent form will have an attached sheet containing that number,&#xD;
           which will be removed once data collection is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
           f. Consent Procedures Participants will be provided with the consent form and given time&#xD;
           to read it, then the study will be explained by a trained, CITI-certified study staff&#xD;
           member who will also answer participants' questions. Participants will initial all pages&#xD;
           of the consent form before signing and dating the consent form with a study staff member&#xD;
           witness. A dated and signed copy will be given to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           g. Internal Validity Threats to internal validity in the study have been considered and&#xD;
           addressed through the inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for the study. Furthermore,&#xD;
           all participants are adult women to reduce age and gender confounds in HRV data, and&#xD;
           randomization to study condition will be blocked by age to further reduce confounds for&#xD;
           HRV measurement. Additionally, blood pressure will be recorded to assess potential HRV&#xD;
           confounds. During the intervention, the biofeedback device will serve as a secondary&#xD;
           measure of HRV and a manipulation check. Cognitive reappraisal instructions will include&#xD;
           practice exercises and questions to ensure understanding of the intervention, and&#xD;
           subscales from the Stress Appraisal Measure will be utilized as manipulation checks.&#xD;
           Self-report measures have been selected for their validity and appropriateness for the&#xD;
           study sample. Furthermore, the stress tasks were specifically selected for their effects&#xD;
           on different facets of stress, including social stress, in order to capture the&#xD;
           potential stressors faced by real-life smokers that lead to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           h. Data Analysis In order to examine the effect of practicing cognitive reappraisal and&#xD;
           HRVb in a single laboratory session on stress task performance, investigators will&#xD;
           examine persistence on the MTT and performance on the Stroop task separately.&#xD;
           Persistence on the MTT will be measured via time to completion or termination of the&#xD;
           task as an outcome measure. Reaction time and response accuracy (as averages for each&#xD;
           individual) will be examined as outcome measures on the Stroop task. Generalized&#xD;
           estimated equations analyses will examine the effects of the two experimental&#xD;
           manipulations (HRVb and cognitive reappraisal) and covariates including age, average&#xD;
           daily cigarettes smoked, Body Mass Index (as calculated from demographics information in&#xD;
           the baseline questionnaire), and demographic variables on the three outcome measures for&#xD;
           the MTT and Stroop task.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to examine the effect of practicing cognitive reappraisal and HRVb on&#xD;
           short-term HRV, craving, and affect, investigators will first clean all HRV data&#xD;
           following standard guidelines (Bernston et al., 1990). Within-subject changes in HRV&#xD;
           will be assessed via changes from baseline HRV measurement averages. Change scores for&#xD;
           HRV, craving, and affect will be explored as between-group differences using 2x2&#xD;
           analyses of variance. Multiple regression analyses will then examine the effect of&#xD;
           cognitive reappraisal and HRVb on changes in HRV, craving, and affect, with age, average&#xD;
           daily cigarettes smoked, Body Mass Index, and demographic variables entered as&#xD;
           covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second, investigators will explore changes over time for the multiple assessments of&#xD;
           HRV, craving, and affect by examining within-subject changes over time. Within-subject&#xD;
           data analysis will be conducted in Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) Version 7 software&#xD;
           (Raudenbush et al., 2011) to account for the nesting structure of the data as well as&#xD;
           missingness of data, and allow for analysis with random intercepts. Multilevel models&#xD;
           will include the covariates mentioned above in addition to the experimental&#xD;
           manipulations of cognitive reappraisal and HRVb.&#xD;
