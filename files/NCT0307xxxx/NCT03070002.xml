  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the amount of cancer cells in the blood of&#xD;
      participants who are being treated with denosumab. The other purpose is to look at how long&#xD;
      it takes for cancer to get worse when participants are being treated with denosumab.&#xD;
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC)&#xD;
      have been associated with shorter survival than when CTCs are absent, especially in patients&#xD;
      whose cancer has spread to their bones. In this study, we want it see if denosumab (the study&#xD;
      drug) will decrease the number of CTCs measured in patients with MBC and cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to their bones. We also plan to get blood from participants to study other research&#xD;
      markers of interest.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of denosumab in Her2/neu negative ER+ and/or PR+ metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who are in partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after starting&#xD;
      systemic therapy with bone metastases and &gt;= 5 circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by measuring&#xD;
      the fraction of patients with reduction in CTCs after 3 cycles of denosumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of denosumab on CTCs enumeration considered as a continuous variable&#xD;
      (percent change from baseline) in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate median progression-free survival (m-PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. CTC enumeration after enrichment. II. To assess the effect on CTC profiling and&#xD;
      characterization of stem cell phenotype (CTC-EMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the type of progressive disease (new site versus [vs.] progression of&#xD;
      lesions in previous sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To analyze the expression of RANKL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive denosumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression, unexpected toxicity, or patient&#xD;
      withdrawal or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
