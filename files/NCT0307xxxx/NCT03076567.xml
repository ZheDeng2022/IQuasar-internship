      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stomach cancer is common around the world. The US is a low-risk region. But the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate in the US is low. This is because the cancer is usually in a late stage by the&#xD;
      time it is diagnosed. One way to detect it earlier is to screen many people with a procedure&#xD;
      called endoscopy. But this may not be feasible in low-risk or developing countries.&#xD;
      Researchers want to find a biomarker for early-stage disease to help them create an effective&#xD;
      way of screening. DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA. It generates a signal&#xD;
      for certain cancers, including stomach cancer. Researchers want to find a blood-based DNA&#xD;
      methylation marker for stomach cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study plasma DNA methylation as a potential biomarker for detection of stomach cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from 2 studies already done in China&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use blood samples from participants in the 2 studies. The blood was&#xD;
      collected in 1999/2000. They will use samples from some who developed stomach cancer between&#xD;
      those years and 2006. The other samples will be from some who stayed cancer free in that&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants already gave written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will take DNA from the samples. They will look for methylation.&#xD;

      Despite markedly declining incidence in recent decades, almost one million new cases of&#xD;
      stomach cancer were estimated to have occurred in 2012, making it the fifth most common&#xD;
      malignancy in the world after lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. More than 70% of&#xD;
      cases (677,000 cases) occur in developing countries, and half occur in Eastern Asia (mainly&#xD;
      in China). Although North America is considered to be a low-risk region, 22,000 cases are&#xD;
      diagnosed in the US each year. Five-year survival for 2005-2011 in the US was less than 30%,&#xD;
      since stomach cancer is generally asymptomatic in early stages and has often metastasized by&#xD;
      the time of diagnosis. In contrast, 5-year survival rates are almost 70% in South Korea and&#xD;
      Japan where mass screening programs have been implemented and a large proportion of stomach&#xD;
      cancer is detected in early stages. UGI endoscopy has been considered as the gold standard&#xD;
      for diagnosis of stomach cancer but endoscopy-based mass screening may not be feasible in&#xD;
      relatively low-risk or less developed regions. Therefore, identification of biomarkers for&#xD;
      early stage disease is crucial to in the development of effective screening strategies. With&#xD;
      the recent advances in cancer genetics and assay technologies, this is an opportune time to&#xD;
      discover minimally invasive, specific, and cost-effective biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surprising discovery from the large scale cancer genome projects such as TCGA was the&#xD;
      enormous variation in mutational patterns both across and within individual tumor types. Even&#xD;
      the most commonly mutated genes were typically altered in less than half of cases of a given&#xD;
      cancer. The two most frequently mutated driver genes in stomach cancer, TP53 (tumor protein&#xD;
      p53) and ARID1A (AT rich interactive domain 1A), were mutated in only 44% and 17% of cases,&#xD;
      respectively. Mutation rates for the remaining stomach cancer driver genes were even lower.&#xD;
      Importantly, mutations of these genes are often spread across several exons which complicates&#xD;
      detection of DNA-based sequence variation, since large numbers of samples and extensive&#xD;
      genotyping will be required to achieve adequate sensitivity and power. In contrast, DNA&#xD;
      methylation, which is a chemical modification of CpG dinucleotides that does not alter base&#xD;
      pair sequence, generates a more robust signal as compared to genetic alterations. For&#xD;
      example, methylation in the Stratifin promoter was found in 96% (24/25) of breast carcinomas,&#xD;
      83% (15/18) of ductal carcinoma in situ, and 38% (3/8) of benign atypical hyperplasias, but&#xD;
      was absent in breast tissues from healthy individuals, which suggests that methylation status&#xD;
      of this locus is an early event of breast cancer that could serve as a breast cancer&#xD;
      biomarker. Aberrant DNA methylation occurs in an early phase of carcinogenesis and&#xD;
      contributes to development and progression. Notably, a comprehensive molecular&#xD;
      characterization of 295 primary stomach cancers in TCGA classified the tumors into four&#xD;
      molecular subtypes. All four types exhibited DNA hypermethylation to various degrees, with&#xD;
      one type more heavily methylated than any other tumor group previously analyzed in TCGA.&#xD;
      Moreover, other studies have also suggested that aberrant methylation may be associated with&#xD;
      various pre-malignant conditions like Helicobacter pylori infection, severe gastritis,&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia, implying a role for an epigenetic field effect which&#xD;
      may reflect the earliest steps in neoplastic transformation of the stomach. Importantly,&#xD;
      hypermethylation can be detected in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) which is thought to be&#xD;
      derived from preneoplastic or tumor tissues. Efforts to discover blood-based DNA methylation&#xD;
      markers are underway in various types of cancers. In particular, plasma methylated SEPT9 DNA&#xD;
      has been evaluated for detection of colorectal cancer, and a commercialblood test for this is&#xD;
      under review for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
