      Treatment for patients with mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with&#xD;
      specific domain tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has given place to objective clinical&#xD;
      response, increase in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
      However, despite clinical success with different TKIs, most patients eventually develop&#xD;
      acquired resistance to these agents after an average period of time of 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently metformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent, has been associated with reduction in the&#xD;
      global risk of incidence and mortality of different types of cancer, by exercising anti-tumor&#xD;
      properties. Its role as a chemo-preventive and adjuvant drug in overcoming acquired&#xD;
      resistance to chemotherapy, target therapy and immunotherapy in NSCLC is still under&#xD;
      discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, preclinical data support the role as an adjuvant drug in the treatment of NSCLC in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy or EGFR-TKIs. This evidence led to examine the effects of&#xD;
      metformin in combination with EGFR-TKIs in a NSCLC cellular line panel, obtaining a different&#xD;
      sensibility to the unique use with EGFR-TKIs. The combination of metformin and TKIs reduced&#xD;
      the colony forming capacity and proliferation, and induced a huge pro-apoptotic effect in&#xD;
      NSCLC cellular lines and resistance in EGFR-TKIs. This suggests that metformin may reduce the&#xD;
      resistance to TKIs. A retrospective study in patients from our institution from 2008 to 2014,&#xD;
      showed significant clinical benefit in patients who used metformin, improving the global&#xD;
      survival. Based on these considerations, we propose a phase II randomized study to assess the&#xD;
      effect and safety of metformin in combination with TKIs as second line therapy in patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC in advanced stages with EGFR mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the progression-free survival period in&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in treatment with TKIs and metformin versus&#xD;
      TKI alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the first cause of death in men and women, representing 28% and 26% of&#xD;
      registered deaths worldwide, respectively. Among patients with this disease, at least 80% has&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 60% of patients are diagnosed when they already have&#xD;
      a locally advanced or metastatic disease. NSCLC therapy regimens depend on the stage of&#xD;
      disease and may require surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these.&#xD;
      Survival rate at 5 years is low for patients with stage II and III of the disease, with&#xD;
      variation from 30% to 5%, this means that an improvement in therapy are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in molecular biology of cancer have led to discovering several molecular targets and&#xD;
      developing new target therapies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in the&#xD;
      development and progression of several types of cancer, including NSCLC. However, despite&#xD;
      clinical success with different tyrosine kinase specific domain inhibitors (TKIs), most of&#xD;
      the patients respond to these drugs initially, but eventually develop resistance to these&#xD;
      drugs after and average period of time of 10 months. Thus, innovative treatment strategies&#xD;
      are required urgently to overcome therapeutic resistance to EGFR-TKIs and to improve survival&#xD;
      of patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, metformin has been associated with reduction in the global risk of incidence and&#xD;
      mortality of different types of cancer, due to its anti-tumor properties. In specific types&#xD;
      of cancer, retrospective studies have demonstrated a clinical benefit from the use of&#xD;
      metformin combined with the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NSCLC with positive EGFR mutations are highly sensible to specific anti-EGFR&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors, however, most of the patients who initially respond to these&#xD;
      target therapies, will present progression of the disease posteriorly during the treatment,&#xD;
      this is known as acquired resistance. Acquired resistance to target therapies was first&#xD;
      studied in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with BCR-ABL translocation treated with&#xD;
      Imitanib, an inhibitor of aberrant kinase BCR-ABL. Thanks to research, mutations associated&#xD;
      with resistance to treatment with TKIs in NSCLC with positive EGFR mutations were discovered.&#xD;
      By several studies, additional mutations were found in the kinase domain and in KRAS in those&#xD;
      patients with acquired resistance to Gefitinib or Erlotinib. By PCR it was found that 50% of&#xD;
      patients with resistance to TKI develop a specific mutation in exon 20 (T790M). However, the&#xD;
      mechanism by which the other 50% of patients develop resistance to anti-EGFR TKI is yet&#xD;
      unknown. Some studies have found focal amplification of MET proto-oncogen in 22% of the&#xD;
      patients with acquired resistance to Gefitinib. The proposed mechanism is that MET&#xD;
      amplification promotes resistance by activation of HER3 depending PI3K pathway. Nonetheless,&#xD;
      there are few studies with few patients about MET amplification as a resistance mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, there are patients who have this resistance mutation since the first&#xD;
      presentation, or de novo. T790M mutation may be present before exposition to TKI and it's&#xD;
      generally found with other activating mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletion and punctual L858R&#xD;
      mutation). A response rate of 8% has been reported in those patients treated with gefitinib&#xD;
      or erlotinib whose T790M mutation was positive at the time of the diagnosis, with&#xD;
      progression-free survival of 2 months and global survival median of 16 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the advances in treatment have increased response rate and progression-free survival&#xD;
      with anti-EGFR TKI in patients with presence of activating mutations, most of them will&#xD;
      develop resistance mutations (T790M) and disease progression. There is no standard treatment&#xD;
      in patients who progress from a first generation anti-EGFR TKI, such as erlotinib and&#xD;
      gefitinib. Some studies have used afatinib as second line therapy in patients who had&#xD;
      progression, finding a benefit in the progression-free survival, disease control rate up&#xD;
      until 58% and delay in the development of lung cancer associate symptoms, thus improving&#xD;
      quality of life in patients treated with afatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquired resistance will develop in a mean time of 9 to 13 months and the 50% to 60% will be&#xD;
      secondary to development of T790M resistance mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms that generate acquired resistance to anti-EGFR TKI are not&#xD;
      completely clear. We know that around 50% of cases are caused by an acquired mutation in the&#xD;
      EGFR T790M and a lower percentage by MET oncogene amplification, nevertheless, there are&#xD;
      other proposed molecular mechanisms, such as the activation of mesenchymal-epithelial&#xD;
      transition. The latter, refers to changes in the phenotype of epithelial cells to cells with&#xD;
      mesenchymal cells phenotype, resulting in increase in motility, proliferation and metastasis&#xD;
      of tumor cells. It's been proposed that epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT) is associated with&#xD;
      sensitivity to chemotherapy and TKI. Finding an effective therapy for patients who develop&#xD;
      T790M resistance mutation is required to overcome resistance to first generation anti-EGFR&#xD;
      TKI. Afatinib, as a second generation irreversible anti-EGFR TKI, has demonstrated in some&#xD;
      studies to have certain effect in patients with resistance, however, the benefit is marginal.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the union of the tyrosine kinase portion of afatinib in patients with&#xD;
      resistance mutation, is 100 times less strong that the union in cells with anti-EGFR&#xD;
      activating mutations. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of IL-6 receptor&#xD;
      activation and activation of JAK1/STAT3 pathway overcomes resistance and sensitize again&#xD;
      those cells with EGFR resistance mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is a drug that has been used for several years to treat diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, it's generally well tolerated. Several studies since 1910 have suggested&#xD;
      that patients with diabetes are at increased risk to develop cancer. The American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association and The American Cancer Society have come to a consensus that suggests a clear&#xD;
      association for greater risk of cancer incidence in diabetic patients. The tumors that have&#xD;
      been studied with more frequency are in: colon, endometrium, rectus and breast. On the other&#xD;
      hand, several epidemiologic and cases and control studies have suggested that the use of&#xD;
      metformin decreases risk to develop cancer up until 30% with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.77&#xD;
      (0.64-0.92) and risk of cancer-specific death with a HR of 0.67 (0.53-0.85). Such protective&#xD;
      effect has been seen in all kinds of cancer, but has been more studied in breast,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of metformin as chemo-prevention is subject to debate, however, there's more&#xD;
      information about its use as adjuvant in the treatment of lung cancer, in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy or target molecular therapy. Pre-clinical studies in mice have demonstrated that&#xD;
      use of metformin per os may decrease the necessary dosage of chemotherapy and may prolong&#xD;
      tumor remission. Metformin, by inhibiting repairing and anti-apoptosis mechanisms, increases&#xD;
      sensitivity to chemotherapy, especially to platinum. Studies that involve metformin,&#xD;
      paclitaxel, carboplatin and doxorubicin, have demonstrated to have an effect in tumor&#xD;
      regression and prevention of recurrences up until four times the effect of monotherapy in&#xD;
      xenograft models in cellular lines of lung and prostate cancer. Retrospective studies have&#xD;
      found a benefit in progression-free survival and global survival in diabetic patients with&#xD;
      NSCLC, who also are treated with metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T790M mutation and MET amplification are the main resistance mechanisms to anti-EGFR TKI,&#xD;
      other mechanisms such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by TGF-β are resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms. TGF-β also induces activation of IL-6 and paracrine activation of the receptor&#xD;
      (IL-6R) and at the same time the activation of pathway JAK1/STAT3 and cell immortalization.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies with cellular lines of lung cancer with anti-EGFR acquired-resistance&#xD;
      treatment show that metformin prevents transcription of factors that activate&#xD;
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inhibiting TGF-β, thus, inhibiting IL-6/JAK1/STAT3&#xD;
      pathway, overcoming anti-EGFR TKI resistance in patients with T790M resistance mutation, in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo. A recent study reports that use of metformin in combination with gefitinib&#xD;
      may increase efficacy of the latter, showing anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effect in&#xD;
      cellular lines of NSCLC. Other studies have shown, by Western-blot, a decrease in levels of&#xD;
      phosphorylation and activation of growth pathways MAPK, AKT and mTOR with the use of&#xD;
      metformin, found in pre-clinical studies. Currently, a phase I/II study is being carried out&#xD;
      to determine effective dose, safety and posteriorly the activity of metformin in combination&#xD;
      with erlotinib as second line therapy in patients with NSCLC without EGFR mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the progression-free survival period in&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in treatment with TKIs and metformin versus&#xD;
      TKI alone. The secondary objectives are the response rate, global survival, quality of life,&#xD;
      safety, as well as determining the alteration of nutrition parameters associated to the&#xD;
      combined use of TKIs and metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the secondary objectives, we want to find new candidate markers in the tumor&#xD;
      characteristics to predict anti-tumor activity, as well as the search for serum biomarkers;&#xD;
      among which we will analyze EGFR mutations (exon 18-21 mutations), IL-6, IGF-1, as well as&#xD;
      determination of LKB-1 molecule expression in tumor tissue. We will associate the prognostic&#xD;
      and potential role as possible biomarkers.&#xD;
