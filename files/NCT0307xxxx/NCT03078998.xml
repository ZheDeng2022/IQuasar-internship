  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), Cerebral Palsy (CP), and Obstetric Brachial Plexus&#xD;
      Injury (OBPI) are the most common disorders that cause upper extremity impairments in&#xD;
      children. Depending on the underlying pathologies, the common symptoms of these disorders are&#xD;
      the limitations of the upper extremity joint movement angles, muscle imbalance and the&#xD;
      functional limitations caused by the contracture due to these problems. Daily life activities&#xD;
      such as feeding, personal care, and self mobility activities that use upper extremity are&#xD;
      commonly limited with these children. Physical rehabilitation is mostly used to address these&#xD;
      problems. However, the process of rehabilitation is difficult and lengthy. In addition, most&#xD;
      of the time, classical rehabilitation is discouraging for many young patients. Employment of&#xD;
      digital technology has been gaining momentum in addressing the above rehabilitation problems&#xD;
      among the medical professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By utilizing exciting new sensor technologies, such as Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii and&#xD;
      Leap Motion, practical game based rehabilitation applications have been becoming popular.&#xD;
      Video Based Games (VBG) that adopt the these technologies as Human Computer Interaction (HCI)&#xD;
      interfaces are recently used successfully for the task of rehabilitation. The Leap Motion&#xD;
      device, one of the new examples of these technologies, has a very small form factor. It&#xD;
      includes two near infrared stereoscopic cameras to capture hand images of patients to produce&#xD;
      3 Dimensional (3D) positions of hand joints at a very fast rate with a sufficient positional&#xD;
      precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been examples that use motion sensor based VBG's for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      different types of patient groups. Compared to classical rehabilitation practices, these&#xD;
      applications provide many advantages such as ease of use, repeatableness, and instantaneous&#xD;
      measurable feedback. In addition, the young patients involved in these applications&#xD;
      demonstrated willingness to participate in these activities and they showed considerable&#xD;
      progress in upper extremity rehabilitation. However, these VBG's were mostly developed for&#xD;
      general public and it was often suggested to develop VBG's for the specific task of upper&#xD;
      extremity rehabilitation of children. It is known that upper extremity specific VBG's and&#xD;
      their applications are very limited both at the global and domestic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, we plan to design and develop specialized Leap Motion based VBG's for the&#xD;
      children diagnosed with JIA, CP, and OBPI. These VBG's will be designed to be easy to use and&#xD;
      motivating for the children. They will automatically lead the patients to correct hand&#xD;
      exercises and they will provide mechanisms for online performance measurements of the&#xD;
      patients. The performance results from the patients will be compared with the results from&#xD;
      the classical rehabilitation applications by the standards of The International&#xD;
      Classification of Functioning (ICF). These games will provide complete Turkish language&#xD;
      support for the extended national dissemination of the project outputs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is inherently a multi disciplinary work that requires very close&#xD;
      interaction of phisiotherapists, software experts, and HCI specialists and efficient&#xD;
      application of the these games for the patients. There will be specialized games for each&#xD;
      disorder. These games will utilize the outputs from the Leap Motion device that will produce&#xD;
      3D hand joint positions and joint angles. Realistic animations of hand and virtual&#xD;
      environments will provide a motivating exercise game platform for the patients.The&#xD;
      performance measurements of the patients will be repeated for each game session. There will&#xD;
      be game parameters for the game duration, difficulty level, and hand joints in focus. The&#xD;
      game hand movements will reflect daily life activities for the rehabilitation purposes which&#xD;
      would make our games different from the general public games. The project findings at end of&#xD;
      the project on best game usage frequency and durations, the effectiveness of the designed&#xD;
      VBG's and other results will be shared with the scientific community through publications and&#xD;
      seminars.&#xD;
