      A prospective randomized clinical trial that included thirty subjects who underwent&#xD;
      tonsillectomy. The patients in Group 1 (n:15) were injected with dexamethasone (1 ml, 8 mg)&#xD;
      through the uvula and soft palate tissue directly before tonsillectomy. Group 2 (n:15)&#xD;
      patients had tonsillectomy without dexamethasone injection. Patients were examined&#xD;
      preoperatively and postoperative on the first and fifth days. In this study investigators&#xD;
      tried an approach of dexamethasone application to reduce uvula edema after tonsillectomy.&#xD;

      Thirty patients between the ages of 18 and 48 years were enrolled in this prospective&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial from July 2015 to July 2016. The study was carried out in a&#xD;
      tertiary referral center in Istanbul, Turkey. Permission for the study was obtained from&#xD;
      Bezmialem Vakif University Clinical Research Ethics Committee, on 03 June 2015, number11/18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in Group 1 (n:15) were injected with dexamethasone (1 ml, 8 mg) through the&#xD;
      uvula and soft palate tissue directly at three points (three points on the connection of the&#xD;
      uvula, and palatum molle) before tonsillectomy. Group 2 (n:15) patients had tonsillectomy&#xD;
      without dexamethasone injection. All patients had the operation under general anesthesia by&#xD;
      utilizing the same protocol. Both of the groups were not given iv/im dexamethasone&#xD;
      perioperatively. The surgical technique for tonsillectomy was bipolar cautery dissection&#xD;
      performed by the same surgeon. The oropharyngeal area was examined and photographed&#xD;
      endoscopically preoperatively and postoperative on the first and fifth days. All of the&#xD;
      participants were examined with an 8mm diameter 70ยบ endoscope. The photographs of the&#xD;
      oropharynx (anterior plicas, tonsils, uvula, posterior oropharynx) were taken by holding the&#xD;
      endoscope positioned vertically to the mouth. Blinded observers made examinations of the&#xD;
      groups at the postoperative first and fifth days and evaluated the uvula edema by using the&#xD;
      uvula edema scale that the investigators developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used a scale for grading uvula edema. There is no such scale in the English&#xD;
      literature so the investigators developed a scale for grading uvula edema. The investigators&#xD;
      grade edema from 1 to 5 as an increase of the edema area. It is called Grade 1 if there was&#xD;
      elongation only at the tip of the uvula. If there was edema in the body and base of the&#xD;
      uvula, it is called Grade 2. If the uvula edema was spread over a larger area than Grade 2,&#xD;
      and if there was involvement in the unilateral plica, it is called Grade 3. If it was spread&#xD;
      to both pharyngeal plicas, it is called grade 4. If the uvula edema caused the complete&#xD;
      blockage of the posterior pharyngeal tract, it is called Grade 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical tests were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      version 24.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). All quantitative variables were&#xD;
      estimated using measures of central location (i.e., mean and median) and measures of&#xD;
      dispersion (i.e., standard deviation [SD]). Data normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      tests of normality. Descriptive statistical analysis were made. Paired t test was used for&#xD;
      comparison of intra-group quantitative data. Independent t test was used to compare groups of&#xD;
      quantitative data.&#xD;
