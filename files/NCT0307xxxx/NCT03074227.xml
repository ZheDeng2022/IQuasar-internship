  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by abdominal pain or&#xD;
      discomfort associated with a change in stool form or frequency, in the absence of a&#xD;
      biochemical or structural explanation for these symptoms. The prevalence of IBS in the&#xD;
      general adult population is 9.8-12.8%, which is in accordance to the prevalence of IBS in&#xD;
      children and adolescents (6.2%-11.9%). Patients with IBS report a decreased quality of life,&#xD;
      high work or school absence, and are more at risk than healthy controls of developing&#xD;
      depressive and anxiety disorders. Consequently, the healthcare costs are substantial; annual&#xD;
      costs of care for adults with IBS in the USA are estimated to be over $20 billion. Total&#xD;
      annual costs per paediatric IBS patient in the Netherlands are estimated to be €2500.&#xD;
      Although the pathophysiology of IBS has not been fully elucidated, pathophysiological&#xD;
      abnormal gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, altered brain-gut function,&#xD;
      low-grade inflammation, psychosocial disturbance and intestinal microbiota characteristics&#xD;
      have been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology. Current treatment focuses on&#xD;
      abnormal gastrointestinal motility, altered brain-gut function and psychosocial disturbances.&#xD;
      However, a significant amount of IBS patients has remaining symptoms, despite these treatment&#xD;
      regimens. These patients are considered to be therapy-resistant, also called refractory.&#xD;
      Treatment focusing on other components of the underlying pathophysiology, such as the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota, might therefore lead to new therapeutic successes in this group of&#xD;
      patients. In this light, being able to modify the intestinal microbiota inrefractory IBS&#xD;
      patients could have beneficial effects on symptoms. Faecal transplantation, a relatively new&#xD;
      treatment regimen that enables the modification of the microbiome, has been shown to be&#xD;
      highly effective in treating Clostridium difficile infections and also yielded promising&#xD;
      results in patients with other diseases such as diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate whether two faecal transplantations from either allogeneic&#xD;
      (healthy) or autologous (own) donor, administered through a nasoduodenal tube, has beneficial&#xD;
      effects on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms such as abdominal pain frequency and&#xD;
      severity. Secondary objective is to study microbiota changes in faeces samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Double-blind randomised placebo-controlled pilot study as well as a reversed&#xD;
      translational part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients with refractory IBS, defined as a failure to improve after&#xD;
      standard medical treatment, at least 6 sessions of a psychological therapy and absence of&#xD;
      response to at least 1 pharmacological agent (aged 16-21 years, male/female, no concomitant&#xD;
      medication, non-smoking), will be recruited by their (paediatric) gastroenterologist at the&#xD;
      Academic Medical Centre (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and patients from other hospitals will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Donors: relatives or volunteers will serve as faeces donor, potential donors&#xD;
      will be thoroughly screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: After bowel lavage with Klean-Prep, patients will be treated with faecal&#xD;
      transplantation at t=0 and t=6 weeks, processed for duodenal tube infusion. Faeces will be&#xD;
      collected from a healthy donor (allogeneic) as well as the patient him/herself (autologous),&#xD;
      in which their own faeces will be used as a placebo.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients will be randomised by a computerised random-number generator to one of the following two treatment arms:&#xD;
allogeneic faecal infusions at t=0 and t=6.&#xD;
autologous faecal infusions at t=0 and t=6.&#xD;
Randomisation and preparation of the faeces will be performed by one of the research assistants. He/she is the only person who will know which treatment the patient will be given and will have no role in further parts of the study.&#xD;
The randomisation list will be kept under secured access by the Clinical Research Unit of the AMC Amsterdam, who will perform the randomisation. In case of an emergency the study medication can be unblinded after consultation of the principal investigator.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of patients with &gt; 50% reduction of their abdominal pain intensity and pain frequency at t=12 weeks after the first faecal transplantation</measure>
    <time_frame>T=12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed with the pain component of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) score. With 2 questions, the severity and frequency of the abdominal pain on the last 10 days is measured. The IBS-SSS is the only symptom severity scale that has been responsive to treatment effects. It has been recommended as the best instrument to obtain information on specific IBS related symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intra-individual changes in faecal gut microbiota composition</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after faecal transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the changes in faecal microbiota composition in IBS patients following FMT. To assess faecal gut microbiota composition, morning stool samples will be collected. Samples will be taken by the patient him/herself (wearing gloves) and will be put in a small container. Afterwards it will directly be transported to the AMC, where all samples will be stored at -80°C. Faecal analysis will be done by HITChip flora mapping, an established sensitive RT-qPCR method which is developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of bacterial population.</description>

    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, t=6 and t=12 weeks, and t=6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-QOL questionnaire will be used as the disease specific questionnaire. This questionnaire is a 34-item assessment of the degree to which the IBS interferes with patient quality of life and consists of eight domains: dysphoria, interference with activities, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social reactions, sexual health, and effect on relationships. For generic quality of life, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) will be used.The SF-36 questionnaire consists of 36 questions regarding eight dimensions of health perception: limitations in physical functioning, role limitation due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional limitations, and mental health. The reliability has been proven extensively for diverse patient groups and it is validated for the Dutch population.The SF-36 is described as adequate for persons 14 years of age and older.</description>

    <measure>Depression and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, t=6 and t=12 weeks, and t=6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Depression and anxiety scores will be measured using the SCL-90. The SCL-90 is a widely used measure of psychological state, suitable for adolescents &gt; 11 years and adults. It has question items that ask on a 5-point scale, how much a certain problem has bothered the subject over the past 7 days. This allows nine scales to be derived, namely somatisation, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absence of school or work, health care resources and costs</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, t=6 and t=12 weeks, and t=6 and 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>A self-designed questionnaire will be used to monitor school absence (adolescents) and absence from work during the first year after treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adequate relief</measure>
    <time_frame>t=6 and t=12 weeks, and t=6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adequate relief will be measured using a single question (&quot;Did you have adequate relief of IBS/FAP symptoms (abdominal discomfort/pain, bowel habits, and other symptoms like nausea and bloating) over the past week?&quot;) scored on a dichotomous scale (Yes/No). This instrument is a well-validated simple outcome assessment for IBS treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CRP, liver profile and renal profile</measure>
    <time_frame>t=0, t=6 and t=12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CRP, liver profile and renal profile will be assessed.Therefore, 4 tubes of blood per assessment will be taken, with a total maximum amount of 20mL. Three of these tubes will be frozen and stored. In case certain biomarkers for inflammation or metabolites related to the gut-brain axis will be demonstrated in the next 5 years, the stored serum can be used for analysis of this newly discovered biomarkers or metabolites in irritable bowel syndrome.</description>
