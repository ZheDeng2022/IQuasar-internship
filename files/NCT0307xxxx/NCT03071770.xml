    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, single-dose, open-label trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety of ivosidenib (AG-120) in healthy, adult male Japanese and&#xD;
      Caucasian subjects. The study plans to evaluate 3 cohorts of a single oral dose of ivosidenib&#xD;
      (AG-120) in Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Pharmacokinetic sampling will take place&#xD;
      serially through-out the duration of subject participation.&#xD;

             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to communicate with the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator according to past medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory test results, and&#xD;
             ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29 kg/m2 (inclusive), and body weight&#xD;
             between 50-120kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory test results (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) must be&#xD;
             within normal limits or considered by the Investigator to be not clinically&#xD;
             significant after confirmation with the Agios Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and oral body&#xD;
             temperature) will be assessed in the supine position after the subject has rested for&#xD;
             at least 5 minutes. Subject must be afebrile with vital signs within the following&#xD;
             ranges at screening, Day -1 and pre dose: Systolic blood pressure: 90 to 140 mmHg;&#xD;
             Diastolic blood pressure: 50 to 90 mmHg; Pulse rate: 40 to 110 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG no later than Day -1. Subjects&#xD;
             must have a pre-dose QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula&#xD;
             (QTcF) value or average of 3 values, â‰¤450 msec. An ECG may be repeated once to&#xD;
             determine subject eligibility after confirmation with the Agios Medical Monitor.&#xD;
