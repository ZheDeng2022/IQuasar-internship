    <measure>Change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication - 9 items (TSQM-9) is a generic questionnaire that measures a patients' satisfaction with medication. Items are rated on a 5-point or 7-point scale according to patients' experience with the medication. The items covered are satisfaction with the effectiveness of the medication, convenience and global satisfaction of treatment. Each domain is based on 3 questions. The score is calculated in a range from 0 to 100, where a higher score reflects a better outcome. Scores have been summed and then scaled to 0-100. Change in TSQM-9 scores from baseline (week 0) to week 52 are presented.</description>

          <description>Participants were to receive a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of Norditropin® once daily for 52 weeks (20 weeks of dose titration and 32 weeks of fixed dose treatment). The dose was titrated every fourth week starting from week 4 based on insulin like growth factor-I standard deviation score (IGF-I SDS) values. The starting dose was 0.2 milligrams per day (mg/day) for participants between 18 and 60 years of age; 0.3 mg/day for females on oral oestrogen irrespective of age; and 0.1 mg/day for participants older than 60 years.

        <title>Change in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) Scores</title>
        <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication - 9 items (TSQM-9) is a generic questionnaire that measures a patients' satisfaction with medication. Items are rated on a 5-point or 7-point scale according to patients' experience with the medication. The items covered are satisfaction with the effectiveness of the medication, convenience and global satisfaction of treatment. Each domain is based on 3 questions. The score is calculated in a range from 0 to 100, where a higher score reflects a better outcome. Scores have been summed and then scaled to 0-100. Change in TSQM-9 scores from baseline (week 0) to week 52 are presented.</description>
