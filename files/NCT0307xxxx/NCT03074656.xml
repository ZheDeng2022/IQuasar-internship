  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infliximab and other TNF-inhibitors have revolutionised the treatment of several&#xD;
      immunological inflammatory diseases. Still, more than half of the patients either do not&#xD;
      respond sufficiently to infliximab therapy or loose efficacy over time. The large individual&#xD;
      variation in the serum drug concentrations on standard doses and the development of anti-drug&#xD;
      antibodies are thought to be main reasons for these treatment failures. An individualised&#xD;
      treatment strategy based on systematic assessments of serum drug concentrations, therapeutic&#xD;
      drug monitoring, has been proposed as a clinical tool to optimise efficacy of infliximab&#xD;
      treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring seems reasonable both from a clinical and an&#xD;
      economical point of view, but the effectiveness of this treatment strategy still remain to be&#xD;
      shown. The NOR-DRUM study is planned as a national, randomised controlled multicentre trial&#xD;
      in two parts aiming to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic drug monitoring in order to&#xD;
      achieve remission in patients with immunological inflammatory diseases starting infliximab&#xD;
      treatment (part A) and in order to maintain disease control in patients on maintenance&#xD;
      infliximab treatment (part B). The results of the NOR-DRUM study will hopefully contribute to&#xD;
      an implementation of a personalised medicine approach to treatment with infliximab and other&#xD;
      biological drugs.&#xD;

It has been validated for adult dermatology patients aged 16 years and older. The items of the DLQI encompass aspects of symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships and the side effects of treatment. Each question is scored on a 4-point Likert scale: Not at all/Not relevant=0, A little=1, A lot=2 and Very much=3. Scores of individual items (0-3) are added to yield a total score (0-30); higher scores mean greater impairment of patient's QoL. The DLQI will only be presented to patients with chronic plaque psoriasis.</description>
