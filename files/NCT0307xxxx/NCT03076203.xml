      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of niraparib when given together&#xD;
      with radium Ra223 dichloride in treating subjects with prostate cancer that keeps growing&#xD;
      even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels and has spread&#xD;
      from the primary site to the bone. Radium Ra 223 dichloride, acts like calcium to target&#xD;
      cancer in the bones and may deliver radiation directly to the bone tumors, limiting damage to&#xD;
      the surrounding normal tissue. Niraparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving radium Ra 223 dichloride and niraparib may work&#xD;
      better in treating subjects with hormone-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to the bone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine a safe dose of niraparib when combined with radium Ra 223 dichloride&#xD;
      (radium-223) in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that have&#xD;
      and have not received prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of subjects with 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction&#xD;
      from baseline in men treated with niraparib and radium 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the radiographic PFS (rPFS) at 6 months in men treated with niraparib and&#xD;
      radium 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the proportion of subjects that have circulating tumor cell (CTC)&#xD;
      conversion (&gt;= 5 to &lt; 5/7.5ml) confirmed in a second assessment &gt; 4 weeks later in men&#xD;
      treated with niraparib and radium 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the overall progression-free survival in men treated with niraparib and&#xD;
      radium 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the time to total-ALP (alkaline phosphatase) progression defined in subjects&#xD;
      with no total-ALP decline from baseline as &gt;= 25% increase from the baseline value, at least&#xD;
      12 weeks from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine the time to total-ALP (alkaline phosphatase) progression defined in patient&#xD;
      with an initial total-ALP decline from baselines as &gt;= 25% increase from the nadir value,&#xD;
      which is confirmed by a second value obtained three or more weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine the total-ALP normalization, defined as the return of total-ALP value to&#xD;
      within normal range at 12 weeks in 2 consecutive measurements (at least 2 weeks apart) after&#xD;
      that of treatment in subjects who have their ALP above upper limit of normal (ULN) at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine the long term safety-tolerability of the combination of niraparib and&#xD;
      radium 223 in men treated with niraparib and radium 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Study of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair aberrations; whole exome and transcriptome in&#xD;
      pre-therapy tumor biopsy samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare changes in bone marrow micro-environment (hematopoietic stem cell [HSC] niche\&#xD;
      C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 [CXCL12]/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 [CXCR4] axis) pre&#xD;
      and post therapy in up to 10 men treated with niraparib and radium 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the baseline plasma cell-free (cf)-DNA for aberrations in DNA repair genes such&#xD;
      as breast cancer (BRCA)1, BRCA2, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia-telangiectasia&#xD;
      and rad3-related (ATR), partner and localizer of brca2 gene (PALB2) as well as the androgen&#xD;
      receptor (AR) gene via next generation sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare gene expression changes in baseline and serial (at end of cycle 1 and 3) whole&#xD;
      blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) (collect blood in edetic acid [EDTA] tubes and RNA-later) using&#xD;
      Nanostring PanCancer and immunology panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate the baseline CTCs for nuclear androgen receptor (AR), phosphorylated (p) nuclear&#xD;
      factor kappa-beta (NF-kB), and gamma-H2A histone family member X (H2AX) foci via&#xD;
      immunostaining.&#xD;
