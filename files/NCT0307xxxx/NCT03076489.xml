  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes an inclusion visit, 2 visits to the Rennes University Hospital and the&#xD;
      filling of two on-line questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit to the University-Hospital of Rennes, during which a blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken, morpho-anatomic measures (height, weight, hip and size), impedancemetry and resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry will be carried out in the Clinical Investigation&#xD;
      Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the volunteers will also have to bring a sample of urine and faeces&#xD;
      previously collected at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two on-line questionnaires (hedonic and caloric evaluation of foods and beverages on&#xD;
      photos) will have to be completed by the volunteers between the first and the second visit to&#xD;
      the University-Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the volunteers will go to the University-Hospital of Rennes for the second visit, on&#xD;
      the Neurinfo platform, during which they will be subjected to a cognitive two-choice test&#xD;
      based on food and drink pictures, during fMRI. Before and after the fMRI session, an&#xD;
      assessment of the state of hunger, thirst, and general status of the volunteer will be&#xD;
      carried out using a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 10.&#xD;
