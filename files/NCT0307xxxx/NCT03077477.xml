      This is a Phase 1 study, which will assess the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of&#xD;
      orally-administered AMXT 1501 dicaprate in normal healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of a total of 8 cohorts; 4 single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts, 1 Food&#xD;
      Effect (FE) Crossover cohort, and 3 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Tablets will be&#xD;
      administered after an overnight fast (10 hours) with at least 250 mL water. No food will be&#xD;
      administered (exception for &quot;fed&quot; subjects, see below) for one hour thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will have a total 6 subjects: SAD and MAD (2 subjects receiving placebo and 4&#xD;
      subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate); and FE crossover (6 subjects receiving active&#xD;
      AMXT 1501 dicaprate).&#xD;

      The Phase 1 study, which will assess the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of&#xD;
      orally-administered AMXT 1501 dicaprate in normal healthy male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of a total of 8 cohorts; 4 single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts, 1 Food&#xD;
      Effect (FE) Crossover cohort, and 3 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Tablets will be&#xD;
      administered after an overnight fast (10 hours) with at least 250 mL water. No food will be&#xD;
      administered (exception for &quot;fed&quot; subjects, see below) for one hour thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will have a total 6 subjects: SAD and MAD (2 subjects receiving placebo and 4&#xD;
      subjects receiving active AMXT 1501 dicaprate); and FE crossover (6 subjects receiving active&#xD;
      AMXT 1501 dicaprate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAD cohorts are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: One placebo and one AMXT 1501 dicaprate subject will be treated as sentinel&#xD;
           subjects receiving one tablet each of their assigned treatment. Assuming no intolerance&#xD;
           is noted after at least 3 days, the remaining cohort subjects (placebo, 1 subject and&#xD;
           AMXT 1501 dicaprate, 3 subjects) will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 2 subjects 2 placebo each and 4 subjects 2 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 2 subjects 4 placebos each and 4 subjects 4 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 2 subjects 8 placebos each and 4 subjects 8 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each&#xD;
&#xD;
      FE Crossover:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Cohort 5: 6 new subjects will be randomized to a fed (n=3 standard meal) or fasted (n=3)&#xD;
      group and administered one dose lower of the maximum tolerated AMXT 1501 dose in the previous&#xD;
      SAD cohorts. First dose and accompanying assessments will be referred to as Period 1.&#xD;
      Subjects will then crossover to the opposite diet plan (fed or fasted) and receive a second&#xD;
      administration of study treatment at the same dose level. The second dose and assessments are&#xD;
      referred to as Period 2. There will be a 7-day washout between doses administered in Periods&#xD;
      1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAD cohorts will receive dosing once daily for 14 consecutive days. Dosing will be contingent&#xD;
      on adequate tolerance in Cohorts 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: 2 subjects 2 placebos each; 4 subjects 2 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 7: 2 subjects 4 placebos each; 4 subjects 4 AMXT 1501 dicaprate tablets each&#xD;
&#xD;
