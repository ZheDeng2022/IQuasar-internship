    <textblock>
      This project will study the effectiveness of computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      in reducing depression symptoms. The design is a two-arm randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing (i) control arm, which is treatment as usual with (ii) treatment arm, which is&#xD;
      treatment as usual plus computerized CBT. The primary outcome measure is change in depression&#xD;
      symptom severity. The name of the computerized CBT program to be used in the study is Thrive.&#xD;

      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As identified in Epic, Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Fontana Family&#xD;
           Medicine patients with a depression diagnosis recorded during the prior week (rolling&#xD;
           basis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target study enrollment: 150 participants per arm (300 total)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaiser Permanente (KP) will send eligible patients a postal letter inviting them to&#xD;
           participate in study. Interested patients will be directed to the Enrollment/Assessment&#xD;
           Website, a website to be developed by vendor Waypoint Health Innovations. The&#xD;
           recruitment letter will contain (i) a description of the study, (ii) the web address for&#xD;
           the Enrollment/Assessment Website, (iii) the patient's Study Identifier (ID).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, KP will send eligible patients for whom KP has an email address an email&#xD;
           inviting them to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment (Enrollment/Assessment Website):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A patient interested in applying to the study will visit the Enrollment/Assessment&#xD;
           Website and input his/her unique Study ID. The website will verify that the entered&#xD;
           Study ID is on a pre-loaded list. If valid, the patient may continue to screening&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will complete the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression symptom&#xD;
           assessment. Patients with eligible PHQ-9 scores may continue to Informed Consent page.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Informed Consent (IC) page will contain (i) the Informed Consent text including&#xD;
           contact information for any questions patient may have; (ii) fields for first name, last&#xD;
           name, date of birth, email address, and phone number; (iii) a check box labeled &quot;I&#xD;
           understand the above information and agree to participate…&quot; (or similar); and (iv) a&#xD;
           &quot;submit&quot; (or similar) button.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enroll in the study, the patient must complete all fields, check the box, and click&#xD;
           submit button. The website will validate that every field has been completed and that&#xD;
           the phone number and email fields have the correct format (e.g. name@domain.com for the&#xD;
           email field).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If all fields are complete, the website will store the Study ID, first name, last name,&#xD;
           date of birth, email address, and phone number that patient entered into the website.&#xD;
           They will be stored in an encrypted database for use by researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, the website will store the complete Informed Consent page (including&#xD;
           Informed Consent text, first name, last name, date of birth, email address, phone&#xD;
           number, and checked box) in a single encrypted record, timestamp it, and place a digital&#xD;
           certificate on it. The digital certificate will allow us to prove that no one tampered&#xD;
           with any part of the IC document after the participant clicked submit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The website automatically randomizes participants to treatment or control arm.&#xD;
           Participants continue in website to baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After baseline assessments, control arm participants go to a page in the&#xD;
           Enrollment/Assessment Website telling them to expect assessment again in 2 months, while&#xD;
           treatment arm participants will be given instructions for enrolling in Thrive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers would have access to the completed IC forms to print and/or mail to patients&#xD;
           who request a copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly, KP research coordinator will review new participants' study ID, name, and date&#xD;
           of birth (DOB) the participant entered to ensure they match KP records. Individuals who&#xD;
           entered information that does not reasonably match KP records would be removed from the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaching:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • KP will send each treatment arm participant four emails encouraging them to use Thrive,&#xD;
      with the exception that the second email will be replaced by a phone call from KP for&#xD;
      patients who have not achieved a minimum level of activity in Thrive at that point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint and Follow-up Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • KP will ask each study participant to visit Enrollment/Assessment Website 2 and 6 months&#xD;
      after study enrollment to complete assessments.&#xD;
