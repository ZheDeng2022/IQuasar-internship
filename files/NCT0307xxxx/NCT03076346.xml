    <textblock>
      Clozapine has consistently shown to be a superior drug for psychosis in patients who do not&#xD;
      respond to other treatments, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. The overall goal of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment&#xD;
      with clozapine, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more&#xD;
      efficient use of clozapine, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with&#xD;
      refractory illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients with chronic psychotic disorders continue to have symptoms&#xD;
      following unsuccessful trials with first-line antipsychotic drugs. For these patients with&#xD;
      refractory psychosis, clozapine has consistently demonstrated superior efficacy. Clozapine is&#xD;
      often underutilized and administered late in a patient's course of treatment, which leads to&#xD;
      increased morbidity, unnecessary medication trials, and increased health care expenditure.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, the mechanism of action underlying clozapine's novel effects remains unknown and&#xD;
      has not been studied with modern neuroimaging methods. Identifying the neural mechanisms by&#xD;
      which clozapine exerts its effects may lead to biomarkers that will facilitate efficient&#xD;
      utilization of the drug, and introduce novel treatment targets. In patients with refractory&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms, the proposed study will use resting-state and task-based functional MRI&#xD;
      (fMRI) to examine the neural circuitry of efficacious treatment with a trial of clozapine.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo fMRI scanning both before and after 12 weeks of treatment, with the&#xD;
      aims of determining: baseline patterns of resting-state functional connectivity and&#xD;
      task-based activation that predict response to treatment; and changes in resting-state and&#xD;
      task-based functional circuitry associated with efficacious treatment. Results of this&#xD;
      proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for psychotic&#xD;
      disorders and facilitate drug development for refractory psychosis.&#xD;
