  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the interpretation of health news items&#xD;
      reporting results of pre-clinical studies with or without spin (i.e., distortion of research&#xD;
      results). The news items which reported those studies evaluating the treatment effect either&#xD;
      in cell culture studies or animal studies, have high number of spin in the headline and text&#xD;
      and received high online public attention will be selected. Spin will be deleted and will&#xD;
      rewrite the news items without spin. This sample of news items reporting results of&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies with and without spin will be interpreted by French-speaking population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health news is an important way to communicate updated medical research to the public. News&#xD;
      items reporting the results of medical research attract a large audience. However, the&#xD;
      quality of reporting in health news is questionable. The merits of a wide range of treatments&#xD;
      and tests are overplayed and harms are underplayed. Several studies have shown the presence&#xD;
      of spin (i.e., distorted presentation of study results) in health news. Distorted facts can&#xD;
      be misleading and can affect the behaviour of physicians, healthcare providers and patients.&#xD;
      However, little research has assessed whether spin can affect readers' interpretation of&#xD;
      health news items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the interpretation of health news items reported with or without spin.&#xD;
      News items reporting pre-clinical studies evaluating the effect of a pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment that received high online public attention will be focused. &quot;Spin&quot; is defined as a&#xD;
      misrepresentation of study results whatever the motive (intentionally or unintentionally) to&#xD;
      highlight that the beneficial effect of the intervention in terms of efficacy and safety is&#xD;
      greater than that shown by the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this study is that the spin can influence the reader's&#xD;
      interpretation of health news items reporting results of pre-clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interventions: Health news items reporting results of pre-clinical studies with and&#xD;
           without spin will be compared. A sample of health news items reporting the results of&#xD;
           pre-clinical studies evaluating the effect of pharmacologic treatment and containing&#xD;
           spin in the headline and text will be selected. Spin will be deleted in the selected&#xD;
           news items and will be rewritten the news without spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants: The participants will include French-speaking healthy population from&#xD;
           Nutrinet santé.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size: For this RCT, the sample size will be 300 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome will be participants' interpretation of the&#xD;
           benefit of treatment after reading the news (What do you think is the probability that&#xD;
           treatment X would be beneficial to patients? (scale, 0 [very unlikely] to 10 [very&#xD;
           likely]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Expected results: This study will evaluate the impact of spin on the interpretation of&#xD;
           news items reporting results of pre-clinical studies by French-speaking population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. This study is approved by ethics review regulations by INSERM (CEEI-IRB): IRB00003888&#xD;
