      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of culturally adapted depression treatment for&#xD;
      reducing depressive symptoms and improving adherence to diabetes self-care regimens in&#xD;
      Hispanics with depression and diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes, a disease in which the body does not properly produce or use insulin, is the fifth&#xD;
      leading cause of death among Hispanics in the United States. The risk of comorbid depression&#xD;
      among diabetics is twice as high as that of the general population, with depression rates&#xD;
      among diabetic Hispanics as high as 33%. Symptoms of depression include feelings of sadness,&#xD;
      anxiety, and guilt; lack of energy; changes in appetite; and lack of pleasure in previously&#xD;
      enjoyed activities. These symptoms can make maintaining good diabetic management and&#xD;
      self-care regimens difficult. Fortunately, depression is treatable with forms of&#xD;
      psychotherapy and antidepressant medications. However, depression treatment adherence and&#xD;
      response rates among the Hispanic population, especially among Hispanics of low&#xD;
      socio-economic status, are lower than those of the general population. Depression treatment&#xD;
      that is specifically adapted for the Hispanic culture may be best at helping diabetic&#xD;
      Hispanics stick to their treatment and self-care plans. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of culturally adapted depression treatment for reducing depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      improving adherence to diabetes self-care regimens in low-income Hispanics with depression&#xD;
      and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 18 months. All participants will first undergo baseline&#xD;
      assessments that will include a 40-minute interview about personal health and feelings.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then be assigned randomly to receive either collaborative&#xD;
      depression care management or enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to receive collaborative depression care management will first be&#xD;
      provided with information about depression treatment. Participants will then have the option&#xD;
      of choosing between two depression treatments: counseling or antidepressant medications.&#xD;
      Participants who choose to receive treatment with counseling will receive eight weekly&#xD;
      45-minute counseling sessions, conducted either on the phone or at the clinic. During these&#xD;
      sessions, participants will undergo structured problem solving therapy (PST) and will learn&#xD;
      strategies to manage their depressive symptoms. Participants who choose to receive treatment&#xD;
      with antidepressant medication will be prescribed medication by a study doctor and will be&#xD;
      monitored for any side effects throughout treatment. Medication treatment may last up to 12&#xD;
      months but will depend upon participants' severity of depression. After completing medication&#xD;
      treatment, participants will be offered PST counseling. All participants receiving&#xD;
      collaborative depression care management will also receive supportive patient navigation&#xD;
      services and maintenance/relapse telephone monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to enhanced usual care will receive an educational pamphlet on&#xD;
      depression and a list of mental health resources in the community. Participants' primary care&#xD;
      doctors will be free to prescribe antidepressant medication or provide other usual care. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo follow-up phone interviews about their status at Months 6, 12, and&#xD;
      18.&#xD;
