      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke and myocardial infarction are leading causes of death and disability in the&#xD;
      industrialized countries. Multiple interactions exist between the various forms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and several risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      stroke and major cardiovascular diseases are similar, as emphasized by the recent publication&#xD;
      of a common set of guidelines for the primary prevention of both. Following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction the stroke incidence is markedly increased, particular early after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Additionally, non-stroke cardiovascular disease, especially coronary artery&#xD;
      disease, is the main cause of long-term mortality in patients surviving cerebrovascular&#xD;
      diseases. The history of ischemic heart disease in stroke patients is often unreliable&#xD;
      because of cognitive and language impairments or simply because ischemic heart disease is&#xD;
      asymptomatic. For at least 25 years myocardial damage has repeatedly been proposed as a&#xD;
      consequence of an acute stroke, i.e. being neuromediated. Most prior studies were performed&#xD;
      in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and consequently only limited data regarding&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, the most common cerebrovascular ailment, are available. Recently it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that highly sensitive and specific markers for the detection of myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis, i.e., cardiac troponins, may be elevated in 0 % - 34 % of patients with ischemic&#xD;
      stroke. However, the majority of the studies conducted have not sufficiently evaluated&#xD;
      coexisting coronary artery disease. The neuromediated theory has been supported in patients&#xD;
      with subarachnoid hemorrhage and elevated troponin levels due to lack of significant&#xD;
      obstructive coronary artery disease evaluated by coronary angiograms. Little is known about a&#xD;
      conceivable cause-effect relationship between acute ischemic stroke and myocardial necrosis,&#xD;
      i.e., neuromediation, or if the elevated levels of troponin are caused by direct cardiac&#xD;
      damage, i.e., AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several reports have demonstrated that levels of natriuretic peptides are increased&#xD;
      in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The hormone Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and its&#xD;
      split product (NT-proBNP) derives predominantly from the myocardium and is processed as a&#xD;
      response to stretch of cardiomyocytes and hemodynamic stress. The mechanism of elevated&#xD;
      levels of NT-proBNP in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is unknown. Myocardial ischemia&#xD;
      is known to cause release of NT-proBNP. Accordingly, levels of NT-proBNP are higher in acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke patients with ST-segment depression on 12-lead ECG than in those without.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown whether levels of NT-proBNP are correlated to coronary&#xD;
      arteriosclerosis and left ventricle function in patients with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard for the detection of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD),&#xD;
      invasive coronary angiography (CAG), allows direct visualization of the coronary artery&#xD;
      lumen. Inconvenience to patients and a small but not negligible risk of complications related&#xD;
      to CAG have prompted an intensive search for alternative, reliable non-invasive means of&#xD;
      coronary artery visualisation. Standard non-invasive methods such as stress testing lack&#xD;
      sufficient sensitivity in detecting significant CAD. Over the last decade multislice computed&#xD;
      tomography (MSCT) has emerged as a promising non-invasive method in the assessment of CAD.&#xD;
      Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated a very high negative predictive value of MSCT&#xD;
      coronary angiography (CTA) with CAG as the reference. Thus, a normal CTA seems to allow the&#xD;
      clinician to rule out the presence of hemodynamic relevant coronary artery stenoses with a&#xD;
      high degree of reliability. In addition to detecting significant coronary artery stenosis,&#xD;
      recent focus has been on visualising and characterising coronary artery plaques. Both&#xD;
      necropsy and coronary intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies have shown that &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      vessels at CAG may in fact contain a significant amount of atherosclerotic plaques.&#xD;
      Independent of the degree of coronary artery stenosis, some plaques may be at increased risk&#xD;
      of erosion or rupture. The latter, unstable plaques are thought to trigger acute coronary&#xD;
      ischemic events. Accordingly, the release of troponins, NT-proBNP and ECG changes observed in&#xD;
      these patients could be due to CAD. So far serial investigation of CAD has never been&#xD;
      performed in patients with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      All patients included in the study will have a computed tomography scan performed at the time&#xD;
      of admission. The patients included undergo a baseline clinical evaluation, a structured&#xD;
      interview and examination of medical records focusing at&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyslipidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemic heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Angina Pectoris (CCS classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart failure (NYHA- and KILLIP-classification)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12-lead resting ECG is obtained immediately on admission and up to each of the following&#xD;
      five days in the morning. The 12-lead resting ECGs were recorded in the supine position with&#xD;
      a paper speed of 25 mm/s. All ECGs are interpreted by two experienced cardiologist under&#xD;
      blinded conditions. The ECG findings of interest in this thesis are horizontal or downsloping&#xD;
      ST-segment depression ≥0.1 mV, T-wave inversion ≥0.1 mV in two or more contiguous leads, and&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation ≥0.2 mV in leads V1-3; ST-elevation ≥0.1 mV in other leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holter 24-hour ECG recordings are performed with Reynolds Medical Tracker 3 and a Pathfinder&#xD;
      700 (Reynolds Medical Limited, England) for analysis. An ischemic episode is defined as ≥0.1&#xD;
      mV of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression compared to baseline, measured 80 ms&#xD;
      after the J-point. An episode of ST-segment depression has to last ≥2 minutes in order to&#xD;
      count and two episodes have to be separated by at least two minutes. In patients with resting&#xD;
      ST-segment depression additional ≥0.1 mV ST-segment depression has to be present. Every&#xD;
      episode of ST-segment deviation is verified by ECG printouts (25 mm/s). Furthermore, Holter&#xD;
      monitoring will be analyzed for occurrence of atrial arrhythmias. Evaluation of ischemic and&#xD;
      arrhythmias episodes is interpreted visually by two cardiologist blinded to other patient&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are drawn immediately on admission and up to each of the following five days in&#xD;
      the morning. Specimens for NT-proBNP, troponin T and I, CK-MB, myeloperoxidase, oxidated&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein, osteoprotegerin are collected. All analyses are performed at the&#xD;
      Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Vejle Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography will be performed as soon as the patient condition allows.&#xD;
      Examinations will be performed on a GE medical Vivid 7 ultrasound machine. Images will be&#xD;
      obtained from the parasternal and apical windows. M-mode recordings will be done in the&#xD;
      parasternal long-axis view. Pulsed Doppler measurements of mitral inflow will be obtained&#xD;
      with the transducer in the apical four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume&#xD;
      placed between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler imaging of the&#xD;
      mitral annulus will be obtained from the apical 4-chamber view with a 1.5-mm sample volume&#xD;
      placed at the medial mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic examinations are done with&#xD;
      horizontal sweep set to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles will be measured. Finally color&#xD;
      coded real time tissue Doppler images will be acquired in the apical windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-systolic, end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction will be calculated according to&#xD;
           the Simpson modified biplane method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LV mass will be estimated using the recommendations of the American Society of&#xD;
           Echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two&#xD;
           orthogonal apical views.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity, peak A wave velocity,&#xD;
           and mitral E-wave deceleration time will be measured. From pulsed wave Doppler recording&#xD;
           of LV outflow ejection time will be recorded. From these recordings Tei index will be&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and size of inferior v. cava pulmonary arterial&#xD;
           systolic pressure will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E') diastolic&#xD;
           velocity will be recorded. Diastolic function will be graded in grades 0-3 and diastolic&#xD;
           E/e' ratio calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From color coded tissue Doppler images systolic longitudinal fibre shortening will be&#xD;
           assessed using tissue tracking, and systolic strain will be assessed on a regional&#xD;
           basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multislice computed tomography coronary angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations are performed at the Department of Cardiology, Vejle Hospital with dual source&#xD;
      CT (DSCT) scanner technology (Siemens Definition; Forcheim, Germany). Tube voltage is 120kV&#xD;
      for both tubes, current 560 mA with modulation and full current between 25 % - 80 % of the RR&#xD;
      interval. Gantry rotation time is 330 msec, pitch is 0.20-0.44 according to the heart rate.&#xD;
      Per rotation 64 slices are generated with a collimation of 0.6 mm resulting in an isotropic&#xD;
      voxel size of approximately 0.6 mm. A bodyweight adapted volume of contrast agent (Iomeron&#xD;
      350) is injected continuously at rate of 5 ml /sec. The scan is initiated according to a&#xD;
      bolus tracking protocol (aortic root attenuation level of 100 HU). Axial images are&#xD;
      reconstructed with 0.75 mm slice thickness, and a 0.5 mm increment using a medium sharp&#xD;
      kernel (B26) and retrospective ECG gating. The reconstructions are performed in 5 % steps&#xD;
      over the relevant part of the RR cycle using a single-segment algorithm. In case of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, data sets were reconstructed in 50 ms steps. Using a semi-automated Hounsfield&#xD;
      dependent algorithm, differentiation between contrast enhanced lumen, vessel wall and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques, is performed. Atherosclerotic plaques will be categorized into&#xD;
      calcified (&gt;130 HU, high density plaque), non-calcified (&lt; 60 HU, low density plaque), and&#xD;
      mixed-type plaques (60-130 HU, intermediate density plaque), respectively. According to an&#xD;
      American Heart Association 17 segmental coronary artery model, stenoses &gt; 50 % or &gt; 75 % are&#xD;
      registered. Main coronary vessels (left main, left anterior descending artery, circumflex,&#xD;
      and the right coronary artery) and side branches with a lumen diameter &gt; 1, 5 mm are&#xD;
      analysed. Image quality will be assessed as good (no artefacts related to motion,&#xD;
      calcification or noise), satisfactory (artefacts present, but assessment of artery stenosis&#xD;
      possible), or unsatisfactory (artefacts compromising the evaluation of artery stenosis).&#xD;
      Images are analysed by two independent observes without knowledge of the patient history.&#xD;
