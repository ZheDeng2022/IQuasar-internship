      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous suicide attempts is a high-risk factor with a repetition rate between 12-30 percent.&#xD;
      Compliance with after treatment is often poor. A systematic review by Hawton, 1999 states a&#xD;
      lack of evidence on psychosocial interventions due to selections bias or statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate if assertive outreach, incorporating hands-on guidance and&#xD;
      motivational support of compliance with follow-up treatment after suicide attempts is able to&#xD;
      reduce the frequency of non-fatal and fatal suicide acts in a one-year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, controlled intervention trial in a prospective design. The patients included&#xD;
      will be randomized to either standard treatment (n = 120) or intervention treatment (N =&#xD;
      120), representing 6 - 8 assertive outreach contacts with a research nurse after suicide&#xD;
      attempts or deliberate self-harm. The outreach contacts are thought of as supporting and&#xD;
      guiding home visits towards compliance with after care or follow-up treatment Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria Males and females, aged 12 years or older with a recent suicide attempt or act of&#xD;
      deliberate self-harm, living independently and not diagnosed with severe mental illness&#xD;
      (psychosis, severe dementia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is repeated fatal suicidal act (fatal or non fatal)assessed by&#xD;
      the Danish Cause of Death Register and the rate of repeated suicide attempts/deliberate&#xD;
      self-harm registered in the medical records by the collaborating wards and units in their&#xD;
      routine procedure of treating people applying for help in relation to suicidal behavior.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS/HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate if assertive outreach incorporating hands-on guidance&#xD;
      and motivational support of compliance with follow-up treatment after suicide attempts is&#xD;
      able to reduce the frequency of non-fatal and fatal suicide acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidal behavior is associated with considerable risk of subsequent self-harm, including&#xD;
      completed suicide. Owens et al. (Owens, Horrocks, &amp; House 2002a) conducted a systematic&#xD;
      review of fatal and non-fatal repetition of self-harm. Owens found that the median one-year&#xD;
      repetition rate was 16 percent non-fatal and two percent fatal. Results from the&#xD;
      epidemiological European Multicentre Study (WHO/EURO) also shows a repetition rate between 12&#xD;
      and 30 percent within the first year, making suicide attempts a very important high-risk&#xD;
      factor (Cedereke, Monti, &amp; Ojehagen 2002;Schmidtke et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately there are still very few randomized controlled trials with evidence based&#xD;
      recommendations for suicide prevention. The studies conducted are often flawed due to&#xD;
      selection bias or lack statistical power (Crawford et al. 2007;Hawton et al. 1998b;van der et&#xD;
      al. 1997). A systematic review of randomised clinical trials of psychosocial and&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions for persons who have attempted suicide revealed that until now,&#xD;
      no intervention has proven effective in reducing suicide rate or repetition rate (Hawton et&#xD;
      al. 1999). The authors identified non-significant trends toward reduced repetition of&#xD;
      deliberate self-harm for problem-solving therapy compared with standard aftercare, for&#xD;
      provision of an emergency contact card in addition to standard care compared with standard&#xD;
      aftercare alone, and for intensive aftercare plus outreach compared with standard aftercare.&#xD;
      In one relatively large study in this group, which evaluated community follow-up of patients&#xD;
      who did not attend outpatient appointments, there was a near significant difference in&#xD;
      repetition of deliberate self-harm of 10.7 percent compared with 17.4 percent (0.57; 0.32 to&#xD;
      1.02), (Van Heeringen et al. 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hawton et al. concluded that the results of the systematic review indicate that there is&#xD;
      currently insufficient evidence on which to base firm recommendations about the most&#xD;
      effective forms of treatment for patients who have recently deliberately harmed themselves.&#xD;
      Given the size of the problem, they consider this situation serious (Hawton, Townsend,&#xD;
      Arensman, Gunnell, Hazell, House, &amp; Van Heeringen 1999). The main problem with nearly all&#xD;
      trials in the meta-analysis was that they included far too few subjects to have the&#xD;
      statistical power to detect clinically meaningful differences in rates of repetition of&#xD;
      deliberate self-harm between experimental and control treatments, if such differences&#xD;
      existed. Even when the results from similar trials were synthesized with meta-analytical&#xD;
      techniques, there were insufficient numbers of patients to detect such differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the Cochrane review, six randomised clinical trials have been published, among them the&#xD;
      POPMATC study, which has a large sample size of 480 patients. The study examines the effect&#xD;
      of up to five plus two booster sessions of manual-assisted cognitive-behavioral-therapy&#xD;
      sessions versus various control conditions, some of which bear some resemblance to cognitive&#xD;
      therapy (problem solving). In the study, there was no significant difference in repetition of&#xD;
      self-harm between experimental group and control group (Tyrer et al. 2003). In a randomised&#xD;
      clinical trial, Brown et al. found that cognitive therapy (mean 9 sessions) for adults who&#xD;
      attempted suicide (N=120) reduced repetition rate and increased the repetition-free period&#xD;
      (Brown et al. 2005). Recently, Vaiva et al. published the results of a large French&#xD;
      multi-centre trial in which telephone contact after one and three months were compared to&#xD;
      standard treatment (Vaiva et al. 2006). Comparison of both experimental groups combined&#xD;
      versus standard treatment did not show that telephone contact was superior to standard&#xD;
      treatment, but the authors point out that there was a significant difference between the&#xD;
      proportion that repeated suicide attempt in the one-month telephone call group compared to&#xD;
      control treatment in the first 6 months of the trial. The odds ratios in all trials point in&#xD;
      the same direction, namely toward a protective effect of the experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As pointed out by Hawton, it might be necessary for such conditions to be combined with&#xD;
      assertive outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD, DESIGN AND PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AID-study is a randomized, clinical trial. The patients included will be centrally&#xD;
      randomized to either standard treatment (n = 120) or intervention treatment (N = 120),&#xD;
      representing 6 - 8 assertive outreach contacts after suicide attempts or deliberate&#xD;
      self-harm. The randomization is computerized and will, in prevention of allocation bias, be&#xD;
      conducted by an independent research assistant in the research unit. The intervention team&#xD;
      therefore will not know the block size of the study groups. The randomization is stratified&#xD;
      for three items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First-evers or previous suicide attempts,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous psychiatric contact or no contact of the kind,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Alcohol or no alcohol involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification variables will reported when calling the research assistant in charge of the&#xD;
      randomization. The research assistant in turn will provide the intervention team with the&#xD;
      assigned treatment and participant number. The intervention team is not blinded. The patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from the emergency room, intensive care, psychiatric emergency room as well&#xD;
      as those admitted to psychiatric wards. After discharge they will be contacted by mail or&#xD;
      phone at home. The experimental intervention treatment will go on for the first six months&#xD;
      followed by six months of no contact. One year from the inclusion date both patients in&#xD;
      standard treatment and intervention treatment will receive a final call focusing on on-going&#xD;
      compliance with follow-up treatment. Sociodemographic data, medical status, information&#xD;
      concerning abuse, previous psychiatric treatment and previous suicide attempts will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION - ASSERTIVE OUTREACH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colleagues in Norway have developed a preventive intervention focusing on the 'gap' between&#xD;
      admission/emergency room and outpatient treatment (Dieserud, Loeb, &amp; Ekeberg 2000). The&#xD;
      Bærum-model is named after the suburb north of Oslo where the intervention first took place.&#xD;
      The concept is to support and guide the person shortly after the in-hospital treatment for&#xD;
      self-injury through a recommended follow-up or after treatment based on assertive principles.&#xD;
      Poor compliance with treatment is addressed using active, caring individual support to assist&#xD;
      clients with feelings of being abandoned, depressed, shame, and ambivalent (Dieserud, Loeb, &amp;&#xD;
      Ekeberg 2000). The Bærum-model has never previously been as researched in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study (Dieserud, Loeb, &amp; Ekeberg 2001). Knowing that the precipitating factors for&#xD;
      suicide are diverse, the prevention strategies have to be likewise. The Bærum-model is a&#xD;
      psychosocial approach to suicide prevention that underlines the need for intervention&#xD;
      tailored according to individual client needs. The intervention is an indicated prevention&#xD;
      strategy targeting people with suicide attempts and deliberate self-harm as a high-risk&#xD;
      group. They will be offered 6-8 assertive outreach contacts. The outreach contacts will be&#xD;
      home visits focusing on providing support and motivating patients to comply with follow-up&#xD;
      treatment. However, depending on individual needs, the contacts may include or be substituted&#xD;
      with admittance to alcohol units, somatic/oncological treatment, counselling with a family&#xD;
      doctor, family meetings and so on. The main target of the intervention is to encourage and&#xD;
      ensure that the patient will be referred and accompanied to the necessary treatment and&#xD;
      actually receive the recommended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARD TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard treatment consists of referral to a range of different treatment modalities&#xD;
      depending on the diagnosis and clinical and social condition of the patient. In standard&#xD;
      treatment there is no procedure for ensuring that the patient will actually receive the&#xD;
      recommended treatment. Patients are often referred to available treatment modalities such as&#xD;
      general practitioner, psychological treatment, treatment for alcohol abuse, and most often,&#xD;
      the patients are themselves responsible for getting into contact with the treatment to which&#xD;
      they are referred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the number of suicides assessed by the Danish death-register&#xD;
      and the rate of repeated suicide attempts/deliberate self-harm registered by the&#xD;
      collaborating wards and units in their routine procedure of treating people applying for help&#xD;
      in relation to suicide behaviour. (Standardized hospital registration procedure). Where it is&#xD;
      not clear if the act was a suicide attempt medical an external evaluation committee will&#xD;
      review records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL POWER&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alfa is assessed to 0.05 and beta to 0.2, which gives a power of 80 percent (power = 100-&#xD;
      beta). According to international literature(Hawton et al. 1998a;Owens, Horrocks, &amp; House&#xD;
      2002b) the expected repetition rate (primary outcome) will be 30 percent in the standard&#xD;
      group and 15 percent in the intervention group at one year. Calculated that requires 120&#xD;
      people in each randomization treatment group(Dupont &amp; Plummer, Jr. 1990), which makes 240&#xD;
      people included all together. Primary outcome based on register data and medical records&#xD;
      dropout does not have to be accounted for. The data collection period will be limited to 2&#xD;
      years. Patients will be drawn from two University Hospitals in Copenhagen and based on&#xD;
      routine registration; it is likely that we will be able to recruit 240 patients in a two-year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical survival analysis will be used for investigating the differences in repeated&#xD;
      fatal and non-fatal acts of self harm between the standard group and the intervention group.&#xD;
      Cox-regression analysis will be used to investigate differences between the two groups in the&#xD;
      frequency of suicidal behaviour (suicide, suicide attempts and deliberate self-harm).&#xD;
      Analysis will be adjusted for confounding factors such as gender, age, and treatment with&#xD;
      antidepressants. The survival rates for the two randomization groups will be illustrated by a&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meyer Plot. Chi-square-test, Mann-Whitney and T-test will be used in the analysis of&#xD;
      compliance intensity in both standard and intervention groups.&#xD;
