    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the bioequivalence of Norgestimate (NGM) and Ethinyl&#xD;
      Estradiol (EE) in 2 formulations of 250 mcg NGM/25 mcg EE, 1 without folic acid and 1&#xD;
      containing 400 mcg folic acid. The pharmacokinetics of blood folate from the formulation of&#xD;
      250 mcg NGM/25 mcg EE containing 400 mcg folic acid and from 400 mcg folic acid administered&#xD;
      alone is characterized.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 3-way&#xD;
      crossover bioequivalence study of a single dose of 250 mcg NGM/25 mcg EE with or without&#xD;
      folic acid. The study consisted of a pretreatment phase (a screening period lasting up to 21&#xD;
      days), an open-label treatment phase (consisting of 3 periods during which a single dose of&#xD;
      study drug was administered followed by up to 72 hours of serial blood sample collections for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic analysis), and a posttreatment phase (consisting of safety evaluations at the&#xD;
      completion of the third open-label treatment period or at early withdrawal). All healthy&#xD;
      volunteers received the following treatments (1 during each period): Treatment A: 250 mcg&#xD;
      NGM/25 mcg EE; Treatment B: 250 mcg NGM/25 mcg EE plus folic acid 400 mcg (combined&#xD;
      formulation); Treatment C: folic acid 400 mcg. Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 6 treatment sequence groups (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, or CBA) on Day 1 of the first&#xD;
      open-label treatment period. Healthy volunteers received a single dose of study drug on Day 1&#xD;
      in each period according to their assigned treatment sequence. There was a washout period&#xD;
      between treatments of at least 4 weeks. Healthy volunteers were confined to the study unit&#xD;
      from the evening before dosing (Day -1) until after vital signs were measured following&#xD;
      collection of the 24-hour (Treatment C) or 48-hour (Treatments A or B) postdose blood sample.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at specified times for 24 hours after dosing for the&#xD;
      determination of plasma levels of folate and for 72 hours after dosing for the determination&#xD;
      of blood levels of norelgestromin (NGMN), and norgestrel (NG) [the active breakdown products&#xD;
      of NGM], and EE. Safety was evaluated based on the following: the incidence, type, and&#xD;
      severity of adverse events; clinical laboratory tests; vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      measurements; and physical and gynecological (including breast) examinations. Oral&#xD;
      temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were measured at screening,&#xD;
      before each dose, and at least 15 minutes after the 24-hour (all treatments) and 48- and&#xD;
      72-hour (healthy volunteers who received Treatments A or B) pharmacokinetic blood samples in&#xD;
      each period, or at early withdrawal. In Period 3, the end-of-study assessments were&#xD;
      considered the 24-hour (for healthy volunteers who received Treatment C) and the 72-hour (for&#xD;
      healthy volunteers who received Treatments A and B) measurements. Physical and gynecologic&#xD;
      examinations and ECG were performed at screening, and at least 1 hour after the last&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic blood sample on Day 58 for healthy volunteers who received Treatment C in&#xD;
      Period 3, on Day 60 for healthy volunteers who received Treatments A or B in Period 3, or at&#xD;
      early withdrawal. Blood samples for blood chemistry, hematology, and urine samples for&#xD;
      urinalysis were collected at screening, after the last pharmacokinetic blood sample on Day 58&#xD;
      for healthy volunteers who received Treatment C in the third treatment period, on Day 60 for&#xD;
      healthy volunteers who received Treatments A or B in Period 3, or at early withdrawal. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study, not including the pretreatment phase, was approximately 9 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment A (250 mcg NGM/25 mcg EE) was administered as a single tablet corresponding to Days&#xD;
      15 to 21 in the commercial dialpak of the OC study drug; Treatment B (250 mcg NGM/25 mcg EE&#xD;
      plus 400 mcg of folic acid) was administered as a single tablet; and Treatment C (400 mcg of&#xD;
      folic acid) was administered as single United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) tablet.&#xD;
