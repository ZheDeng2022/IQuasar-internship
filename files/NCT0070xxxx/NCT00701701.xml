    <textblock>
      An exploratory, open-labeled study of participants with Pompe disease, who had previously&#xD;
      received Myozyme速 (alglucosidase alfa) treatment, to evaluate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      clinical benefit of 2 Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) regimens in combination with Myozyme速.&#xD;
      Eligible participants who were then receiving Myozyme速 therapy were enrolled into the study,&#xD;
      and were followed for a minimum of 18 months on-study (a 6-month ITI treatment module and a&#xD;
      12-month follow-up module on Myozyme速 alone). Eligible participants were followed for a&#xD;
      minimum of 18 months on treatment or, if a participant was &lt;6 months of age at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment, until the participant was 2 years of age. Both cross-reacting immunologic&#xD;
      material (CRIM)-negative and CRIM-positive participants were eligible for Regimen A depending&#xD;
      if they met the required criteria. Regimen B, however, was limited to CRIM-negative&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any undesirable physical, psychological, or behavioral effect experienced by participant during his/her participation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the use of the drug or biologic, whether or not product-related. TEAEs were defined as AEs that occurred or worsened during the on-treatment period (time from the start of investigational medicinal product [IMP] administration up to 18 months). Serious AE (SAE) was any AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, was life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; or important medical events that may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above; and/or new invasive ventilator use.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Recombinant Human Acid Alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) Inhibitory Antibody at Month 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with positive anti-rhGAA IgG antibody were planned to be assessed for the presence of inhibitory antibodies (inhibition of enzyme activity and inhibition of enzyme uptake). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure inhibition of rhGAA enzymatic activity in vitro and a cell-based assay was used to measure the inhibition of the uptake of rhGAA in normal fibroblast cells by flow cytometry.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until death or study cut-off whichever comes earlier (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time interval from the date of first IMP administration to the date of death due to any cause.</description>

    <measure>Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) Z-Score and LVM Index</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>LVM Z-score and LVM index were assessed by echocardiograms (ECHOs). LVM Z-Score is an indicator of degree of standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution. The normal range for LVM Z-Score is -2 to 2. Values &lt;-2 or &gt;2 indicate abnormal LVM Z-Score. Values less than 0 (negative values) indicate a smaller LVM than mean and values higher than 0 indicate a larger LVM than the mean. LVM index is an index value derived by normalizing LVM by body surface area. LVM index provides evidence of cardiomyopathy. LVM index values &lt;65 gram per square meter (g/m^2) were considered as normal and LVM index values &gt;=65 g/m^2 were considered as abnormal.</description>

    <measure>Gross Motor Disability Assessed by Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>GMFM-88 is an 88-item measure to detect gross motor function. It consists of 5 categories: lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; and walking, running and jumping. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0=cannot do; 1=initiates [&lt;10 percent (%) of the task]; 2=partially completes [10% to &lt;100% of the task]; 3=task completion). The score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. Total score is obtained by adding the percentage scores for each dimension and dividing the sum by the total number of dimensions. Total score ranges from 0% to 100%, where higher scores indicate better motor functions. A total score of &lt;7.5% demonstrates gross motor disability.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Development Status Assessed by Alberta Infantile Motor Scale (AIMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS is a 58-item reliable and valid measure of motor development for infants at risk for motor delay. It assesses infant movement in 4 positions (subscales): prone (reciprocal crawling); supine (moving hands to feet); sitting (sitting with arm support); and standing (pulls to stand). For each subscale, items are scored as &quot;observed&quot; or &quot;not observed&quot;. Items in observed range create a motor window. When scoring, subscale scores are calculated by giving child credit (1 point) for observed items within motor window in addition to being given credit (1 point) for all of the less mature items before motor window. AIMS total score is calculated by summing scores for 58 items and ranges from 0-58, with lower score indicating less mature motor development and higher score indicating more mature motor development.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Disability Index Assessed by the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pompe PEDI is a disease specific version of PEDI which assesses functional capabilities and performance in children with Pompe disease from 2 months through adolescence.It consists of all items of original PEDI (197 functional skill items in 3 domains: self-care; mobility; and social function) and additional items in functional skills, mobility, and self-care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional skills. Each domain consists of 2 subdomains: functional skill performance and caregiver assistance scale. Norm-based scoring was developed for these additional items, and scoring algorithms for PEDI have been adjusted to reflect additional normative data collected for Pompe PEDI. Total score range for each domain (mean of subdomains) and subdomains ranges from 0-100, higher score indicates higher capability.</description>

        <description>GMFM-88 is an 88-item measure to detect gross motor function. It consists of 5 categories: lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; and walking, running and jumping. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0=cannot do; 1=initiates [&lt;10 percent (%) of the task]; 2=partially completes [10% to &lt;100% of the task]; 3=task completion). The score for each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension. Total score is obtained by adding the percentage scores for each dimension and dividing the sum by the total number of dimensions. Total score ranges from 0% to 100%, where higher scores indicate better motor functions. A total score of &lt;7.5% demonstrates gross motor disability.</description>

        <title>Motor Development Status Assessed by Alberta Infantile Motor Scale (AIMS) Score</title>
        <description>AIMS is a 58-item reliable and valid measure of motor development for infants at risk for motor delay. It assesses infant movement in 4 positions (subscales): prone (reciprocal crawling); supine (moving hands to feet); sitting (sitting with arm support); and standing (pulls to stand). For each subscale, items are scored as &quot;observed&quot; or &quot;not observed&quot;. Items in observed range create a motor window. When scoring, subscale scores are calculated by giving child credit (1 point) for observed items within motor window in addition to being given credit (1 point) for all of the less mature items before motor window. AIMS total score is calculated by summing scores for 58 items and ranges from 0-58, with lower score indicating less mature motor development and higher score indicating more mature motor development.</description>

        <title>Disability Index Assessed by the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) Score</title>
        <description>Pompe PEDI is a disease specific version of PEDI which assesses functional capabilities and performance in children with Pompe disease from 2 months through adolescence.It consists of all items of original PEDI (197 functional skill items in 3 domains: self-care; mobility; and social function) and additional items in functional skills, mobility, and self-care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional skills. Each domain consists of 2 subdomains: functional skill performance and caregiver assistance scale. Norm-based scoring was developed for these additional items, and scoring algorithms for PEDI have been adjusted to reflect additional normative data collected for Pompe PEDI. Total score range for each domain (mean of subdomains) and subdomains ranges from 0-100, higher score indicates higher capability.</description>

In Regimen A, participants received alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme速) IV infusion of 20 mg/kg qow for a minimum of 18 months or, until the participant reached the age of 2 years (if the participant was &lt;6 months of age at the time of enrollment). In addition, cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m^2 IV infusion was administered q4w after Myozyme速 infusion for 6 months.</description>

          <title>Disability Index Assessed by the Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) Score</title>
          <description>Pompe PEDI is a disease specific version of PEDI which assesses functional capabilities and performance in children with Pompe disease from 2 months through adolescence.It consists of all items of original PEDI (197 functional skill items in 3 domains: self-care; mobility; and social function) and additional items in functional skills, mobility, and self-care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional skills. Each domain consists of 2 subdomains: functional skill performance and caregiver assistance scale. Norm-based scoring was developed for these additional items, and scoring algorithms for PEDI have been adjusted to reflect additional normative data collected for Pompe PEDI. Total score range for each domain (mean of subdomains) and subdomains ranges from 0-100, higher score indicates higher capability.</description>
