      Hepatocellular cancer, one of the world's most deadly tumors, is associated with chronic&#xD;
      liver injury and cirrhosis. With the increasing occurrence of viral hepatitis, the incidence&#xD;
      of this cancer in the United States continues to rise. Surgical resection offers the only&#xD;
      hope for cure; but sadly, few patients are candidates for surgery due to their liver disease.&#xD;
      Liver transplant can be an effective treatment, but due to a scarcity of organs, most&#xD;
      patients do not qualify for this therapy either. Patients who are not candidates for these&#xD;
      procedures have very few therapeutic options as chemotherapy and radiation have little&#xD;
      efficacy. New therapies are desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid Growth Factor (OGF) inhibits the growth of a number of cancer lines in vitro by a&#xD;
      receptor-mediated mechanism. In pancreatic cancer this phenomenon has been well defined not&#xD;
      only in vitro but in animal models. Based upon these findings, a phase I trial has been&#xD;
      conducted demonstrating that OGF can be administered safely to patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators hypothesize that administration of OGF will inhibit the course of&#xD;
      cancer progression in human subjects with unresectable hepatocellular cancer and cirrhosis.&#xD;
      As a first step in testing this hypothesis, the investigators propose a phase I trial to&#xD;
      study the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of this therapy in patients suffering from inoperable&#xD;
      hepatocellular cancer and cirrhosis.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers in the&#xD;
      world. About 19,160 new cases are anticipated to occur in the US in 2007. Any form of chronic&#xD;
      liver injury and cirrhosis predisposes to the development of this malignancy. Worldwide, the&#xD;
      most common risk factor is viral hepatitis; in the United States other sources of chronic&#xD;
      liver injury such as cirrhosis related to alcohol use are important, but the incidence of&#xD;
      viral hepatitis continues to increase. Regardless of the etiology, the only known cure for&#xD;
      HCC is surgical resection. Unfortunately, due to associated liver disease and stage of tumor&#xD;
      progression at the time of diagnosis, very few patients are candidates for surgical therapy.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy has shown very little efficacy in this disease, and radiation is of little value&#xD;
      due to associated liver toxicity. New therapies are desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research examining the mechanisms involved in the growth of human cancer has shown that the&#xD;
      peptide [Met5]-enkephalin, Opioid Growth Factor (OGF), inhibits growth of a number of cancer&#xD;
      lines in vitro. In pancreatic cancer this phenomenon has been well defined not only in vitro&#xD;
      but in vivo after transfer of human tumors into nude mice. The suppressive effect on growth&#xD;
      by this peptide is by a receptor-mediated mechanism. Based upon these findings, a phase I&#xD;
      trial has been conducted studying the effects of OGF in patients with pancreatic cancer. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that administration of OGF will inhibit the course of carcinogenic events in&#xD;
      human subjects with unresectable hepatocellular cancer and cirrhosis. In order to test this&#xD;
      hypothesis we propose a phase I trial to study the toxicity of this therapy in patients&#xD;
      suffering from liver disease and cirrhosis addressing the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of OGF after an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion in patients suffering from HCC. While the MTD has been determined for patients&#xD;
      suffering from pancreatic cancer, it is unclear that these results will hold true in patients&#xD;
      with HCC who suffer from liver insufficiency and cirrhosis. For this reason we will conduct a&#xD;
      dose-finding trial that contains dose-escalation of OGF. Dose-limiting toxicities will be&#xD;
      determined by monitoring liver function, pupillary size &amp; response, respiration, vital signs&#xD;
      (orthostatic blood pressure and pulse), gastrointestinal distress, cutaneous flushing, and&#xD;
      effects on blood count, glucose and electrolytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Study the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of OGF in patients with HCC and&#xD;
      cirrhosis by monitoring plasma OGF levels. Blood samples will be collected prior to and at&#xD;
      designated intervals after an infusion of the MTD of OGF in cancer patients. OGF plasma&#xD;
      levels will be analyzed by performing radioimmunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objectives of our research team are to understand the effects of peptide growth&#xD;
      factors in patients with HCC and cirrhosis. This phase I trial will be useful in determining&#xD;
      the appropriate dose and expected toxicities of OGF in these patients. Our study employs the&#xD;
      use of a naturally occurring opioid peptide, which has been shown to inhibit growth of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer in preclinical studies, and to be safely administered to patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common&#xD;
      malignancy in the world; five hundred thousand people succumb to this malignancy annually.&#xD;
      The incidence and mortality rates are almost equal, which demonstrates that very few patients&#xD;
      are cured. Any form of chronic liver injury and cirrhosis predisposes to the development of&#xD;
      this malignancy. The major risk factors for HCC are chronic hepatitis B virus infection,&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and alcoholic cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only known cure for HCC is surgical resection. The patient's degree of cirrhosis and the&#xD;
      anatomic location of tumor determine if partial hepatectomy can be performed. Even at high&#xD;
      volume centers specializing in the procedure, operative mortality has been shown to increase&#xD;
      from 1% to 14% in the presence of cirrhosis (1). For this reason, resection is usually&#xD;
      reserved for patients with Child's A liver function. Multiple lesions do not preclude&#xD;
      resection. Intraductal tumors causing obstructive jaundice can be successfully resected. In&#xD;
      this situation, it is important to distinguish obstruction from underlying liver disease as&#xD;
      the cause of the patient's jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total hepatectomy followed by orthotropic liver transplantation is a sensible strategy to&#xD;
      treat patients with cirrhosis and cancer, and experience is growing with this approach. As&#xD;
      expected, the best results have been recorded in patients who had small HCC discovered&#xD;
      incidentally at transplantation performed for liver failure. Lesions smaller than 5 cm&#xD;
      treated by transplantation have a significantly better prognosis, and, because organs are&#xD;
      scarce, transplantation for HCC us usually limited to this setting. Mazzaferro et al have&#xD;
      reported liver transplantation as an effective treatment for small, unresectable HCC in&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis, with 4-year recurrence-free survival of 83%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, 90% of patients are not suitable for resection or transplantation with a&#xD;
      curative intent (2-6), and these patients have very few therapeutic options of proven&#xD;
      efficacy. In this setting the prognosis is extremely poor, with median survivals as low as 3&#xD;
      months in high-incidence areas (5-8). No systemic chemotherapeutic regimens have demonstrated&#xD;
      significant efficacy. Response rates to single-agent and multidrug protocols, with or without&#xD;
      biologic response modifiers, are no better than 20% to 30% (9-12)and randomized trials do not&#xD;
      demonstrate a clear survival benefit (13, 14). Recently, sorafenib was shown to increase&#xD;
      overall survival, from 7.9 months to 10.7 months, in Child's A patients with hepatocellular&#xD;
      cancer (15). External radiation therapy for HCC is ineffective even for palliation (9, 16,&#xD;
      17)because the dose of radiation that can be delivered to the tumor is limited by radiation&#xD;
      hepatitis (18, 19). Hepatic intraarterial infusion of cytotoxic agents, aimed at increasing&#xD;
      the local concentration of drugs and reducing systemic toxicity (20), and intraarterial&#xD;
      embolization, which causes ischemic necrosis of the tumor (21), have been used as palliative&#xD;
      treatment either alone or in combination. Chemoembolization is most often employed on the&#xD;
      basis of reports of decrease in tumor size in nonrandomized trials (22-26); however, the&#xD;
      results of a multi-center randomized trial showed no improvement in overall survival, and&#xD;
      significant morbidity with this therapeutic approach (27). Clearly new therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      are needed to treat this deadly disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endogenous opioid systems participate in the growth of developing cells and tissues,&#xD;
      micro-organisms, tissues that undergo cellular renewal, and in neoplastic cells and tissues&#xD;
      (28, 29). A thorough examination of the effects of opioid peptides in pancreatic cancer cells&#xD;
      growing in tissue culture revealed that [Met5]- enkephalin, a pentapeptide was the most&#xD;
      potent peptide influencing DNA synthesis and growth; in view of its growth factor action,&#xD;
      [Met5]-enkephalin has been termed opioid growth factor (OGF). OGF interacts with the OGFr&#xD;
      receptor zeta (OGFr) to influence growth. Unlike other opioid receptors, the function (e.g.,&#xD;
      growth), distribution (neural and non-neural), transient appearance during ontogeny, ligand&#xD;
      specificity (i.e., [Met5]- enkephalin), competitive inhibition profile, subcellular location&#xD;
      (i.e., nucleus), and the fact that ligands for other known opioid receptors do not influence&#xD;
      growth have provided a unique set of characteristics that distinguish the OGFr from other&#xD;
      opioid receptors. It has been demonstrated that opioids function as inhibitory growth factors&#xD;
      in human pancreatic cancer, both in vitro and in vivo (28, 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Met5]-enkephalin has been safely used in several pilot studies to treat human subjects with&#xD;
      cancer. Wybran and Schandene (31) administered [Met5]-enkephalin intravenously to seven&#xD;
      previously untreated patients with lung cancer and found significant increases in T-cell&#xD;
      immunity (i.e., OK1 0 cells. Leu11 cells, and natural killer cells). Plotnikoff and&#xD;
      colleagues (32) administered [Met5]-enkephalin over a period of several months by intravenous&#xD;
      infusions at doses of 10 to 60 pg/kg body weight three times weekly to human subjects with&#xD;
      advanced melanoma. Plotnikoff and coworkers (33) and Wybran and coworkers (31) have reported&#xD;
      improvement in the size and coloration of Kaposi's sarcoma nodules in AIDS patients. In&#xD;
      addition, [Met5]-enkephalin increased the number of cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells involved&#xD;
      in tumor surveillance. The tumor response in these human studies has been attributed to&#xD;
      [Met5]-enkephalin's action on the immune system (31, 34). Most recently, a phase I study has&#xD;
      demonstrated that OGF can be delivered safely to patients suffering from advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer (30) and is now being given in a phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team has demonstrated both the presence and the function of the Opioid Growth&#xD;
      Factor (OGF)-OGF receptor (OGFr) system in human hepatocellular carcinoma. First,&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry staining of human hepatocellular cell lines SK-Hep-1 and HepG2 cells&#xD;
      revealed specific distribution of both OGF and OGFr. Second, OGFr was detected in receptor&#xD;
      binding studies, and found to have specific and saturable binding of a single binding site,&#xD;
      with binding capacity (Bmax) values of 12.1 +/- 2.7 fmol/mg protein and 9.4 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg&#xD;
      protein and binding affinity (Kd) values of 6.1 +/- 1.1 nM and 5.8 +/- 1.5 nM for SK-Hep-1&#xD;
      and HepG2, respectively. Third, in functional assays that monitored the effects of OGF on&#xD;
      cell number of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, a statistically significant suppression&#xD;
      in cell growth was found in vitro when SK-Hep-1 cell were cultured in the presence of OGF&#xD;
      (appendix 10.7). Based on the previous in vitro and in vivo evidence in pancreatic cancer, as&#xD;
      well as with colon cancer, neuroblastoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,&#xD;
      as well as the successful Phase I trial of OGF in pancreatic cancer patients, these&#xD;
      preliminary data with hepatocellular carcinoma cells are consistent and provide the rationale&#xD;
      to test OGF therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.&#xD;
