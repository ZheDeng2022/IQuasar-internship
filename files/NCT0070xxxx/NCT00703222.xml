  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to test the safety, and immunologic and clinical efficacy of a&#xD;
      combination of 2 allogeneic neuroblastoma tumor cell line vaccines, one of which has been&#xD;
      genetically modified to secrete the cytokine/chemokine combination of IL-2 and lymphotactin,&#xD;
      in patients undergoing chemotherapy for newly diagnosed, high risk neuroblastoma who receive&#xD;
      single autologous stem cell rescue as consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will be carried out as a Phase I/IIa study to evaluate the safety and toxicity&#xD;
      of adding a previously unstudied, unmodified, irradiated neuroblastoma cell line (SKNLP) to a&#xD;
      studied, safe dose of a gene modified, IL-2/Lptn secreting neuroblastoma cell line&#xD;
      SJNB-JF-IL2/Lptn to be given as a vaccine to patients diagnosed with high risk neuroblastoma.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN: Standard Chemotherapy for Neuroblastoma: Standard therapy for neuroblastoma&#xD;
      is given in 3 phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. For enrollment in this&#xD;
      vaccine study patients and their physicians must anticipate therapy that will include&#xD;
      consolidation with high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. They will be eligible for&#xD;
      enrollment in the phase I or phase II trial of vaccination with gene modified and unmodified,&#xD;
      allogeneic neuroblastoma cell lines. Patients will receive Induction, Consolidation, and&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy per their institutional standards. A general description of the therapy&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction: Induction consists of multiple cycles of induction chemotherapy with harvest&#xD;
           of autologous stem cells immediately following a particular cycle of chemotherapy per&#xD;
           institutional standards. Local control of the tumor with radiation therapy and/or&#xD;
           surgery occurs following a few cycles of induction chemotherapy or immediately prior to&#xD;
           consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation: Consolidation must consist of high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem&#xD;
           cell rescue (HDT/SCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance: Starting day +90 after HDT/SCR, patients will be treated with Isotretinoin&#xD;
           (Cis-Retinoic Acid, CRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VACCINE DOSING: Vaccine components SJNB-JF-IL2 and SJNB-JF-Lptn will each be dosed at 1x10e7&#xD;
      cells/m2. This will be given in conjunction with an escalating dose of SKNLP vaccine in the&#xD;
      phase I portion of this study. In the phase II portion of this study, the same dose of&#xD;
      SJNB-JF-IL2 and SJNB-JF-Lptn will be given in conjunction with the highest dose of SKNLP&#xD;
      determined in the phase I portion. Vaccination will be administered on an inpatient or&#xD;
      outpatient basis. Patient will be notified of which dose of vaccine cells they will receive&#xD;
      if enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Dose Escalation Component: While the investigators do not suspect that addition of a&#xD;
      second irradiated, unmodified neuroblastoma tumor cell line to the previously tested SJNB-JF&#xD;
      gene modified cell line will affect the safety profile of the vaccine, as the SKNLP has not&#xD;
      been tested previously in vaccine studies, the investigators will perform an abbreviated dose&#xD;
      escalation study of the combined vaccine to assess safety. The investigators know that the&#xD;
      vaccine given to patients whose neuroblastoma returned was safe. The vaccine that was given&#xD;
      to those patients was treated with the viruses to make cytokines. The investigators have&#xD;
      never used the 2nd cell group in patients. Because of this, the investigators plan to treat 3&#xD;
      to 6 patients at a lower dose of cells to see if adding the second cell line is safe to give.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 1 (3-6 patients) 1x10e6 cells/m2/vaccination dose of SKNLP Unmodified&#xD;
           Neuroblastoma Cell Line Vaccine Component&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Level 2 (3-6 patients) 1x10e7 cells/m2/vaccination dose of SKNLP Unmodified&#xD;
           Neuroblastoma Cell Line Vaccine Component&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SJNB-JF-IL2 and SJNB-JF-Lptn cells are each dosed at 1x10e7 cells/m2/vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy: In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may&#xD;
      continue with immunizations per the treatment plan up to 12 vaccinations or until one of the&#xD;
      following criteria applies: - Disease progression - Intercurrent illness that prevents&#xD;
      further administration of treatment - Unacceptable adverse events(s) including but not&#xD;
      limited to grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity according to CTCAE v3.0. Grade 3 rigors/chills&#xD;
      will be tolerated for 48-72 hours if attributed to vaccination. - Patient decides to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study - General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient&#xD;
      unacceptable for further treatment in the judgement of the investigator.&#xD;
