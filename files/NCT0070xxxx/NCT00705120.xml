    <textblock>
      This protocol was a prospective, Phase I study of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
      (BMT) as the primary therapy for Osteogenesis Imperfecta Types II and III. Compatible sibling&#xD;
      donors and unrelated donors were stratified and analyzed according to the type of donor. All&#xD;
      patients with a sibling donor will received a chemotherapy conditioning regimen; a non-T cell&#xD;
      depleted allogeneic marrow, and GVHD prophylaxis. All patients with an unrelated donor will&#xD;
      receive a chemoradiotherapy conditioning regimen, a T-cell depleted allogeneic marrow, and&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      toxicity of these BMT procedures in this particular population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The secondary objective of the protocol assessed the engraftment of donor mesenchymal cells&#xD;
      and their ability to increase the synthesis of normal type I procollagen relative to the&#xD;
      synthesis of mutated type I procollagen and to assess whether BMT improves the bone structure&#xD;
      and the clinical condition of these patients with OI.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has diagnosis of OI Type II or III. Because there are no specific, defined&#xD;
             clinical criteria consistently used to make this diagnosis, we provide the following&#xD;
             clinical guidelines to assist in diagnosis. Any appropriate combinations of the&#xD;
             following clinical findings will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of OI Type II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antenatal ultrasonography (if performed for other indications) by established&#xD;
             obstetric impressions including short femurs, a small thoracic cage and poorly&#xD;
             mineralized bones. Analysis of collagen synthesized from cultured cells obtained from&#xD;
             chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may establish the diagnosis; however, no CVS will be&#xD;
             performed specifically for enrollment into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical examination including prematurity, low birth weight, characteristic facies&#xD;
             (blue sclera, beaked nose, extremely soft calvarium), &quot;frog-leg&quot; hips, small thoracic&#xD;
             cavity, fractures at birth or shortly thereafter, loose skin or lax joints that cannot&#xD;
             be readily explained by other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic evaluation demonstrating various aspects of the characteristic picture of&#xD;
             telescoped femur, bowed tibias, beaded ribs, flattened vertebral bodies and virtual&#xD;
             absence of calvarial mineralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of OI Type III&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antenatal ultrasonography (performed for other indications) by established obstetric&#xD;
             impressions for this more moderate form of OI. Chorionic villus sampling will be&#xD;
             accepted as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical examination including short stature, bony deformities, many fractures at&#xD;
             birth or shortly thereafter. Blue scleras and dental abnormalities are also common.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiographic abnormalities including thin, osteopenic bones of the limbs with evidence&#xD;
             of fractures, growth plate abnormalities, and an undermineralized calvarium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of other diseases with possibly similar presentation to OI (e.g.&#xD;
             hypophosphatasia and rickets) should be excluded by obtaining a serum calcium,&#xD;
             phosphate and alkaline phosphatase. These parameters can be expected to be within&#xD;
             normal limits (alkaline phosphatase may be somewhat elevated) in patients with OI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age less than 3 years at time of transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents or legal guardians must sign an informed consent indicating that they are&#xD;
             aware this is a research study and have been told of its possible benefits and toxic&#xD;
             side effects, including treatment related mortality. Patients or their guardians will&#xD;
             be given a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identification of a suitable bone marrow donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any donor must be of sufficient size so that adequate bone marrow may be harvested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA mismatched sibling or unrelated donor. DNA typing will be per- formed on unrelated&#xD;
             donors. Donors must be a 6/6 match or a 5/6 match (with serologic mismatch at a single&#xD;
             Class I allele or mismatch at a single DR1 allele).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are ventilatory dependent due to primary lung parenchymal disease prior&#xD;
             to BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of basilar invagination/compression.&#xD;
