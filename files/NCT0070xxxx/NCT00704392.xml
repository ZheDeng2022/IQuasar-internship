  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and highest safe doses of&#xD;
      XL647 in combination with XL147 in adults with solid tumors. XL647 is a small molecule that&#xD;
      potently inhibits multiple receptor kinases, including EGFR, VEGFR2 (KDR), and ErbB2. XL147&#xD;
      is a new chemical entity that inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to&#xD;
      inhibit growth and induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells.&#xD;
