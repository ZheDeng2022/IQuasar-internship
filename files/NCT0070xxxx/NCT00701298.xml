  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects of decitabine when given together with or&#xD;
      without interferon alfa-2b, and the best dose of interferon alfa-2b, in treating patients&#xD;
      with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Biological therapies, such as interferon alfa-2b, may stimulate&#xD;
      the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether decitabine is more effective when given with or without interferon alfa-2b in&#xD;
      treating solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess toxicities of decitabine plus escalating doses of pegylated interferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      (PEG-Intron) in patients with metastatic solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify the dose-limiting toxicity of decitabine in combination with escalating doses&#xD;
      of pegylated interferon alfa-2b in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify the maximum tolerated dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2b in combination&#xD;
      with decitabine in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate pretreatment and post-treatment blood and tumor samples to identify changes in&#xD;
      global (genomic) DNA methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pretreatment and post-treatment blood, skin and tumor samples to identify&#xD;
      changes in Mage-1 mRNA and protein expression, DNMT-1 levels (due to sequestration by&#xD;
      5-azacytidine), p53 induction (evidence of DNA damage response), as well as changes in levels&#xD;
      of 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthesis, MxA and HLA class I as indicators of interferon response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate complete and partial response rates in patients receiving decitabine in&#xD;
      combination with escalating doses of pegylated interferon alfa-2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalation study of pegylated interferon alfa-2b. Patients are assigned to 1&#xD;
      of 2 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 (control): Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      who experience disease progression after the first course of treatment may crossover to&#xD;
      receive treatment in group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: Patients receive decitabine as in group 1 and pegylated interferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      subcutaneously on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample, normal skin, and tissue biopsy collection at baseline and&#xD;
      periodically during study. Blood, normal skin, and tissue samples are analyzed for global&#xD;
      (genomic) DNA methylation (gene-promoter methylation, gene and protein expression, p53&#xD;
      induction by DNA damage) and interferon levels by high-performance (pressure) liquid&#xD;
      chromatography and PCR methylation assays, and for pharmacodynamic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
