      Human conception in vivo occurs in a complex milieu that includes proteins. It has been&#xD;
      speculated that the addition of proteins more complex than human serum albumin to culture&#xD;
      media may improve IVF outcomes. Whether the expense, labor and risk of adding additional&#xD;
      human-derived protein to IVF media are warranted is a question unanswered. Patients,&#xD;
      undergoing routine IVF or ICSI, will be assigned to one of two treatment groups in a&#xD;
      randomized, prospective clinical trial . Embryos will be cultured in either media&#xD;
      supplemented with human serum albumin (HSA) as a solitary protein supplement or in media&#xD;
      supplemented with HSA + SSS from the 2-PN stage until the time of embryo transfer. Clinical&#xD;
      endpoints monitored will be implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate.&#xD;
      It is expected that the supplementation of commercial embryo culture media containing HSA&#xD;
      with the more complex protein source, SSS, will result in an overall increase in&#xD;
      implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. In the balance, protein enrichment of&#xD;
      media may represent opportunities to simultaneously increase the live birth rate and reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of multiple gestations.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of this comparison is to determine the best of two protein sources in&#xD;
      the embryo culture media for future use in the Presbyterian Assisted Reproductive Technology&#xD;
      Services (ARTS) Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: For embryos to grow in the incubator, a protein source is essential in the embryo&#xD;
      culture media. Currently, HSA (simple protein) is used as the sole protein source in the&#xD;
      embryo culture media of the Presbyterian ARTS laboratories. Literature suggests that by&#xD;
      adding globulins, e.g. SSS (increasing the complexity of the protein source) to the culture&#xD;
      media, the resultant embryos may be of better quality and have an increased chance to produce&#xD;
      a pregnancy. HSA and/or SSS are routinely used as a standard protein source by most&#xD;
      commercial human IVF programs. Both sources of proteins are FDA approved for use in human&#xD;
      embryo culture media. The goal is to switch to the better protein source (existing HSA vs.&#xD;
      more complex SSS), without compromising established pregnancy rates. To do this responsibly,&#xD;
      Presbyterian ARTS Program feels that it should introduce the potential improved formulation&#xD;
      (existing culture media supplemented with SSS) by comparing it in a randomized, prospective&#xD;
      way with the existing culture system (existing culture media supplemented with HSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Summary: Study design: The study will be conducted in a prospective, randomized way.&#xD;
      Two treatment groups are considered: 1) culture media supplemented with HSA 2) Culture media&#xD;
      supplemented with SSS. To allow for the well-documented decline in pregnancy rates with&#xD;
      increased age, patients will be randomized within 4 age groups and 7 physicians within each&#xD;
      treatment (blocked for age and physician within treatments). The age groups are: donor eggs;&#xD;
      &lt;35 years; 35 to 37 years; and 38 to 40 years as determined on the day of egg retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Measured: The endpoints measured will be embryo cryopreservation-biochemical&#xD;
      pregnancy-, clinical pregnancy-, ongoing pregnancy-, live birth- and embryo implantation&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients in the Study: To detect a difference of 10% in pregnancy rates, 150&#xD;
      patients should be included in each treatment group. With the current patient volume, it&#xD;
      should take less than one year to complete the study. Differences in implantation rates may&#xD;
      be detected earlier (more embryos transferred than patients enrolled). Should significance&#xD;
      differences in pregnancy rates become evident before the full number of patients is enrolled,&#xD;
      the study may be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location: The study will be conducted simultaneously at both ARTS facilities of&#xD;
      Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas and Presbyterian Hospital of Plano.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects: All patients undergoing a first IVF cycle or any donor&#xD;
      oocyte cycle is eligible to participate in this laboratory comparison. The eggs may be&#xD;
      fertilized with conventional IVF methodology or by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection&#xD;
      (ICSI). When performing ICSI, ejaculated sperm must be used. Patients using their own eggs&#xD;
      must be 40 years of age or younger on the day of egg retrieval. The Presbyterian Hospital&#xD;
      ARTS Program performed ~900 commercial egg retrievals in 2000. Of these, ~500 would have met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects: To reduce the tremendous patient variability seen in the&#xD;
      infertile patient population, only first cycle patients 40 years of age or younger on the day&#xD;
      of egg retrieval should participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of Research Material: Patients will be enrolled in this study from the regular&#xD;
      patient pool presented to the Presbyterian ARTS Program for treatment of infertility. Data&#xD;
      will not be collected specifically for research purposes. Data to be used are collected on&#xD;
      all ARTS patients, regardless of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of Subjects: Subjects for this study will be recruited from the regular patient&#xD;
      pool presented to the ARTS Program for the treatment of infertility. Patients that will meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria of this study can be identified prospectively. Information about the&#xD;
      study will be included in the routine, biweekly, group laboratory and nursing orientation&#xD;
      sessions. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria for the study will be presented with the&#xD;
      study consent along with their regular IVF consents and asked to consider joining the study.&#xD;
      The attending physician, the physician's nurse, the ARTS Scientific Director, attending&#xD;
      embryologist or ARTS nurse may approach these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks: Patients consenting to the comparison will allow their embryos to be&#xD;
      cultured in either the standard HSA-supplemented embryo culture media or in embryo culture&#xD;
      media supplemented with SSS. HSA-supplemented culture media is the current standard in this&#xD;
      program. SSS-supplemented media is used routinely in many other commercial IVF-programs and&#xD;
      for cryopreservation of embryos in the Presbyterian ARTS Program. Both HSA and SSS is FDA&#xD;
      approved for use in human embryo culture media. Culture conditions and ingredients that will&#xD;
      be applied are not experimental. The embryos will not be exposed to procedures or substances&#xD;
      considered not being industry standard in human IVF laboratories. To the best knowledge of&#xD;
      Presbyterian Hospital ARTS Program, published literature suggests that the SSS-supplemented&#xD;
      culture media may do better rather than worse under the conditions proposed for this study.&#xD;
      However, when HSA and SSS are compared in a controlled, randomized way as suggested in this&#xD;
      comparison, the ARTS Program can not guarantee that the pregnancy outcome will be equivalent&#xD;
      for both treatment groups (HSA vs. SSS). Therefore, by being randomized, a patient may be&#xD;
      included in a group with a lower success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special Precautions: If it should become clear early in the study that the SSS treatment&#xD;
      outcome is inferior to the current culture system (HSA) in place, the study will be&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality: No additional information will be collected from&#xD;
      study patients than that not otherwise collected from ARTS patients. Data collected will be&#xD;
      treated in the same way as for other ARTS patients. The ARTS Scientific Director, aided by 6&#xD;
      embryologists will keep record of the number of patients enrolled in the study, randomization&#xD;
      procedures, treatment allocations and outcome of the endpoints measured by treatment. Nursing&#xD;
      and administrative personnel will not have access to the treatment-specific data. The&#xD;
      treatment allocation sheets will be kept in the two IVF laboratories. Only the embryologists&#xD;
      have access to these laboratories. The executed consent forms will be treated like all other&#xD;
      consents pertaining to the IVF cycle and be filed in the patient's chart in the consent&#xD;
      section. Copies will only be made for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits: The patients directly involved in this study may benefit if their&#xD;
      treatment-group provide higher pregnancy rates than the current standard treatment protocol&#xD;
      (HSA only). For future ARTS patients, information obtained from this study may determine the&#xD;
      better protein source or the equivalency of both protein sources for use in culture media in&#xD;
      the ARTS laboratory to allow the best possible pregnancy rates. Only a very few programs have&#xD;
      the patient volume and ability to examine this in a controlled manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit Assessment: The proteins to be compared are both FDA approved for use in human&#xD;
      embryo culture media. Furthermore, industry-standard culture conditions and methodology will&#xD;
      be used throughout the study period. Literature suggests that the embryo quality and&#xD;
      pregnancy outcome should improve rather than deteriorate when increasing the complexity of&#xD;
      the protein source. The Presbyterian ARTS Program perceives the risk to be minimal. This is a&#xD;
      responsible way of introducing a new variable with potential benefits into the ARTS IVF&#xD;
      laboratory without risking the established, successful embryo culture protocol. By not&#xD;
      constantly seeking ways to improve the pregnancy rates for our patients, Presbyterian ARTS&#xD;
      Program runs the risk of becoming a stagnant, outdated IVF program. The ability to compare&#xD;
      these variables (protein source) in a randomized, prospective way will be invaluable to the&#xD;
      ARTS community in general. The researchers can not guarantee that the outcomes for all&#xD;
      treatment groups will be equivalent. Therefore, it is possible that a patient may be included&#xD;
      in a treatment group with a lower success rate.&#xD;
