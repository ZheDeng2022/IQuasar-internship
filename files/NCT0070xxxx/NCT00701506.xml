    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of the Patterned Neuromuscular&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation (PENS) for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The rationale for this&#xD;
      investigation is to assess the benefit of PENS in the alleviation of symptoms of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and elucidating the mechanism of action of PENS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two study conditions; patients will be assigned to PENS treatment or to the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 1 - 15 Patients (may be expanded) will receive stimulation with the following&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20-minute session, to each affected knee, 3 times per week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PENS for 20 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tri-phasic Lower Extremity stimulation pattern based on activation timing of the&#xD;
                quadriceps and hamstrings for strength training (50 Hz impulses for 200 ms every&#xD;
                1500 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Minimal twitch for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Moderate to strong, but well-tolerated twitch contractions for 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrodes placed on quadriceps and hamstrings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 2 - 5 Patients (may be expanded) will receive stimulation with the following&#xD;
      parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20-minute session, to each affected knee, 3 times per week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo PENS for 20 minutes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrodes placed on quadriceps and hamstrings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study was performed by the principal investigator to compare treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with exercise vs a control group. The data from that study will be used to&#xD;
      historically compare exercise with PENS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints The following endpoints will be evaluated (between and within groups):&#xD;
      Change in WOMAC osteoarthritis-specific status from baseline to end of treatment phase (12&#xD;
      weeks); Change in VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints The following endpoints will be evaluated: Change in biochemical Synovial&#xD;
      Fluid markers from baseline to end of treatment phase (12 weeks); MRI Data; Muscle strength;&#xD;
      Change in pressure algometry of the knee joint; Change in patient self-reported and&#xD;
      physician-reported global assessment from baseline to end of treatment (12 weeks); Change in&#xD;
      pain intensity from baseline through the end of treatment phase (12 weeks); Change in&#xD;
      physical function indices from baseline to end of treatment phase (12 weeks); Number of&#xD;
      patients reporting 20% or more improvement in pain intensity; Number of patients recording&#xD;
      20% or more improvement in self-reported osteoarthritis overall questionnaire score; Number&#xD;
      of patients indicating 20% or more improvement in self-reported and in physician-reported&#xD;
      global assessment score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Observations The following will also be monitored: Changes in prescription and&#xD;
      over-the-counter medication usage (type used and amount taken); Adherence to treatment&#xD;
      protocol (data from clinical treatment records); Safety of electrical stimulation and knee&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: Primary outcomes for this study is osteoarthritis-specific functioning,&#xD;
      (WOMAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis-specific functioning will be evaluated with the Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index version 3.1 (WOMAC 3.1). The WOMAC 3.1 is a 24-item patient&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaire assessing pain, stiffness, and physical function disability. The&#xD;
      WOMAC is available in a Japanese version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain intensity will be measured using a 10-centimeter visual analog scale (VAS scale). The&#xD;
      scale will be anchored at one end with &quot;0&quot; and labeled &quot;no pain at all,&quot; and at the other&#xD;
      &quot;10&quot; and labeled &quot;worst pain possible.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Secondary outcomes for this study are pain intensity, global assessment&#xD;
      of function, physical functioning and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical markers in knee joint fluid will be evaluated for change related to electrical&#xD;
      stimulation. Synovial fluid will be aspirated, at baseline and after 12 weeks of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, from the osteoarthritic knee receiving stimulation. Fluid volume and acidity&#xD;
      (i.e., pH), chondroitin 6-sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate concentrations, and hyaluronan&#xD;
      (concentration, molecular weight and viscosity) will be assessed. Chondroitin sulfate isomers&#xD;
      will be evaluated using high performance liquid chromatography. Hyaluronan viscosity will be&#xD;
      determined using a capillary viscometer, molecular weight determined from viscosity, and&#xD;
      concentration by protein assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be taken to evaluate the volume of the muscle group, thickness of the cartilage, and&#xD;
      glucosaminoglycan content&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global assessment of function will be addressed with a single question; one for the patient&#xD;
      and one for the treating physician. On a 10 cm visual analogue scale the following or&#xD;
      similarly worded question will be rated: Considering all the ways OA has impacted your life&#xD;
      {your patient's life} in the last month, how would you rate your {your patient's} condition&#xD;
      today? The scale will be anchored at one end with &quot;0&quot; and the label &quot;very poor,&quot; and at the&#xD;
      other end with &quot;10&quot; and the label &quot;very good.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical performance (objectively measured data) will be assessed using a timed up-and-go&#xD;
      test. Quadriceps strength will be evaluated using a mechanical dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength should be conducted prior to the other physical performance measures to&#xD;
      reduce bias due to fatigue. Responses to all questionnaires should be obtained prior to&#xD;
      physical measurements, and then the physician should aspirate the treated knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription medication regimen for the patients will be reported by the physician or study&#xD;
      coordinator. The patient will report over-the-counter medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient adherence to the stimulation protocol will be monitored through the clinical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of electrostimulation and of the fluid aspiration procedure will be monitored via&#xD;
      adverse events reports from the physician or study coordinator. Serious adverse events (i.e.,&#xD;
      fatal, life threatening, needing hospitalization) are not anticipated for electrostimulation&#xD;
      or for aspiration of the knee. Anticipated adverse events for electrostimulation are minor&#xD;
      (e.g., skin irritation), while for knee aspiration adverse events may include knee pain,&#xD;
      swelling, stiffness, vasovagal or syncopal reaction.&#xD;
