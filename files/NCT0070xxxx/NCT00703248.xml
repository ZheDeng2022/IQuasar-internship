      Treatment options that increase immune function, such as Osteopathic Manipulation Treatment&#xD;
      (OMT) lymphatic techniques, may provide improved short or long term performance of the immune&#xD;
      system. However, the efficacy of OMT to boost immune function among people living with HIV&#xD;
      has not yet been examined in a controlled study. Our experiment is designed to examine the&#xD;
      short (45 minutes) term impact of OMT on the white blood cells counts of HIV positive men who&#xD;
      are either antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve or have not taken ART for at least 12 months&#xD;
      prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
