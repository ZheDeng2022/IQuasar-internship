  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colchicine was first used in Behcet's Disease (BD), in 1977. There are controversial reports&#xD;
      of the efficacy of Colchicine in BD. For some experts the unresponsiveness of some patients&#xD;
      could be explained by genetic difference between the Silk Road BD and sporadic BD from other&#xD;
      parts of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis (the inefficacy of colchicine in the Silk Road BD), we designed a&#xD;
      randomized double-blind controlled crossover study in Iran, which is in the middle of the&#xD;
      Silk Road, and has the second highest prevalence of BD in the world.&#xD;

      Patients: They were selected as consecutive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entry criteria was: age between 14 and 60 years, confirmed diagnosis of Behcet's Disease,&#xD;
      absence of major organ involvement (eye, brain, lung, and cardio-vascular involvement),&#xD;
      having at least one active symptom, and no treatment for at least one month. Patients were&#xD;
      explained the study design and they gave a signed written consent. During the two phases of&#xD;
      study, if a major organ involvement appeared, the patient was moved out of the study. All&#xD;
      patients fulfilled the new International Criteria for Behcet's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: patients were randomized at the study entry to take either colchicine or placebo. At&#xD;
      4 months, they were crossed over. Those who were taking colchicine went on placebo and those&#xD;
      on placebo went on colchicine. Each patient tried therefore, both colchicine and placebo. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was the effect of colchicine on the disease activity index, the IBDDAM&#xD;
      (16-17). To calculate the overall IBDDAM of the baseline, the IBDDAM of the last 12 months&#xD;
      (prior to the study) of each manifestation was calculated and added together. The overall&#xD;
      disease activity index was then divided to the number of months (12 months) to have the mean&#xD;
      activity index per month. IBDDAM was then measured every 2 months (in the middle and at the&#xD;
      end, in each arm of the study). The total IBBDAM of the 4 months was then divided by 4 to&#xD;
      have the mean activity index per month. The secondary outcome was to see how the individual&#xD;
      symptoms responded to colchicine (IBDDAM of each manifestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The analysis was done by the intention to treat method. As the&#xD;
      difference between IBDDAM before and after treatment had normal distribution Student T test&#xD;
      for paired samples were used to evaluate the outcome in the colchicine and the placebo group.&#xD;
      As the Levene's test showed the homogeneity of variance, ANOVA (one way) was used to test the&#xD;
      effect of treatment (colchicine and placebo) and gender on patients' outcome. The dependent&#xD;
      variable was the difference between IBDDAM (before and after the treatment). The independent&#xD;
      variables were the treatment, and the gender. SPSS 15 was used for all statistical&#xD;
      calculations.&#xD;
