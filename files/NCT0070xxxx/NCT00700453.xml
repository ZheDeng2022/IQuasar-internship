      1. Young adults who are exposed to 7-10 days of play of violent video games will show&#xD;
           reduced activation in certain regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior&#xD;
           cingulate cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Young adults who are exposed to 7-10 days of violent video games will show increased&#xD;
           activation in regions of the amygdala.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Young adults who abstain from violent video games for a week, after 7-10 days of play of&#xD;
           violent video games, will show increased activation of regions in the dorsolateral&#xD;
           prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and decreased activation of the&#xD;
           amygdala, on pre-post fMRI and compared to young adults who continue to play violent&#xD;
           video games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Young adults who complete a computerized attention-training program after 7-10 days of&#xD;
           violent video games will show increased activation of regions in the dorsolateral&#xD;
           prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and decreased activation of the&#xD;
           amygdala, on pre-post fMRI and compared to young adults who continue to play violent&#xD;
           video games.&#xD;

      After an initial screening visit (Visit 1) followed by a one-week period of monitoring their&#xD;
      usual media habits, subjects will have a baseline functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) scan (Visit 2). They will then be assigned in a 3:1 ratio to either one-week of&#xD;
      violent video game play for 1-2 hours per day or no video game play for one week. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive a second fMRI scan at the end of that week (Visit 3). Subjects who had played&#xD;
      violent video games will then be assigned to one of three conditions (continued regular&#xD;
      violent video game play, no video game play, or an intervention involving cognitive training&#xD;
      of working memory) for one week, in order to investigate the persistence of any changes that&#xD;
      are found after the first week of exposure. Subjects who had not played video games during&#xD;
      the first week will continue to not play video games for the second week. Following that&#xD;
      week, subjects will receive a third fMRI scan (Visit 4). One week after the third fMRI scan,&#xD;
      subjects will have a final visit or phone call to check on the possibility of any issues with&#xD;
      aggressive thoughts/feelings/behavior following the video game exposure in the study (Visit&#xD;
      5). Brain functioning will be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as&#xD;
      the primary measurement methodology, with neuropsychological testing used as a secondary&#xD;
      measurement methodology.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have K-BIT-2 Matrices IQ&gt;70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must be 18-29 years old for the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Only males will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be judged by the investigator to be reliable and cooperative for clinic visits&#xD;
             and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must speak English, be proficient in spoken and written English, and have an&#xD;
             educational level and understanding of English required to complete all tests and&#xD;
             questionnaires. This is important because some of the tests require automatic and&#xD;
             rapid processing of written English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have a baseline level of violent video game play averaging less than or equal to&#xD;
             2 hours per week in the year prior to the study, and must have a baseline level of&#xD;
             total video game play averaging less than or equal to 5 hours per week in the year&#xD;
             prior to the study. These values are based on research by Kronenberger et al. (2005a)&#xD;
             showing that nonviolent control adolescent subjects averaged about 2-3 hours of video&#xD;
             game play in a week (of which 1-2 hours are spent with violent video games), compared&#xD;
             to aggressive adolescent subjects, who averaged about 4-7 hours of video game play per&#xD;
             week (of which 3-4 hours are spent with violent video games). Green and Bavalier&#xD;
             (2003) based their selection criteria for &quot;action video game players&quot; (VGP) on an&#xD;
             average of 1 hour per day for 4 days a week of violent/action video game play and&#xD;
             found differences between the VGP group and a non-VGP group on visual processing. It&#xD;
             is important to select subjects who are not frequent game players in order for the&#xD;
             experimental manipulation (8-16 hours of violent video game play) to be different from&#xD;
             their baseline behavioral habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be willing to make lifestyle changes about media habits during the 3-5 week&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must have basic level of proficiency with computer to load and play video games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Organic brain conditions or seizure disorder (history of febrile seizures with no&#xD;
             neurological sequelae is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any physical condition or risk that would preclude or invalidate an MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any current mental health diagnosis (other than Adjustment Disorder), based on the&#xD;
             Adult Inventory - 4 and follow-up questions from the interviewer, which would be&#xD;
             defined as moderate or more severe using the Clinical Global Index - Severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment of a behavioral or emotional problem (excluding normal adjustment issues,&#xD;
             such as adjustment to divorce) by a mental health professional in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any historical diagnoses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct&#xD;
             Disorder, Oppositional-Defiant Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia (or other&#xD;
             disorder involving psychosis), Personality Disorders, or Pervasive Developmental&#xD;
             Disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any history of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct Disorder,&#xD;
             Oppositional-Defiant Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia (or other disorder&#xD;
             involving psychosis), Personality Disorders, or Pervasive Developmental Disorders in&#xD;
             first degree relatives (mother, father, siblings, children).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current diagnosis of Substance Abuse or Dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of psychotropic medication for treatment of a mental or behavioral disorder at any&#xD;
             time in the study or in the year prior to the study.&#xD;
