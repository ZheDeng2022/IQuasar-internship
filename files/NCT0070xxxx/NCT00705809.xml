      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The T-Cell Project, sponsored by the International T-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study&#xD;
           Group, is a consortium of institutions interested in achieving more detailed information&#xD;
           on clinical and biological characteristics of T-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The T-Cell Project serves as a repository for data on patients with peripheral T-cell&#xD;
           lymphoma (PTCL) worldwide. Its overall goal is to improve T-cell subtype classifications&#xD;
           and evaluate treatment strategies for each subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To implement a standardized epidemiologic questionnaire into the ongoing T-Cell Project to&#xD;
      allow evaluation of various potential risk factors for PTLCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Untreated patients 18 years of age and older who were diagnosed with PTLC September 1, 2006,&#xD;
      or later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients complete a questionnaire containing the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking history and alcohol use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal history or cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of cancer among first-degree relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of transplants&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of blood transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational and residential history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pesticide treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The information collected is linked to clinical and pathologic information in the T-Cell&#xD;
      Project database.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that are&#xD;
      derived from post-thymic lymphoid cells at different stages of differentiation with different&#xD;
      morphological patterns, phenotypes, and clinical presentations. Although a number of&#xD;
      case-control studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have identified various risk factors for&#xD;
      disease, including autoimmune conditions, family history of hematopoietic malignancies,&#xD;
      smoking, hepatitis C infection, and host susceptibility, these risk factors largely pertain&#xD;
      to B-cell lymphoma subtypes as they comprise well over 90 percent of all NHLs. At present,&#xD;
      there are no known epidemiologic risk factors for PTCL or its subtypes. This is largely due&#xD;
      to the lack of sample size of PTCL in any one epidemiologic study. The aim of this proposal&#xD;
      is to implement a standardized epidemiologic risk factor questionnaire into the on-going&#xD;
      T-Cell Project. Briefly, the T-Cell Project is an international consortium of on-going&#xD;
      clinical trials on peripheral PTCL. It serves as a prospective collection of patients&#xD;
      (greater than 18 years) worldwide with PTCL who are enrolled at participating medical&#xD;
      institutions for treatment in a clinical trial. The overall goal of the T-Cell Project is to&#xD;
      improve current T-cell subtype classifications and to evaluate different treatment strategies&#xD;
      for each T-cell subtype. The specific goal of our proposal is to implement, within the T-Cell&#xD;
      Project, a 20-minute standardized epidemiologic questionnaire to allow evaluation of various&#xD;
      potential risk factors for T-cell lymphomas. Importantly, there are currently no known&#xD;
      epidemiologic risk factors for PTCL. We plan to administer questionnaires to 800 PTCL&#xD;
      patients; if successful this collection would be the largest database of PTCLs to date with&#xD;
      epidemiologic data. If the questionnaire implementation of assessing epidemiological risk&#xD;
      factors for PTCL among patients in the T-Cell Project is found logistically feasible, then&#xD;
      descriptive and analytic epidemiologic analyses of the collected data to understand the&#xD;
      etiology of PTCL would be pursued at the NCI in collaboration with members of the T-Cell&#xD;
      Project. For such analyses, NCI would receive only fully anonymized and de-linked data with&#xD;
      no identifiers.&#xD;
