  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate and 6-month&#xD;
      progression-free survival rate of XL184 in subjects with recurrent or progressive&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme. XL184 is a new chemical entity that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET,&#xD;
      kinases implicated in tumor formation, growth and migration.&#xD;

             (if in first relapse, the subject must have received temozolomide until progression,&#xD;
             intolerance, or completion of planned therapy; if in second relapse, the subject must&#xD;
             have received temozolomide until progression, intolerance, or completion of planned&#xD;
             therapy either for first-line treatment or for treatment after first relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is in first or second Grade 4 relapse, defined as having one or two&#xD;

             glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have a baseline brain MRI scan within 14 days prior to first dose of&#xD;
             XL184 while either not receiving glucocorticoids during the 5 days prior to the&#xD;
             baseline MRI scan or on a stable dose of glucocorticoids during the 5 days prior to&#xD;
             the baseline MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects having undergone recent resection or biopsy of tumor will be eligible as long&#xD;
             as all of the following conditions apply: First dose of XL184 occurs at least 28 days&#xD;
             after surgery, the subject has recovered from the effects of surgery, and the subject&#xD;
             has measurable residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
