    <textblock>
      This study is being proposed with the objective to assess the potential benefits of induced&#xD;
      diuresis by furosemide with matched hydration therapy compared to standard hydration in the&#xD;
      prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). It is expected that matched hydration will&#xD;
      prove to be as effective as hydration alone, will avoid an overnight stay prior to the&#xD;
      procedure, and thus will prove to be a less costly and more clinically manageable solution to&#xD;
      the prevention of CIN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiocontrast agents (contrast) are widely used in coronary and peripheral vascular&#xD;
      catheterization procedures. Although the use of these iodine-containing agents is vital for&#xD;
      these procedures, it can be associated with adverse side effects. CIN is one of the most&#xD;
      important adverse effects of contrast agents, and can cause substantial morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, intravenous hydration before the&#xD;
      catheterization procedure is the only current treatment that has been shown to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of CIN. However, in patients with baseline impairments in renal function, hydration&#xD;
      is commonly performed at a rate significantly lower than that shown to provide protection due&#xD;
      to the fear of overhydration and pulmonary edema. Previous studies have used diuretics to&#xD;
      increase urine output and prevent overhydration. In addition to the benefit of increased&#xD;
      urine flow, loop diuretics, such as furosemide, should be expected to provide additive&#xD;
      benefit against another potential mechanism of CIN, medullary ischemia, as they reduce sodium&#xD;
      reabsorption, and consequentially oxygen consumption, of the kidney. While the results of&#xD;
      their use have been mixed, it appears that furosemide was deleterious in patients who became&#xD;
      dehydrated, i.e. those in whom the urine output was substantially greater than the rate of&#xD;
      hydration they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This problem may be overcome by a device, which is now available on the market, called the&#xD;
      RenalGuard System. The System is capable of delivering saline solution to a patient in an&#xD;
      amount matched to the volume of urine produced by the patient. The purpose of this matched&#xD;
      fluid replacement is to prevent hypovolemia that may lead to hypotension or fluid&#xD;
      overload.The aim of the study is to compare furosemide-induced diuresis with matched&#xD;
      hydration therapy compared to standard hydration.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will begin treatment approximately 90 minutes prior to the start of catheterization procedure. After a pre-hydration bolus of 250 ml of normal saline solution over 30 minutes the patient will receive 0.5 mg/kg of furosemide intravenously. Then, a replacement solution (saline) is given in an amount matched (ml for ml) to the volume of urine produced. Matched hydration will occur prior, during, and 4 hours post procedure.</description>
