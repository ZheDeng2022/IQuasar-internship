      The purpose of this study is to assess whether 7% hypertonic saline (HS) is an effective and&#xD;
      safe therapy in infants and young children with CF.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence supports the importance of intervention in Cystic Fibrosis (CF)&#xD;
      lung disease during infancy and early childhood, in order to potentially delay or prevent&#xD;
      irreversible lung disease. Yet, aside from antimicrobial therapies, the CF community has no&#xD;
      clinical trial evidence base with which to guide pulmonary therapies in children &lt;6 years of&#xD;
      age. Hypertonic Saline (HS) is the most attractive chronic maintenance therapy to investigate&#xD;
      in these young children because it addresses defective mucociliary clearance, an early step&#xD;
      in the cascade of events leading to CF lung disease that is expected to be abnormal prior to&#xD;
      the onset of airway infection and inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, parallel group, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of 7% HS inhaled twice daily for 48 weeks among young children with CF 4 to &lt; 60&#xD;
      months of age at enrollment. The primary hypothesis is that, compared to isotonic saline&#xD;
      (IS), HS will decrease the number of protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations during the 48&#xD;
      week treatment period. The results of the proposed trial may for the first time provide&#xD;
      evidence for early initiation of HS, which, by improving mucociliary clearance, may delay or&#xD;
      hinder the cycle of infection and inflammation responsible for progressive airway damage in&#xD;
      CF lung disease.&#xD;
