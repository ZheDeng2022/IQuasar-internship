  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiglaucoma medication have been shown to induce subclinical conjunctival inflammation in a&#xD;
      considerable proportion of glaucoma patients. Today, trabeculectomy still remains the gold&#xD;
      standard as surgical treatment of medically uncontrolled glaucoma disease. However, this&#xD;
      procedure is associated with variable possible complications, of which subconjunctival&#xD;
      fibrosis is the most frequent one. The latter results in a non-functional filtering bleb. As&#xD;
      a consequence, either additional interventions such as laser suture lysis, needling, bleb&#xD;
      revision or additional IOP-lowering medication is necessary. Previous studies demonstrated a&#xD;
      benefit of the use of topical steroids postoperatively in reducing inflammation and&#xD;
      subsequent subconjunctival fibrosis. In this perspective, we will prospectively explore the&#xD;
      usefulness of topical NSAID or corticosteroid therapy preoperatively as compared to placebo&#xD;
      in subjects scheduled for first-time trabeculectomy, without interrupting topical&#xD;
      antiglaucoma therapy. This will allow us to determine wether the impact of longterm topical&#xD;
      antiglaucoma therapy on subclinical conjunctival inflammation which possibly result in&#xD;
      postoperative fibrosis and bleb failure can be reversed by anti-inflammatory medication&#xD;
      before filtering surgery.&#xD;

      This prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was approved by&#xD;
      our institutional review board and adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      Patients who agree for the study had to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be subsequently allocated into one of three topical study medication&#xD;
      groups by a computer-based randomisation programme: the placebo group received artificial&#xD;
      lacrimal tears (Liquifilm®), the NSAID group a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug&#xD;
      (Aculare®, ketorolac), and the CS group a corticosteroid (FML®, fluorometholone). All study&#xD;
      medication is made by the same pharmaceutical manufacturer (Allergan™), and contained the&#xD;
      preservative benzalkonium chloride. Each subject of the 3 study groups will have to take one&#xD;
      drop of their study medication four times daily for one month before filtering surgery in&#xD;
      addition to their routine antiglaucoma medication. The trabeculectomy technique will be done&#xD;
      according to a modified Moorfields procedure by experienced surgeons (IS, TZ)using a standard&#xD;
      fornix-based approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be postoperatively examined on days 1 and 2, at weeks 1, 2, and 4, and at&#xD;
      months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 following trabeculectomy. IOP will be measured by Goldmann&#xD;
      applanation tonometry. IOP outcomes will be the observed IOP values and relative (percentage&#xD;
      reduction) IOP reduction as compared to baseline at the different postoperative time points.&#xD;
      In addition, complete (without additional postoperative medication) and qualified (with and&#xD;
      without additional postoperative medication), and number of postoperative additional&#xD;
      treatments (needling, laser suture lysis, needling revision) in the study eye will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the onset of the study, sample size and power calculations are performed. In addition,&#xD;
      a randomization programme was set up. A multivariate regression model was used to compare the&#xD;
      IOP evolution between the three groups .&#xD;
