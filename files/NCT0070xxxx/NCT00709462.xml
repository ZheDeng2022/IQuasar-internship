      This research study is for individuals who have advanced breast, colon, pancreatic, ovarian&#xD;
      or bladder cancer. Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. is testing a form of immune therapy (vaccine)&#xD;
      to see if it can be used to make the immune system attack the cancer. The study includes&#xD;
      administration of additional treatments, in combination, thought to enhance the immune&#xD;
      response effect. (CDX 1307-01)&#xD;

      Protocol CDX1307-01: CDX-1307 is an investigational drug that is being tested to see if it&#xD;
      can stimulate the immune system (the cells and substances that protect the body from&#xD;
      infection and foreign matter) of people with certain kinds of cancer. It is believed that the&#xD;
      body's immune system can attack tumor cells and kill them. It is thought that immune cells&#xD;
      recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to fight the cancer. One of&#xD;
      these proteins is called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-β) and is found on several&#xD;
      types of cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and ovarian. The study&#xD;
      drug will be given as an injection under the skin (an intradermal or intracutaneous&#xD;
      injection). In addition, the study includes combination with TLR agonists, which are thought&#xD;
      to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells.&#xD;

          2. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients who have never received prior hCG-β therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients for whom therapy with potential survival benefit is available, or&#xD;
             disease-specific palliation is the goal of therapy, must have received these&#xD;
             appropriate standard of care therapies and experienced recurrence or progression while&#xD;
             on that care. If no such therapy is available, patients with progressive disease may&#xD;
             be enrolled. Patients who have refused standard of care options known to provide&#xD;
             potential survival benefit or disease specific palliation are not eligible for this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed between prior therapy and first dose of the&#xD;
             vaccine. Prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             vaccine dose. No prior radiopharmaceuticals within 8 weeks prior to the first vaccine&#xD;
             dose. The patient must have recovered from any clinically significant toxicity&#xD;
             experienced during prior treatment(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients on the following medications may be enrolled into the study if the&#xD;
             medications were initiated 4 weeks or longer prior to screening and if no dosing&#xD;
             changes are anticipated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hormonal therapy including gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRh) agonist,&#xD;
                  antiandrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), aromatase&#xD;
                  inhibitors, and progestins.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Patients must have an ECOG Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male patients who are sexually active must agree to practice an effective form of&#xD;

&#xD;
        Laboratory abnormalities attributed to liver involvement with cancer but outside of the&#xD;
        normal range will be allowed if they do not exceed the following limits:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST &lt;4 X ULN&#xD;

             childbearing potential will be excluded (women who participate in this study must be&#xD;
             post-menopausal [absence of menses for at least 1 year] and/or surgically incapable of&#xD;
             bearing children).&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Any underlying medical condition that in the Principal Investigator's opinion will&#xD;
             make the administration of study drug hazardous to the patient or would obscure the&#xD;
             interpretation of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Medical condition requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (must be discontinued&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. The use of inhaled corticosteroids is&#xD;
