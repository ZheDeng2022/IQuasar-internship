      Study Objectives The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of 5-Aza-Cytidine + Thalidomide on the course of hrMDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the overall response rate (CR+PR) of the combination of 5-Aza-Cytidine +&#xD;
      Thalidomide in hrMDS patients (INT-2 and High risk as defined by IPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination of Thalidomide+5-Aza-Cytidine in high risk MDS&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematological improvement rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytogenetic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment (FACT: MDS and peripheral neuropathy QOL Questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, phase II, single arm study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination of Thalidomide+5-Aza-Cytidine in high risk MDS patients (INT-2&#xD;
      and High risk defined by IPSS) who are older than 18 years of age. Potential study subjects&#xD;
      will sign an informed consent prior to undergoing any study related procedure. Number of&#xD;
      patients to be enrolled 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan: 5-aza-cytidine (75 mg m2/d) will be injected subcutaneously in 5-day cycle&#xD;
      every 28 days, for a total of 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide will be given at the dose of 50 mg/d, from day 1 until for 6 months together with&#xD;
      5-aza-cytidine .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period includes 5-aza-cytidine (75 mg m2/d) will be injected subcutaneously in&#xD;
      5-day cycle every 28 days. Total number of 12 cycles or until progression or toxicity. Cycle&#xD;
      delay of maximum 2 weeks in case of hematological toxicity grade 3-4 at investigator&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the follow up period is 6 months. Duration of study The duration of the treatment&#xD;
      period is approximately 12 months. This time is required to complete the treatment, and to&#xD;
      determine the safety profile and the response rate. The duration of the Follow period will be&#xD;
      approximately a half year. The occurrence of PD will determine the duration of&#xD;
      progression-free survival of each patient.&#xD;
