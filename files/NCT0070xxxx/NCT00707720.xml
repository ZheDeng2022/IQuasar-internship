      The Barosense Trans-oral Endoscopic Restrictive Implant System (TERIS) is an investigational&#xD;
      system being evaluated for safety The system uses endoscopic guidance to trans-orally implant&#xD;
      a restrictive reservoir for food entering the stomach in obese and morbidly obese subjects to&#xD;
      induce early and prolonged satiety. The Intended Use of the system is for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is now considered to be epidemic through most of the industrialized world. The&#xD;
      consequences of obesity on long-term health of individuals is now well documented. While&#xD;
      lifestyle changes in diet and activity level are the key instruments to arresting or&#xD;
      reversing this condition, conventional medically supervised programs have proven only&#xD;
      marginally effective. Bariatric surgery has shown to be a reliable long-term treatment for&#xD;
      reducing excess body weight. Though surgical techniques have evolved and complication rates&#xD;
      have been reduced, surgery on these patients still carries significant mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques and instruments are now being developed to allow for Endoscopic approaches to&#xD;
      these procedures that will aim to reduce the complications associated with open or&#xD;
      laparoscopic technique for these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the Trans-oral Endoscopic&#xD;
      Restrictive Implant System (TERIS) procedure for the treatment of obesity over a six month&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the TERIS&#xD;
      procedure in order to guide the design of future studies, including a pivotal trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective feasibility study at up to 3 investigational sites of up to 40 subjects&#xD;
      who are obese and have failed standard obesity therapy of diet, exercise, behavior&#xD;
      modification, and pharmacologic agents either alone, or in combination. Up to 60 subjects may&#xD;
      be enrolled, and undergo baseline evaluation in order to obtain a final total of up to 40&#xD;
      subjects appropriate for trans-oral implant. Barosense intends to use data from this study in&#xD;
      support of subsequent investigational studies, including a pivotal trial&#xD;
