      The hypothesis to be tested: After the construction of a database of anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, the system would extract important features of a given facial surface and be&#xD;
      able to match it with existing morphometric figures. A given combination of normal and&#xD;
      abnormal measurements will open a &quot;probable diagnosis&quot; and a list of &quot;differential diagnosis&quot;&#xD;
      that will be expressed as percent of matching in a descendent order to the examiner.&#xD;

      Summary of Relevant Background Studies: Congenital anomalies play a major role in pediatric&#xD;
      care. One of the leading causes of infant mortality in developed countries is the sequelae of&#xD;
      these congenital anomalies. In some cases this exceeds the death rate for prematurity, SIDS,&#xD;
      and other common causes of infant or neonatal death. The available tools for the assessment&#xD;
      of a dysmorphic infant or child are based mainly on the experience of the examiner and his&#xD;
      ability to translate findings and measurements from the physical examination to a qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative summary of accepted values plotted for the corresponding age (1,2). Various&#xD;
      unusual features are expressed in qualitative terms such as short stature, long fingers,&#xD;
      pear-shaped nose, small ears or other terms, which imply a comparison with other body&#xD;
      proportions and the subjective impression of the examiner. Following that, an impression of&#xD;
      the patient as a 'gestalt' is formed in the examiner's mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The databases and most of the written material are descriptive with scarce graphic and&#xD;
      photographs, making the comparison of the phenotypic expression of the described subject with&#xD;
      the one that needs to be diagnosed a difficult one. Even with the extensive existing data on&#xD;
      objective measurements available to characterize a phenotype, many of the physicians involved&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of a specific case will base part of their diagnosis on &quot;it looks like&quot; and&#xD;
      put that impression in the context of other physical and laboratory findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many syndromes in human pathology are recognized by their unique and distinctive facial and&#xD;
      body characteristics. These stereotypic phenotypic characteristics are mostly reproducible&#xD;
      using anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charts are available for nor+mal data values of various morphometric variables (1,2).&#xD;
      However, some of these figures can be accurately measured only on 3D structures (head, face).&#xD;
      The following figure demonstrates the measurement of the angle of the palpebral fissure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fig. 1: An upward obliquity to the palpebral fissures is known as a mongoloid slant while&#xD;
      downward obliquity is referred to as an antimongoloid slant. In order to obtain such&#xD;
      measurements within the uterus a 3D configuration and appropriate image analysis is necessary&#xD;
      (Figure from Ref. 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is an example of a syndrome that underwent characterization by&#xD;
      graphic data analysis methods (3). The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) was&#xD;
      determined in a foster care population and evaluated the performance of the FAS Facial&#xD;
      Photographic Screening Tool. The authors concluded that the screening tool performed with&#xD;
      very high accuracy and could be used to track FAS prevalence over time in foster care&#xD;
      population to accurately assess the effectiveness of primary prevention. An expert can&#xD;
      recognize facial characteristics and provide accurate analysis. Objective measurements could&#xD;
      provide less experienced observers with tools that classify anatomical characteristics of&#xD;
      different diseases and syndromes. Facial phenotypic patterns can be extracted from large&#xD;
      databases of facial surfaces. These biometric measurements can be used for analysis when&#xD;
      evaluated with respect to their &quot;normal&quot; values in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Methods of Study: Following approval of the Helsinki Committee, the project will be&#xD;
      performed in several successive steps as follows: A. Newborn scanning: A database of 3D&#xD;
      pictures (scans) of the face of newborn infants will be created. The scanning will be&#xD;
      performed initially at the Carmel Medical Center, during their hospital stay. The examinees&#xD;
      will be scanned one time, in order to build a database based on the data obtained from each&#xD;
      scanned picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The facial anthropometric patterns of the obtained 3D pictures will be studied off-line using&#xD;
      a computerized face pattern recognition system developed and used at the Faculty of Computer&#xD;
      Sciences at the Technion. The measurements obtained will be compared to geometric&#xD;
      anthropometric data already in use by medical geneticists and clinicians (1-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Hardware and software description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D Image Acquisition: Special hardware specially prepared in our department was developed for&#xD;
      3D image acquisition of newborn (see figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hardware consists in:a structured light projector (DLP Projector Casio 350j,a digital&#xD;
      video camera (PTGray Flea CCD Camera (Point Grey Research® Inc.( Black and white (640x480),&#xD;
      Aluminum projector cage, Special medical stand with wheels,Personal Computer - Pentium 4 -&#xD;
      XP,Flat screen 17&quot; with stand mount,Firewire cables,I/O cables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systems used for image acquisition: Currently there are two basic technologies. One is a&#xD;
      laser scan, where a narrow laser generated light plane scans a face in vertical direction and&#xD;
      the 3-D structure of the face is recovered based on the form of the light contour at the&#xD;
      intersection between the light plane and the face surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second method is based on the so-called structured light technology (regular light),&#xD;
      where one or more specially designed light patterns are projected onto a face, and the 3D&#xD;
      structure is recovered based on the position measurements of known pattern elements&#xD;
      projections on the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the range image is converted to a triangulated surface. The mesh can be possibly&#xD;
      sub-sampled in order to decrease the amount of data. The choice of the number of sub-samples&#xD;
      is a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity. Using this technique image&#xD;
      acquisition and reconstruction takes about 2-3 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Morphometric parameters and their computation: In order to compute common morphometric&#xD;
      parameters like inner and outer cantal distance, interpupillary distance, etc., there is a&#xD;
      need to recognize various points of interest in the 3D face. This will be done using various&#xD;
      pattern recognition algorithms. At the initial stage a manual procedure will be used to mark&#xD;
      features on the projection of the facial surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the first phase automatic methods will be developed to detect&#xD;
      features using statistical and algebraic algorithms. After having the relevant anchor points&#xD;
      secured, simple 3D geometry will be used to compute common morphometric data. Parameters&#xD;
      include outer canthal distance, interpupillary distance, palpebral fissure length, palpebral&#xD;
      fissure angle, nasal-labial (philtrum) length, ear length, ear height, etc. The 3D data&#xD;
      available can be used to try and search for other parameters that might be considered as&#xD;
      statistically meaningful indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another avenue of research is to examine the importance of other metrics for distance&#xD;
      estimation. One option is to check the contribution of geodesic distances as indicators.&#xD;
      Geodesic distance is a distance map computed on the surface itself (Riemannian metric). A&#xD;
      minimal geodesic path is the shortest path on the surface connecting two points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An efficient method for computing the minimal geodesic distances on a triangulated domain was&#xD;
      developed by Kimmel and Sethian (10). As the face is a deformable surface it is important to&#xD;
      use such a representation for the facial surface that the measurements performed on it would&#xD;
      be invariant to possible deformations (i.e. various facial expressions). In this case a&#xD;
      bending invariant surface representation introduced by Elad and Kimmel will be used (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Statistical methods will be used for detecting the best independent significant&#xD;
      morphometric variables which significantly correlate with the various syndromes:&#xD;
      Discriminating scores will be constructed using the regression coefficients of the&#xD;
      multivariate analysis tests and best cutoff points will be found, predicting between&#xD;
      different genetic anomalies. Testing of the method and of the results will be done using a&#xD;
      validation group of patients and healthy controls, by independent observers. The syndromatic&#xD;
      examined newborn infants will be assessed by a geneticist and confirmation of the diagnosis&#xD;
      will be made by laboratory tests when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Statistical Power and number of patients: Many morphometrical variables will be assessed,&#xD;
      based on our 3D reconstructing methods. Only after applying the multivariate analysis on the&#xD;
      results, the relative diagnostic importance of each variable will be revealed. Thus, no&#xD;
      single variable can be considered at this point, as an absolute discriminator between normal&#xD;
      and abnormal value. However, if considering for example only one 3D morphometric variable,&#xD;
      such as the degree of palpebral fissure slanting, in order to discriminate between &quot;Trisomy&#xD;
      21&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; in the Caucasian population, the following power analysis can be computed:&#xD;
      The average and SD values of the slanting eye angle in &quot;normal&quot; is: 3.5 (degrees) ± 1.5. In a&#xD;
      Trisomy 21 patient, there is an upward shift of this value. In order to detect a shift of&#xD;
      more than 2 SD's (i.e. of more than 3 degree) and supposing that the SD will be larger than 3&#xD;
      degrees in the pathological population we need a minimal number of 21 patients and controls,&#xD;
      in order to obtain a statistical power of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of patients: Our purpose is to obtain scans from 800 newborn infants during the&#xD;
      two year study period.&#xD;
