  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate what happens to hepatitis C virus in response to&#xD;
      treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients with HCV compared to those with&#xD;
      HIV and HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done to help us identify how the composition of HCV changes with&#xD;
      interferon in different populations. We will examine how quickly HCV is cleared from your&#xD;
      body and what factors may influence that clearance. This information may help us find better&#xD;
      treatments for HCV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who participate in this study will have frequent blood drawn in order to measure&#xD;
      how quickly HCV virus declines. Pegylated interferon and ribavirin are not provided by the&#xD;
      study, but will be obtained as part of standard of care treatment for hepatitis C.&#xD;
      Participants must be willing to spend 48 hours in the hospital for frequent blood draws. They&#xD;
      will be compensated for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must be HCV genotype 1. All patients must have a liver biopsy prior to&#xD;
      enrollment into study. (This is not provided by the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients must have a CD4 cell count&gt;300. If HIV-infected and on antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy for HIV, they must be on a stable regimen for 12 weeks. The HIV regimen can not&#xD;
      include didanosine (Videx).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HCV infection, as documented by the presence of circulating levels of HCV RNA by any&#xD;
             RT-PCR or bDNA assay performed by a laboratory with a CLIA certification or its&#xD;
             equivalent within 52 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HCV RNA &gt;1000 IU/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented genotype 1 performed by any CLIA certified lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Men and women age 18 to 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability and willingness of subject or legal guardian/representative to give written&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female study volunteers of reproductive potential must be willing to use two methods&#xD;
             of birth control in order to prevent pregnancy while on IFN/RBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For HIV infected patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western&#xD;
             blot at any time prior to study entry. HIV-1 culture, HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA,&#xD;
             or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA is acceptable as an alternative&#xD;
             confirmatory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CD4+ cell count ³ 300 cells/mm3 within the prior 12 weeks at a CLIA certified lab or&#xD;
             its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject may be HAART naïve, but if on HAART should be on a stable regimen for 12 weeks&#xD;
             The HAART regimen cannot include didanosine (Videx). Interaction with ribavirin and&#xD;
             didanosine has led to fatal hyperlactatemia in a few patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unwilling to be admitted for 48 hours for serial blood draws for virology studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior IFN -based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional Exclusion for HIV-infected:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current symptomatic HIV disease (i.e., AIDS-defining illnesses).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HAART regimen that contains Videx (Didanosine). Subject may previously have been on&#xD;
             didanosine but if on a new HAART regimen should be on the regimen for 12 weeks.&#xD;
