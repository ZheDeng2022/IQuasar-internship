    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when given&#xD;
      together with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Bortezomib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib&#xD;
      together with decitabine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) in&#xD;
      combination with decitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) II. To define the&#xD;
      specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of decitabine plus bortezomib&#xD;
      combination&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR). II. To determine the rate of complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) of decitabine plus bortezomib in AML III. To correlate the biological activity&#xD;
      of decitabine as demethylating agent (changes in target gene methylation and gene expression,&#xD;
      DNMT1 protein expression, global methylation) with clinical endpoints and plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the biological activity of bortezomib as a potential demethylating agent&#xD;
      V. To correlate intracellular concentration of decitabine-triphosphate with global DNA&#xD;
      methylation and other biological endpoints as well as clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the biologic role of microRNAs in determining clinical response to the&#xD;
      decitabine plus bortezomib combination and achievement of the other pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5 or 1-10 and bortezomib&#xD;
      IV on days 5 and 8 or days 5, 8, 12, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined,&#xD;
      an additional 6 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>If a patient meets the definition of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the patient may continue on with study therapy provided that the toxicity can be managed according to the dose modification guidelines. For DLT = 2, dose level will stop. This dose level will be declared the MTD administered dose (highest dose administered). As an exploratory, phase I study, no inferential statistical tests of hypotheses are planned. Data collected will be descriptive and provide limited estimates of variability given the small sample sizes at each dose level.</description>
