  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of blindness in children in developed&#xD;
      countries around the world, and an increasing cause of blindness in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retina lines the inside of the eye. It functions as &quot;film&quot; within the camera which is the&#xD;
      eye. When an infant is born prematurely, the vascular network necessary to nourish the retina&#xD;
      has not fully developed. As a consequence, in some infants abnormal vessels proliferate&#xD;
      instead of the normal ones - a condition known as ROP. The abnormal vessels carry scar tissue&#xD;
      along with them, and may lead to retinal detachment and blindness if the eye is not treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) Study&#xD;
      demonstrated that ablation of the peripheral avascular retina reduced the risk of poor&#xD;
      structural and visual outcome due to retinal distortion or detachment in ROP (1980's). The&#xD;
      ablated retina is not functional and is not amenable to regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral retinal ablation is not universally effective in fostering regression of ROP. This&#xD;
      is particularly true for an aggressive form of ROP (aggressive posterior ROP, or APROP) which&#xD;
      typically afflicts profoundly premature and infirm neonates. In this subset of infants,&#xD;
      progression of ROP to bilateral retinal detachment and blindness occurs despite timely and&#xD;
      complete peripheral retinal laser ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale The development of ROP is largely dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF). When an infant is born prematurely the relatively hyperoxic environment the baby is&#xD;
      introduced to shuts down the production of VEGF. Retinal maturation is delayed. Subsequently,&#xD;
      at a time when intraocular VEGF levels would normally be declining late in the third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy, abnormally high levels of VEGF are seen due to large areas of&#xD;
      avascular retina and associated tissue hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of FDA-approved drugs for anti-VEGF treatment renders it possible to treat&#xD;
      such eyes off-label. Available drugs include pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) for partial blockage&#xD;
      of VEGF-A, or drugs such as ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab (Avastin), which cause&#xD;
      complete blockage of VEGF-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As VEGF is required in the developing retina for normal angiogenesis, and our goal is not to&#xD;
      penetrate tissue, but to block the excessive levels of VEGF trapped within the overlying&#xD;
      vitreous which is responsible for the abnormal vasculature in ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of this study the investigators have chosen bevacizumab (Avastin), which will:&#xD;
      a) attain complete blockage (vs. Macugen) of intravitreal VEGF-A, and; b) which is limited in&#xD;
      its ability to penetrate tissues because it is a full antibody (vs. Lucentis, an antibody&#xD;
      fragment specifically designed for better tissue penetration), and is more likely to restore&#xD;
      VEGF homeostasis within the developing retina.&#xD;
