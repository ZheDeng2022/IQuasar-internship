  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with end-stage renal disease require hemodialysis. An arteriovenous fistula&#xD;
      (AVF) or a prosthetic arteriovenous graft (AVG) is the preferred accesses for this. After its&#xD;
      surgical creation, the fistular vein immediately faces a tremendous blood flow and the venous&#xD;
      lumen is gradually dilated and the wall thickened, producing an access that can be routinely&#xD;
      needled and deliver sufficient blood flow for dialysis. However, many hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      will experience access stenosis, dysfunction, and even thrombosis, which are the most common&#xD;
      complications of a hemodialysis access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most physicians, in-charge nurses of the hemodialysis unit, patient, and/or the family use&#xD;
      traditional stethoscope as a convenient method to evaluate the patency and function of a&#xD;
      hemodialysis access before, during, and after each session of dialysis. The acoustic signal&#xD;
      of an access is always affected by environmental noises, non-specific in nature, and the&#xD;
      sensitivity to detect stenosis is very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development and use of electronic stethoscope, the proprietary ambient noise&#xD;
      acoustically cancels out an average of 75% of distracting room noise, greatly enhancing&#xD;
      overall utility. However, the output acoustic signals are still apprehended by the ear, which&#xD;
      is the main source of bias and errors of detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study purpose is to apply the signal processing technology to transfer the acoustic&#xD;
      signals into simple visual signals that provide an easy way to read. It can be used by a&#xD;
      professional medical staff, a non-professional person responsible for taking care, or even&#xD;
      the patient himself, disability or not, as an early screening detector of stenosis or&#xD;
      dysfunction of a hemodialysis access.&#xD;
