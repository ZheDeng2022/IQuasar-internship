  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on this study have a type of lymph gland cancer called non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or&#xD;
      chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. Their lymphoma or CLL has come back or has not gone away after&#xD;
      treatment. Because there is no standard treatment for the cancer at this time or because the&#xD;
      currently used treatments do not work fully in all cases, patients are being asked to&#xD;
      volunteer to take part in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from&#xD;
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special&#xD;
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with&#xD;
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells&#xD;
      because of a substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been&#xD;
      used to treat people with lymphoma and CLL. For this study, the anti-CD19 antibody has been&#xD;
      changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an&#xD;
      antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric&#xD;
      receptor-T cells seem to be able to kill tumors, but they don't last very long and so their&#xD;
      chances of fighting the cancer are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators found that T cells work better if they also attach a protein called CD28 to the&#xD;
      T cells. This protein makes the T cells more active and survive longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also they found that T cells that are also trained to recognize the virus that causes&#xD;
      infectious mononucleosis (called Epstein Barr Virus or EBV) can stay in the blood stream for&#xD;
      many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor T cells and CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cells are&#xD;
      investigational products not approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe to&#xD;
      administer, to see how long each of the T cell populations (CD19-CD28 and CD19-EBV-specific)&#xD;
      last, to assess what the side effects are, and to evaluate whether this therapy might help&#xD;
      people with lymphoma or CLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient or their donor will give us blood to make CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor T cells and&#xD;
      CD19 chimeric-EBV specific T cells in the laboratory. These cells are grown and frozen for&#xD;
      the patient. Because the patient will have received cells with a new gene in them they will&#xD;
      be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene&#xD;
      transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be assigned a dose of CD19-CD28 chimeric receptor-T cells and CD19 chimeric&#xD;
      receptor-EBV specific T cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to&#xD;
      be able to proliferate and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there&#xD;
      are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, if the patient's level of&#xD;
      circulating T cells is relatively high, they will receive one treatment of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
      This drug will decrease the numbers of the patient's own T cells before the infusion the CD19&#xD;
      chimeric receptor T cells. Although it's not expected to have any effect on the tumor with&#xD;
      the dose that the subject will receive, this drug is part of many regimens that are used to&#xD;
      treat lymphoma or CLL. If the subject is already receiving chemotherapy, this may not be&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the&#xD;
      assigned dose. The patient will be followed in the clinic after the injection for up to 3&#xD;
      hours. If after a 4-6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be&#xD;
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),&#xD;
      they may be able to receive up to three additional doses of the T cells. These additional&#xD;
      infusions would be at least 4-6 weeks apart and at the same dose level the patient received&#xD;
      the first time.&#xD;
