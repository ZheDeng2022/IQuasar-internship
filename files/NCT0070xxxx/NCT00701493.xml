  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the bioavailability of the oral liquid&#xD;
      formulation of topiramate relative to the commercially available oral sprinkle capsule&#xD;
      formulation in healthy patients. If appropriate, bioequivalence between the oral liquid&#xD;
      formulation and the sprinkle capsule formulation will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover, single-center, relative bioavailability&#xD;
      study in healthy adult men and women. The study was conducted in 3 phases: a pretreatment&#xD;
      phase (Days -14 to -1), a 25-day open-label treatment phase, and a 7-day follow-up phase.&#xD;
      Patients will enter the screening phase no more than 14 days prior to receiving study&#xD;
      treatment. During the screening period, patients' eligibility will be assessed, and physical&#xD;
      examinations and other safety evaluations will be performed. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized at baseline (Day -1) to receive the topiramate oral liquid and sprinkle capsule&#xD;
      formulations according to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (see Section 5, Randomization and&#xD;
      Blinding). There will be a 3 week washout period between treatments. Initially, approximately&#xD;
      40 patients will be enrolled in the study, in order for at least 32 patients to complete all&#xD;
      PK assessments. Patient will be confined to the study site on the evenings of Days -1 and 20.&#xD;
      Following a 10-hour overnight fast, patients will receive topiramate as a single 100-mg dose&#xD;
      of the oral liquid formulation and the oral sprinkle capsule formulation according to the&#xD;
      sequence specified by the randomization schedule at approximately 8 a.m. on Days 1 and 21.&#xD;
      Serial blood samples will be collected for estimation of plasma topiramate concentrations at&#xD;
      scheduled times from predose through 96 hours postdose. Patients will be discharged from the&#xD;
      study site on Days 3 and 23 after collection of the 48 hour postdose blood sample. Patients&#xD;
      will arrive at the study site 2 hours prior to PK sample collection to obtain the 60 hour&#xD;
      (Days 3 and 23), 76 hour (Days 4 and 24), and 96 hour (Days 5 and 25) postdose samples.&#xD;
      Patients will complete the study on Day 25 and receive a follow-up phone call on Day 32 for&#xD;
      an adverse event assessment. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive both oral treatments: A then B, or B then A.&#xD;
      Treatment A: Topiramate 100 mg as 20 mL of a 5 mg/mL liquid formulation and Treatment B:&#xD;
      Topiramate 100 mg as 4 X 25-mg sprinkle capsule formulation There is a 3 week wash-out period&#xD;
      between treatments&#xD;
