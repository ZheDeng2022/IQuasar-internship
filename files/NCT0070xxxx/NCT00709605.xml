  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the immune response and side effects of an experimental HIV vaccine&#xD;
      given by two different methods of administration by needle injection or by use of a&#xD;
      needle-free device called the Biojector 2000 (Registered Trademark). The vaccine, called&#xD;
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, or rAd5, is made using an adenovirus that has been modified to contain&#xD;
      DNA that codes for three HIV proteins. It cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers who are not infected with the HIV virus may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Subjects are recruited for two study groups: Group 1 comprises volunteers who are 18 to 50&#xD;
      years old and have never received an HIV vaccine and Group 2 comprises volunteers who are 18&#xD;
      to 55 years old and participated in a prior study in which they received at least one&#xD;
      injection of the study rAd5 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both groups are randomly assigned to receive the vaccine by needle or Biojector&#xD;
      2000 (Registered Trademark) into a muscle in the upper arm. They call a study nurse 2 days&#xD;
      after the injection, record their temperature and symptoms on a diary card at home for 5 days&#xD;
      after the injection for later review, and visit the clinic two weeks after the injection for&#xD;
      a checkup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection is given on the day of enrollment. Additional visits are scheduled at weeks 2,&#xD;
      4, 12 and 24, when subjects are checked for health changes or problems, their use of&#xD;
      medications and how they are feeling. Blood samples are collected at all clinic visits.&#xD;
      Subjects are tested for HIV at the beginning and end of the study, are asked about their&#xD;
      sexual behavior and drug use, and are counseled about HIV risk reduction. Women are tested&#xD;
      for pregnancy at the beginning and end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 may undergo apheresis at the 4-week visit. This procedure is done to&#xD;
      collect white blood cells for tests to examine the immune response to the vaccine. Blood is&#xD;
      collected through a needle in the vein of one arm and directed through a machine that&#xD;
      separates the cell components. The white cells are removed and the rest of the blood is&#xD;
      returned through the same needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are asked about any social effects they may have experienced from participating in&#xD;
      the study. These effects are monitored to make sure participants receive any needed&#xD;
      assistance and to learn ways to prevent these problems in the future.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC 015 will examine safety, tolerability and immune response to the VRC recombinant&#xD;
      adenoviral vector serotype 5 vector vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd5), in uninfected&#xD;
      subjects who will be randomized to receive the injection either by needle or Biojector&#xD;
      injection. The study will include enrollment of rAd5 vaccine-naive subjects, as well as&#xD;
      enrollment of rollover subjects who received at least one rAd5 injection in a prior study&#xD;
      that included the rAd5 vaccine. The hypothesis is that the rAd5 vaccine will be safe and&#xD;
      immunogenic when administered by either needle or Biojector. The primary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the rAd5 vaccine at 10(10) PU dosage in the naive and&#xD;
      previously vaccinated, uninfected subjects when administered by needle or Biojectors. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives include evaluating the HIV-1-specific humoral and T-cell immune&#xD;
      responses and adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) antibody responses, and social impacts of&#xD;
      participation in an HIV vaccine study. Exploratory evaluations include epitope mapping and&#xD;
      other immunogenicity evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRC HIV rAd5 vaccine is a recombinant product composed of 4 adenoviral vectors (in a&#xD;
      3:1:1:1 ratio) that encode the HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyprotein from clade B and HIV-1 Env&#xD;
      glycoproteins from clades A, B, and C, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will include healthy adults, ages 18-50 years old who are HIV vaccine-naive. Group 2&#xD;
      will include healthy adults, ages 18-55 years old, who are rollover enrollments from a prior&#xD;
      study of the VRC HIV rAd5 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group 1 and Group 2 will be simultaneously enrolled. Both groups will be randomized in&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive the study injection by needle or Biojector. All study injections will be&#xD;
      at a dosage of 10(10) particle units (PU) of rAd5 vaccine delivered into deltoid muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are more than 100 past study participants who are potentially eligible for Group 2. The&#xD;
      study design is based on at least 10 rollover subjects, but allows for additional rollover&#xD;
      enrollment of up to 10 more (i.e., Group 2 total n=20) if there is greater than expected&#xD;
      interest in participation. The sample for immunogenicity studies collected at Week 4 after&#xD;
      vaccination from Group 2 subjects will be obtained by apheresis from those who are willing&#xD;
      and eligible for apheresis; otherwise peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be&#xD;
      obtained from 80 mL blood collected by phlebotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated at 5 or more clinical visits for 24 weeks after the study&#xD;
      injection and then followed by annual clinic telephone or mail contact for the subsequent 4&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
