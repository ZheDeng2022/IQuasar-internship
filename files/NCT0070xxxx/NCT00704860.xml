  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduction of volume of the hippocampus has been associated with major depression in many&#xD;
      studies. It has been suggested that antidepressants may protect against hippocampus volume&#xD;
      loss in humans associated with multiple episodes of depression and may also reverse the&#xD;
      reduction of volume caused by the depression. In addition, genetic markers for serotonin are&#xD;
      implicated with depression, and may be an indication of reduced response to antidepressant&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to enroll patients who are defined as having treatment resistant depression&#xD;
      (no remission after at least 2 treatments trials with an antidepressant). They will receive&#xD;
      an MRI scan at the initial visit and either 6 months after sustained remission or 12 months&#xD;
      after they enter the study for non-remitters. They will also be asked to give a blood sample&#xD;
      for genotyping. They will be matched by age and handedness to healthy volunteers with no&#xD;
      personal history of depression who will also receive an MRI scan and genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim is to compare hippocampal volume of depressed subjects to healthy controls. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that subjects will initially have smaller hippocampal volume but of those who&#xD;
      sustain remission, there will be a small increase in hippocampal volume. It is also&#xD;
      anticipated that specific genetic markers will be related to individuals response to&#xD;
      antidepressant treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who are defined as having treatment-resistant major depression (failure of at&#xD;
      least 2 trials of an antidepressant at an adequate dose) and currently meet DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
      for depression qualify for this study. At the initial visit, each subject is given an MRI in&#xD;
      order to perform a volumetric analysis of their hippocampus and a blood sample is taken in&#xD;
      order to determine their genotype for the 5-HT1a(serotonin) promoter. Each patient is then&#xD;
      aggressively treated (open label) for depression with the goal of remission. A second MRI&#xD;
      scan is completed 6 months after sustained remission or 12 months from baseline if remission&#xD;
      is not met or sustained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will select healthy volunteer controls with no personal or first relative&#xD;
      history of depression and match with the subjects based on age and handedness. Genotyping and&#xD;
      and MRI scan will be performed on the healthy subjects in order to compare all parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is anticipated that the hippocampal volume will be smaller than those of&#xD;
      matched controls. It is also anticipated that the Homozygous G(-1019) genotype will be more&#xD;
      prevalent in the patient group than in the healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is hypothesized that the investigators should find a small increase in&#xD;
      hippocampal volume after long-term treatment. Also, most non-responders will be of homozygous&#xD;
      G(-1019) 5-HT1a genotype and will have the greatest degree of hippocampal atrophy. Moreover,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that patients carrying a long allele of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism for 5-HTT&#xD;
      might show a better response to antidepressants in general. Finally, it is anticipated that&#xD;
      the TPH*A variant of the gene coding for tryptophan hydroxylase will be associated with&#xD;
      poorer outcome.&#xD;
