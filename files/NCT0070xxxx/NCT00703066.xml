    <textblock>
      The study aims to show that the candidate malaria vaccine GMZ2 is as safe as the already&#xD;
      publicly used vaccine against rabies. 30 Gabonese children aged 1-5 years will be enrolled&#xD;
      and randomly allocated to receive either malaria vaccine or rabies vaccine without the&#xD;
      investigator or the participants knowing what they received. They will receive 3 doses each&#xD;
      at one month intervals, and will be followed up for one year to evaluate safety parameters.&#xD;
      30 and 100µg doses for the candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 will be evaluated for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the second time that candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 is being tested in Africa, the&#xD;
      first time being in Gabonese adults where the product was found to be safe.&#xD;

      Background. GMZ2 is a recombinant hybrid of the Glutamate Rich Protein (GLURP) and the&#xD;
      Merozoite Surface Protein 3 (MSP 3).This product has been developed at State Serum&#xD;
      Institute/EMVI in Denmark and Batch released by Henogen of Belgium. The phase Ia trial in&#xD;
      malaria naive volunteers was done in Germany, at Tuebingen University. This phase Ia trial&#xD;
      established safety of the vaccine and also assisted in selecting the best dosage (10, 30 or&#xD;
      100 µg). The dosage with the best safety and immunogenicity profile will be tested for the&#xD;
      phase Ib trials in Gabon, including this phase Ib trial in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of three doses of 30 and 100µg GMZ2, adsorbed on&#xD;
      aluminium hydroxide, in comparison with three doses of the control vaccine (rabies), in&#xD;
      healthy Gabonese children aged 1-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the humoral immune response to the vaccine antigens GMZ2, GLURP and MSP3 by&#xD;
      measuring the total IgG concentration and IgG isotypes against GMZ2 by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess B-cell memory by memory B-cell ELISPOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the functionality of the immune response by measuring the Growth Inhibition of P.&#xD;
      falciparum in the presence or absence of Monocytes, and by measuring the recognition of&#xD;
      native antigen of P. falciparum by IFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib double-blind, randomised, and controlled trial with three groups at one study site;&#xD;
      rabies vaccine,30µg and 100 µg GMZ 2 vaccine.&#xD;
