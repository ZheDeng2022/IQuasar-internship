  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to test differences in RNA levels between Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS) patients and normal subjects. RNA provides a &quot;message&quot; from genes altered in diseases.&#xD;
      We will also test DNA to determine if there are any small mutations called SNPs in any of the&#xD;
      genes. The last tests are two separate tests for markers of inflammation called cytokines and&#xD;
      eicosanoids. This research may lead to the discovery of biological markers for MS that are&#xD;
      useful for diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

      This is an investigator-initiated, pilot study of gene expression (RNA) in the blood of&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study will enroll patients from the UC Davis&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis clinic. At a single study visit, we will confirm eligibility, obtain&#xD;
      clinical information, and collect blood samples. We will then process these samples to obtain&#xD;
      RNA for subsequent microarray analysis. DNA will also be used to examine single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNPs) on chips that allow us to examine 1 million of these SNPs. The SNPs may&#xD;
      allow us to diagnose a disease like multiple sclerosis or to predict a treatment or cause. In&#xD;
      addition, the DNA may be used to determine if there are any small mutations in any of the&#xD;
      genes in the individuals who donate their blood. Additional studies will be done on blood&#xD;
      plasma, testing for inflammatory molecules called eicosanoids and cytokines. The data from&#xD;
      these tests will be superimposed on the microarray data to determine a molecular profile for&#xD;
      each patient. We will then compare the data obtained between patient groups to determine gene&#xD;
      alterations specific for each condition.&#xD;

        Adult subjects aged 18 to 70 will be enrolled. There will be four study groups: patients&#xD;
        with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), patients with untreated relapsing-remitting MS&#xD;
        (RR-MS), patients with chronic, progressive MS (CPMS), and age- and gender-matched control&#xD;
        subjects without MS. Patients of both sexes and all races will be recruited into the study&#xD;
        without bias.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  males and females&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any race&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between the ages of 18 and 70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with a clinically isolated syndrome or the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis&#xD;
             using the widely established Macdonald criteria. A 'clinically isolated syndrome'&#xD;
             refers to an isolated attack of optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or brain&#xD;
             demyelination. Relapsing-remitting MS is characterized by acute relapses that are&#xD;
             followed by some degree of recovery without worsening of disability between relapses.&#xD;
             Chronic progressive MS is defined as sustained progression of physical disability,&#xD;
             occurring separately from relapses, in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control subjects will be male or female, between the ages 18 to 70 years, of any race,&#xD;
             with no symptoms of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children are excluded from the study because MS is generally a disease of young adult&#xD;
             onset and is rare in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of infection or communicable disease, cancer or other known systemic disease,&#xD;
             anti-coagulation, known bleeding disorder, illicit drug abuse, or change in&#xD;
             medications in the last 30 days (including treatment with steroids).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other immune modulating medications (steroids,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine,&#xD;
             IVIG or rituximab) in the prior thirty days will be excluded from the study&#xD;
