      Statins present anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. They may modify the&#xD;
      regulation of cytokines, (released from the cellular damage) and may reduce the production of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein levels. It has been hypothesized that these pleiotropic characteristic of&#xD;
      statins might be useful in the management of various diseases, including pneumonia. Indeed, a&#xD;
      recent study showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of pneumonia in&#xD;
      diabetic patients. However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of pneumonia is&#xD;
      not consistent . In addition there is no prospective study to investigate the role of statins&#xD;
      in severe forms of pneumonia such as the VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this base the investigators aim to study prospectively the effect of statins on the&#xD;
      outcome of patients with VAP in the ICU settings. The investigators therefore contacted a&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pneumonia in the intensive care unit (I.C.U.) constitutes the most frequent infection and&#xD;
      is most often associated with the application of the mechanical ventilation. VAP (Ventilator&#xD;
      - Associated Pneumonia) is defined as the nosocomial pneumonia in a patient on mechanical&#xD;
      ventilatory support (by endotracheal tube or tracheostomy) for more than 48 hours. The risk&#xD;
      for such complication is proportionally increased with the duration of hospitalization. The&#xD;
      symptoms include the appearance of pulmonary infiltrate, fever, leukocytosis and purulent&#xD;
      tracheobronchial secretions although this symptomatology is not always present. VAP is&#xD;
      usually caused by several nosocomial species, such as Acinetobacter baumanni (the most&#xD;
      often), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP is frequently complicated with the entry of bacteria in the circulation of blood&#xD;
      resulting in bacteremia and sepsis. In this respect, this disorder is associated with&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and devastating costs of hospitalization. Notably, the cost of one&#xD;
      episode of VAP is estimated in 57000 $ per occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, several strategies have been implicated to minimize the risk of VAP and to&#xD;
      manage effectively the disease (5-12). Among these, antinflammatory treatment has been used&#xD;
      in the past to influence the course of and to alter favorably the outcome of VAP (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins (HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors), are drugs that regulates the speed of composition of&#xD;
      cholesterol suspending the composition of cholesterol in very precocious stage. Recent&#xD;
      studies have brought in the surface new attributes of statins. Statins present&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. They may modify the regulation of cytokines,&#xD;
      (released from the cellular damage) and they may reduce the production of C-reactive protein&#xD;
      levels (14-19). It has been hypothesized that these pleiotropic characteristic of statins&#xD;
      might be useful in the management of various diseases (20), including pneumonia. Indeed, a&#xD;
      recent study showed that statin treatment is associated with reduced risk of pneumonia in&#xD;
      diabetic patients (18). However, the relationship between statins and reduced risk of&#xD;
      pneumonia is not consistent (19). In addition there is no prospective study to investigate&#xD;
      the role of statins in severe forms of pneumonia such as the VAP. We therefore contacted a&#xD;
      double open label randomized trial to investigate whether the use of pravastatin reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia in the ICU and whether it is related with&#xD;
      favorable outcome of patients with Ventilator Associated Pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and protocol The present is a prospective randomized open label controlled&#xD;
      trial. The study will take place in the intensive care (ICU)of the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Larissa and the General Hospital of Larissa in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive sampling will be used to recruit patients hospitalized in the ICU department&#xD;
      between June of 2008 and August of 2009. The patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      pravastatin sodium 40 mg (subjects) or not (controls). The trial medication will be commenced&#xD;
      within 24 hours of ICU admission (Day 0). The treatment group will receive pravastatin for up&#xD;
      to 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorization has been given from the Scientific Council and the Ethical Committee of our&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of VAP will be based on the following definition (1): the appearance of a new and&#xD;
      persistent pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography, fever (&gt;38.2ºC), leukocytosis or&#xD;
      leukopenia (&gt;12000/mm³ or &lt;4000/mm³ respectively), purulent tracheobronchial secretions and&#xD;
      microbiological documentation by bronchial aspirated or BAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment and microbiology Prerandomization baseline assessment will include&#xD;
      evaluation of demographic data, medical history, radiography of thorax, blood leukocyte&#xD;
      count, PaO2/FiO2, maximum body temperature of the day, CRP levels, the APACHE score in the&#xD;
      entrance in ICU, the SOFA score, Murray score and the serum amyloid alpha levels.&#xD;
      Measurements of the above parameters will take place at the baseline (Day 0), at the 5th,&#xD;
      10th, 20th of admission, at the day of VAP diagnosis and at the 3rd, 5th, 10th of VAP and at&#xD;
      the day of discharge from the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology To determine bacterial species responsible for VAP, bronchial secretions or BAL&#xD;
      will be sampled at the baseline (Day 0), at the 5th, 10th, 20th of admission, at the day of&#xD;
      VAP diagnosis and at the 3rd, 5th, 10th of VAP and at the day of discharge from the ICU.&#xD;
      Samples will be also collected at any other day if the attending physician finds it&#xD;
      clinically significant according to established protocol (22). Microbiology assessment will&#xD;
      include identification of the responsible agent (Gram and culture) in bronchial secretions&#xD;
      and BAL (50cc NaCl 0.9%) and assessment of antibiotic resistance. Accordingly bacterial&#xD;
      species will be categorized as sensitive to colistin or not (1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP Management and monitoring Treatment of VAP will be based on the attending physician&#xD;
      decision according to guidelines. All relevant diagnostic and therapeutic decisions will be&#xD;
      discussed in a daily multidisciplinary ICU meeting (5-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow up of the patients will be continued for up to 6 months from the initiation&#xD;
      of the study to document late adverse events related to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis, and&#xD;
      probability values will be 2-sided. Data will be presented as mean +/- SD and 95% CI.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed using statistical software, SISS 15 for Windows. Data will be&#xD;
      compared between the pravastatin and the control groups. Pre- and post- randomization&#xD;
      characteristics will be compared using the χ² test (the Fisher exact test will be used when&#xD;
      any number off the cell will be &lt;5) and the t test. Stepwise multiple logistic or linear&#xD;
      regression analysis will be applied to determine the factors that might the factors that&#xD;
      might be considered independent predictors of unfavorable outcome and scores, whereas a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 will be chosen for variable entry into the model. The odds ratio&#xD;
      (OR) and linear coefficient will be calculated and presented with 95% CI. P&lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
