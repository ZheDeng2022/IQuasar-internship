  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      arimoclomol in subjects with SOD1 positive familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This&#xD;
      type of ALS is HEREDITARY (runs in families), and at least one other person in the family&#xD;
      must have had ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses: Arimoclomol, taken at a dose of 200 mg three times daily will improve&#xD;
      survival as defined by time to death, tracheostomy or permanent assisted ventilation. In&#xD;
      addition, it will be safe and well tolerated in subjects with SOD1 positive familial ALS.&#xD;

      Using a seamless, adaptive, phase II/III design, the investigators will determine the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of arimoclomol in patients with SOD1 positive familial ALS. Both stage-1 and&#xD;
      stage-2 are randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled in a population of patients with&#xD;
      rapidly progressive SOD1 positive familial ALS. Patients with ALS, a history of a relative&#xD;
      affected with ALS (i.e. familial ALS) and the presence of a demonstrable mutation in the SOD1&#xD;
      gene that is known to be associated with rapidly progressive disease, will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in this study. Potentially eligible subjects will undergo screening via telephone&#xD;
      and, if necessary, review of outside medical records. The intervention will continue for up&#xD;
      to 12 months. In the event that a participant reaches a study endpoint (e.g. tracheostomy or&#xD;
      permanently assisted ventilation) study drug will be terminated. Subjects who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will travel a study site for final eligibility determination, baseline&#xD;
      evaluation and will then be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or arimoclomol at a dose&#xD;
      of 200 mg t.i.d. Participants will then be evaluated again in person at a study site at&#xD;
      Month-2. Telephonic evaluations at Month-1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 will be performed in&#xD;
      participants' homes. Safety and tolerability evaluations will be performed at each of these&#xD;
      visits. Collection of blood samples for safety laboratory analyses and measurement of blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and weight will be performed at Months-1,&#xD;
      3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 in the participant's home by a representative of a medical monitoring&#xD;
      company. A study coordinator may perform an in-person visit at Month-12, or this visit may&#xD;
      occur telephonically. A final evaluation will be performed via telephone at Month-13 (30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study medication).&#xD;
