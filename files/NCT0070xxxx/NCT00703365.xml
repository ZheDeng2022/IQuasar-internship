      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sorafenib in combination with&#xD;
      Gemcitabine in patients with advanced/unresectable HCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as primary liver cancer, is the fifth most common&#xD;
      cancer in the world. It is responsible for about 90 percent of the primary malignant liver&#xD;
      tumors observed in adult and disproportionately affects men, with about three times as many&#xD;
      men developing the disease as women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common symptoms in patients affected with HCC include abdominal pain, weight loss, weakness,&#xD;
      fullness and anorexia, abdominal swelling, jaundice and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple clinical staging systems for hepatic tumors have been used such as the American&#xD;
      Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system (stage 0, A, B, C, D) etc. However, the staging systems&#xD;
      are still evolving with all attempts to improve the classification and prognosis prediction&#xD;
      of HCC, and there is no agreement on the best staging that can be recommended world-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For advanced HCC, sorafenib is likely to become the new standard of care. Combinational&#xD;
      therapies with sorafenib have the potential to further improved therapeutic options for&#xD;
      patients suffering from advanced HCC. Gemcitabine is a classical chemotherapeutic substance&#xD;
      that has modest anti-cancer activity in HCC. However, its anti-cancer activity seems to be&#xD;
      improved when combined with other anti-cancer drugs including drugs interfering with the VEGF&#xD;
      pathway. Both substances, sorafenib and gemcitabine, have a favorable safety profile with a&#xD;
      minimal overlap of side effects. Further the mode of actions of sorafenib and gemcitabine are&#xD;
      likely to result in synergistic anti-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open label, single arm, multicenter phase II study designed to determine progression free&#xD;
      survival of patients with advanced stage HCC treated with sorafenib in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine. Patients will receive up to 6 cycles of gemcitabine(IV 1000 mg/m2 on day 1, 8,&#xD;
      15 of a 28-day cycle) in combination with sorafenib (400 mg po bid daily) followed by&#xD;
      sorafenib (400 mg po bid daily) maintenance until disease progression.&#xD;
