  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) describes acute, transient airway narrowing that&#xD;
      occurs during, and most often after, exercise. Manifestations of EIB can range from mild&#xD;
      impairment of performance to severe bronchospasm and respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of EIB remains controversial and the role of airway inflammation has not yet&#xD;
      been definitively characterized. We plan on comparing markers of inflammation in asthmatic&#xD;
      participants with and without EIB at baseline and after bronchoprovocation with eucapnic&#xD;
      voluntary hyperventilation testing (EVH). We also will collect demographic information as&#xD;
      well as information about asthma control and exercise habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      At Visit 1, participants will complete questionnaires about demographics, asthma control (if&#xD;
      asthmatic) and exercise habits. The participants will have baseline spirometry performed, and&#xD;
      skin prick testing for allergies. Skin testing is important as it can influence the level of&#xD;
      exhaled nitric oxide and hence we would like to adjust our results for the presence of&#xD;
      allergies. Subsequently, volunteers will undergo sputum induction and then have peripheral&#xD;
      blood drawn for microRNA analysis. MicroRNA's are single-stranded RNA molecules of about&#xD;
      21-23 nucleotides in length regulating gene expression. Patterns of MicroRNA expression have&#xD;
      been linked to heart disease and cancer. Similar patterns have not been identified in&#xD;
      exercise-induced asthma. In total, including time for questions and recovery, the time for&#xD;
      Visit 1 will be approximately 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, which will occur 24 hours to 7 days after Visit 1 in order to minimize risk of&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation, the participants will again have baseline spirometry. Baseline exhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide will be performed. Eucapnic Voluntary hyperventilation testing will then be&#xD;
      performed. They then will have a second exhaled nitric oxide quantification, will undergo&#xD;
      sputum induction and then have peripheral blood drawn for microRNA analysis, all occurring&#xD;
      after EVH testing. In total, including time for questions and recovery, the time for Visit 2&#xD;
      will be approximately 2 hours.&#xD;

        EIB is one of the most common triggers of bronchospasm in asthmatics. It is identified as a&#xD;
        trigger in 80-90% of asthmatics. It also occurs frequently (10-15%) in healthy volunteers&#xD;
        without asthma. Inclusion of a heterogenous population of asthmatics and non-asthmatics&#xD;
        will help provide much needed information to help compare/contrast EIB that occurs in these&#xD;
        two groups.&#xD;
