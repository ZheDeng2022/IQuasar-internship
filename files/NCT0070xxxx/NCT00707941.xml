      Background In preparation for a global influenza pandemic, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      representative data from populations and settings where the pandemic is most likely to arise.&#xD;
      There are no data on oseltamivir efficacy from Asian urban slum populations concerning&#xD;
      duration of illness and viral shedding, nor whether efficacy depends on starting treatment &lt;&#xD;
      48 hours or ≥ 48 hours after illness onset. Finally, there are no data on the capacity of the&#xD;
      drug, in such settings, to affect household and community transmission rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives This proposal aims to compare the duration of clinical illness among&#xD;
      patients treated with oseltamivir vs placebo &lt; 48 hours and ≥ 48 hours after illness onset.&#xD;
      It will compare the duration of viral shedding among all treatment groups vs placebo, risk of&#xD;
      transmission to household contacts by treatment group and whether neuraminidase inhibitor use&#xD;
      creates resistance. Secondarily it aims to measure the effect on influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods A double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial design among a population&#xD;
      in an urban slum under current influenza disease burden surveillance will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Infection status will be confirmed by rRT-PCR. Patients ≥ 1 year old will be randomised to &lt;&#xD;
      48 hour and ≥ 48 hour treatment arms. Family members and neighbours will also be assessed by&#xD;
      PCR and a basic reproductive number calculated (R0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance These findings will address whether oseltamivir can affect illness duration and&#xD;
      severity, affect transmission, incidence and resistance in high risk urban Asian settings&#xD;
      where a pandemic is most likely to arise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose Influenza is a disease of global importance, having caused three pandemics in the&#xD;
      20th Century. Although concerns persist about a new pandemic, possibly from an avian&#xD;
      influenza A strain, more people died during the 20th Century from seasonal epidemic influenza&#xD;
      than from any single pandemic, thus global preparedness must address both epidemic and&#xD;
      pandemic influenza. It is generally believed that if a pandemic emerges, an efficacious&#xD;
      vaccine will either not be either generally available or broadly protective. Additional&#xD;
      strategies are required for effective control. Neuraminidase inhibitors, including&#xD;
      oseltamivir, have shown efficacy in limited controlled trials against both human influenza,&#xD;
      and have been used in avian influenza cases. Numerous questions, however, persist about the&#xD;
      extent of their efficacy. These include whether or not they are effective if given after 48&#xD;
      hours post-symptom onset, whether they reduce the duration and titre of viral shedding, their&#xD;
      effect on transmission to household contacts, and how quickly - or even if - resistance will&#xD;
      emerge in a high endemic setting during seasonal use. Finally, clinical trials to date have&#xD;
      used small samples sizes under controlled settings in industrialized countries. There are no&#xD;
      data on the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in over-crowded urban settings with rates of&#xD;
      influenza and other respiratory infections, like Dhaka, Bangladesh. The findings from this&#xD;
      study will enable better assessment of the performance of neuraminidase inhibitors under the&#xD;
      conditions similar to those from which a global pandemic is likely to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate whether oseltamivir is effective at reducing illness and household&#xD;
      transmission during the seasonal influenza epidemic in a crowded urban setting in Dhaka,&#xD;
      Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methods This will be a double-blind placebo randomised controlled clinical trial that&#xD;
      will identify study subjects in clinic who present with signs/symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
      influenza. Patients will be screened using a commercial rapid diagnostic test of high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity (QuickVue A + B, Quidel, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and their&#xD;
      status will be confirmed using RT-PCR. Rapid test-positive patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      oseltamivir or placebo for the standard twice daily, five-day course. A total of 512&#xD;
      PCR-confirmed patients will be recruited and treated. Patients will provide nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      specimens on the day of presentation (day 0), and on days 2, 4 and 7 to determine duration of&#xD;
      viral shedding. All patients will be followed up at home daily by field research assistants&#xD;
      (FRAs), who will monitor their progress using standardised forms, and refer back to clinic&#xD;
      anyone who meets criteria for treatment failure. Once a patient meets criteria for recovery,&#xD;
      they will be referred back to clinic for an exit interview with the physician. At the end of&#xD;
      the study, comparisons will be made between groups on duration of illness, duration of viral&#xD;
      shedding and household and inter-household transmission rates, as well as whether there were&#xD;
      differences between those who started oseltamivir &lt; 48 hour or ≥ 48 hours from the onset of&#xD;
      illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Requirements for subject population, rationale for use: The influenza virus, once&#xD;
           suspected to primarily attack older persons, is now recognised to cause more illness in&#xD;
           children, particularly those &lt; 5 years. Indeed, both hospitalisation rates, serious&#xD;
           complications, and even mortality among healthy children &lt; 5 years approach those of&#xD;
           older persons with chronic conditions that place them at high risk [1]. Children are&#xD;
           also the most potent spreaders of influenza infection in the community [2]. However, in&#xD;
           order to model the impact of neuraminidase inhibitors on duration of illness, and&#xD;
           especially on intra and inter-household transmission, the entire age spectrum must be&#xD;
           examined, as in the early stages of an epidemic, adults may be among the first to show&#xD;
           infection signs and seek treatment, even though children will be more important in the&#xD;
           spread of the epidemic in its early stages [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Potential risks, likelihood, seriousness and impact of methodology: The risk is greater&#xD;
           than minimal, in that oseltamivir is not routinely prescribed for influenza infection in&#xD;
           Bangladesh, and as with any licensed drug, there are potential side effects, the most&#xD;
           common being gastrointestinal upset, nausea and vomiting - all of which are rare but&#xD;
           reported, as well as sleep or behaviour disturbances, which are even less common and not&#xD;
           causally linked to oseltamivir. Likewise, nasopharyngeal washes and swabs are not&#xD;
           routinely collected in Bangladesh, and cause minor discomfort during the procedure,&#xD;
           however complications, primarily from nasopharyngeal swabs, such as nosebleeds, are also&#xD;
           uncommon. There are no alternatives to these procedures for these samples, which are&#xD;
           needed to document whether a person had influenza and for how long.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedures for minimising risks, effectiveness assessments: 1) All physicians have been&#xD;
           trained on the procedures for specimen collection, as this has been ongoing in Kamalapur&#xD;
           since 2004. A refresher course will be provided to all study physicians prior to the new&#xD;
           study to ensure correct procedure. 2) All physicians will be trained about potential&#xD;
           side effects, and will relate these to the patients and their caregivers, as they&#xD;
           currently do with any medication. 3) FRAs will be trained to look for signs of illness&#xD;
           as well as complications to the medication during their daily home visits, and will&#xD;
           refer back to clinic any patient with signs suggestive of complication (e.g. skin rash,&#xD;
           repeated vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Confidentiality and anonymity: All patient information, which is recorded on a case&#xD;
           report form, (CRF) will be kept in a locked cabinet. Only project staff will see it.&#xD;
           Patients' name and other potential identifiers will be removed from data shared in&#xD;
           public fora. Published data will be aggregated and anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Description of consent procedures: One consent form will be for household consent for&#xD;
           participation in weekly home visits for influenza surveillance, and collection of&#xD;
           samples for rapid diagnostics (nasal swab) and nasopharyngeal wash or nasopharyngeal&#xD;
           swab specimens for index cases, and for subsequent household suspected cases (Household&#xD;
           consent, Appendix 1), This form will be obtained by the field research assistant (FRA),&#xD;
           as are all surveillance forms used in Kamalapur. This is the same format as the current&#xD;
           influenza surveillance for children &lt; 5 years of age. The FRA will read the consent form&#xD;
           in its entirety to any responsible adults (those with legal responsibility for the&#xD;
           children in the home, or if there are no children, for home itself) in the home, and&#xD;
           answer their questions using standardised responses (key points). The second consent&#xD;
           form will obtain consent for the index case to receive antiviral or placebo&#xD;
           administration, and to provide subsequent NPW or NPS specimens on days 2, 4 and 7&#xD;
           (Oseltamivir Study, Appendix 2). A study physician will obtain this consent form in&#xD;
           clinic. If the subject (index case) is an adult (age ≥ 18 years), consent will be&#xD;
           obtained from the subject himself/herself; if the subject is a child, consent will be&#xD;
           sought from his/her parents or legal guardian. The Oseltamivir study consent form&#xD;
           readability score is Flesh-Kincaid Grade level = 7.8. An Assent form will be read to&#xD;
           children aged 7-14 years. The Assent form readability score is Flesh-Kincaid Grade level&#xD;
           = 5.6. The methodology of obtaining consent for both forms will be standardised. The FRA&#xD;
           using the home visits consent form, or the study physician using the antiviral&#xD;
           administration form, will read the entire consent form to the patient or parent if the&#xD;
           patient is a minor, as this is an illiterate population. If parents have questions, the&#xD;
           study physician will provide clarification of the consent form from a standardised set&#xD;
           of key points that cover each section of the consent form. Patients, or parents if the&#xD;
           patient is a minor, who indicate that they understand and agree to the terms of the&#xD;
           study will be asked to provide written consent. If they cannot sign the form, a thumb&#xD;
           impression will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Interviews: The only interviews will be those conducted in the home by the FRA to either&#xD;
           screen for illness or follow-up ill patients at home, and will focus on illness signs&#xD;
           using standardised screening calendar questionnaires or follow-up questionnaires. The&#xD;
           other interviews occur in clinic with the study physician, and again focus on history of&#xD;
           present illness, past medical history, physical exam, follow-up and an exit interview,&#xD;
           as described above. These physician-patient interviews are fundamentally the same as&#xD;
           between any physician and patient, except that they are standardised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Potential benefit to individual and society, risk/benefit: Patients may receive direct&#xD;
           benefit if they receive the treatment drug, including a mild reduction in the duration&#xD;
           of influenza symptoms. In addition, household members of persons treated with&#xD;
           oseltamivir may experience fewer influenza illnesses, if transmission is reduced.&#xD;
           Patients will receive routine medical care regardless of treatment group, even if they&#xD;
           refuse to participate in the study. The daily home follow-up by the trained FRA is&#xD;
           another benefit, as she can help to identify any signs indicating the need for medical&#xD;
           attention. The information collected will be valuable to inform future pandemic planning&#xD;
           in Bangladesh and globally, as there is no information available for this regimen from&#xD;
           the developing world. The potential and real benefits thus outweigh the potential and&#xD;
           real risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Drug status: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) is not an experimental drug, but is US Federal Drug&#xD;
           Administration (FDA) approved, having passed Good Clinical Practices licensing trials,&#xD;
           under the terms for use as in this trial. Furthermore, oseltamivir is manufactured by&#xD;
           Roche Pharmaceuticals, which has a branch in Bangladesh, which currently supplies local&#xD;
           pharmacies with the drug for sale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Experimental new drugs: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Placebo, indications for use in the study: In order to objectively demonstrate the&#xD;
           efficacy of the drug on duration of illness specifically, but household transmission&#xD;
           more generally, both patient and observer have to blinded to the intervention, as&#xD;
           knowledge of intervention assignment can affect recorded outcome (observational bias).&#xD;
           Although it is known that oseltamivir affects illness duration under controlled settings&#xD;
           and in settings with lower disease burden than those documented in Dhaka, Bangladesh, it&#xD;
           is not known how effective it will be under these conditions, nor is it known whether it&#xD;
           will work for patients who present later in the illness (≥48 hours). For this reason,&#xD;
           patients will be allocated to a study arm by pre-allotment using block randomisation,&#xD;
           along with the blinding by use of a placebo. No patient will be denied standard of care,&#xD;
           as any focal illness, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, otitis media,&#xD;
           sinusitis, or other common complications of influenza and similar pathogens, will be&#xD;
           treated with standard, WHO-recommended or approved regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Experimental 'new' drug sponsorship: N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Use of records, organs, tissues, body fluids, and faetus/abortus: The study will acquire&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal wash and/or swab specimens, the objective of which is to collect&#xD;
           nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, which will be used in cell culture to isolate influenza&#xD;
           virus. The purpose of isolating the influenza virus is to validate whether or not a&#xD;
           patient actually had influenza, and if so, for how long was it shed.&#xD;
