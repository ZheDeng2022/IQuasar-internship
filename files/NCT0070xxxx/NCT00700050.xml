  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective is to elucidate the mechanisms whereby sex hormones may modulate the&#xD;
      severity of respiratory disease. An important component of this proposal is a systematic and&#xD;
      intensive approach to characterize how the cellular and cytokine components of airway&#xD;
      inflammation respond to fluctuations in sex hormone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of menstrual fluctuations in levels of sex hormones on inflammation and bacterial&#xD;
      load in respiratory secretions of CF patients will also be determined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most CF patients die because of chronic lung infection with P. aeruginosa, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and progressive airway damage. Agents that reduce inflammation or enhance airway&#xD;
      antibacterial defences hold potential therapeutic value. Therefore, there is considerable&#xD;
      current interest in identifying and stimulating the activities of these agents. Although sex&#xD;
      hormones are generally acknowledged to modulate respiratory inflammation, the downstream&#xD;
      mechanism of such action remains incompletely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified three antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), responsive to sex hormone in the CF&#xD;
      human respiratory tract, including one (LTF) with known activity against P. aeruginosa&#xD;
      biofilm formation. Our preliminary results show additive activity of LTF and STH against P.&#xD;
      aeruginosa biofilm formation, and that LTF and STH also inhibit attachment of P. aeruginosa&#xD;
      to airway epithelial cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the concept&#xD;
      that female sex hormones exert their negative effect on the CF lung, in part, by reducing the&#xD;
      levels of these AMPs in the airway. The next step is to determine if female sex hormones&#xD;
      alter airway inflammation and infection or AMP levels in the respiratory secretions of CF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

        The primary study population are sexually mature cystic fibrosis (CF) females with regular&#xD;
        natural menstrual cycles. For some measurements, they serve as their own controls. For&#xD;
        other measurements, there are up to three control groups: non-CF females, CF males and&#xD;
        non-CF males.&#xD;
