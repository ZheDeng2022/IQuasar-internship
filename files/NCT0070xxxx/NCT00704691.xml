  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the effectiveness of lenalidomide for the treatment of patients with relapsed and&#xD;
           or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphomas; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the safety of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are reports suggesting a therapeutic benefit of thalidomide in patients with refractory&#xD;
      and/or relapsed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma's (NHL) which have led to the formal investigation of&#xD;
      lenalidomide in the treatment of relapsed NHL's.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL's) represent a subgroup of Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with&#xD;
      poor prognostic features. Compared to aggressive B-cell lymphomas, PTCL's often present with&#xD;
      more advanced disease and sustain less durable remissions following treatment with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. With standard anthracycline-based regimens such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), PTCLs achieve inferior 5-year overall survival rates&#xD;
      of around 40% compared to aggressive B-cell lymphomas whose 5-year overall survival rates&#xD;
      reach 50-60%. While several salvage regimens have been established for B-cell lymphomas with&#xD;
      moderate success, the guidelines for patients with relapsed and/or refractory PTCL's are less&#xD;
      clear. Several reports suggest that the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs®) have clinical&#xD;
      activity in this setting. The aim of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the activity of&#xD;
      lenalidomide in relapsed and/or refractory PTCL's.&#xD;
