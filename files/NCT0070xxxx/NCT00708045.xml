      Patients must have had their breast cancer treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute to be&#xD;
      eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To use quantitative FDG-PET, functional MRI (fMRI) and co-registered anatomic MRI imaging to&#xD;
      better understand the cognitive disorder known as &quot;chemobrain&quot; which effects up to 16 -50% of&#xD;
      individuals receiving long-term adjuvant chemotherapy [Tannock 2004, Matsuda 2005]. The study&#xD;
      is exploratory to obtain proof of feasibility pilot data to support an eventual submission to&#xD;
      the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Testing A battery of testing will be used to assess the subjective&#xD;
      complaints of cognitive impairment in the symptomatic patient cohort. Similarly the same&#xD;
      battery of tests will be used to assure that the non-symptomatic patient control group and&#xD;
      the age-matched normal controls do not exhibit any cognitive impairment. The following set of&#xD;
      clinical tests will be performed to assess the degree of cognitive impairment in all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      In this study, 3 groups of 8 women each, between the ages of 18 and 65, will participate in&#xD;
      this study. The &quot;affected patient group&quot; will be women with complaints of memory dysfunction&#xD;
      who have received adjuvant chemotherapy (one or more anticancer drugs used in combination&#xD;
      with surgery), for the treatment of breast cancer. These patients will be those that are&#xD;
      being treated at Huntsman Cancer Institute/Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second &quot;patient control group&quot; will be age-matched (same age) women with breast cancer&#xD;
      who have undergone similar chemotherapy and have no complaints of memory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-patient group will be age-matched (same age) women who have not undergone any type of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. These individuals will be recruited from friends of female family members of&#xD;
      the two breast cancer groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals will be assessed for dementia (intellectual deterioration) and brain problems&#xD;
      using the same kind of neuropsychological testing. All subjects will be age-matched as close&#xD;
      as possible, to eliminate age related effects. Subjects will be right-handed,&#xD;
      primarily-English speakers with normal hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to use modern imaging techniques to better understand&#xD;
      chemobrain. These imaging techniques include FDG-PET (FDG is the abbreviation for the&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical fluorodeoxyglucose and PET is Positron Emission Tomography) and&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI)). They will be used to look at the metabolism (chemical activity) in&#xD;
      specific areas of the brain and the entire brain overall. By using FDG-PET doctors will see&#xD;
      how the brain activates. By using fMRI doctors will see how the brain works when you are&#xD;
      challenged with certain mental tasks that make you concentrate and remember. FDG-PET and fMRI&#xD;
      might provide important information on the brain that may be connected with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an important first step to understand the problem of chemobrain. The&#xD;
      imaging evaluations will make it possible to explore the changes in brain function that may&#xD;
      be responsible for chemobrain and hopefully make it possible to predict which people may be&#xD;
      affected by this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people who undergo chemotherapy particularly adjuvant chemotherapy have complained about&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction for many years. This cognitive decline effects up to 16 -50% of&#xD;
      individuals receiving long-term adjuvant chemotherapy [Tannock 2004, Matsuda 2005].Cancer&#xD;
      survivors frequently refer to this cognitive dysfunction as &quot;chemobrain&quot; or &quot;chemofog.&quot; The&#xD;
      majority of individuals who are affected are woman who have undergone adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      for breast cancer. The table below is a summary of many of the studies that have been&#xD;
      performed assessing cognition and chemobrain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who experience chemobrain typically complain of inability to concentrate, memory&#xD;
      dysfunction, word finding difficulties, difficulty with learning, slowed processing&#xD;
      abilities, and often difficulty with writing and speaking. A particularly disturbing&#xD;
      complaint for many individuals is the inability to multitask. Only recently, have researchers&#xD;
      begun studying the impact of chemotherapy on cognitive functioning. This is a difficult area&#xD;
      to study however. Part of the problem in assessing chemobrain using scientific principals is&#xD;
      sorting out which problems are due to chemotherapy and which are due to having a serious&#xD;
      illness like cancer that can result in physical debilitation, depression, sleep disruption,&#xD;
      hormone shifts, and fatigue--all of which can affect cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of theories at to why chemobrain may occur. One is that some types of&#xD;
      chemotherapy can cross the blood/brain barrier and cause neurotoxicity. Another is that the&#xD;
      cognitive problems are created by certain free radicals, the toxic elements that many types&#xD;
      of chemotherapy produce [Joshi 2005]. Another theory is that some people have a genetic&#xD;
      background that makes them more susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. Most likely it is&#xD;
      not just a single etiologic factor but a multifactorial process that combine to predispose&#xD;
      certain individuals to develop chemobrain. Chemotherapy isn't the only cancer treatment that&#xD;
      may cause cognitive disturbance and memory complaints. Other cancer treatments that have been&#xD;
      implicated as causing complaints of cognitive dysfunction include hormone therapy,&#xD;
      immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. Hormone therapy is common in woman being treated with&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapy. It is not entirely clear if women undergoing hormone therapy which&#xD;
      alters the amount of systemic estrogen experience memory problems. Some studies link memory&#xD;
      to the amount of estrogen in the brain. Other studies haven't found this link.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria: Pre-screening will be conducted to ensure that all subjects are in good&#xD;
        neurologic health with no history of seizures or other neurological disorders, and that&#xD;
        they have no ferromagnetic implants or clips in their body. Subjects will be right-handed&#xD;
        exclusive-English speakers with normal hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria: If a subject is found to have profound or severe depression after the&#xD;
        Neuropsychological and Cognitive Testing session they may be excluded from the imaging&#xD;
        portion of the study. This is justified as the imaging session would not be valid as the&#xD;
        biologic correlates of depression rather than chemobrain would be imaged. Subjects found to&#xD;
        have profound or severe depression will be notified and appropriate referral made to get&#xD;
        them the necessary medical care to treat their depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Three cohorts of 8 women each under the age of 65 will be recruited for this exploratory&#xD;
        pilot study. The &quot;affected patient cohort&quot; will be woman with complaints of cognitive or&#xD;
        memory dysfunction who have received adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of breast&#xD;
        cancer. These patients will be those being treated at Huntsman Cancer Hospital and be the&#xD;
        patients of Dr Saundra Buys or Dr John Ward. The second &quot;patient control cohort&quot; will be&#xD;
        age-matched woman with breast cancer who have undergone similar adjuvant chemotherapy for&#xD;
        the same amount of time who have no complaints of memory dysfunction. Again these are&#xD;
        primarily patients of Drs. Buys or Ward. The non-patient cohort will be age-matched woman&#xD;
        who have not undergone any type of chemotherapy. These individuals will be recruited from&#xD;
        friends of female family members of the two breast cancer cohorts. All individuals will be&#xD;
        assessed for dementia and cognitive impairment using the same battery of dementia and&#xD;
        cognitive/neuropsychological testing. All subjects will be age-matched as close as possible&#xD;
        to eliminate age related cognitive effects. Subjects will be right-handed exclusive-English&#xD;
        speakers with normal hearing. Pre-screening will be conducted to ensure that all subjects&#xD;
        are in good neurologic health with no history of seizures or other neurological disorders,&#xD;
        and that they have no ferromagnetic implants or clips in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Up to 40 subjects may be enrolled to ensure 24 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
