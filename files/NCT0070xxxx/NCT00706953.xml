  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using pegylated&#xD;
      liposomal doxorubicin and bortezomib in the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma who had been previously treated with bortezomib. Multiple myeloma is a cancer that&#xD;
      begins in plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. These cells are part of the immune&#xD;
      system, which helps protect the body from germs and other harmful substances. In time,&#xD;
      myeloma cells collect in the bone marrow and in the solid parts of bone. Multiple myeloma&#xD;
      treatment may include stem cell transplantation, however, not all patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma are candidates for stem cell transplantation and many patients who receive&#xD;
      transplants relapse. As a result, additional first and later-line therapeutic options are&#xD;
      needed for patients who are not candidates for transplantation, or whose disease relapses&#xD;
      after transplantation or other therapies. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib is approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have not&#xD;
      previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy. The combined use&#xD;
      of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and bortezomib in this study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      overall response rate and safety in patients with multiple myeloma who have been previously&#xD;
      treated with bortezomib.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall response rate to DOXIL/VELCADE&#xD;
      treatment in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma previously treated with VELCADE. Overall&#xD;
      response rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving either a complete response&#xD;
      (CR) or partial response (PR) to treatment according to the European Group for Blood and&#xD;
      Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. This is a single arm (all patients will receive the&#xD;
      same drug combination and dose), multi-center (many study sites), open label (the patient and&#xD;
      the physician know the drug treatment being received) of approximately 60 patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma whose disease has progressed after initial response to VELCADE-based&#xD;
      therapy. During each 21-day treatment cycle, patients will receive VELCADE by intravenous&#xD;
      bolus on 4 designated days, and DOXIL by intravenous infusion on one designated day.&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, or the occurrence of unacceptable&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity or up to a total of 8 cycles of therapy. Drug doses may be delayed&#xD;
      or dropped as needed to allow for platelet transfusions or other treatment requirements.&#xD;
      Patients responding to treatment at study end may be evaluated for continued treatment for as&#xD;
      long as treatment can be tolerated and they continue to respond. After discontinuation of all&#xD;
      study drugs, patients who have not had disease progression will be followed for 6 months&#xD;
      after receiving the last dose of study drug. The primary endpoint is overall response rate as&#xD;
      defined by the proportion of patients achieving either a complete response or a partial&#xD;
      response. Response will be assessed at each cycle. Safety will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study by physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, and the incidence and severity of&#xD;
      reported adverse events. Overall safety will be summarized at study-end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each 21-day treatment cycle, patients will receive bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 by intravenous&#xD;
      bolus on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2 by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion on Day 4.&#xD;
