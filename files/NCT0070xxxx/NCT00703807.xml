  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract. The&#xD;
      majority of patients with endometrial cancer are diagnosed at an early stage and cured with&#xD;
      surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. However, a significant number of patients&#xD;
      present with metastatic disease outside of the pelvis or develop recurrent disease after&#xD;
      primary therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mTOR inhibitors have been shown to be promising agents in reducing tumor growth in vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo, in several solid cancers. Inhibitors of mTOR are primarily cytostatic in cancer&#xD;
      cells; combination therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and other biologic agents may&#xD;
      prove to be the most advantageous use of these drugs. mTOR inhibition with a rapamycin&#xD;
      analogue demonstrated in vitro antiproliferative activity on endometrial AN3 CA and HEC-1-A&#xD;
      tumor cells, and this inhibition of proliferation was found to be concentration dependent.&#xD;
      Topotecan is an active agent in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancers.&#xD;

          -  Development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting lesions on bone scintigraphy,&#xD;
             CT, MRI or by physical examination. Patients in whom the sole criterion for&#xD;
             progression is an increase in a biochemical marker, e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
             (CEA), or an increase in symptoms, are not eligible.&#xD;
