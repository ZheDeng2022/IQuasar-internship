        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patient age &gt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to comply with protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically, cytologically or biochemically documented metastatic&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma of the prostate, clinically refractory or resistant to hormone therapy,&#xD;
             as documented by progression following at least one hormonal therapy, which must&#xD;
             include orchidectomy or gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Progressive Disease (PD). PD is defined as a minimum of three&#xD;
             consecutive serum PSA measurements obtained at least 7 days apart within the previous&#xD;
             3 months of start of trial, which document progressively increasing PSA values.&#xD;
             Patients with progression of measurable disease (RECIST) or progression of bone&#xD;
             disease must also fit the criterion for PSA progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documented progression (as defined above) following anti-androgen&#xD;
             withdrawal of 4 weeks duration for flutamide and 6 weeks for bicalutamide or&#xD;
             nilutamide. For a patient who has withdrawn from anti-androgen therapy less than 6&#xD;
             months prior to inclusion in the trial, one of the following criteria is also&#xD;
             required:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Following completion of the anti-androgen withdrawal period one PSA measurement should&#xD;
             be higher than the last pre-withdrawal PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Following the completion of the anti-androgen withdrawal period if the PSA value has&#xD;
             decreased, a patient can still qualify if 2 increases in PSA are documented after the&#xD;
             post- withdrawal nadir.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A predicted life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A maximum of one prior treatment with either chemotherapy or other non-hormonal&#xD;
             treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable analgesia requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  INR Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt;1.5 upper limit of&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.5 x 109l,&#xD;
             Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haemoglobin &gt; 9.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum Albumin &gt; 2.0 g/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Castrate testosterone level [&lt; 20 ng/dl or &lt;0.69nM (nM/L x 28.8 = ng/dl)] must be&#xD;
             maintained during the duration of the trial by orchidectomy or medical castration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on oral or intravenous bisphosphonates are allowed to enter the trial as long&#xD;
             as they have been on bisphosphonates for a minimum of 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with more than one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to the trial drug or their excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistence of toxicities of prior anti-cancer therapies which are deemed to be&#xD;
             clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate amino transferase (ast) or alanine amino transferase (alt) greater than 2.5&#xD;
             times the upper limit of normal, or aspartate amino transferase (ast) or alanine amino&#xD;
             transferase (alt) greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal in case of known&#xD;
             liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin greater than 1.5 mg/dl (&gt; 26 micromol/l, Si unit equivalent). Serum&#xD;
             creatinine greater than 2.0 g/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with trial requirement or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the&#xD;
             efficacy or safety of the trial drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroids taken within the past 28 days before screening (inhaled&#xD;
             corticosteroids prescribed for bronchospasm are allowed). Patients on long-term&#xD;
             stable-dose steroids for concurrent illness are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 28 days of trial onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other malignancies which could affect compliance with the protocol or&#xD;
             interpretation of results within 5-years. Patients with adequately treated basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer are generally eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with history or clinical evidence of CNS disease or brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptoms of impending or established spinal cord compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy within the past four weeks prior to treatment with the trial drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radioisotope therapy (except radium-223 which is permissible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunotherapy within the past four weeks prior to treatment with the trial drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
