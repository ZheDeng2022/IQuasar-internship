      The goal of this project is to test whether a phone and mail-based program designed to help&#xD;
      people who have recently lost weight helps them keep the weight off over a 2 year period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem in the United States. Increases in obesity&#xD;
      prevalence over the last four decades have been dramatic in all age and social groups,&#xD;
      heightening concern about health risks for children, adolescents, and adults. Currently, over&#xD;
      half of US adults are overweight and upward trends in prevalence show no sign of slowing. A&#xD;
      continuation of current trends seems quite likely to lead to substantial increases in the&#xD;
      number of people affected by obesity-related health conditions and in premature mortality.&#xD;
      The primary treatment for obesity continues to be behavioral weight loss therapy, an approach&#xD;
      that uses behavioral strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, stimulus control, problem-solving) to&#xD;
      help participants adhere to dietary and physical activity recommendations. Significant&#xD;
      progress has been made with respect to short term weight loss research over the past twenty&#xD;
      years, with short term weight losses approximately doubling during this time period.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, long term weight losses remain disappointing. The typical pattern is for&#xD;
      maximum weight loss to occur at 6 months, with weight regain following. During the year&#xD;
      following treatment, participants typically regain 30% to 50% of their initial weight loss.&#xD;
      Follow-up beyond 1 year indicates a pattern of continued weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though long term weight loss maintenance remains a critical challenge for obesity treatment,&#xD;
      important information regarding successful weight loss maintenance (e.g., high levels of&#xD;
      physical activity, self-weighing, maintenance of a low-fat, low-calorie diet) has been&#xD;
      derived from the National Weight Control Registry led by Drs Wing and Hill. Treatment studies&#xD;
      have incorporated such strategies to enhance maintenance; however, the most intensive&#xD;
      treatment phase typically occurs during weight loss initiation with the maintenance phase&#xD;
      occurring after treatment novelty has faded. Although increasing treatment duration improves&#xD;
      weight loss, there is a point of diminishing returns as people eventually stop attending&#xD;
      intervention sessions. An alternative strategy to provide the critical support necessary for&#xD;
      weight loss maintenance may be to recruit people who have recently lost weight to a&#xD;
      maintenance-focused intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit up to 400 adult men and women who have recently lost at least 10% of their&#xD;
      body weight and randomize them to either a Self-Directed Intervention or a Guided&#xD;
      Intervention . Self- Directed participants will receive a core set of print materials&#xD;
      describing key behaviors and skills necessary for successful weight loss maintenance and will&#xD;
      review these materials with an intervention coach during two phone sessions. Guided&#xD;
      participants will take part in a set of ten core phone sessions addressing key factors&#xD;
      relevant to weight maintenance (e.g., high levels of physical activity). After completing&#xD;
      these sessions, Guided participants will receive 8 monthly check in calls and then bimonthly&#xD;
      calls for the rest of the study. Guided participants are also asked to report their weight&#xD;
      weekly, either via the Keep It Off website, email or voicemail. Those who experience weight&#xD;
      gain will receive outreach calls to assist them in reversing their recent weight gain. They&#xD;
      will also receive bi-monthly tailored feedback reports based on whether they are maintaining,&#xD;
      losing or gaining weight. We hypothesize that those in the Guided arm of the study will&#xD;
      regain less weight than those in the self-directed arm.&#xD;
