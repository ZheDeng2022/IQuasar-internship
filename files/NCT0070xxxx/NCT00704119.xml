  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RhuDex® (code number AV1142742) is a novel, orally bioavailable, low molecular weight&#xD;
      modulator of co-stimulation of T lymphocytes. RhuDex® binds to the protein CD80 (also known&#xD;
      as B7-1) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and inhibits its interaction with CD28&#xD;
      (but not with CTLA-4) presented by CD4+ T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RhuDex® is being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. To improve oral&#xD;
      bioavailability, the study drug has to be co-administered with an alkaline buffer that&#xD;
      increases gastric pH values. In previous in vitro and phase I studies, meglumine has been&#xD;
      identified as the most effective buffer. Study CT 5002 is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      bioavailability of four increasing doses of RhuDex®, combined with a fixed amount of&#xD;
      meglumine using a tablet formulation, under fed and fasted conditions as well as with&#xD;
      co-administration of the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. Furthermore, dose/plasma&#xD;
      concentration proportionality for single dosing and accumulation effects for repeat dosing of&#xD;
      RhuDex® will be evaluated.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, non-randomized, monocentric Phase I study to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of single-dosed and repeat-dosed RhuDex® using a tablet formulation&#xD;
      as well as to assess the effect of food and the effect with co-administration of a proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor on the bioavailability of RhuDex®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 healthy male subjects will receive study medication in 8 different treatment periods in 4&#xD;
      subsequent steps A, B, C and D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within steps A and B, the subjects will receive different treatments (4 in A and 2 in B),&#xD;
      sequentially. There will be a wash-out period of at least 4 days between each of the 8&#xD;
      different treatments/treatment periods of steps A, B, C and D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step A, each subject will receive increasing doses of RhuDex® in 4 subsequent treatments.&#xD;
      In Step B, each subject will receive 2 different doses of RhuDex® preceded by pantoprazole&#xD;
      intake, in 2 subsequent treatments, and in Step C the RhuDex® dosing will be preceded by a&#xD;
      standardized high-fat, high-calorie meal. In Step D, RhuDex® will be administered twice daily&#xD;
      for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing the pharmacokinetic profile of RhuDex® in steps A, B and C, blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected prior to and at different intervals after RhuDex® administration. In step D,&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected on Days 1, 2, 4 and 7. Cmin, Cmax, tmax, t½ term, CL/F,&#xD;
      AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-∞) of RhuDex® will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by regular observation and documentation of AEs, vital signs,&#xD;
      physical examination, ECG, and laboratory parameters.&#xD;
