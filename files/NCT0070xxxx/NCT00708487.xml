  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potentially damaging effect of free O2 radicals to cultured embryos may be reduced by&#xD;
      adding scavengers to the culture media or by reducing the incubator O2 levels. However,&#xD;
      lowering the O2 in the culture environment can be expensive, troublesome and may not be&#xD;
      justifiable. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of lowered incubator O2&#xD;
      tension on live birth rates in a predominately day-5 embryo transfer program. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of this study is that a lowered (more physiological)oxygen concentration in embryo culture&#xD;
      incubators will increase live birth rates for in vitro fertilization patients. 230&#xD;
      first-cycle women undergoing routine IVF or ICSI with ejaculated sperm will be randomized in&#xD;
      a prospective clinical trial and stratified for patient age and physician. Embryos of&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned for culture in either a 21% O2 (atmospheric) or 5% O2&#xD;
      (reduced) environment. Clinical endpoints monitored will be rates of implantation, clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy, live birth and blastocyst cryopreservation.&#xD;

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if a more physiological oxygen&#xD;
      concentration (5%) will improve clinical outcomes when compared with the industry standard of&#xD;
      21%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: For embryos to grow in the incubator, atmospheric gas concentrations should be as&#xD;
      close to possible to those seen in the oviduct or uterus. Currently, atmospheric&#xD;
      (non-physiological, 21%) oxygen concentrations are used in the incubators to culture the&#xD;
      embryos of infertility patients of the Presbyterian ARTS laboratories. Literature suggest&#xD;
      that culturing animal embryos in a reduced oxygen environment will significantly improve&#xD;
      embryo quality and clinical outcomes. Both 5% and atmospheric oxygen concentrations are&#xD;
      routinely used for embryo culture in the human IVF laboratories, however, very few commercial&#xD;
      human IVF facilities invest in oxygen control as it is more expensive to maintain and labor&#xD;
      intensive to implement. The goal is to use lower oxygen concentrations in the future if&#xD;
      clinical improvement justifies the expense and increased labor associated with low oxygen&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Summary: Study design: The study will be conducted in a prospective, randomized way.&#xD;
      Two treatment groups are considered: 1) existing atmospheric oxygen concentration in embryo&#xD;
      incubators 2) lower 5% oxygen concentration in embryo culture incubators. To allow for the&#xD;
      well-documented decline in pregnancy rates with increased age, patients will be stratified&#xD;
      within 4 age groups and 3 physicians within each treatment. The age groups are: donor eggs;&#xD;
      &lt;35 years; 35 to 37 years; and 38 to 40 years as determined on the day of egg retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Measured: The endpoints measured will be embryo cryopreservation-biochemical&#xD;
      pregnancy-, clinical pregnancy-, ongoing pregnancy-, live birth- and embryo implantation&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients in the Study: To detect a difference of 10% in pregnancy rates, 150&#xD;
      patients should be included in each treatment group. With the current patient volume, it&#xD;
      should take less than one year to complete the study. Differences in implantation rates may&#xD;
      be detected earlier (more embryos transferred than patients enrolled). Should significance&#xD;
      differences in pregnancy rates become evident before the full number of patients is enrolled,&#xD;
      the study may be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location: The study will be conducted at the ARTS facility of Presbyterian Hospital of&#xD;
      Plano.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects: All patients undergoing a first IVF cycle or any donor&#xD;
      oocyte cycle is eligible to participate in this laboratory comparison. The eggs may be&#xD;
      fertilized with conventional IVF methodology or by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection&#xD;
      (ICSI). When performing ICSI, ejaculated sperm must be used. Patients using their own eggs&#xD;
      must be 40 years of age or younger on the day of egg retrieval. The Presbyterian Hospital&#xD;
      ARTS Program performed ~900 egg retrievals in 2000. Of these, ~500 would have met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects: To reduce the tremendous patient variability seen in the&#xD;
      infertile patient population, only first cycle patients 40 years of age or younger on the day&#xD;
      of egg retrieval should participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of Research Material: Patients will be enrolled in this study from the regular&#xD;
      patient pool presented to the Presbyterian ARTS Program for treatment of infertility. Data&#xD;
      will not be collected specifically for research purposes. Data to be used are collected on&#xD;
      all ARTS patients, regardless of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of Subjects: Subjects for this study will be recruited from the regular patient&#xD;
      pool presented to the ARTS Program for the treatment of infertility. Patients that will meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria of this study can be identified prospectively. Information about the&#xD;
      study will be included in the routine, biweekly, group laboratory and nursing orientation&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks: Patients consenting to the comparison will allow their embryos to be&#xD;
      cultured in either the standard atmospheric oxygen concentration or in a reduced, more&#xD;
      physiological oxygen concentration. Atmospheric (21%) oxygen concentrations is the current&#xD;
      standard in this program. Both methods are considered industry standard. To our best&#xD;
      knowledge and as reported in animal literature, low oxygen culture should do better rather&#xD;
      than worse under the conditions proposed for this study. No other culture conditions or&#xD;
      culture media compositions/ingredients that will be applied during this comparison is&#xD;
      experimental. However, when atmospheric oxygen concentrations and lowered (5%) oxygen&#xD;
      concentrations are compared in a controlled, randomized way as suggested in this comparison,&#xD;
      the ARTS Program can not guarantee that the pregnancy outcome will be equivalent for both&#xD;
      treatment groups. Therefore, by being randomized, a patient may be included in a group with a&#xD;
      lower success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special Precautions: If it should become clear early in the study that either one of the&#xD;
      treatments are superior to the other, the study will be discontinued and the best conditions&#xD;
      implemented for future patients.&#xD;
