      Hypothesis: Intensification of current ARV regimens with maraviroc will result in more&#xD;
      complete suppression of viral replication, particularly in the gastrointestinal mucosa with&#xD;
      resultant reduction in markers of immune activation and improved GI immune reconstitution.&#xD;

      -  DURATION: Subjects will participate for a minimum of 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAMPLE SIZE: 18 subjects randomized 2:1 continued ARVs plus maraviroc versus continued&#xD;
           ARVs plus additional ARV to be determined based on baseline ARV regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  REGIMEN: At entry, subjects will be randomized to one of the following in a 2:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification with maraviroc for 24 weeks at one of the following doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  150 mg orally BID when coadministered with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  600 mg orally BID when coadministered with efavirenz or nevirapine&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification with an additional NRTI for 12 weeks then cross over to maraviroc&#xD;
      intensification for an additional 12 weeks as above:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Addition of abacavir 600 mg orally once daily to a tenofovir containing regimen for 12&#xD;
           weeks then replacing the abacavir with maraviroc&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Addition of an alternate FDA approved NRTI [such as zidovudine (AZT) or didanosine&#xD;
           (ddi)] at standard oral dosing to a tenofovir containing regimen for 12 weeks (if the&#xD;
           participant declines abacavir therapy) then replacing the alternate NRTI with maraviroc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether intensification of current ARV regimens with maraviroc will result in&#xD;
      more complete suppression of viral replication and improved immune reconstitution in GI&#xD;
      mucosal lymphoid compartment based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in normalized levels of CD4+MMC HIV-1 RNA as determined by PCR pre- and post-&#xD;
           intensification at week 12 in Arm A versus Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in normalized levels of CD4+ mucosal mononuclear cell (MMC) HIV-1 RNA at week&#xD;
           12 compared to baseline in Arm A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in %CD4+MMC HIV-1 RNA positive as determined by PCR pre- and post-&#xD;
           intensification between Arm A and Arm B as well as week 12 and 24 post maraviroc&#xD;
           intensification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of CD4+ T cells in GALT (% by flow and absolute #s by immunohistochemistry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phenotype of cells in GALT by flow (memory, naive, R5, X4, dual expressing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Levels of activation of CD4 and CD8 in PB and GALT using HLA DR and CD 38.&#xD;
