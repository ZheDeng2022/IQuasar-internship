  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of islet cell&#xD;
      transplantation alone (ITA) in patients with difficult to control type I diabetes. Difficult&#xD;
      to control type 1 diabetes is defined as wide swings in blood glucose that disrupt the&#xD;
      patient's life and result in frequent episodes of low blood glucose despite the proper use of&#xD;
      standard insulin therapy and frequent blood glucose monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is associated with the damage of a specific cell subtype of pancreatic islets&#xD;
      (clusters of cells in the pancreas that produce insulin and other metabolic hormones), which&#xD;
      makes patients depend on an outside source of insulin. Despite insulin treatment, type 1&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus causes a significant risk of long-term problems, including damage to the&#xD;
      heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. The results of recent research studies&#xD;
      suggest that these complications are caused by poor glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantation of islets offers the prospect of good glycemic (blood glucose) control&#xD;
      without the major surgical risks associated with whole pancreas transplant and may result in&#xD;
      not needing any insulin injections. In 2000, a group of investigators in Edmonton, Canada&#xD;
      showed that islet transplantation using a combination of anti-rejection drugs to help prevent&#xD;
      the rejection of transplanted islets was effective in eliminating insulin intake in 7&#xD;
      subjects who were followed up to 20 months. After 5 years, more than 60 patients have been&#xD;
      transplanted at Edmonton and only 1 in 10 remained off of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being performed to confirm the results of the Edmonton study to see if islet&#xD;
      transplantation alone (ITA) is a safe and effective way of treating subjects with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. This study uses a few additional medications and vitamin supplements that were not&#xD;
      included in the original Edmonton study. We hope this will improve the long-term outcome of&#xD;
      islet transplantation.&#xD;
