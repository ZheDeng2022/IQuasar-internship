  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will use advanced and newly available MR imaging techniques at 3 Tesla&#xD;
      (including in situ axial loading and quantitative T1rho, T2, and diffusion measurements) to&#xD;
      assess the intervertebral discs and adjacent vertebrae in patients with lumbar back pain&#xD;
      scheduled for back surgery (n=20), patients with degenerative disease without classic&#xD;
      discogenic back pain (n=10), patients who had discectomies for herniated discs (n=5), and&#xD;
      age-matched volunteers without back pain (n=10). In all patients standard imaging procedures&#xD;
      will also be performed, including radiographs, standard MRI at 1.5 Tesla and discography. All&#xD;
      patients will have specimen of the intervertebral disc harvested at surgery and pathologic&#xD;
      analysis and spectroscopy of these specimen will be performed. Post-surgical findings/outcome&#xD;
      combined with discography will serve as a standard of reference for the identification of the&#xD;
      painful disc(s). The diagnostic performance of the new techniques in assessing the painful&#xD;
      disc will be evaluated. We will collect disc specimens from 50 patients undergoing back&#xD;
      surgery but did not have pre-surgical MR imaging. These disc specimens will be analyzed in&#xD;
      the same manner as the specimens collected from surgical patients who had pre-surgical MRI.&#xD;
      This study will serve as a pilot study for a larger project focusing on advanced imaging of&#xD;
      the painful intervertebral disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis that advanced, dedicated MR examinations at 3T can identify painful degenerated&#xD;
      discs in patients with chronic lumbar back pain.&#xD;

      Disc specimens are taken out during back surgery and will be studied using techniques for&#xD;
      tissue analysis to explain the properties and characteristics of disc tissue from patients&#xD;
      with back pain.&#xD;

        Potential subjects are patients seen by surgeons in the UCSF ACC Orthopedic Clinic. If a&#xD;
        patient meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the orthopedic surgeon will talk to the&#xD;
        patient about the new dedicated examinations using 3 Tesla MRI that can identify painful&#xD;
        degenerated discs. When patient is comfortable with participating and has made a decision&#xD;
        to go ahead with the MRI, patient can let the orthopedic surgeon's assistant know about&#xD;
        his/her decision, the assistant will make sure that patient still meets the inclusion and&#xD;
        exclusion criteria and will call the coordinator at the Imaging Center to set up an MRI&#xD;
        appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Flyers will be posted at different UCSF campuses to recruit for normal age-matched and&#xD;
        young normal volunteers.&#xD;
