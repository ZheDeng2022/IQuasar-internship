  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve the use of a new medicine called GW642444 being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of the&#xD;
      study is to see how safe and how well tolerated the study drug is when inhaled in two&#xD;
      different formulations as a fine powder by asthmatic patients. In addition, the study is&#xD;
      designed to examine the effect of the study drug on the lungs, how the study drug affects&#xD;
      parts of the body other than the lungs and to see how the body affects the study drug when it&#xD;
      is given in single doses.&#xD;
