  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to define the schedule and dose of oral vinorelbine (Navelbine)&#xD;
      to be used with erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Additive or supraadditive activity of an EGFR TK-I with vinorelbine has been demonstrated&#xD;
      in-vitro. Clinical synergism has also been described between gefitinib and vinorelbine in&#xD;
      NSCLC. The use of cytotoxics in a metronomic schedule has not been well investigated in the&#xD;
      clinical setting despite emerging pre-clinical data. Using an established oral cytotoxic such&#xD;
      as oral vinorelbine in a metronomic dose-schedule is attractive due to the oral route of&#xD;
      administration. Preclinical studies have shown that by using cytotoxics in a low-dose&#xD;
      protracted manner, endothelial cells are preferentially affected via inhibition of&#xD;
      proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition to this anti-angiogenic mechanism, an&#xD;
      anti-vasculogenic process may also be involved that acts by reducing circulating endothelial&#xD;
      progenitor mobilization and viability. Moreover, it has also been shown that tumours that&#xD;
      were selected for high levels of acquired resistance to cytotoxics can be induced to respond&#xD;
      by using metronomic doses of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous administration of metronomic oral vinorelbine, given three times a week, has been&#xD;
      reported as feasible and well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg total dose per week. Early&#xD;
      results showed activity against refractory solid tumors such as renal cancer, NSCLC, ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, prostate cancer, unknown primary and Kaposi sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I study combines erlotinib and oral vinorelbine on two different schedules. The&#xD;
      conventional schedule vinorelbine (CSV) aims to determine the MTD of conventional schedule of&#xD;
      oral vinorelbine given on days 1 and 8 every 21 days plus daily erlotinib and the metronomic&#xD;
      schedule vinorelbine (MSV) aims to determine the optimal metronomic dose of vinorelbine given&#xD;
      3 times a week plus daily erlotinib.&#xD;

             advanced unresectable disease. There should be at least 4 weeks since prior&#xD;

               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of Oral Vinorelbine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because vinca alkaloids as well as other therapeutic agents used in this&#xD;
             trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received previous vinorelbine or oral EGFR tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with progressive brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             However patients are eligible if they have brain metastases that have been treated&#xD;
             with whole brain radiotherapy and are stable and not on corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to Oral Vinorelbine or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior and / or concomitant treatment with drugs known to induce or inhibit cytochrome&#xD;
             P450 3A4, CYP1A1 &amp; CYP1A2 : phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin,&#xD;
             imidazole antifungals (such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole,&#xD;
             metronidazole), omeprazole and ritonavir&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant malabsorption syndrome or disease affecting the gastro-intestinal tract&#xD;
             function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding or women of child-bearing potential not using effective&#xD;
             contraception,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Oral Vinorelbine. In addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of organ allograft&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence or history of bleeding diatheses or coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of interaction risk on CYP3A4, patients with concomitant treatments with&#xD;
             vitamin K antagonists such as phenprocoumon or warfarin or heparin or heparinoids&#xD;
             should be excluded&#xD;
