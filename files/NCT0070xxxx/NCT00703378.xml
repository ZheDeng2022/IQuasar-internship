      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PD) model for optimisation of docetaxel&#xD;
      dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish an exposure-toxicity (neutropenia) relationship for docetaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the exposure breakpoint for docetaxel toxicity based on a neutropenia PD&#xD;
           model&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify demographic, pathophysiological and/or phenotypic covariates predicting&#xD;
           docetaxel clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To prospectively validate this PK-PD model for optimisation of docetaxel dosage and&#xD;
           determination PK variability and toxicity&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor tolerance of standard docetaxel dosage regimens used as a single agent in Asians has&#xD;
      been clearly demonstrated by our group in 2 separate studies. Neutropenia emerged as the most&#xD;
      prominent manifestation of chemotherapy toxicity [12, 20]. While this has been attributed to&#xD;
      the lower docetaxel CL derived in our Asian patients, an optimal dosage regimen taking into&#xD;
      account the extensive genetic polymorphisms associated with CYP3A4 has yet to be established.&#xD;
      The use of ketoconazole as a potent CYP3A4 modulator to reduce pharmacokinetic variability of&#xD;
      docetaxel did show &gt;2-fold reduction in docetaxel dosage, but inter-individual variability in&#xD;
      CL was not significantly reduced. There was also poor correlation of docetaxel CL to&#xD;
      midazolam phenotyping of CYP3A4 with the addition of ketoconazole to the regimen [23]. Since&#xD;
      the use of an additional modulator failed to achieve the desired reduction in pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      variability, the idea of using low-dose docetaxel to predict its own pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters appeared feasible, safe and an appealing approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more acute toxicities of docetaxel, such as neutropenia, stomatitis, neurological&#xD;
      toxicities and fluid retention are more frequently associated with the 3 weekly than weekly&#xD;
      dosing schedule. This study is designed so that the less toxic weekly schedule is used for&#xD;
      PK/PD correlation. This information would be utilized to derive an optimal dosage for the 3&#xD;
      weekly regimen that follows since cumulative myelosuppression was not observed with previous&#xD;
      weekly docetaxel for metastatic breast cancer [31].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently patients with impaired liver function manifested by elevated baseline ALT/AST more&#xD;
      than 1.5 more than the institutional limits of normal are not treated with the recommended&#xD;
      dose of docetaxel because of impaired clearance of docetaxel. Theoretically, these patients&#xD;
      may benefit from docetaxel treatment, but the dose will need to be individualized based on&#xD;
      hepatic drug clearance to avoid toxicity. To determine the clinical usefulness of our&#xD;
      strategy of predicting docetaxel clearance and individualised dosing based on clearance and a&#xD;
      PD model, patients with a certain extent of liver dysfunction will be included into the&#xD;
      study. They will be divided into 3 groups according to the level of AST/ALT and SAP, total&#xD;
      bilirubin, and initial weekly doses as well as q3weekly doses will be lower than the&#xD;
      recommended doses for patients with normal liver function. Previous investigators have&#xD;
      reported the feasibility of using the erythromycin breath test as an in vivo probe for CYP3A&#xD;
      activity and docetaxel clearance in patients with liver dysfunction (Baker SD et al&#xD;
      Evaluation of CYP3A activity as a predictor covariate for docetaxel clearance Proceedings of&#xD;
      ASCO 2004; 128: 2006abs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study is that PK/PD guided dosing of docetaxel will reduce the&#xD;
      variability in docetaxel PK while achieving the maximum exposure desired within acceptable&#xD;
      limits of toxicity. At this juncture, this is a novel approach in oncology to fully exploit&#xD;
      the potential of using low-dose docetaxel as its own probe drug to individualise and optimise&#xD;
      dosage for subsequent chemotherapy treatment without having to use other agents to modulate&#xD;
      or predict drug metabolism and clearance.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because docetaxel is embryotoxic/fetotoxic&#xD;
             with the potential for abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with docetaxel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with docetaxel. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
