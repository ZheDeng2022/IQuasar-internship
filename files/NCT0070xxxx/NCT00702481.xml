      The purpose of this study is to define the response and toxicities with the addition of&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab to chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in Head and Neck Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma (HNSCC). EGFR pathway activation is associated with tumor growth, decreased&#xD;
      apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis. These present a putative target for the use of EGFR&#xD;
      inhibitors either in the form of small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies. Several&#xD;
      studies have been advanced that suggest application of these targeted therapies show&#xD;
      promising responses with little additional toxicity. The addition of EGFR monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies to radiation results in better response rates and locoregional control compared to&#xD;
      radiation alone. Addition of EGFR monoclonal antibodies compared to chemotherapy alone also&#xD;
      improves the response rates in patients with advanced HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nimotuzumab is a humanized chimeric monoclonal antibody specific to the extracellular domain&#xD;
      of EGFR. Several studies are ongoing and demonstrate promising efficacy of Nimotuzumab as&#xD;
      monotherapy and in combination with radiation in HNSCC, and in combination with&#xD;
      chemoradiation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. This phase II clinical trial examines the&#xD;
      feasibility of EGFR inhibition using Nimotuzumab in combination with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced unresectable HNSCC. Successful and safe incorporation&#xD;
      of an EGFR monoclonal antibody into the concurrent chemoradiation paradigm used to treat&#xD;
      locally advanced HNSCC will represent an important advance in the optimisation of treatment&#xD;
      for this group of patients.&#xD;
