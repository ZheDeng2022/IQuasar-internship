      The purpose of this study is to determine if a dendritic cell vaccine made with autologous&#xD;
      tumor lysate or for patients who are HLA-A2 with peptides of MUC1 and WT1 therapy will&#xD;
      produce remissions in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This research is being done&#xD;
      because we want to find new therapies for treatment of relapsed or refractory (resistant to&#xD;
      ordinary treatment) ovarian cancer. The use of vaccine therapy is research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new experimental approach for treating refractory or relapsed ovarian cancer involves using&#xD;
      the patients own immune system to kill the cancer cells. These immune cells are called&#xD;
      monocytes and are harvested from blood. The process of Leukapheresis collects the monocytes&#xD;
      called Dendritic Cells. This is usually a 3 hour process done in the comfort of a hospital&#xD;
      bed in the apheresis lab, similar to giving blood for donation. Approximately 300cc's are&#xD;
      collected during this process, the equivalent of about 10 ounces of blood. Once these&#xD;
      dendritic cells are collected - a special laboratory grows and processes them into a vaccine&#xD;
      using a patient's own tumor cells or for those with a specific HLA type (HLA-A2) with tumor&#xD;
      peptides. This preparation is then given back to the patient hopefully to stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system to kill cancer cells. This type of treatment is considered biological research.&#xD;

      Patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma who have failed initial curative chemotherapy&#xD;
      attempts will be evaluated at the time of relapse for tumor debulking surgery prior to the&#xD;
      initiation of salvage chemotherapy. If appropriate, samples will be collected for tumor&#xD;
      lysate preparation for vaccination as per the existing Loyola protocol. Lysates may also be&#xD;
      produced by the collection of malignant effusions as performed for palliation of symptoms.&#xD;
      Patients will then receive palliative chemotherapy to a maximum tumor cytoreduction. Patients&#xD;
      from whom sufficient tumor cells have been collected for DC-based vaccine production will&#xD;
      undergo a leukapheresis for DC cell production. Once completed, these patients will receive a&#xD;
      DC vaccination with 1 x 106 tumor lysate and KLH-loaded immature DCs into inguinal nodes&#xD;
      identified by ultrasound guidance for a total of three injections at two week intervals; or&#xD;
      for those who are HLA-A2 restricted with pharmaceutical grade MUC1 and WT1 tumor peptides.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible if they have failed to enter a complete remission after therapy&#xD;
             and are not eligible for otherwise curative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received any antineoplastic chemotherapy or immunotherapy for&#xD;
             the four weeks preceding tumor excision; six weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin-C&#xD;

             development of the dendritic cell vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of dendritic cell vaccination in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of the vaccine on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional eligibility requirements for vaccine therapy initiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible after tumor collection for the vaccine strategy, or for those&#xD;
             selected to receive ONTAK alone (group 3 -CLOSED) because tumor is not available can&#xD;
             enroll at ay time they fulfill the Eligibility Criteria. Pre-vaccination the goal is&#xD;
             to establish a Minimal Residual Disease state (MRD maximum tumor diameter of any&#xD;
             residual disease ≤ 1cm). This can be achieved with surgery and/or salvage&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Vaccine administration and/or vaccine therapy will commence at least 4&#xD;
             weeks after the completion of the last day of any of the aforementioned therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients to be randomized to groups 1 and 2 must have tumor available for preparation&#xD;
             of tumor lysate vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;

             infection, active bleeding, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled bronchospasm, hypertension, hyperglycemia,&#xD;
             or hypercalcemia; or psychiatric illness/social situations that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate this treatment or&#xD;
             affect compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with the vaccine. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HIV infection, AIDS, or hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, are&#xD;
             excluded from this trial. Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition,&#xD;
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of corticosteroid use in the four weeks preceding entry onto the clinical&#xD;
             trial, or the requirement for ongoing corticosteroid use during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are expected to require therapeutic anticoagulation during the trial&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases&#xD;
