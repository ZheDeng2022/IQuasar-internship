    <textblock>
      Despite significant advances in the understanding of brain tumor biology and genetics as well&#xD;
      as improvements in surgical techniques, radiotherapy administration, and chemotherapy&#xD;
      methods, many primary brain tumors remain incurable. Most primary brain tumors are highly&#xD;
      infiltrative neoplasms, and are therefore unlikely to be cured by local treatments such as&#xD;
      surgery, focal radiotherapy, radiosurgery or brachytherapy. A particularly problematic aspect&#xD;
      of the management of patients with brain tumors is the eventual development of enhancing&#xD;
      lesions on MRI after radiation therapy. The treating physician is then left with the dilemma&#xD;
      of what this enhancing lesion may represent (radiation necrosis versus recurrent tumor). The&#xD;
      differential diagnosis is between recurrent tumor or radiation necrosis however the amount of&#xD;
      each contributing to the enhancing mass on MRI is difficult if not impossible to assess. This&#xD;
      particular problem is very common and most patients develop some degree of radiation necrosis&#xD;
      after therapy with radiation. Differentiation of necrosis from recurrence is particularly&#xD;
      challenging. MRI is typically unable to make this important distinction as there is simply an&#xD;
      enhancing mass, the etiology of which could be either necrosis or recurrence. Other imaging&#xD;
      methods such as FDG-PET have been used but this technique is also complicated in that the&#xD;
      normal brain has FDG uptake and it is often difficult to differentiate recurrence from&#xD;
      necrosis. [F-18]FLT may prove to be the most reliable method in making this important&#xD;
      differentiation (necrosis versus recurrence) as normal brain and necrotic brain do not have&#xD;
      proliferative activity and thus no [F-18]FLT uptake whereas tumor will have proliferative&#xD;
      activity and thus [F-18]FLT uptake.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical 3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18]fluorothymidine, [F-18]FLT, a radiopharmaceutical that&#xD;
      directly assess tumor proliferation using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in&#xD;
      differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis in a group of 30 patients with glial&#xD;
      neoplasms. This preliminary clinical study will investigate [F-18]FLT in patients with&#xD;
      previously treated primary malignant brain tumors (WHO Grade II, III or IV glial-based&#xD;
      tumors) who have a new or enlarging enhancing lesion on Gd-MRI and in whom it is not possible&#xD;
      to differentiate recurrent tumor from radiation necrosis on the basis of conventional imaging&#xD;
      techniques. The ability to make this important differentiation and accurately determine the&#xD;
      amount/degree of tumor recurrence from the amount/degree of radiation necrosis in the&#xD;
      enhancing mass is critical for the care of treated brain tumor patients and could potentially&#xD;
      change patient management once validated as an accurate means of differentiating the&#xD;
      amount/degree of radiation necrosis from recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the safety of [F-18]FLT has been studied in a many patients to date we will also obtain&#xD;
      additional safety data on the use of this agent in patients with primary brain tumors in a&#xD;
      cohort of the initial 12 patients to be studied. It is important to emphasize that the&#xD;
      potential clinical application of [F-18]FLT imaging in brain tumors must be compared to the&#xD;
      current widely used imaging techniques of MRI and PET imaging using the agent, [F-18]&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, [F-18]FLT PET will be used to assess the three goals of this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Show that imaging with [F-18]FLT and PET will or will not better determine the&#xD;
           amount/degree of tumor versus necrosis in the abnormal areas seen on the recent MRI scan&#xD;
           and FDG-PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The [F-18]FLT radiopharmaceutical is shown to be safe or not safe in the amount&#xD;
           administered in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The amount of [F-18]FLT that is seen on the PET study is shown to correlate or not to&#xD;
           correlate with other tests used to determine the proliferation of brain tumors in a&#xD;
           tissue sample of your newly identified abnormality on MRI in the event that another&#xD;
           surgical biopsy or procedure is performed&#xD;

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging methods using radiopharmaceutical agents F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and F-18 fluorothymidine (FLT) were used for analysis. For F-18 FDG, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) with correction for body weight was measured at suspicious area of lesion enhancement. The ratio of F-18 FDG SUVmax of the suspicious lesion to that of the SUVmean of a 1 cm diameter region of normal contralateral white matter was also measured (F-18 FDG ratio lesion: contralateral white matter). For F-18 FLT, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured at suspicious area of lesion enhancement. Patlak graphical analysis was applied using the metabolite-corrected plasma input function to obtain voxel-wise estimates of the FLT metabolic influx parameter (F-18 FLT Kimax).</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (n = 20) with primary brain tumors will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will have had previous radiation and may or may not have had chemotherapy&#xD;
             for treatment of the primary brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have either radiological or established histological diagnosis of&#xD;
             the following general categories: glioma (grade 2 to grade 4) previously treated with&#xD;
             radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy. It is expected that some of the patients&#xD;
             may need a biopsy or neurosurgical procedure for diagnostic and/or therapeutic&#xD;
             purposes as necessary treatment of their disease. In those instances the pathologic&#xD;
             results will be used for correlation with the imaging findings. Only clinically&#xD;
             indicated biopsy and/or surgery will be done and surgery is incidental to inclusion in&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After entry into the study, the initial 12 patients are expected to be followed for at&#xD;
             least 1 month after the infusion of [F-18]FLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient, if female, must be postmenopausal for a minimum of one year or surgically&#xD;
             sterile, or on one of the following methods of birth control for a minimum of one&#xD;
             month prior to entry into this study: IUD, oral contraceptives, Depo-Provera or&#xD;
             Norplant. These criteria can be waived at the discretion of the investigator if the&#xD;
             patient's intracranial tumor is considered life threatening and the one month wait&#xD;
             required is not in the best interest of the patient. Negative pregnancy test is&#xD;
             accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-treatment laboratory tests for patients receiving [F-18]FLT must be performed&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to study entry. These must no greater or less than 4X the normal&#xD;
             upper or lower limits. These will include liver enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, ALK Phos, GGT,&#xD;
             LDH), bilirubin (direct and total), amylase, serum electrolytes, CBC with platelets&#xD;
             and absolute neutrophil counts, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, BUN,&#xD;
             creatinine, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-treatment radiological scans/studies (Gd- enhanced MRI and FDG-PET) for patients&#xD;
             receiving [F-18]FLT must be performed within 10 days of study entry.&#xD;

             pupillary enlargement, rapidly developing motor changes (over hours), or rapidly&#xD;
             decreasing level of consciousness, are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered&#xD;
             radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune&#xD;
             diseases may be enrolled at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive patients due to the previous toxicity noted with FLT in this patient&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
