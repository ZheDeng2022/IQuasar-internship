    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical and immunological effects of the&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor, CC-10004, on skin inflammation associated with cutaneous&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discoid cutaneous lupus is the most common cutaneous manifestation of lupus erythematosus, a&#xD;
      chronic, immune mediated disease of unknown etiology. The immune processes underlying&#xD;
      cutaneous lupus remain largely unexplored, but recent evidence suggests a role for dendritic&#xD;
      cells (DCs), type 1 interferons (IFN) and Th1-type immune processes. Treatment of cutaneous&#xD;
      lupus remains limited primarily to anti-malarials, with thalidomide an effective secondary&#xD;
      agent. However, side effects associated with these treatments are potentially problematic&#xD;
      with chronic use. Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are critical enzymes that degrade cAMP. In&#xD;
      particular, PDE type 4 (PDE4) activity is found in inflammatory and immune cells, including&#xD;
      DCs. The immune modulator CC-10004 is a PDE4 inhibitor with demonstrated low toxicity in&#xD;
      phase I and II clinical studies with potential efficacy in cutaneous lupus. CC-10004 is a&#xD;
      well-tolerated, selective PDE4 inhibitor with demonstrated inhibitory effects on Th1-type&#xD;
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and is under development for the treatment of&#xD;
      inflammatory and immune mediated conditions. Prior studies include pilot trials in psoriasis&#xD;
      and exercise-induced asthma, with results suggesting clinical efficacy in the former study.&#xD;
      This open label, pilot study of 16 weeks duration will explore the clinical and&#xD;
      immune-modulating effects of CC-10004 in 10 cutaneous discoid lupus patients. Patients&#xD;
      meeting study criteria will receive the drug for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week washout&#xD;
      period. Study visit time points will include weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16, during&#xD;
      which we will measure outcomes for clinical, immunological and safety parameters. To&#xD;
      investigate early immunological changes occurring in response to treatment, we will also&#xD;
      perform skin punch biopsies of lesional sites at week 0 and week 4 for immunohistochemical&#xD;
      and molecular analysis.&#xD;

    <measure>Cutaneous LE Diseases Area and Severity Index (CLASI) Score Based on Extent of Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the clinical response of cutaneous lupus patients to CC-10004. From J Invest Dermatol. 2005 Nov; 125(5): 889-894.doi: 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23889.x:&#xD;
The CLASI consists of two scores. One summarizes the activity of the disease on a scale from 0 to 30, higher score translates to more severe disease. The second is a measure of the damage done by the disease on a scale form 0 to 30, higher score translates to more severe disease. Activity is scored on the basis of erythema, scale/hyperkeratosis, mucous membrane involvement, acute hair loss and non-scarring alopecia. Damage is scored in terms of dyspigmentation and scarring, including scarring alopecia. Each score is reported separately. Outcome measures are reported for each time point for each subject due to the low numbers of enrollment.</description>
