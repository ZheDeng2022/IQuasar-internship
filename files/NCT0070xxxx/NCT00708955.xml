    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and provide standard treatments for people with various eye&#xD;
      conditions. It will provide a resource for enrollment into new research protocols throughout&#xD;
      the Eye Institute and will allow institute specialists the opportunity to maintain their&#xD;
      expertise and gain additional knowledge of the course of various eye disorders. The&#xD;
      information obtained will allow for the evaluation of standard treatments and may lead to&#xD;
      ideas for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with diagnosed or undiagnosed eye disease and first-degree relatives of people with a&#xD;
      genetic or developmental eye disease may be eligible for this study. Participants are&#xD;
      evaluated and treated in the National Eye Institute. Blood or other tissue samples (e.g.,&#xD;
      urine, stool, hair, saliva or cheek swab) may be collected for future laboratory studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Eye Institute (NEI) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide standard&#xD;
      treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed ocular conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of this protocol is to provide a reservoir of patients for&#xD;
      enrollment into new research protocols throughout the NEI laboratories. Evaluating and&#xD;
      treating participants will allow the NEI specialists to maintain their expertise and gain&#xD;
      additional knowledge of the course of various eye disorders. The information obtained will&#xD;
      allow for the evaluation of standard treatments of the studied eye diseases. This&#xD;
      understanding may lead to ideas for future protocols. In some cases, blood or other biologic&#xD;
      samples (including tear fluid, urine, saliva, hair, stool or a cheek swab) will be obtained&#xD;
      for future laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but&#xD;
      will be set to 5,000 patients with ocular diseases and their unaffected first-degree&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is an observational natural history study of multiple ocular diseases and their&#xD;
      progression and physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however the clinical assessments of&#xD;
      enrolled participants can be used to measure the response to standard treatment. In addition,&#xD;
      DNA samples obtained may be used to identify and verify causative mutations, which may help&#xD;
      establish pathogenic mechanisms and genotype-phenotype correlations.&#xD;
