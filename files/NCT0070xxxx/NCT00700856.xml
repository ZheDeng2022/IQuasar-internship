      Background: In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin, two main&#xD;
      therapeutic options are equally plausible: add-on a sulfonylurea (SU) or a thiazolidinedione&#xD;
      (TZD). Since the two classes of drugs clearly differ in terms of mechanisms of action, side&#xD;
      effects, economic costs and cardiovascular risk factors profile, a direct comparison of the&#xD;
      two therapeutic strategies would be most appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: 1) To evaluate the effects of add-on pioglitazone as compared with add-on a SU on the&#xD;
      incidence of cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic patients inadequately controlled with&#xD;
      metformin; 2) To compare the two treatments in terms of glycemic control, safety, and&#xD;
      economic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: multicentre, randomised, open label, parallel group trial of 48 months duration.&#xD;
      Eligible participants (type 2 diabetic males and females, aged 50-75 years, BMI 20-45 Kg/m2,&#xD;
      in treatment for the last two months with metformin 2 gr/die in monotherapy and with HbA1c &gt;&#xD;
      =7.0% and &lt;= 9.0%) will be randomized to add-on: a SU - glibenclamide (5-15 mg/die),&#xD;
      gliclazide (30-120 mg/die), glimepiride (2-6 mg/die), chosen according to local practice - or&#xD;
      pioglitazone (15-45 mg/die). A HbA1c value &gt; 8.0 % on two consecutive occasions will lead to&#xD;
      addition of insulin to ongoing oral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy outcome: a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, non fatal MI&#xD;
      (including silent MI), non fatal stroke, and unplanned coronary revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes. Principal secondary outcome: a composite ischemic endpoint of sudden&#xD;
      death, fatal and non fatal acute MI (including silent MI), fatal and non fatal stroke, major&#xD;
      amputations (above ankle), endovascular or surgical intervention on the coronary, leg or&#xD;
      carotid arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      - a composite cardiovascular end point including the primary end point plus hospitalization&#xD;
      for heart failure, endovascular or surgical intervention on the coronary, leg or carotid&#xD;
      arteries, silent MI, angina - by WHO criteria and confirmed by a new electrocardiogram&#xD;
      abnormality - intermittent claudication with an ankle/brachial index lower than 090; events&#xD;
      of heart failure; a microvascular endpoint including: plasma creatinine increase of 2 times&#xD;
      above the baseline value or creatinine clearance reduction of 20ml/min/1. 73m2 or development&#xD;
      of overt nephropathy (dialysis or plasma creatinine &gt;3,3 mg/dl) or macroalbuminuria; glycemic&#xD;
      control (changes from baseline in HBA1c, time to failure of glycemic control, i.e., HBA1c&#xD;
      &gt;8.0% on two consecutive occasions three months apart); major CV risk factors (lipids, blood&#xD;
      pressure, microalbuminuria, inflammation markers, waist circumference); safety and side&#xD;
      effects; direct and indirect costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding CV endpoints, safety, tolerability, and study conduct will be monitored and&#xD;
      analyzed by an independent committee, and will be not available to the study investigators&#xD;
      until the closing of data collection. Efficacy end points will be analyzed on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      diabetic patients.The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)clearly showed that tight glycemic&#xD;
      control significantly decreases diabetes-related events. Therefore, achievement of HbA1c &lt; 7%&#xD;
      is a major goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes since this parameter still represents the&#xD;
      best predictor of micro and macrovascular complications. However, it is often difficult to&#xD;
      maintain this goal because of the progressive deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function&#xD;
      and insulin sensitivity. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes generally requires a&#xD;
      stepwise therapeutic approach starting with lifestyle intervention (diet and increased&#xD;
      physical activity). After lifestyle changes have failed, drug therapy is initiated and&#xD;
      progressively intensified through the combination of different classes of hypoglycemic&#xD;
      agents. Since insulin resistance is recognized as a major factor in the pathogenesis of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes and associated CV risk factors, drugs that improve insulin sensitivity are advised&#xD;
      as initial pharmacological therapy. Currently, metformin is recommended as the first-line&#xD;
      drug for patients with type 2 diabetes. Great uncertainty exists regarding the best&#xD;
      therapeutic option in diabetic patients inadequately controlled with metformin, due to the&#xD;
      lack of randomized controlled trials that have directly compared the efficacy of different&#xD;
      combination regimens in achieving glycemic goals. The paucity of sound clinical evidence in&#xD;
      this area is highlighted in a Consensus Statement from the American Diabetes Association and&#xD;
      the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, that suggested either a sulphonylurea&#xD;
      (SU) or a thiazolidinediones (TZD) as additional medication to metformin, in the absence of&#xD;
      data demonstrating the superiority of one combination over the other. Addition of a SU or a&#xD;
      TZD to concomitant metformin results in a substantial improvement in glucose control with a&#xD;
      mean reduction in HbA1c of 1-1.5%. However, a direct evaluation of these treatment&#xD;
      strategies, within a large clinical trial, would be most appropriate, given their different&#xD;
      mechanisms of action, side effects and costs. Indeed, the only direct comparison between a SU&#xD;
      and a TZD added to metformin has been obtained in a short-term study (24 weeks), which showed&#xD;
      a greater reduction in HbA1c with the association metformin-glibenclamide (- 1.5%) compared&#xD;
      with the association metformin-rosiglitazone (-1.1%, &lt;0.001). More patients receiving&#xD;
      metformin-glibenclamide reached HbA1c &lt;7.0 % than did those receiving metformin-rosiglitazone&#xD;
      (60% vs. 47%). In addition, a more favorable lipid profile was present in patients treated&#xD;
      with metformin-glibenclamide, although this finding has not been confirmed in other studies.&#xD;
      However, the short duration of the study precluded evaluation of CV endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of information prevents an evidence-based choice between these two treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this respect, several studies are underway to investigate the potential of different&#xD;
      glucose-lowering therapies on CV outcomes. With regard to SU, retrospective cohort studies&#xD;
      have documented a higher risk of adverse outcomes in patients treated with a SU in&#xD;
      monotherapy or in combination with metformin as compared to metformin alone. In the UKPDS,&#xD;
      diabetic patients treated with a combination of glibenclamide plus metformin showed an&#xD;
      increase in CV mortality compared with other groups of treatment. However, these data derive&#xD;
      from a post-hoc analysis and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution. In contrast, the&#xD;
      ADOPT study has shown a lower proportion of CV events in the glibenclamide group compared&#xD;
      with rosiglitazone and metformin. These conflicting reports underline the need to evaluate&#xD;
      the rate of CV events induced by the combination metformin-SU in comparison with other&#xD;
      treatment strategies. Regarding TZDs, a recent prospective study (PROACTIVE Study) has&#xD;
      compared the efficacy of adding pioglitazone (from 15 to 45 mg/die) or placebo to the&#xD;
      standard hypoglycemia therapy in the secondary prevention of CV events in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Pioglitazone treatment did not significantly affect the primary endpoint, which&#xD;
      included all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, endovascular or&#xD;
      surgical intervention in the coronary or leg arteries and leg amputation, but significantly&#xD;
      reduced the number of patients who experienced the secondary endpoint (all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      nonfatal MI and stroke). However, patients treated with pioglitazone had 115 more episodes of&#xD;
      heart failure than the placebo group. In addition, weight gain was 4 kg greater with&#xD;
      pioglitazone than with placebo, and much greater than that expected on the basis of the&#xD;
      improved glycemic control. These conflicting reports support the need for large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trials that compare the efficacy of the association of metformin plus a SU vs.&#xD;
      metformin plus a TZD on CV outcomes. For these reasons, the Italian Diabetes Society has&#xD;
      organized a randomized controlled clinical trial on long term cardiovascular effects of these&#xD;
      two therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study is to ascertain whether in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes poorly controlled with metformin in monotherapy, the addition of pioglitazone&#xD;
      reduces the rate of cardiovascular events as compared with the addition of a SU. Glucose&#xD;
      control, major CV risk factors, safety, tolerability and economic costs with the two&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens will also be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: multicentre, randomized, open-label, comparative, parallel-group trial of 48 months&#xD;
      duration (PROBE: Prospective Randomized Open Blinded End-Point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT WAS TERMINATED IN JANUARY 20147, WITH 3040 PATIENTS ENROLLED. Screening and&#xD;
      follow-up took place at several Clinical Units which will work in collaboration with a&#xD;
      network of Diabetes Outpatients Clinics all over Italy. All study procedures will be&#xD;
      performed by trained study personnel according to a standardized protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients meeting the inclusion criteria, free from any condition listed in the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria and giving the informed consent, have been randomized to one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin (2 gr/die) + sulfonylurea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin (2 gr/die) + pioglitazone In the group randomized to metformin plus a&#xD;
           sulfonylurea the choice between glibenclamide, gliclazide and glimepiride will be left&#xD;
           to the study physician following local practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres were masked to the randomization sequences which were generated at the&#xD;
      Epidemiology Unit of the &quot;Consorzio Mario Negri Sud&quot; (Dr Nicolucci). Patients entering the&#xD;
      trial were allocated to the treatment group upon a telephone call from the clinic to the&#xD;
      Epidemiology Unit after verification of all eligibility/exclusion criteria. The randomization&#xD;
      sequences were stratified by clinic, gender and previous cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are seen for clinical follow up after 1, 3 and 6 months from the randomization and&#xD;
      then every 6 months unless clinical conditions requiring more frequent medical consultations&#xD;
      develop (according to GCP). Telephonic contacts are established with all patients in order to&#xD;
      take information on adverse events,on glycaemic control and to modify drugs dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metformin dose will remain constant throughout the study; the initial dose of added drug&#xD;
      will be 5 mg glibenclamide or 30 mg gliclazide or 2 mg glimepiride for the group randomized&#xD;
      to metformin plus SU and 15 mg pioglitazone in the group randomized to metformin plus&#xD;
      pioglitazone. If glucose control is unsatisfactory (fasting glucose &gt;120mg/dl or post&#xD;
      prandial glucose &gt;160 mg/dl in more than 50% of home readings over a 8 weeks period), study&#xD;
      medications will be uptitrated to the maximal effective daily dose (i.e. 15 mg glibenclamide,&#xD;
      120 mg gliclazide, 6 mg glimepiride, 45 mg pioglitazone). If a HbA1c &gt;8.0% is observed at any&#xD;
      follow up visit, patients will receive reinforcement of lifestyle education, compliance to&#xD;
      study protocol will be assessed and a glycated hemoglobin measurement will be repeated after&#xD;
      three months. A confirmed value &gt;8.0% despite adherence to maximal doses of study medications&#xD;
      for the previous three months, will lead to addiction of a single injection of insulin&#xD;
      Glargine bed-time. Insulin titration will be performed on the basis of fasting capillary&#xD;
      glycemia according to a pre-defined algorithm. If a HbA1c &gt;8.0% is observed at two&#xD;
      consecutive follow-up visits 3 months apart, one or more injections of analog insulin will be&#xD;
      added. Insulin will be titrated down, according to a pre-specified algorithm, if frequent&#xD;
      hypoglycemic episodes occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of concomitant medications (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and antiplatelet agents)&#xD;
      will be permitted throughout the study, according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will stop the study medications but will remain in the study if any of the following&#xD;
      conditions develops:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alanine aminotransferase increases 2.5 or more times above baseline on two consecutive&#xD;
           occasions (one month apart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  signs and symptoms suggestive of heart failure evaluated according to the American Heart&#xD;
           Association and the American Diabetes Association consensus on glitazones and heart&#xD;
           failure (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bladder cancer (in that case the study drug will be stopped only in the pioglitazone&#xD;
           arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical conditions contraindicating oral hypoglycemic treatment and requiring stable&#xD;
           insulin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated based on the assumption that the study results would be&#xD;
      relevant for the public health point of view in case add-on treatment with pioglitazone&#xD;
      proves more effective than add-on sulfonylureas for the management of hyperglycemia and the&#xD;
      prevention of the chronic complications of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is thus estimated to detect with a 80% power of reduction in the risk of&#xD;
      events of 20% (HR=0.80; metformin + Pioglitazone vs metformin + SU), with p&lt;0.05 (one sided&#xD;
      log rank test). Assuming an estimated occurrence rate of the primary end point of 3.5% per&#xD;
      annum (24-26) and a 5% loss at follow-up, a total of 3371 patients will be enrolled with the&#xD;
      event driven analysis at 498 end point events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) composed of Cardiologists and Specialists in Internal&#xD;
      Medicine with vascular expertise will review and adjudicate all potential end points,&#xD;
      according to pre-specified criteria. This committee will be blind to the study medication&#xD;
      assignment group and independent of the Steering Committee. Side effects (i.e. weight gain,&#xD;
      peripheral edema, hypoglycemic episodes, etc.) will be monitored. All adverse events, whether&#xD;
      or not attributed to study drugs, will be collected and recorded on the appropriate, ad hoc&#xD;
      page(s) of the Case Report Form (CRF). The Data Safety Monitoring Board, composed of clinical&#xD;
      trials expertise, will monitor events and side effects and will decide the study&#xD;
      discontinuation in the case of a significant difference between the two arms in the rate of&#xD;
      the primary endpoint or serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and at each follow-up visit (ever six months) the following parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vital signs, anthropometry, check for any new signs/symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  home glucose readings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency of hypoglycemic episodes graded by severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intercurrent illnesses/events, change(s) in use or dose of drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  history of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, major leg amputation&#xD;
           (above ankle), acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, endovascular or surgical&#xD;
           intervention on the coronary, leg or carotid arteries)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  angina or intermittent claudication At baseline and every months safety parameters (ALT,&#xD;
           AST, macroematuria) and HbA1c will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and every 12 months serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides), microalbuminuria and C Reactive Protein (CRP) will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and every 12 months a standard resting ECG (Minnesota coding) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study investigations will be performed according to a standard protocol described in&#xD;
      detail in the operating manual which will be produced by the Coordinating Center in&#xD;
      collaboration with the Steering Committee. Prior to study start-up, the investigators will&#xD;
      attend training and standardization sessions to reduce inter-observer variability; these&#xD;
      sessions will be organized and supervised by the Coordinating Centre. Ad hoc CRFs will be&#xD;
      developed to collect information which will be transmitted to the Epidemiology Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRFs will be reviewed and data queries will be produced to correct missing or incorrect&#xD;
      data on the CRFs. Periodically a Quality Team (appointed by the Steering Committee) will&#xD;
      check the amount of CRFs per centre and produce recalls for centres not sending CRFs. An&#xD;
      electronic data base will be created using a standardized procedure of data input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study conduct (i.e. timing, adherence to protocol etc..) at each participating centre&#xD;
      will be monitored by regular visits of professional monitors (at the start-up, at the end of&#xD;
      the study and twice a year). A Steering Committee will meet to review the study progress&#xD;
      every 6 months, and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor&#xD;
      safety outcomes throughout the course of the study. This Committee will assess at given&#xD;
      intervals the safety data, the critical efficacy endpoints and will recommend whether to&#xD;
      continue, modify, or stop the trial. Stringent statistical criteria will be set for early&#xD;
      study termination in the event of a clear-cut difference between the treatment groups with&#xD;
      respect to all-cause mortality. The DSMB should also recommend termination of the study for&#xD;
      other serious safety reasons. The DSMB will meet independently of the Steering Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP)Guidelines. The protocol&#xD;
      will be approved by Ethics Committees or Institutional Review Boards of each centre. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from all participants before beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical centres, one epidemiology unit, and a central laboratory will participate in&#xD;
      the study. The Coordinating Centre (Prof Riccardi) will be responsible for preparation of the&#xD;
      study protocol together with the Steering Committee and for the preparation of the manual of&#xD;
      operations, standardization and training sessions for the field investigators and for the&#xD;
      monitoring of study conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Epidemiology unit (Dr Nicolucci) will provide a centralized randomization system for the&#xD;
      patients allocation to study medications, will be responsible for data managing, creation of&#xD;
      an appropriate electronic data base-planned according to the GCP- and for data analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation of end points will be performed under the responsibility of Prof&#xD;
      Giuseppe Gallus (University of Milan) according to a protocol of analysis approved by the&#xD;
      Steering Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events monitoring and analysis will be provided by the Unit of Pharmacovigilance of&#xD;
      the Federico II University of Naples (Prof. G. Di Renzo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacoeconomics evaluation will be provided by the Interdepartmental Centre of&#xD;
      Pharmacoeconomy of the Federico II University of Naples (Prof G.L. Mantovani).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory measurements including fasting glucose, haematology markers, liver&#xD;
      enzymes, hepatitis markers, renal function tests, serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in&#xD;
      premenopausal women will be performed at each centre. A central laboratory participating to&#xD;
      an external quality control program will measure glycated hemoglobin (HPLC), standard lipid&#xD;
      profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), macroematuria, microalbuminuria,&#xD;
      CRP (ELISA; high sensitivity). Extra samples will be collected and stored (-70 °C) for future&#xD;
      biochemical analyses. A genetic biobank will be prepared.&#xD;
