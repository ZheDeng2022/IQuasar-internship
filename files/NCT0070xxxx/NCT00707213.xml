      Patients must be currently treated at the Huntsman Cancer Institute or Intermountain Primary&#xD;
      Children's Medical Center to be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been many advances in the assessment and treatment of infections&#xD;
      responsible for febrile neutropenia in cancer patients, it still remains a common&#xD;
      complication of cancer therapy and accounts for the majority of chemotherapy-associated&#xD;
      deaths. This National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded proposal using the R-21 Quick-Trials&#xD;
      Exploratory Grant mechanism is to conduct an exploratory/pilot project in a group of patients&#xD;
      with persistent febrile neutropenia to provide critical information that will support the&#xD;
      concept, and aid in the design, of a larger multi-center clinical trial. The ultimate goal of&#xD;
      our interdisciplinary team of oncologists, infectious diseases experts, imagers, and&#xD;
      biostatisticians is to conduct a prospective, multi-center trial to establish the utility and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of PET/CT using the widely available glucose analogue&#xD;
      [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in identifying sites of infection in cancer patients with&#xD;
      persistent febrile neutropenia without an obvious identifiable source thus improving targeted&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      What is the significance of this project? The significance is two fold: (1) the serious&#xD;
      nature of the clinical condition that it addresses, and (2) in the potential ease and safety&#xD;
      by which this approach could be translated to clinical practice. Although there have been&#xD;
      many advances in treatment modalities related to febrile neutropenia, it still remains a&#xD;
      common complication of cancer therapy and accounts for the majority of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-associated deaths (Sipsas 2005). The broad-spectrum therapeutic management of&#xD;
      febrile neutropenia is often &quot;shotgun&quot; in its approach, without a clear source to allow&#xD;
      target-specific therapy. The subpopulation of patients with febrile neutropenia that present&#xD;
      the greatest problem is that with persistent febrile neutropenia &gt; 5 days despite broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotics, and without an identifiable source of infection. As noted previously,&#xD;
      however, the definition of persistence is changing in medical practice. Currently medical&#xD;
      professionals are ordering diagnostic imaging studies such as CT scans earlier due to the&#xD;
      need to localize a site of infection and use the most appropriate antibiotic therapy. Without&#xD;
      a target, multi-drug antibiotic therapy in these patients can continue for many weeks. The&#xD;
      drugs are often toxic, with substantial side effects. Hospitalization is extended. The cost&#xD;
      of broad spectrum hospital course of antibacterial and antifungal drugs is in the range of&#xD;
      multiples of $10,000, and the cost of extended hospitalization to treat an unknown infection&#xD;
      in a patient with persistent febrile neutropenia may be multiples of $100,000. Chemotherapy&#xD;
      may be suspended or discontinued, with risk of development of chemo-resistant tumor cells.&#xD;
      Conventional imaging methods are limited in evaluation of febrile neutropenia due to lack of&#xD;
      anatomic changes. The lack of sufficient white cells to mount an inflammatory reaction&#xD;
      compromises detection of sites of infection by radiography or CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because white cell number is severely reduced, the use of labeled white cell scans is often&#xD;
      precluded. If FDG-PET/CT can provide a likely anatomic site for targeted antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      in this specific high risk population, it is possible that morbidity/mortality from infection&#xD;
      and antibiotic side effects may be minimized, hospitalization days may be reduced, and&#xD;
      effective anti-cancer therapy may be continued without interruption. Although FDG-PET/CT is&#xD;
      not cheap, the ultimate result may be highly cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our oncologist and infectious diseases co-investigators predict that a tissue diagnosis can&#xD;
      be obtained in at least 80% of all FDG-PET/CT or CT findings that are suspicious for&#xD;
      infection in children and 50% in adults. This confirmatory tissue diagnosis will serve as the&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; to assess the effectiveness of FDG-PET/CT in finding a source of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional confirmatory factors will include clinical response to targeted therapy and&#xD;
      resolution of associated radiographic or CT findings. The data will be evaluated to address&#xD;
      the following questions, which are the sub-aims of the funded proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How effective is FDG-PET/CT in identifying sites of infection in patients with febrile&#xD;
           neutropenia without an obvious cause?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To what degree does FDG-PET/CT improve detection of sites of infection over CT alone?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What FDG-PET/CT imaging variables best predict the presence of infection at a specific&#xD;
           site (e.g. standardized uptake value [SUV], concomitant abnormality on CT)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can the magnitude of uptake of FDG measured by an SUV at sites of infection predict the&#xD;
           identity of the infective agent (bacterial vs. fungal vs. viral)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does magnitude of uptake at sites of infection correlate with absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
           (ANC)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Can a clinical scoring system be developed to identify a population of patients in whom&#xD;
           FDG-PET/CT is likely to be most efficacious in identifying sites of infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot data will be used to determine whether there is sufficient support for, and to aid&#xD;
      in the design of, a large, prospective, multi-center clinical trial to establish the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and efficacy of FDG-PET/CT in evaluation of febrile neutropenia, compared&#xD;
      to patients who are managed by conventional methods.&#xD;

        Pediatric patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All pediatric subjects will be recruited from Intermountain Primary Children's Medical&#xD;
        Center (PCMC). At any point in time, there are 6-10 inpatients at PCMC who are being&#xD;
        treated as in-patients for febrile neutropenia. Each day, 2-3 new patients with febrile&#xD;
        neutropenia are admitted or transferred to PCMC from hospitals and clinics across the&#xD;
        intermountain area. Approximately 3-5 patients per week will be eligible for inclusion in&#xD;
        this study (having high-risk persistent febrile neutropenia without an obvious cause). The&#xD;
        target for this study is to recruit a minimum of 1-2 pediatric patients per month to the&#xD;
        protocol. Therefore, the eligible pediatric patient population should be more than&#xD;
        sufficient to meet this goal. Most of these patients are &gt;10 years of age. The vast&#xD;
        majority are adolescents and teenagers, because pediatric patients at highest risk for&#xD;
        febrile neutropenia are those on high dose methotrexate for high risk leukemia and&#xD;
        lymphomas that target adolescents and teenagers. Leukemics constitute the largest&#xD;
        percentage of these patients. To be eligible for inclusion, subjects must be admitted for&#xD;
        treatment as in-patients for febrile neutropenia, with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;&#xD;
        500 cells/mm3, in whom a fever persists without obvious source despite 5 days of broad&#xD;
        spectrum antibiotics. Typically, pediatric patients in this category will have been treated&#xD;
        with IV Fortaz (ceftazidime). We will also study patients that do not meet the older&#xD;
        definition of persistent (&gt; 5 days) fever who for medical reasons an advanced imaging study&#xD;
        (typically CT scans) is now medically indicated for localization of a possible site of&#xD;
        infection. These patients will have a fever and be neutropenic, however they may not have&#xD;
        been febrile for &gt; 5 days. Medical imaging is indicated sooner than the typical 5 days due&#xD;
        to the patients condition and need to localize a site of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria will include inability to undergo a FDG-PET/CT scan without conscious&#xD;
        sedation, medical instability that would preclude safe transport to the PET center in the&#xD;
        Huntsman Cancer Hospital (PCMC does not have a PET scanner), and a fasting serum glucose &gt;&#xD;
        200 mg/dl. A negative pregnancy test will be required in post-menarche females prior to&#xD;
        inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All adult subjects will be recruited from the Huntsman Cancer Hospital, patients will be&#xD;
        recruited from the general oncology service. As for the pediatric patients, those&#xD;
        considered eligible will include those with a documented fever &gt; 5 days despite IV&#xD;
        antibiotics, an ANC &lt; 500 cells/mm3, and in patient treatment as a high risk patient. We&#xD;
        will also study patients that do not meet the older definition of persistent (&gt; 5 days)&#xD;
        fever who for medical reasons an advanced imaging study (typically CT scans) is now&#xD;
        medically indicated for localization of a possible site of infection. These patients will&#xD;
        have a fever and be neutropenic, however they may not have been febrile for &gt; 5 days.&#xD;
        Medical imaging is indicated sooner than the typical 5 days due to the patients condition&#xD;
        and need to localize a site of infection. On average, 5-6 patients per week are admitted to&#xD;
        the Huntsman Cancer Hospital with the diagnosis of high risk persistent febrile&#xD;
        neutropenia. At any one time, there are typically 3-4 adult in patients on the ward with&#xD;
        the diagnosis of persistent febrile neutropenia. Of these, approximately 2-3 patients per&#xD;
        week will be eligible for inclusion in this study (having persistent febrile neutropenia&#xD;
        without an obvious cause). The target for this study is to recruit a minimum of 1-2 adult&#xD;
        patients per month to the protocol. Therefore, the eligible adult patient population should&#xD;
        be more than sufficient to meet this goal. As with the pediatric population, the majority&#xD;
        of these patients have leukemia and lymphoma (50:50). Adult patients may also have multiple&#xD;
        myeloma. In these patients, the typical duration of neutropenia is 3-4 weeks. Typically,&#xD;
        the initial workup of the adult patients with febrile neutropenia is a chest X-ray, CBC,&#xD;
        urinalysis, peripheral and central line blood culture, and additional studies only as&#xD;
        directed by symptoms. Initial in-patient treatment for high risk patients is typically with&#xD;
        IV meropenem and ceftazidime. If fever persists beyond 5 days without specific localizing&#xD;
        signs or symptoms, antibacterials may be changed or added, and antifungals are started&#xD;
        (typically amphotericin B or caspofungin), typically persisting until the white count&#xD;
        returns to 1000 cell/mm3. Additional imaging studies are not done on a consistent basis for&#xD;
        the adults with persistent high-risk febrile neutropenia. Extended imaging is typically&#xD;
        done only as symptoms dictate. Typically, a source of infection is found in only 40-50% of&#xD;
        patients with febrile neutropenia at our institutions as well as from the literature&#xD;
        (Chaimberlain 2005; Hughes 2002; Roguin 1996). In the persistent febrile neutropenia&#xD;
        patient despite further and more comprehensive evaluation and assessment a source is&#xD;
        identified in only about an additional 10% of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As with pediatric patients, adult exclusion criteria will include inability to undergo a&#xD;
        FDG-PET/CT without conscious sedation, medical instability, a fasting serum glucose &gt; 200&#xD;
        mg/dl, and pregnancy. A negative pregnancy test will be required of all females of&#xD;
        reproductive potential prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Of note, patients from the bone marrow transplant unit will be eligible to participate in&#xD;
        this pilot study,. Many of these patients are placed on prophylactic antifungal agents at&#xD;
        the time of presentation of neutropenia and fever. This may cause a drug-induced fever in a&#xD;
        certain percentage of recipients. For this reason, the clinical picture is clouded however&#xD;
        the patients may still have an occult infection. Bone marrow transplant patients will be&#xD;
        included in the study as this is an exploratory study and the information gained from&#xD;
        assessing the ability of FDG-PET/CT to localize sites of infection in neutropenic, febrile&#xD;
        bone marrow transplant patients will be valuable.&#xD;
