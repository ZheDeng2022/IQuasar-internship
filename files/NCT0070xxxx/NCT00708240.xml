  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although research suggests that patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit&#xD;
      specific deficits in their high cognitive processes, it is still unknown how these deficits&#xD;
      relate to the clinical symptoms of the disorder, and to the response to treatment. There are&#xD;
      two aims for the proposed research. The first is to examine how high cognitive processes and&#xD;
      brain activity are affected in OCD. The second aim is to investigate the effects of a&#xD;
      specific psychotropic medication (escitalopram) on high cognitive processes and brain&#xD;
      activity in OCD. We will investigate how 40 youth with OCD (recruited in specialized clinics)&#xD;
      differ from 40 healthy youth (recruited from the local community) on selected cognitive tests&#xD;
      and brain imaging paradigms, as well as explore how treatment with medication can correct or&#xD;
      reverse the observed differences. The final goal of our research is to learn more about the&#xD;
      mechanisms of action for available treatments, in order to refine and improve short- and&#xD;
      long-term therapeutic strategies for a highly debilitating and often lifelong disorder.&#xD;

      Rationale. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often has a childhood onset, and is&#xD;
      characterized by recurrent obsessions and compulsions that are perceived as irrational and&#xD;
      cause significant interference in daily functioning. Neuropsychological and/or neuroimaging&#xD;
      investigations have consistently implicated pathways involving the ventral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortical regions in the pathophysiology of the disorder. In the absence of attention or&#xD;
      memory loss, OCD patients perform more poorly than controls on tasks requiring inhibition of&#xD;
      an automatic response. Dysfunction of a frontal-striatal-thalamic circuit in OCD may be&#xD;
      mediated by abnormalities in glutamatergic-serotonin neurotransmission, and selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the unique class of psychotropic medication with&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy for youth (and adults) with the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and hypotheses. The first objective of the study is to examine how executive&#xD;
      functions, metacognition performance, and regional brain activations differ in adolescents&#xD;
      with OCD compared to healthy controls. Three specific hypotheses will be tested: (1) in&#xD;
      adolescents with OCD, the executive functions related to the frontal cortex will be impaired&#xD;
      compared to healthy controls; (2) the metacognition performance of the OCD group will be&#xD;
      lower than that of the control group; (3) using fMRI, the OCD group's frontal lobe&#xD;
      activations during tasks testing response inhibition and working memory, will be higher than&#xD;
      those in the control group. The second objective is to investigate how treatment with the&#xD;
      SSRI escitalopram will affect executive functions, metacognition performance, and regional&#xD;
      brain activations in adolescents with OCD. After pharmacotherapy, three specific hypotheses&#xD;
      will be tested: (1) there will be significant improvement from baseline in the OCD group's&#xD;
      frontal executive functions and metacognition performance; (2) the differences on executive&#xD;
      functions and metacognition performance between the OCD and control groups will no longer be&#xD;
      significant; (3) on repeated fMRI procedures, the OCD group's frontal lobe activations will&#xD;
      show a significant decrease from baseline. The third objective is to explore, within the&#xD;
      patient group, the relationships between the degree of clinical change, and the magnitude of&#xD;
      pre-post-treatment changes in neurocognitive performance, and regional brain activations. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that greater clinical improvement will be associated with greater changes on&#xD;
      the selected neurocognitive and neurofunctional measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. Forty subjects, aged 13-19 years, with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD, and 40&#xD;
      sex-, and age-matched healthy controls, will be recruited from Ottawa mental health centers&#xD;
      and the community. The study will use a pre- post-treatment design, and include three phases.&#xD;
      Phase I: Pre-treatment, the OCD subjects will be compared to controls on clinical,&#xD;
      neurocognitive, and functional brain activation measures. Phase II: The OCD subjects will&#xD;
      receive open treatment with escitalopram (5 mg to 20 mg/day) for 16 weeks. Phase III: The&#xD;
      clinical, neurocognitive, and functional brain activations measures will be repeated in all&#xD;
      OCD subjects who completed 16 weeks of escitalopram pharmacotherapy, and the neurocognitive&#xD;
      measures in control participants after 16 weeks. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop&#xD;
      Test, and a Working Memory Task will be used to assess frontal executive functions. The&#xD;
      Feeling-of-knowing task and Metacognition Questionnaire will measure metacognition&#xD;
      performances. To investigate regional brain activations (only in participants aged 15-19&#xD;
      years), two functional neuroimaging paradigms will be used, a Go/NoGo and a n-Back task, and&#xD;
      regional brain activations will be measured using fMRI technology. In patients, clinical&#xD;
      severity and changes with treatment will be assessed using the Children's Yale Brown&#xD;
      Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, the State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory for Children, and the Children Depression Inventory. Statistical methods&#xD;
      will include repeated measures MANOVAS, t-tests, and correlational analyses.&#xD;
