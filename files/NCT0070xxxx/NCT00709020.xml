      RATIONALE: White button mushroom extract may stop or delay the recurrence of breast cancer in&#xD;
      postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of white button&#xD;
      mushroom extract in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women who&#xD;
      are breast cancer survivors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To show that a whole food extract of white button mushrooms (WBM) can inhibit&#xD;
           aromatase-induced estrogen biosynthesis in postmenopausal women who are breast cancer&#xD;
           survivors (BCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the optimal daily dose of WBM needed to induce aromatase inhibition of&#xD;
           estrogen biosynthesis in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the bioavailability of C-18 unsaturated fatty acids, which are thought to&#xD;
           moderate the anticancer effects of WBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of WBM in humans via serial comprehensive&#xD;
           symptom questionnaires, pre- and post-treatment markers of bone metabolism, and pre- and&#xD;
           post-treatment comprehensive lipid panels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore potential alternate antitumor mechanisms, specifically the effect of WBM on&#xD;
           cytokines as well as innate and adaptive cellular immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe barriers experienced in recruitment of ethnically diverse subjects from the&#xD;
           community into a secondary prevention BCS trial utilizing a dietary supplement&#xD;
           intervention in an effort to enhance feasibility of a subsequent phase II trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral white button mushroom extract twice daily for 12 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of a second primary ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive breast cancer, or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and periodically during&#xD;
      treatment for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and immunologic correlative studies. Blood&#xD;
      and urine samples are analyzed for concentrations of C-18 unsaturated fatty acids (CUFA) by&#xD;
      high-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. Blood samples are also&#xD;
      analyzed for anti-aromatase activity by ex vivo plasma aromatase inhibition assays;&#xD;
      circulating sex steroid hormones by radioimmunoassay; serum immune cytokine levels by&#xD;
      multiplex cytokine analyses; immunophenotyping, NK-cell activation status, and NK-cell&#xD;
      function by multiparameter flow cytometry; lipid levels by lipid assays; and biochemical&#xD;
      markers of bone metabolism by bone metabolism marker assays. DNA, RNA, and plasma samples are&#xD;
      stored for post-trial pharmacogenomic studies.&#xD;
