  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a mono-center randomized controlled trial to be performed in the Center of Medical&#xD;
      Research (ZMF) at Medical University Graz and is composed by one screening visit (V1) and two&#xD;
      study visits (V2 and V3). In the visit V1, complete medical examination will be performed and&#xD;
      blood samples will be withdrawn to check overall conditions of the healthy volunteers. Those&#xD;
      who accomplish the necessary conditions will be enrolled in the trial to receive either&#xD;
      saline or lipid-heparin solutions in a randomized, cross-over design during visits V2 and V3.&#xD;
      Volunteers will arrive at ZMF after overnight fasting, when two venous catheters will be&#xD;
      placed in forearm veins. One venous catheter will be used for continuous infusion of&#xD;
      lipid-heparin solution (Intralipid 20%, 40 ml/h, Fresenius Kabi plus Heparin 250U/h, IMMUNO&#xD;
      Baxter AG) or saline, and Inulin (Inutest 25%, Fresenius Kabi). The second venous catheter&#xD;
      will be used for blood sampling (arterialized venous blood). Subsequently, two open flow&#xD;
      microperfusion (OFM) macro-perforated catheters will be inserted in the subcutaneous tissue&#xD;
      of abdominal wall for continuous sampling of interstitial fluid. Study visits will last for&#xD;
      28 hours for continuous sampling, with four additional hours for observation after infusion&#xD;
      discontinuation, during visits V2 and V3. Concentrations of different cytokines,&#xD;
      non-esterified fatty-acids, insulin, glucose, triglycerides and inulin will be&#xD;
      retrospectively quantified in the frozen samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that cytokine concentrations in subcutaneous tissue and/or in&#xD;
      circulation can be modified by lipid-heparin infusion.&#xD;

      1. General&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be selected to participate in the protocol during study visit 1 according&#xD;
           to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently they will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
           receive continuously an intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline or a lipid-heparin solution&#xD;
           (Intralipid 20%, 40 ml/h, Fresenius Kabi plus Heparin 250U/h, IMMUNO Baxter AG) during&#xD;
           28 hours at study visits V2 and V3. For the study visit 3, subjects who first received&#xD;
           0.9% saline in the previous visit, will receive intravenously Intralipid 20% and vice&#xD;
           versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Screening Day (Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Volunteers will receive overall information about the study and sign in the written&#xD;
           informed consent. Every subject will receive an assignment number according to the&#xD;
           inclusion sequence. Physical examination and blood withdrawal shall be performed and&#xD;
           data will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demographic data, medical history and concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body weight and height, Body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference and&#xD;
                waist-to-hip ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood blood count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, free fatty acids,&#xD;
                cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, potassium, calcium&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Study day (Visit 2 and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
           During each study visit subjects shall arrive at 7:00 AM at ZMF (Center of Medical&#xD;
           Research, Medical University Graz) after an overnight fasting period of 12 hours. A&#xD;
           pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential will be performed in the&#xD;
           morning of each study day. Two short polyethylene catheters will be inserted in&#xD;
           antecubital veins of both arms. A first venous cannula will be exclusively used for&#xD;
           blood sampling and the arm will be placed in a thermo regulated box (Hot-Box) to be&#xD;
           maintained warmed at a temperature of 50°C over the whole study period. The second&#xD;
           venous cannula will be used for infusion of saline or lipid-heparin solution and inulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At 8:00 AM, the infusion of saline or Intralipid solution will be started. At the same&#xD;
           time point a continuous infusion of inulin via syringe infusion pump will be started&#xD;
           with a 50mg/Kg bolus and maintained at a continuous rate of 0.250 x Creatinin Clearance&#xD;
           mg/min, until the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At 11:00 AM, OFM catheters will be inserted in the periumbilical area of each subject.&#xD;
           To prevent important delays in sampling from subcutaneous tissue, the afferent loop for&#xD;
           the catheter will be previously filled with the perfusate solution. Eight milliliters of&#xD;
           a sterile isotonic solution (ELO MEL isoton, Fresenius Kabi, Austria) commonly used as&#xD;
           intravenous infusion added with 2.0ml autologous serum previously withdrawn from each&#xD;
           volunteer and prepared under straight sterile conditions will be used as the perfusate&#xD;
           solution for the OFM catheters. Peristaltic pumps will start to run at 12:00 AM to&#xD;
           infuse the perfusate solutions at a perfusion rate (push-pull mode) of 1µl/min until&#xD;
           12:00 AM in the following day. Effluent samples from subcutaneous tissue will be&#xD;
           collected at regular time-intervals and venous blood sampling will be performed in&#xD;
           parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects will be maintained under fasting conditions during the whole study period.&#xD;
           They shall stay in the research center facilities for a four-hours observation period&#xD;
           after the study procedures have finished. At this time they will receive a complete meal&#xD;
           and additional blood samples will be withdrawn to access blood glucose and aPTT&#xD;
           (activated partial tromboplastin time). Normal values have to be ensured before the&#xD;
           volunteers are allowed to leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine concentrations will be measured in effluent and serum samples using a multiplexed&#xD;
      flow cytometric bead-based ELISA assay (LUMINEX®100s System, Luminex Corporation, Texas,&#xD;
      USA). The following substrates will be accessed by this method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin 6 (IL-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin 10 (IL-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CCL2/MCP-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serpin E1/PAI-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-alpha)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adiponectin&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin concentrations in effluent and plasma samples will be measured by Joanneum Research&#xD;
      Laboratory using solid-phase two-site ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Inulin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inulin will be measured by Joanneum Research Laboratory, using a fully enzymatic method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4. Glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose concentration in arterialized blood samples will be measured in duplicate using two&#xD;
      Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2 (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEFA concentrations will be measured in plasma using a colorimetric and enzymatic method.&#xD;
