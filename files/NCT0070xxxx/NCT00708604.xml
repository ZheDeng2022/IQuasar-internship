  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of islet transplantation in patients&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes who have had a successful kidney transplant and have been maintained for&#xD;
      at least three months on anti-rejection medications consisting of any combination of&#xD;
      sirolimus, tacrolimus, MMF or prednisone (5 mg/day or less). Another purpose is to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of an islet transplant in inducing insulin independence and whether or not&#xD;
      an islet transplant improves quality of life for kidney transplants patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use sugar and keeps blood sugar levels normal.&#xD;
      Special cells in the human body, called beta cells, make insulin. Beta cells are found inside&#xD;
      small groups of cells called &quot;islets.&quot; Islets are found scattered in the pancreas gland. Type&#xD;
      1 diabetes is caused by damage to these insulin-making cells. Type 1 diabetic patients need&#xD;
      insulin shots because their body does not make enough insulin. Even with insulin shots, many&#xD;
      diabetic patients develop damage to the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys.&#xD;
      Research studies suggest that these problems are caused by blood sugar levels being too high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another way to treat diabetes is by giving the patient a pancreas transplant. The pancreas&#xD;
      transplant gives the patient new insulin-making cells. If the pancreas transplant works, the&#xD;
      patient does not need insulin shots. Pancreas transplantation is considered major surgery,&#xD;
      and things can go wrong after surgery. Transplantation of just the islets, and not the rest&#xD;
      of the pancreas, can be done without a major surgery. Research doctors have been studying&#xD;
      islet transplantation to determine whether subjects who undergo the procedure can get off&#xD;
      insulin shots, without the dangers of a major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2000, a group of research doctors in Edmonton, Canada reported that 3 out of 4 research&#xD;
      subjects given islet transplants from brain-dead donors did not need insulin shots for&#xD;
      approximately 2 years after transplantation. The research doctors from Edmonton have also&#xD;
      reported that most islet transplant recipients in their study start to need insulin shots&#xD;
      again with longer follow-up. So far, only about 1 out of 10 of the research subjects in the&#xD;
      original Edmonton trial remain off of insulin 5 years after their transplant. The reasons&#xD;
      that islet transplants stop working well enough and the recipients need to start insulin&#xD;
      again are not known at this time. As with any type of transplant, all of the research&#xD;
      subjects receiving islets from donors needed medicine to stop their bodies from rejecting the&#xD;
      transplants. This study uses a few additional medications/vitamins that were not included in&#xD;
      the Edmonton study that may improve the long-term outcome of islet transplantation. Some&#xD;
      research studies suggest that for subjects with type 1 diabetes, an islet transplant may also&#xD;
      help the kidney transplant work better and last longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being performed to confirm that islet after kidney transplantation (IAK) is a&#xD;
      safe and effective procedure for kidney transplant patients with type 1 diabetes who are on&#xD;
      any combination of sirolimus, tacrolimus, MMF or prednisone (5 mg per day or less)&#xD;
      anti-rejection medications for the care of their kidney transplant. Subjects will be followed&#xD;
      closely for two years after islet transplant to monitor blood sugar control, the health of&#xD;
      the kidney transplant, and changes in quality of life.&#xD;
