  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a cancer that starts at the back of the nose. Without distant&#xD;
      spread, NPC is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however, if NPC relapses or&#xD;
      spreads to other organs, treatment options are limited. This grant proposes to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of a novel treatment for patients with NPC that has either relapsed&#xD;
      or spread to distant organs. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known to play a role in the&#xD;
      development of NPC, and studies have shown that NPC tumor cells express proteins that are&#xD;
      related to EBV. Some of these proteins can trigger a response from the immune system,&#xD;
      specifically the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of immune cell that&#xD;
      might exert anti-tumor effects. In this project, we will take blood from NPC patients,&#xD;
      generate CTLs targeted against EBV, and re-infuse these back into patients in an attempt to&#xD;
      achieve anti-tumor activity. Patients will also receive an antibody called CD45 Mab prior to&#xD;
      CTL infusion in order to allow for better expansion of the infused CTLs in the patients.&#xD;

      Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a cancer that starts at the back of the nose. Without distant&#xD;
      spread, NPC is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the treatment of this&#xD;
      cancer can lead to later complications, including other cancers, and if NPC relapses or&#xD;
      spreads to other organs, the treatment options are limited. This grant proposes to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of a novel treatment for patients with NPC that has either&#xD;
      relapsed or spread to distant organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is known to play a role in the development of NPC in individuals,&#xD;
      especially those with a compromised immune system. Studies have shown that NPC tumor cells&#xD;
      express proteins that are related to EBV. Some of these proteins can trigger a response from&#xD;
      the immune system, specifically the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), a type of&#xD;
      immune cell that might exert anti-tumor effects. In this project, we will take blood from NPC&#xD;
      patients, generate CTLs targeted against EBV, and re-infuse these back into patients in an&#xD;
      attempt to achieve anti-tumor activity. Patients will also receive an antibody called CD45&#xD;

    <description>A dose escalation schema will be employed. Three to six patients will be treated at each of the following dose levels with EBV-Specific CTLs and CD45 Mab: Dose Level I: 2 x 10^7 cells/m2. Dose Level II: 5 x 10^7 cells/m2. Dose Level III: 1 x 10^8 cells/m2. Dose escalation decisions will be made after review of the data from the current dose level. There will be no intra-patient escalation. An additional 6-10 patients with measurable disease will be treated at the recommended phase II dose to expand the experience at this dose level.</description>
