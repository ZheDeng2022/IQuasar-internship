      The purpose of this study is to look at the safety and immunogenicity of a combination&#xD;
      vaccine that includes tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis&#xD;
      (Tdap). The study will be conducted in 48 pregnant women and 32 non-pregnant women. Safety of&#xD;
      the newborn infant and the effect of the mother's vaccination on the infants' immune&#xD;
      responses prior to vaccinating infants with another combination vaccine to protect against&#xD;
      diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis will be evaluated. Participants will be 18-45 years old.&#xD;
      Pregnant volunteers will be 30-32 weeks pregnant and at a low risk for pregnancy&#xD;
      complications. Pregnant volunteers will receive 2 injections (1 vaccine and 1 placebo,&#xD;
      inactive substance); non-pregnant volunteers will receive 1 injection of vaccine. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected from the mother and infant, along with the baby's growth&#xD;
      measurements. Participation for mother infant pairs is about 15 months and about 7 months for&#xD;
      non-pregnant women.&#xD;

      Pertussis, &quot;whooping cough&quot;, caused by the gram negative pleomorphic bacillus, Bordetella&#xD;
      pertussis, is a highly contagious, potentially life-threatening respiratory illness that has&#xD;
      re-emerged in the United States (US) as a cause of morbidity and mortality in infants less&#xD;
      than 6 months of age as well as morbidity in adolescents and adults. Tetanus toxoid, reduced&#xD;
      diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed (Tdap) immunization of women in&#xD;
      the third trimester of pregnancy represents an opportunity to protect the vulnerable very&#xD;
      young infants through passively acquired maternal pertussis specific antibodies. Tdap vaccine&#xD;
      is being evaluated for this purpose since there is no monovalent acellular pertussis (aP)&#xD;
      vaccine available in the U.S. This is a multi-site, randomized, double masked, cross-over&#xD;
      study in 48 healthy pregnant women, 18-45 years of age who will be randomized (2:1) into two&#xD;
      groups. One group will receive a single dose of Tdap vaccine at 30-32 weeks of gestation and&#xD;
      a postpartum dose of saline. The other group will receive saline at 30-32 weeks of gestation&#xD;
      and a postpartum dose of Tdap vaccine. On May 30, 2008 the Advisory Committee on Immunization&#xD;
      Practices (ACIP) issued a recommendation for use of Tdap in pregnant and postpartum women:&#xD;
      &quot;Pregnant women (including women who are breastfeeding) who have not received a dose of Tdap&#xD;
      previously should receive Tdap after delivery and before discharge from the hospital or&#xD;
      birthing center if 2 years or more have elapsed since the most recent administration of Td.&quot;&#xD;
      This study design provides a control for the evaluation of the safety of Tdap vaccine&#xD;
      administered during pregnancy and provides compliance with the ACIP recommendation. Immune&#xD;
      responses to Tdap vaccine measured in antepartum and postpartum women enrolled in this&#xD;
      clinical trial will be compared. Also, immune responses of the 32 pregnant women antenatally&#xD;
      immunized with Tdap will be compared to those in approximately 32 healthy non-pregnant women&#xD;
      contemporaneously enrolled into 2 age groups (18-39 years and 40-45 years) that are equal to&#xD;
      the pregnant women. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Tdap vaccine in&#xD;
      pregnant women and their neonates and the effect of maternal immunization on the infant&#xD;
      immune response to DTaP vaccinations. The safety of and immune response to Tdap vaccine in&#xD;
      the 32 pregnant women immunized antenatally will be compared to that in approximately 32&#xD;
      non-pregnant women enrolled contemporaneously. The primary objectives of this phase I study&#xD;
      are: to evaluate the safety of a single 0.5 mL intramuscular injection of Tdap vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy pregnant women vaccinated at 30-32 weeks of gestation compared to women immunized&#xD;
      postpartum and a non-pregnant control group; and to evaluate the safety of maternal Tdap&#xD;
      immunization in neonates. Secondary objectives are: to assess the immunogenicity of Tdap&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy pregnant women compared to women immunized postpartum and a non-pregnant&#xD;
      control group; to determine the efficiency of placental transport of maternal pertussis&#xD;
      specific antibodies to the neonate; to assess the persistence of the maternal pertussis&#xD;
      specific antibodies in infants just prior to receiving the first dose of DTaP [Diphtheria and&#xD;
      Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed, Inactivated Poliovirus and Haemophilus b&#xD;
      Conjugate (Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate] vaccine for infants); and to assess the effects of&#xD;
      maternal immunization with Tdap vaccine on infant immune responses to DTaP vaccinations.&#xD;
      Study duration will be approximately 3 years. Subject participation will be approximately 15&#xD;
      months (for each mother-infant pair) and 7 months for non-pregnan&#xD;
