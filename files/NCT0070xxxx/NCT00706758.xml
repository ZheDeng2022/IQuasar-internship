      In this randomized controlled study in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) we plan&#xD;
      to compare the effects of a structured patient group education (IBS school) with receiving&#xD;
      only written information in the form of a IBS-guidebook. The effects of the interventions on&#xD;
      GI and psychological symptom severity, knowledge and quality of life will be assessed with&#xD;
      validated questionnaires at baseline and 3 and 6 months after the intervention.&#xD;

      In this randomized controlled study in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) we plan&#xD;
      to compare the effects of a structured patient group education (IBS school) with receiving&#xD;
      only written information in the form of a IBS-guidebook. We plan to include men and women 18&#xD;
      to 70 years old, with IBS according to the Rome II criteria, who are referred from physicians&#xD;
      in primary care and secondary/tertiary care to participate in the study. The education will&#xD;
      be held at the GI out patient clinic at Sahlgrenska University hospital in Gothenburg. A&#xD;
      nurse, specialized in GI functional disorders will conduct an interview with each patient for&#xD;
      about 30 minutes to collect additional information from the patients before inclusion. The&#xD;
      patients will be informed about the positive results obtained in previous studies with both&#xD;
      interventions, i.e. a structured patient education (IBS school) and a self-help guidebook.&#xD;
      Patients with an organic GI disease and/or with another disease potentially affecting the GI&#xD;
      symptoms were excluded. Likewise, patients with a severe psychiatric disease were excluded&#xD;
      due to potential problems to participate in a group intervention. In order to allocate an&#xD;
      equal number of patients to both of the interventions during the study, a number of up to 20&#xD;
      patients will be interviewed in a block during one week. After all these interviews the&#xD;
      patients will be randomly divided into two groups with an equal number of patients in each&#xD;
      group. The groups will then be randomized 1:1 to either start the IBS school within two to&#xD;
      three weeks, or to receive the IBS Guidebook. The patients in the guidebook group will be&#xD;
      offered to participate in the IBS school six months later, as part of the clinical routine at&#xD;
      our unit (as requested by the ethics committee). The effects of the interventions on GI and&#xD;
      psychological symptom severity, knowledge and quality of life will be assessed with validated&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and 3 and 6 months after the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perceived knowledge about IBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IBS Quality of Life (IBSQOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS school The IBS school is designed based on the self-efficacy theory , and the general&#xD;
      theory of nursing. Moreover, the education is performed based on a biopsychosocial model&#xD;
      considered to be important in functional GI disorders. The IBS-school consists of six&#xD;
      sessions held once per week in a group setting with eight to ten patients in each group. Five&#xD;
      different health care professionals (nurse, gastroenterologist, dietician, physiotherapist&#xD;
      and psychologist) are involved in the education, in order to cover a wide spectra of issues&#xD;
      related to IBS. Each of the professionals will hold one session for two hours where a lot of&#xD;
      space is given for discussion in the group. This intervention has been described in detail&#xD;
      previously (Ringström et. al. Submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS Guidebook The IBS Guidebook consists of two booklets, written for IBS patients by one of&#xD;
      the gastroenterologists in this study (MS). The booklets are detailed and cover the same&#xD;
      areas of issues related to IBS as are covered in the structured education, namely&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms, GI and extra intestinal symptoms, the diagnostic workup,&#xD;
      treatment options, food related issues, psychological and lifestyle factors.&#xD;
