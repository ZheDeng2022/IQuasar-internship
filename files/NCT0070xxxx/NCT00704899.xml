      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the use of physiotherapy or pharmacotherapy help in improving quality of life in&#xD;
      patients of fibromyalgia as judged by fibromyalgia impact questionnaire at a 6 month follow&#xD;
      up period?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy is no better than pharmacotherapy in improving the quality of life in patients&#xD;
      of fibromyalgia as judged by fibromyalgia impact questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type- Interventional STUDY DESIGN: open label alternate patient treatment allocation&#xD;
      Ethical approval for the trial protocol has been obtained from the institute's ethics&#xD;
      committee of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Methods The study will be conducted in Kasturba Hospital and Mahatma Gandhi&#xD;
      Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram, from 1 march 2006 - 1 dec 2007. Patients will be&#xD;
      selected to enter the study, in such a way that every patient presenting with chronic&#xD;
      muscular pain will be screened in the study and patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be recruited in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 175 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will screen all patients who are referred to them for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The patients included&#xD;
      in the study will be administered a standardized questionnaire to record socio-demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, symptom characteristics and history of previous visits to a health care&#xD;
      provider. The socio-economic score (SES) will be determined using a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire.[6] Briefly, the questionnaire consists of following: (1) household profile,&#xD;
      (2) material possession profile, (3) educational profile, (4) occupational profile, (5)&#xD;
      economic profile (6) possessed land or house cost profile and (7) social profile.&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) will be used to determine a baseline score. [7] For&#xD;
      the purpose of the study this questionnaire is translated to local language (Marathi), and&#xD;
      back-translated to English to ensure its accuracy. Minor modifications have been done in the&#xD;
      questionnaire to make it suitable for our setting (for example: the use of washer or dryer&#xD;
      for laundry was modified to washing the laundry by themselves). Assessment of psychiatric co&#xD;
      morbidity will be done using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), which is an 18 item&#xD;
      instrument, each item has a seven severity grades.[8] A score of 32 or more indicates&#xD;
      presence of psychopathology.[9]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained Physiotherapist will conduct a uniform structured physical training and aerobic&#xD;
      session for one group of patients. The patients will be advised to perform the exercises&#xD;
      daily twice for at least 10 minutes. There will be a step up pattern of exercise regimen&#xD;
      followed with relaxation, stretching and strengthening techniques. The methodology is&#xD;
      described in box 1. The second group of patients will receive antidepressant in the form open&#xD;
      label amitriptyline 25 mg once daily at bedtime. The dose of the drug may be increased if&#xD;
      required. All patients will be also offered pharmacologic treatment with 50 mg tramadol in&#xD;
      thrice daily doses and as required. The treatment recommendations are based on standard&#xD;
      recommendations on the management of fibromyalgia.[5]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment All patients will be followed up for six months at monthly intervals. At&#xD;
      each visit the study investigators will determine the course of the disease and compliance&#xD;
      with therapy. The FIQ score will be assessed at the end of 6 monthly visits. Reduction in FIQ&#xD;
      score from the baseline will be used as the principle outcome measure.&#xD;
