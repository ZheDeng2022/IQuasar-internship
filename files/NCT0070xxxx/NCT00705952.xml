      The purpose of the study is to assess whether weight loss achieved through a programme of&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle management can result in enhanced production of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1&#xD;
      (GLP-1) together with improvements in the release of insulin and glucagon and thus&#xD;
      improvements in glycaemic control (HbA1c), in patients with new onset type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cohort study with comparisons made between assessments at baseline, after an&#xD;
      initial four months of intensive intervention and after a further four months follow up&#xD;
      (maintenance period). Each patient will participate in the study for 8 month. The entire&#xD;
      study period will be 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with new onset type 2 diabetes (within 2 weeks of diagnosis) will be recruited&#xD;
      from those referred to the Type 2 Diabetes Education Programme in the community (&quot;FOCUS&quot;), as&#xD;
      per standard practice. The investigators will also hope to recruit direct from local GP&#xD;
      surgeries who will be advised of the study. At this point, patients will be given a study&#xD;
      information sheet with a contact number if they wish to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who are unable to give consent, who would be unable to attend all the programme&#xD;
      sessions for medical or other reasons, who are prescribed oral hypoglycaemic, antiobesity or&#xD;
      any other prescription medications that may interfere with the study results or whose BMI is&#xD;
      &lt; 25, will be excluded. The investigators will also exclude those who cannot converse&#xD;
      competently in English as special arrangements would need to be made for such people&#xD;
      attending the programme and this would be impractical in a group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those willing to participate will be invited for an individual appointment with the&#xD;
      dietitian, during which the study structure, aims and procedures will be explained and&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study will be obtained. For the first session of the programme,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to attend following an overnight fast. Blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      for basal measurement of glucose, HbA1c, lipids, insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, leptin, ghrelin&#xD;
      and adiponectin. They will then be given a standard 75 g glucose load and sampling repeated&#xD;
      at 30 mins (for peak GLP-1 levels). Baseline measurements of weight, height, percent body&#xD;
      fat, waistline circumference and blood pressure will also be taken during this session.&#xD;
      Following the assessment, patients will participate in the first session of the education&#xD;
      programme. The full assessment will be repeated at 4 and 8 months intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight management programme will be run by the Specialist Dietitian. It will consist of 2&#xD;
      phases: an initial 4 month intensive weight loss phase, followed by a 4 month weight loss /&#xD;
      maintenance phase. The initial four month programme will consist of 8 group education&#xD;
      sessions and at least 3 phone calls. The following 4 month programme will consist of 5 group&#xD;
      sessions, at least 3 phone calls and 1 individual appointment. Each education session will&#xD;
      last 60min. Before the 1st session and, at 4 month and 8 month sessions, bloods will be&#xD;
      taken, as above. Before the rest of the sessions, there will be 15 minutes devoted to weight&#xD;
      assessment. The programme will be based on portion control and healthy eating and will be&#xD;
      supported by behavioural and cognitive change interventions. Such interventions will include&#xD;
      self monitoring, stimulus control, goal setting, problem solving and relapse prevention. The&#xD;
      specialists from &quot;Bournemouth HealthLink&quot; (a partnership backed by the local NHS, Council and&#xD;
      University) will take part in helping participants to increase their activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to achieve weight loss of 5% over the first 4 months with, as a minimum, weight&#xD;
      maintenance or possible further reduction over the subsequent four months.&#xD;

      The early management of type 2 diabetes usually consists of education related to lifestyle&#xD;
      changes especially as 80 to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are obese. Obesity worsens the&#xD;
      metabolic and physiological abnormalities associated with diabetes particularly&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia (raised blood sugar), hyperlipidaemia (raised fats in the blood), and&#xD;
      hypertension which are prerequisites for macrovascular complications. On the other hand,&#xD;
      weight loss is one of the cornerstones of diabetes management as it improves glycaemic (blood&#xD;
      glucose) control, lowers triglycerides (a fat in the blood) and low-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      cholesterol (the &quot;bad&quot; form of cholesterol) levels and improves blood pressure, mental health&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1993 the investigators established a structured education programme for patients with new&#xD;
      onset type 2 diabetes; following the diagnosis being made in primary care individuals are&#xD;
      seen within one week at a nurse led, open-access programme. Since 1994, there has been a 2.5&#xD;
      fold increase in the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in our area. At&#xD;
      diagnosis, Body Mass Index (BMI) has risen from 28.5 to 31.1kg/m2 associated with a fall in&#xD;
      HbA1c (a blood test which gives a measure of long term control of diabetes) levels from 10.3%&#xD;
      to 8.1% at presentation. The lower HbA1c at diagnosis probably reflects earlier detection and&#xD;
      awareness of the condition. Since 2006, responsibility for providing the education has been&#xD;
      transferred to primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, a secondary care based dietitian led group weight management programme&#xD;
      comprising more intensive education sessions and regular phone contact was piloted in this&#xD;
      unit. A recent evaluation of this service of fifty one overweight and obese individuals who&#xD;
      completed the 3-month programme. Average weight loss at 3 months was 4.8 kg equivalent to 4.5&#xD;
      % baseline body weight. Follow up at six months, without further intervention, showed that&#xD;
      this was maintained (weight loss 5.8 kg, equivalent to 5.3 %, ns compared to 3/12). 43% of&#xD;
      participants achieved &gt;5% weight reduction with 6% achieving &gt;10%. The intervention resulted&#xD;
      in significant reduction in waistline circumferences, body fat mass, total cholesterol,&#xD;
      HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of neuro-endocrine factors (hormones that influences the activity of the brain or&#xD;
      nervous system) have a role in the control of insulin secretion and in the regulation of food&#xD;
      intake. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone, the name based on the&#xD;
      observation that the insulin response to an oral glucose load was greater than that following&#xD;
      the intravenous administration of an equivalent amount of glucose. Incretin hormones are&#xD;
      secreted from the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients in the intestinal&#xD;
      lumen. Physiologically, GLP-1 enhances glucose-mediated insulin secretion and suppresses&#xD;
      glucagon (a hormone that opposes the action of insulin) secretion. GLP-1 also induces satiety&#xD;
      and improves gastric emptying. In studies of patients with established diabetes, GLP-1 levels&#xD;
      and the response to oral glucose have been shown to be attenuated and administration of GLP-1&#xD;
      has normalized both fasting and post-prandial glucose levels. It remains uncertain whether&#xD;
      lower GLP-1 levels in established diabetes contribute to the pathogenesis of the condition or&#xD;
      are a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, though the observation that GLP-1 levels are&#xD;
      lower in obese subjects suggests the possibility that the former may be the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators measured GLP-1 levels in patients with newly diagnosed type 2&#xD;
      diabetes to assess the effect of an initial period of lifestyle and dietary adjustment. In&#xD;
      this pilot project 9 newly diagnosed patients (time from diagnosis 25 + 5 days, 4 female with&#xD;
      mean BMI 27.6 kg/m2 were compared with 9 age, gender and body weight matched controls. All&#xD;
      participants had a 75g oral glucose tolerance test with measurements of glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      GLP-1 and glucagon with the diabetic patients having a repeat OGTT after 3 months. Compared&#xD;
      with controls, diabetic patients had higher glucagon levels, lower active GLP-1 at baseline&#xD;
      before the glucose load although AUC levels were not significantly different. After 3 months&#xD;
      lifestyle adjustment, 5 patients had achieved weight loss (0.2 to 5 kg) but 4 had gained&#xD;
      weight (2.7 to 6.5 kg), giving an average weight change for the group of 0.8 Kg. A small&#xD;
      change in HbA1c was observed (7.31% vs 6.96%, p=0.25). The levels of active GLP-1 were&#xD;
      augmented in the diabetic group accompanied by an increase in the insulin response at 30&#xD;
      mins. though glucagon levels were unaltered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear whether more intensive lifestyle changes would result in greater improvements&#xD;
      in GLP-1 production and thus greater improvements in diabetic control. If GLP-1 production&#xD;
      can be enhanced early following diagnosis of diabetes, this may have favorable consequences&#xD;
      for the patient, as GLP-1 has been shown in animal studies and in vitro, to have a role in&#xD;
      the regulation of beta glucose sensing and proliferation of beta-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of other neuroendocrine peptides have regulatory roles in energy homeostasis and may&#xD;
      influence insulin secretion and glycaemic control. Leptin is a protein hormone produced by&#xD;
      adipose (fat) tissue which has a key role in regulating energy intake and expenditure, a&#xD;
      suppressive effect on appetite and an increase in metabolism. Circulating leptin levels&#xD;
      reflect body fat mass. Leptin can enter the the Central Nervous System (CNS) at and interact&#xD;
      with centres in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. Despite these suppressive effects,&#xD;
      elevated levels have often been noted in obesity, possibly suggesting resistance to the&#xD;
      hormone, though may be a result of stimulation by increased insulin levels, which would be&#xD;
      expected in obesity. Leptin in turn can inhibit insulin release so a fall in leptin resulting&#xD;
      from weight loss may enhance insulin production and may therefore be beneficial in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike leptin, ghrelin is an orixigenic (stimulates appetite) hormone which acts via the&#xD;
      Growth Hormone secretagogue receptor. It is the only hormone known to stimulate increased&#xD;
      feeding and weight gain. Basal plasma levels are increased in malnutrition and decreased in&#xD;
      obesity. In some, but not all studies, insulin has been shown to be an inhibitor of ghrelin&#xD;
      release. An anticipated rise in ghrelin with weight reduction might offset the effects of&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention through stimulation of appetite and increased intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adiponectin is an adipocyte (fat cell) hormone that modulates a number of metabolic&#xD;
      processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid catabolism, and may have a role in the&#xD;
      metabolic derangements of type 2 diabetes. Though produced in adipose (fat) tissue, plasma&#xD;
      adiponectin levels are decreased in obesity as a consequence of down regulation. Adiponectin&#xD;
      has insulin sensitizing effects and has central effects on energy homeostasis, promoting&#xD;
      weight reduction. Levels of adiponectin have been found to be reduced in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      compared with non-diabetic controls. Weight reduction can increase circulating levels. Again&#xD;
      little is known about the effect of changes in adiponectin in the early stages of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
