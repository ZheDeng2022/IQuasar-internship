      The purpose of this study is to determine whether macrolide treatment of patients with severe&#xD;
      sepsis has an advantageous immunomodulatory and clinical effect compared to severe septic&#xD;
      patients without macrolide therapy. Our main hypothesis is macrolide use in addition to&#xD;
      standard therapy in severe septic patients has an advantageous immunomodulatory and clinical&#xD;
      effect compared to patients with severe sepsis not treated with a macrolide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent studies, the significant effects of macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin) on immune&#xD;
      response, unrelated to their anti-microbial properties, have been appreciated. Clinical&#xD;
      trials of macrolides added to -lactams in bacteremic Streptococcus pneumoniae&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) have consistently demonstrated an absolute risk reduction&#xD;
      in mortality of 15% in most populations. Several cytokines including tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF) interleukin (IL) -1 and IL-8 which are generally proinflammatory and IL-6 and IL-10,&#xD;
      which tend to be anti-inflammatory have been associated with sepsis. TNF is a cytokine that&#xD;
      for a number of reasons is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock. TNF concentrations are increased during clinical and experimental sepsis and&#xD;
      increasing concentrations and especially persistence of high concentrations of TNF during&#xD;
      sepsis are associated with decreased survival. Therefore, our primary aim is to determine&#xD;
      whether macrolide treatment of patients with severe sepsis has an advantageous&#xD;
      immunomodulatory and clinical effect compared to severe septic patients without macrolide&#xD;
      therapy. Our main hypothesis is macrolide use in addition to standard therapy in severe&#xD;
      septic patients has an advantageous immunomodulatory and clinical effect compared to patients&#xD;
      with severe sepsis not treated with a macrolide.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject, or legal representative, has given written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. SIRS is defined as two or more of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Temperature &gt; 38o C or &lt; 36oC&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Heart rate &gt; 90 beats/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min or PaCO2&lt; 32mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cell count &gt; 12.000/mm3; &lt; 4000/mm3; or &gt; 10% immature (band) forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of a suspected or proven infection. Patients with suspected infection must&#xD;
             have evidence of an infection, such as white blood cells in a normally sterile body&#xD;
             fluid, perforated viscus, chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia and associated with&#xD;
             purulent sputum production, or a clinical syndrome associated with a high probability&#xD;
             of infection (for example, purpura fulminans or ascending cholangitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of one or more sepsis-associated organ failure. The onset of the first&#xD;
             sepsis-associated organ failure must occur within the 48-hour period immediately&#xD;
             preceding initiation of study drug infusion. A patient must have an organ failure&#xD;
             attributable to the sepsis episode. The organ failure must be newly developed and not&#xD;
             explained by underlying disease processes or by effects of concomitant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiovascular: An arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or a mean&#xD;
                  arterial pressure (MAP) 70 mm Hg for at least 1 hour despite adequate fluid&#xD;
                  resuscitation, adequate intravascular volume status, or the need for vasopressors&#xD;
                  to maintain SBP 90 mm Hg or MAP 70 mm Hg.&#xD;

                  resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Respiratory: Evidence of acute pulmonary dysfunction PaO2/FiO2 300 and, clinical&#xD;
                  exam or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure not suggestive of volume overload. If&#xD;
                  pneumonia is the suspected site of infection, the patient must have a PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
                  200.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hematology: Platelet count &lt;80,000/mm3 or a 50% decrease in platelet count from&#xD;
                  the highest value recorded over the last 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unexplained metabolic acidosis: Defined by (1) pH 7.30 or base deficit 5.0 mEq/L&#xD;
                  or (2) plasma lactate level &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate fluid resuscitation or adequate intravascular volume is defined as either&#xD;
        pulmonary arterial wedge pressure 12 mm Hg or central venous pressure 8 mm Hg. Vasopressors&#xD;
        is defined as dopamine 5 g/kg/min or any dose of norepinephrine, epinephrine, or&#xD;
        phenylephrine. Dobutamine is not considered a vasopressor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Macrolide therapy indicated for clinical condition. If after randomization, the&#xD;
             treating physician determines that a macrolide is indicated and no other alternative&#xD;
             antibiotic is appropriate, the patient will be excluded from the trial. However, if&#xD;
             only one dose of azithromycin had been given and the treating physician decided to&#xD;
             stop it, azithromycin might be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known allergy to macrolides.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prolonged QT syndrome or on medications with increased risk of QT prolongation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
