      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Acid-related gastrointestinal disorders are numerous and may require chronic treatment and&#xD;
      maintenance, but they are often difficult to diagnose and treat. Gastric analysis is a&#xD;
      critical tool for diagnosing and treating acid-related disorders; however, at present it&#xD;
      requires a technically difficult procedure, using a nasogastric tube, that is costly,&#xD;
      invasive, and uncomfortable. Recently a new tool, the SmartPill, has been developed that can&#xD;
      measure acid levels, temperature, and pressure throughout the stomach, small intestine, and&#xD;
      colon by swallowing a small capsule. Researchers are interested in comparing current methods&#xD;
      of measuring stomach acid with the SmartPill by studying both healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      individuals with acid-related gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of the SmartPill for gastric analysis, compared&#xD;
      with current procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1A/1B: Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
           Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome or acid hypersecretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with refractory&#xD;
           gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, or idiopathic gastric&#xD;
           hypersecretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves a screening visit, a 3-day inpatient study visit, and possible&#xD;
           additional outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well&#xD;
           as blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1A/1B: Participants will have a 3-day inpatient study visit with the following&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging study of the stomach (simultaneous gastric emptying scintigraphy), followed by a&#xD;
           special diet for the next day s test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric analysis using a nasogastric tube to collect stomach acid secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SmartPill study, in which participants will ingest a SmartPill and wear a monitor for 24&#xD;
           to 48 hours to collect readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in Phase 1A will have a second outpatient SmartPill study 7 days after the&#xD;
           first SmartPill study. Participants in Phase 1B will not have the second SmartPill&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 and Phase 3: Participants will have a 3-day inpatient study visit with the&#xD;
           following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging study of the stomach (simultaneous gastric emptying scintigraphy), followed by a&#xD;
           special diet for the next day s test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastric analysis using a nasogastric tube to collect stomach acid secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SmartPill study, in which participants will ingest a SmartPill and wear a monitor for 24&#xD;
           to 48 hours to collect readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 and 3 participants will have outpatient study visits only if directed by the&#xD;
           study researchers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acid related disorders are numerous and often require chronic treatment and maintenance. Many&#xD;
      of these diseases are without symptoms and therefore difficult to diagnose and treat. Gastric&#xD;
      analysis is the quantitative measurement of gastric acid output and is a critical tool for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of acid related disorders and the ongoing assessment of therapy response. At&#xD;
      present gastric analysis requires a technically difficult procedure, using gastric aspiration&#xD;
      through a nasogastric tube, that is costly, invasive, and uncomfortable for patients.&#xD;
      Recently there is introduction of the SmartPill, which is a disposable pill that measures pH,&#xD;
      temperature, and pressure throughout the GI tract. We propose a pilot study to validate a new&#xD;
      method of gastric analysis with the ingestion of the SmartPill with a meal of a known&#xD;
      buffering capacity to measure both the acidity and quantity of acid output in the stomach. We&#xD;
      will validate this method by comparing it to the accepted gastric aspiration method under&#xD;
      maximally stimulated conditions. We will study healthy volunteers for the validation phase&#xD;
      and then study patients with known acid related disorders to assess its usefulness in&#xD;
      patients. Interested subjects will report to the NIH outpatient gastrointestinal clinic for&#xD;
      evaluation to be followed by a 3 day in-patient admission and 2 subsequent clinic visits.&#xD;
      Subjects will have gastric analysis of basal, meal stimulated, and pharmacologically&#xD;
      stimulated rates with both the conventional and study methods. Outcomes will include a&#xD;
      quantitative measurement of gastric acid output in unit time, normal meal stimulated acid&#xD;
      output values in healthy volunteers and patients with acid related disorders, and the&#xD;
      assessment of acid suppression in patients treated with a variety of anti-secretory&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
