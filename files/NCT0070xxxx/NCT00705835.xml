  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to help us study a vaccine treatment for patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer. A vaccine is a medicine that teaches the body to destroy harmful infections&#xD;
      and other diseases, such as cancer. Your immune system is made up of many different types of&#xD;
      cells which fight infection and disease in your body. A vaccine may stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system to destroy the cancer cells. It may also help to slow the growth of the cancer. The&#xD;
      vaccine is a solution given as an injection into or under the skin. It is made up of several&#xD;
      parts. The first part is PSMA, a protein present in many cancers, especially prostate cancer.&#xD;
      It is referred to as rsPSMA when made in a laboratory for this study and is mixed with a&#xD;
      material called Alhydrogel® (aluminum hydroxide suspension) which helps the immune system to&#xD;
      make more cancer-fighting cells.&#xD;

    <description>The assigned dose of rsPSMA protein plus Alhydrogel® vaccine will be administered subcutaneously to random sites on the upper arm and upper leg at weekly intervals for 3 weeks. This will be followed by a 4-week break and then a fourth vaccination during week 7. The vaccination site will rotate to a different quadrant with each administration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-castrate metastatic patients must have biochemically progressive disease as&#xD;
             defined by serial changes in PSA (with a serum testosterone &gt; or = to 180&#xD;
             ng/mL)following definitive primary therapy such as prostatectomy or radiation.&#xD;
             Castrate metastatic patients must have biochemically progressive disease in the&#xD;
             absence of radiographic evidence of disease progression with rising PSA values despite&#xD;
             castrate (&lt;50 ng/mL) levels of testosterone following an adequate course of hormonal&#xD;
             therapy. An adequate course of hormonal therapy is treatment with an LH-RH analog&#xD;
             (with or without an anti-androgen) or orchiectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prostate cancer must be histologically confirmed by the Department of Pathology at&#xD;
             MSKCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
