  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnancy is a major public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past&#xD;
      decades, P. falciparum has shown increasing resistance to chloroquine and&#xD;
      Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine, which has prompted a change in treatment approach; artemisinin&#xD;
      containing combination therapies (ACTs) are now the standard treatment of P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria in areas with established resistance to traditional therapies. However, a standard&#xD;
      approach for using ACT in pregnancy does not exist in Africa, where some countries keep on&#xD;
      using quinine, while others allow the use of ACTs. Thus, there is need of establishing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of ACTs in malaria-infected pregnant women. Since the pharmacokinetic of&#xD;
      antimalarials may be altered during pregnancy and since available pharmacokinetic data are&#xD;
      still somewhat limited, we propose to carry out a study confirming or disproving existing&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data (collected in South-East Asia), before starting any larger African&#xD;
      efficacy and safety trials. The fixed-dose combination mefloquine-artesunate (MQ-AS),&#xD;
      developed by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, will be used in the study, which&#xD;
      will compare the pharmacokinetics of MQ-AS for treatment of P.falciparum in 24 pregnant women&#xD;
      in the second and third trimesters, to the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in 24 matched&#xD;
      non-pregnant P.falciparum infected women. The study will be carried out in Burkina Faso.&#xD;

      Malaria during pregnancy constitutes a major public health problem in Sub-Saharan Africa,&#xD;
      where it increases the risk of low birth weight (&lt;2500g), infant mortality, infant morbidity&#xD;
      during the first year of life, prematurity and infant anemia. Over the past decades, P.&#xD;
      falciparum has shown increasing resistance to standard antimalarial therapy (chloroquine CQ&#xD;
      and Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine). The inexorable development and spread of P. falciparum&#xD;
      resistance to antimalarials has prompted a change in treatment approach; artemisinin&#xD;
      containing combination therapies (ACTs) are now the standard treatment of P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria in areas with established resistance to the traditional therapies. The use of&#xD;
      combinations reduces the theoretical likelihood of selecting resistant mutants; it is hoped&#xD;
      that this strategy will delay the development of new resistances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard approach for using ACT in pregnancy does not exist in Africa. Even if the World&#xD;
      Health Organization endorses the use of ACTs for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in 2nd&#xD;
      and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, some countries keep on using quinine, while others allow the&#xD;
      use of ACTs. These different approaches point out to the necessity of establishing the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of ACTs in malaria-infected pregnant women. Nevertheless, considering that the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic of antimalarials may be altered during pregnancy (potentially leading to&#xD;
      under-dosing) and that the available safety and pharmacokinetic data are still somewhat&#xD;
      limited, it is important to carry out a preliminary pharmacokinetic study confirming or&#xD;
      disproving available data (collected in South-East Asia), before starting any larger African&#xD;
      efficacy and safety trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACT regimen mefloquine-artesunate (MQ-AS) has recently been developed as a fixed-dose&#xD;
      combination by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) and has been registered in&#xD;
      Brazil (the country of manufacture) in 2008. Artesunate is an artemisinin derivative with a&#xD;
      rapidly increasing positive experience in pregnancy, while Mefloquine (LariamÂ®) has been used&#xD;
      for many years for both prevention and treatment of malaria, and has been shown to be safe in&#xD;
      pregnant women. The convenient dosing afforded by a fixed drug combination makes MQ-AS a very&#xD;
      promising candidate for use in treating pregnant women in Africa, as rescue treatment&#xD;
      alternative to quinine. Since preliminary data suggest that the peak concentration of&#xD;
      mefloquine is lowered in pregnant women, further studies on safety, efficacy, and dose&#xD;
      optimization are imperative, prior to wide-spread adoption of this medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to compare the pharmacokinetics of the fixed combination of MQ-AS for&#xD;
      treatment of P.falciparum in 24 pregnant women in the second and third trimesters to the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in 24 matched non-pregnant P.falciparum infected women, in&#xD;
      an African setting. This will allow for dose optimization in pregnant women.&#xD;
