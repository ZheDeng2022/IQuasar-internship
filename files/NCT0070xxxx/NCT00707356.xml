    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to determine the optimal treatment conditions to achieve&#xD;
      prostate cancer tumor ablation and to assess the effects of WST11 mediated VTP treatment in&#xD;
      patients with localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives is to evaluate safety and quality of life ; to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters and to model the relationship between concentration and effects;&#xD;
      and to assess the effects, the safety and quality of life of a second WST11 VTP treatment in&#xD;
      patients with persistent or recurrent localized prostate cancer after a first VTP;&#xD;

      This trial is designed as a multicentre, phase II, open-labeled, single intra-venous (IV)&#xD;
      dose study. The patient is to receive general anesthesia. WST11-mediated VTP will consist of&#xD;
      the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2 mg/Kg,4mg/Kg or 6 mg/kg,&#xD;
      using 753 nm laser light at a fixed power (150mW/cm) and energy (200 J/cm) delivered through&#xD;
      transperineal interstitial optical fibers. If deemed necessary and in consideration of the&#xD;
      results of the patients treated with 200 J/cm, alternate power (200mW/cm) and alternate&#xD;
      energy (300 J/cm) might be applied after Sponsor, Steering Committee and DSMB approval.The&#xD;
      fibers are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the prostate under&#xD;
      ultra sound image guidance (using a brachytherapy like template). The tumor location is&#xD;
      established using transrectal biopsy and MR imaging. The number of fibers and the total light&#xD;
      energy will be adapted to each patient, taking into account the tumor localization and the&#xD;
      volume of the prostate.&#xD;
