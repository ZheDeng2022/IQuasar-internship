      RATIONALE: Sorafenib and pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Sorafenib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with pemetrexed and cisplatin may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib when&#xD;
      given together with pemetrexed and cisplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate when given in combination&#xD;
           with pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous cell solid&#xD;
           tumor malignancy including, but not limited to, breast, lung, colon, pancreatic,&#xD;
           prostate, or head and neck cancer or sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain preliminary information about the antitumor activity of this regimen in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate once daily on days 1-21 and cisplatin IV over 1-2&#xD;
      hours and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days, every 8 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression, and then every 3 months for up to 6 months.&#xD;
