  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of folic acid administration on the blood&#xD;
      level and the breakdown products of OC study drug (250 mcg norgestimate[NGM]/35 mcg Ethinyl&#xD;
      Estradiol [EE]) tablets. The effect of study drug tablet intake on the blood level of folic&#xD;
      acid is also determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, pharmacokinetic drug interaction study between folic&#xD;
      acid (1 mg) and study drug (250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE) in 2 groups of at least 20 healthy women&#xD;
      each. In Group 1, a single oral dose of 250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE study drug was administered to&#xD;
      the healthy volunteers at the study site on Days 1 and 17 and folic acid 1 mg was&#xD;
      administered orally on Days 4 to 18; in Group 2, folic acid 1 mg was administered orally on&#xD;
      Days 1 and 17 at the study site and 1 tablet of study drug was administered on Days 2 to 17.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at specified times for 72 hours postdose on Days 1 and 17 for&#xD;
      the healthy volunteers in Group 1 for determination of blood levels of norelgestromin (NGMN),&#xD;
      and norgestrel (NG) [the active breakdown product of NGM], and EE. For the healthy volunteers&#xD;
      in Group 2, blood samples were collected for 24 hours after the folic acid dose on Days 1 and&#xD;
      17 for determination of plasma levels of total folates. Safety was evaluated based on the&#xD;
      following: the incidence, type and severity of adverse events; clinical laboratory tests;&#xD;
      vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECGs) measurements; and physical examinations. Oral&#xD;
      temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and sitting blood pressure (BP) were taken before&#xD;
      dosing on Days 1 and 17. For Group 1, measurements were taken before and at least 15 minutes&#xD;
      after the 24-hour (Days 2 and 18), 48-hour (Days 3 and 19), and 72-hour (Day 4)&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic blood draw; and at study completion (Day 20) or early withdrawal. For Group&#xD;
      2, measurements were taken before and at least 15 minutes after the 24-hour pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      blood draw on Days 2 and 18; and at study completion (Day 18) or early withdrawal. Physical&#xD;
      and gynecologic examinations and 12-lead ECGs were performed at screening and at study&#xD;
      completion or early withdrawal. Blood samples for blood chemistry, hematology, and urine&#xD;
      samples for urinalysis were collected at the screening visit and at the follow-up visit or&#xD;
      early withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral contraceptives tablet (250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE); Folic acid tablet (1 mg). In Group 1, a&#xD;
      single oral dose of (250 mcg NGM/35 mcg EE) study drug was administered on Days 1 and 17 and&#xD;
      folic acid 1 mg was administered orally on Days 4 to 18; in Group 2, folic acid 1 mg was&#xD;
      administered orally on Days 1 and 17 and 1 tablet of study drug was administered on Days 2 to&#xD;
      17. Study drugs were taken with 240 mL (8 oz) of water at approximately 8:00 a.m.&#xD;
