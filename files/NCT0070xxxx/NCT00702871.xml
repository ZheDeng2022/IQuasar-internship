      Objective of this study was to determine incidence, risk factors, etiological micro-organisms&#xD;
      and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and outcome of VAP; and to study effect of&#xD;
      ranitidine vs. sucralfate, used for stress ulcer prophylaxis, on gastric colonization and on&#xD;
      occurrence of VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Design: Prospective randomized study. Setting: ICUs of Medicine Department and&#xD;
      Anesthesiology Department, Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital, University of&#xD;
      Delhi, New Delhi. Patients: 50 patients of age more than 12 years, who had been on ventilator&#xD;
      for more than 48 hrs. Intervention: Endotracheal Aspirate and blood sample of all patients&#xD;
      were cultured to determine micro-organisms causing VAP and their antimicrobial susceptibility&#xD;
      pattern. Patients were divided into 2 groups on random basis. The first group was given&#xD;
      ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis while the second was given sucralfate. Thereafter,&#xD;
      difference in gastric colonization (on basis of quantitative culture of nasogastric aspirate)&#xD;
      and on occurrence of VAP in both the groups was compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: Study was designed to create data about Ventilator associated pneumonia in&#xD;
      developing countries like India. This data is crucial for providing information for deciding&#xD;
      future guidelines for treatment of and prevention of Ventilator associated pneumonia. Further&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that H2 blockers, by virtue of raising gastric Ph, increase gastric&#xD;
      colonization by pathogenic organism and increase incidence of Ventilator associated&#xD;
      pneumonia; patients were divided into two groups on random basis, as described above.&#xD;

      Study population: Fifty patients of either sex admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit and&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit of Anaesthesiology department of Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok&#xD;
      Nayak Hospital, New Delhi( a 2000 bedded, tertiary care centre), fulfilling the criteria were&#xD;
      enrolled and prospectively followed up until one week after discharge from intensive care&#xD;
      unit or till death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Ventilator associated pneumonia was diagnosed when new and persistent pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrates (not otherwise explained) appeared on chest radiograph after 48 hours of&#xD;
      ventilation and any two of the following three criteria were fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Temperature of more than 38oC or less than 35oC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Leukocytosis ≥16,000 or leukopenia ≤ 3,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Purulent endotracheal aspirate and/or positive endotracheal aspirate culture. Protocol&#xD;
           of study: All patients were ventilated by orotracheal or tracheostomy tube, which was&#xD;
           changed only if, blocked or displaced. Patients were ventilated in supine position with&#xD;
           frequent changing to right lateral and left lateral positions and nasogastric tube was&#xD;
           put in all patients. No prophylactic topical oropharyngeal antibiotic and selective gut&#xD;
           decontamination was done in any of the patients. Base line complete blood count was done&#xD;
           in all patients at time of intubation. Subsequent counts were done when pneumonia was&#xD;
           suspected by onset of fever, new chest signs, worsening of ventilatory requirement and&#xD;
           radiologically new infiltrates. Baseline chest X-ray and endotracheal aspirate culture&#xD;
           was done at intubation and at 48 hours of ventilation and subsequently done at suspicion&#xD;
           of pneumonia or any other pulmonary complications, 48 hours after pneumonia has been&#xD;
           detected, routinely once a week if no pneumonia is detected. Nasogastric aspirate&#xD;
           culture was done on 3rd and 7th day of intubation and every week thereafter. Gastric&#xD;
           colonization was diagnosed if more than 103 colony-forming units/ml were found. Clinical&#xD;
           examination for pneumonia and chest radiographs after one week of extubation were done&#xD;
           on follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of collection of samples: Endotracheal aspirate was collected with mucus trap under&#xD;
      all aseptic precautions. Nasogastric (NG) aspirate was collected from indwelling NG tubes.&#xD;
      After removing the initial 5 ml, the next 10 ml of fluid in the tube was aspirated into a&#xD;
      sterile syringe and immediately transported to the laboratory for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culture method: A Semi quantitative culture of the endotracheal aspirate and nasogastric&#xD;
      aspirate was done [6]. A Measured amount of aspirate was plated on blood agar and Mac-Conkey&#xD;
      medium and a colony count was done after incubation. A sample of blood was collected in&#xD;
      glucose broth and after overnight incubation, subcultures were done on blood agar and&#xD;
      Mac-Conkey agar. Colony characteristics were observed and identification was done in&#xD;
      accordance with standard recommendations. Susceptibility of the organisms isolated from&#xD;
      endotracheal aspirate was done by disc diffusion technique employing the Stokes method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grouping of patients: Patients enrolled into study were divided randomly into two groups on&#xD;
      random basis. One group was given Ranitidine (H2 blocker) 50 mg I.V. every 8 hourly as stress&#xD;
      ulcer prophylaxis while the other group recieved Sucralfate (surface active agent) 1g 6&#xD;
      hourly via nasogastric tube. Occurrence of VAP in each group was recorded and compared.&#xD;
      Gastric colonization in each group was monitored by semi-quantitative culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors studied were age, sex, underlying disease, prior respiratory disease including&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD), prior hospitalization, duration of intubation,&#xD;
      numbers of intubations, prior antibiotic therapy etc. Other parameters noted were indication&#xD;
      of mechanical ventilation and outcome of patients with VAP Statistical methods: Incidence,&#xD;
      risk factors, outcome and antimicrobial susceptibility were calculated in absolute numbers&#xD;
      and percentages. Comparison of effect of ranitidine vs. sucralfate on occurrence of VAP was&#xD;
      done by chi square test and effect of ranitidine vs. sucralfate on gastric colonization was&#xD;
      calculated in absolute numbers and percentages and compared. All statistics were calculated&#xD;
      using SPSS software. P value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK FACTORS studied include age, sex, underlying disease, prior COPD, prior hospitalization,&#xD;
      duration of intubation, no. of intubation. Longer duration of dependence on ventilator&#xD;
      increased the risk for VAP significantly (p value 0.001). Similarly, reintubation also&#xD;
      emerged as clear predisposing factor for VAP (See table 1).&#xD;
