    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the progression of kidney disease in subjects with&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Advanced Diabetic Nephropathy treated by routine follow-up as a&#xD;
      general care and in subjects treated by multi-factorial intervention in the Diabetes-Renal&#xD;
      Clinic.&#xD;

      In this study, the overall objective is comparison of progression of renal insufficiency in&#xD;
      subjects with Advanced Diabetic Nephropathy (CKD stages 3 and 4) randomized into&#xD;
      multifactorial intervention in the Diabetes-Renal Clinic (study group) and into usual care&#xD;
      (control group). The multifactorial intervention includes the following: 1. Blood pressure&#xD;
      control to the goal of &lt;130/80mmHg and renal protection with reduction of proteinuria to&#xD;
      &lt;0.5g/day using a protocol that includes therapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs or their&#xD;
      combination. 2. Tight glucose control using SMBG and Lantus/Apidra self-escalation regimen.&#xD;
      3. Use of hypolipidemic therapy to achieve targets of LDL of &lt; 70 mg/dl, HDL &gt; 40/50 mg/dl&#xD;
      (males/females) [since you said that HDL is not a target because there are no meds for it I&#xD;
      deleted HDL;] and triglycerides of less than 200 mg/dl. 4. Patient enhanced self-management&#xD;
      provided by combined diabetes-renal education curriculum (taught by certified diabetes and&#xD;
      renal educators). 5. Behavior and social intervention (motivational interviews and social&#xD;
      assessment) provided as needed by social workers. 6. Intense case management that includes&#xD;
      close follow-up of visits, laboratory monitoring and other self-adherence behaviors. 7.&#xD;
      Weight loss with lifestyle and diet modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group will keep on receiving the usual treatment that they used to receive from their&#xD;
      respective clinics and the Diabetes-Renal team would not alter their therapy or interfere in&#xD;
      their management.&#xD;
