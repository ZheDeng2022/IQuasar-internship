    <textblock>
      Von Willebramd Factor (VWF) is an adhesive glycoprotein synthesized by megakaryocytes and&#xD;
      endothelial cells.VWF has a central role in primary hemostasis and is a critical ligand for&#xD;
      platelets adhesion and aggregation (1, 2).VWF is the carrier of circulating factor 8 as well.&#xD;
      VWF is stored in Wiebel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and in platelets alfa granules in&#xD;
      a form of Ultra-large (UL) multimers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VWF multimers are composed from subunits which are linked by disulfide bonds that&#xD;
      alternate between 2 C- terminal ends and 2 N- terminal ends in a head-to-head and&#xD;
      tail-to-tail fashion (3, 4). The biological activity of VWF has been shown to be related to&#xD;
      the size of the multimers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VWF is released from endothelial cells toward the plasma as a multimers ranging from&#xD;
      500-20,000 kD. The UL multimers are hemostaticallly more effective than the smaller forms.&#xD;
      They spontaneously bind to platelets which lead to the formation of microthrombi in the&#xD;
      circulation. This mechanism is downregulated by the plasma protease ADAMTS-13(A Disintegrin&#xD;
      And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin motif).If the proteolysis become defective the ULVWF&#xD;
      will bind to platlets resulting in systemic thrombotic microangiophaties (TMA) such as&#xD;
      thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura(TTP)(5,6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAMTS-13 belongs to the ADAMTS family of metalloproteases.The structure of ADAMTS-13 is&#xD;
      conserved throughout vertebrates, indicating its important function (7).The metalloprotease&#xD;
      function was first describe 11 years ago and has been cloned and characterized (8-13).The&#xD;
      ADAMTS family of metaloploproteases is required in other systems such as genitourinary system&#xD;
      (ADAMTS1), collagen system (ADAMTS2) and as a cleaving protease of VWF (VWFCP) - ADAMTS13.&#xD;
      When VWF multimer is subjected to sufficient fluid shear stress ADAMTS-13 cleaves VWF at a&#xD;
      unique 842Tyr- 843Met bond in domain A2 (14,15).This cleavage produce VWF subunit fragments&#xD;
      of 176 kDa and 140 kDa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of ADAMTS-13 depends on both Zn+2 and Ca+2 ions (16). Low levels or deficiency&#xD;
      of ADAMTS-13 is seen in patient with TTP(17,18). Mannuccio et al (19) showed that low levels&#xD;
      of ADAMTS-13 are seen in other conditions such as healthy adults older than 65 years,&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis, uremia, acute inflammation, postoperative period. In neonate and&#xD;
      preterm infants the data is limited. Few studies have shown that levels of ADAMTS-13 are low&#xD;
      in neonate (19-21).Tsai et al (22) observed that ADAMTS-13 activity is normal in cord blood&#xD;
      compared to adults. In preterm infants a pilot study showed that preterm have low levels of&#xD;
      ADAMTS-13(23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to check ADAMTS-13, VWF multimers, VWF antigen and VWF collagen&#xD;
      binding activity in healthy and sick neonate and in preterm infants.&#xD;
