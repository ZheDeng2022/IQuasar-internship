      The main objectives of the study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the knowledge acquisition and retention of 4th-grade students who participate&#xD;
           in the St. Jude Cancer Education for Children Program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship between outcome measures (knowledge acquisition and&#xD;
           knowledge retention) with covariates of interest such as self-reported age and gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the knowledge scores among schools and identify the schools that may show&#xD;
           better improvement than others and factors associated with improvement&#xD;

      The subjects in this research study will be current 4th-grade students at elementary schools&#xD;
      in Memphis, Tennessee who choose to participate in the Program. These participants are not&#xD;
      patients of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The Program will be implemented over a&#xD;
      three-day period. Each student will attend two presentations and six hands-on activities led&#xD;
      by St. Jude faculty and research staff on topics within their expertise, such as cells and&#xD;
      cancer, and healthy living. Printed materials to be distributed as part of the St. Jude&#xD;
      Cancer Education for Children Program have been developed by a multi-disciplinary team of St.&#xD;
      Jude employees and local educators and reviewed by national experts for scientific accuracy&#xD;
      and appropriate readability. Material includes three illustrated children's books, a&#xD;
      laboratory manual, and activity sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One pre- and two post-tests will be administered by designated school teachers. The tests&#xD;
      consist of 10 multiple-choice questions per each of three modules(cells, cancer, and healthy&#xD;
      living), validated by a group of experts for readability and content relevance. Knowledge&#xD;
      acquisition will be assessed by taking the differences from first post-test to pre-test&#xD;
      scores, obtained from 10 questions on each component of the intervention, and using&#xD;
      one-sample signed rank test to evaluate the improvement in the knowledge scores. A similar&#xD;
      analysis will be undertaken by taking the differences from the 2nd post-evaluation to the 1st&#xD;
      post-evaluation for each participant to assess knowledge retention.&#xD;

    <description>Each participant will attend two presentations and six hands-on activities led by St. Jude faculty and research staff on topics within their expertise, such as cells and cancer, and healthy living. The pre-test will take place within 7±1 days before the program presentations and before students receive copies of the printed material. Two post-tests will take place. The first post-test will be administered within 7±1 days after the final scheduled program presentation and will be a measure of knowledge acquisition. The second post-test will take place 90±7 days post-intervention and will be a measure of knowledge retention.</description>

        A convenience sample of schools that agree to participate in the St. Jude Cancer Education&#xD;
        for Children Program. 2-3 public schools and 2-3 private schools will be selected in order&#xD;
        to achieve a fair representation of the Mid-South area. Based on average class sizes, this&#xD;
        study expects to enroll at least 200 public school students and about 100 private school&#xD;
        students.&#xD;
