      The aim of the study is to assess the cardiac innervation in patients with heart failure to&#xD;
      better select candidates for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Cardiac innervation&#xD;
      will be assessed using an imaging agent administered intravenously.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The survival benefit provided by implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary&#xD;
      prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure compared to medical treatment alone is&#xD;
      well established. First limited to the most severe patients, the indications have gradually&#xD;
      been extended in accordance with the results of more recent studies. This beneficial effect&#xD;
      in terms of public health is accompanied by an increase in health spending which threatens to&#xD;
      grow strongly at short and medium term. However, the majority of ICDs implanted will not be&#xD;
      solicited because of the overall low incidence of severe ventricular arrhythmias in the&#xD;
      population meeting the implantation criteria. To optimize our resources, it is therefore&#xD;
      important to better assess the risk of sudden death in those patients candidates for ICD&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overactivation of NEURO-humoral systems plays an important role in the progression of&#xD;
      heart failure, and in the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. The iodine-123&#xD;
      meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy (MIBG), is a functional imaging method that can&#xD;
      noninvasively evaluate cardiac sympathetic innervation. It has been shown that cardiac&#xD;
      adrenergic hyperactivation estimated by MIBG scintigraphy was associated with a poor outcome,&#xD;
      and that its value was independent and superior to other prognostic factors in heart failure.&#xD;
      More importantly, the risk of occurrence of major cardiac events is minimal when the cardiac&#xD;
      uptake of MIBG is high. Furthermore, plasma natriuretic peptides (particularly BNP and&#xD;
      NT-proBNP), which are other indicators of the NEURO-hormonal activation used in the diagnosis&#xD;
      and assessment of prognosis in heart failure, are predictive of the risk of occurrence of&#xD;
      sudden death in the same population. In summary, the MIBG scintigraphy and NT-proBNP are two&#xD;
      prognostic markers in heart failure related to the degree of NEURO-hormonal dysfunction, and&#xD;
      have a good negative predictive value of mortality. Their combined use could therefore help&#xD;
      identify patients at low risk of severe arrhythmias.These tests are not currently part of&#xD;
      heart failure diagnosis in patients who are candidates for ICD implantation.&#xD;
