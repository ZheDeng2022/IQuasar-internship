      Background: Crohn's disease (CD), a type of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), is a chronic&#xD;
      relapsing inflammatory disorder of the digestive system. CD affects ~112,000 individuals in&#xD;
      Canada, of whom 20-25% are diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The specific cause of CD&#xD;
      remains unknown; however, it is hypothesized that CD involves a complex interaction of&#xD;
      several factors, including a genetically susceptible host, the intestinal mucosal immune&#xD;
      system and microbe population. Several dietary factors have been explored for their potential&#xD;
      role in the etiology of CD. However, no consensus on the role of diet has emerged. Recent&#xD;
      evidence suggests a plausible link between a lack of Vitamin D and CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose &amp; Hypothesis: The investigators primary hypothesis is that a greater proportion of&#xD;
      pediatric CD patients will achieve optimal 25OHD concentration (&gt; 75 nmol/L) on 2000 IU/d&#xD;
      than 400 IU/d Vitamin D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Pediatric Crohn's Disease patients between 8-18 years of age, and have been in&#xD;
      remission for at least 4 weeks as indicated by a Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index&#xD;
      (PCDAI) &lt;10 will be recruited for a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial where they&#xD;
      will receive one of two dosages of vitamin D (10 or 50 ug/day) and will be asked to continue&#xD;
      the supplementation for 6 months. Vitamin D levels will be measured in blood at baseline, 3&#xD;
      months, and 6 months. Dietary vitamin D intake will be estimated using a food frequency and&#xD;
      lifestyle questionnaire. Data will be analyzed using multiple regression analysis controlling&#xD;
      for baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results and Conclusions: It is expected that a greater proportion of children&#xD;
      receiving the 50 ug/day vitamin D supplement will achieve a blood vitamin level &gt;75 nmol/L&#xD;
      compared to children receiving 10 ug/day. This data will aid policy makers, parents/children&#xD;
      and healthcare workers in recommending an appropriate vitamin D dosage for the pediatric&#xD;
      crohn's population.&#xD;

      Trial Objectives: Our primary hypothesis is that a greater proportion of pediatric CD&#xD;
      patients will achieve optimal 25OHD concentration (&gt; 75 nmol/L) on 2000 IU/d than 400 IU/d&#xD;
      Vitamin D. Our primary objective is to determine whether the proportion of pediatric CD&#xD;
      patients achieving 25OHD concentration &gt; 75 nmol/L is greater in those receiving 2000 IU/d or&#xD;
      400 IU/d Vitamin D. Our secondary objective is to determine if patients receiving 2000 IU&#xD;
      Vitamin D are more likely to have remained in remission [Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity&#xD;
      Index (PCDAI) &lt; 20] than those receiving 400 IU/d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a parallel study design with two levels of Vitamin D: 400 IU/d,&#xD;
      and 2000 IU/d supplement of Vitamin D3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 6 Months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites (inside and outside of Canada):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children's and Women's Hospital of British Columbia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. McMaster's Children's Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of Investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tim Green, PhD. Faculty of Land and Food Systems, UBC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kevan Jacobson MD. Pediatric GI, UBC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Robert Issenman MD. Pediatric GI, McMaster University&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Susan Barr PhD. Faculty of Land and Food Systems, UBC Sample Size: Forty-five subjects&#xD;
           per group will allow us to detect as little as a 20% difference in the proportion of&#xD;
           participants achieving a 25OHD &gt;75 nmol/L between the two doses with 80% power and a one&#xD;
           sided of 0.05. Assuming a 10% attrition rate we will need to recruit 50 subjects per&#xD;
           group. Clinical experience indicates that approximately 50% of pediatric CD patients&#xD;
           will relapse over 6 months based on an elevated PCDAI (&gt;20). Forty-five subjects per&#xD;
           group will allow us to detect a 50% difference in CD relapse between the two doses with&#xD;
           80% power and a one sided of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Pediatric CD patients who are patients of the pediatric gastroenterology&#xD;
      services of BC and McMaster Children's Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Patients will be eligible to participate if they have a diagnosis of CD,&#xD;
      are between 8-18 years of age, and have been in remission for at least 4 weeks as indicated&#xD;
      by a PCDAI &lt;10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be ineligible if they have active disease with a PCDAI &gt;&#xD;
      10, taking corticosteroids, or taking more than 400 IU Vitamin D at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NHP Formulation: Vitamin D at doses of 10 and 50 ug (400, and 2000 IU) 400 IU DIN #02231624&#xD;
      2000 IU Dosage Regimen: Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two supplemental doses&#xD;
      of vitamin D3 (10, and 50 ug/d) Prestudy Screening and Baseline Evaluation: Patients and&#xD;
      their parent/guardian who meet the inclusion criteria and who consent will be enrolled and&#xD;
      assigned without bias to a dose group. A one-hour fasting blood sample and a spot urine&#xD;
      collection will be collected, a PCDAI will be administered, and patients will complete a food&#xD;
      frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that will include information on Vitamin D and calcium&#xD;
      supplement use (including dose and duration) as well as a lifestyle and demographic&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit: One-hour fasting blood and spot urine will be collected and the PCDAI will&#xD;
      be administered at baseline, 3 months (+/- 1 week), and 6 months (+/- 1 week) after baseline.&#xD;
      25OHD concentrations are thought to stabilize after 8 weeks of supplementation at a constant&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria: Discontinuation criteria for individual&#xD;
      subjects include violation of any of the exclusion criteria, severe non-compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol, or occurrence of adverse events that are judged to be severe enough for&#xD;
      discontinuation. Subjects are also free to voluntarily discontinue the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Medication: Regular dosage of 400 IU vitamin D Washout Period: None Dietary&#xD;
      Assessment: Calcium and Vitamin D intake from food over the previous month will be estimated&#xD;
      using a food frequency questionnaire validated for use in a variety of ethnic groups (From S&#xD;
      Whiting; U Sask).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index: The PCDAI will be used to assess the severity of&#xD;
      disease. It consists of a patient recall, laboratory values, and a clinical examination.&#xD;
      Scores below 10 indicate remission and scores above 20 indicate active disease (attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assessment: Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, serum calcium, serum albumin, serum&#xD;
      creatinine, urinary calcium and urinary creatinine will be measured by the hospital pathology&#xD;
      labs using standard procedures. Serum 25OHD, PTH will be measured using automated&#xD;
      chemiluminescent assay system (Liaison, Diasorin) by BC Biolabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analysis: The proportion of patients achieving a 25OHD of 75 nmol/L on each of the&#xD;
      dosages at 6 months will be compared using a Chi-squared test. Likewise the proportion of&#xD;
      participants remaining in remission (PCDAI &lt;20) will also be compared using a Chi-squared&#xD;
      test. Data will initially be analyzed as intent-to-treat for all outcomes. In the case of&#xD;
      dropouts or missing data the last observation will be carried-forward. A second analysis will&#xD;
      be carried out for each outcome only using subjects with complete data and who were over 80%&#xD;
      compliant in supplement use (as-treated analysis). Differences in the characteristics of the&#xD;
      participants in the groups at baseline will be determined using Student's t-test for&#xD;
      continuous and the chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analysis: Adverse events will be recorded according to Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines and the guidelines of our university's human research ethics board. Adverse event&#xD;
      occurrences will be compared descriptively between the treatment and placebo groups. Safety&#xD;
      will also be assessed as part of the blood collection (Serum Ca and Serum PTH and Serum P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Data will initially be analyzed as intent-to-treat for all outcomes. In&#xD;
      the case of dropouts or missing data the last observation will be carried-forward. A second&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out for each outcome only using subjects with complete data and who&#xD;
      were over 80% complaint in supplement use (as-treated analysis). Differences in the&#xD;
      characteristics of the participants in the groups at baseline will be determined using&#xD;
      Student's t-test for continuous and the chi-square test of Fisher's Exact Test for&#xD;
      categorical variables. The primary endpoints will be the dosages at 3 months will be&#xD;
      evaluated using a Chi-squared test. Dose response (as ug Vitamin D3 per nmol/L increase in&#xD;
      25OHD) in children will be determined using multiple regression analysis with 25OHD as the&#xD;
      dependent variable, vitamin D dose entered as a continuous variable, and baseline vitamin D&#xD;
      as a covariate.&#xD;
