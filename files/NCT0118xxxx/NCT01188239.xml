  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's major aim is to investigate the ability of a commercial Electronic Nicotine&#xD;
      Delivery Device (E-Cigarette) loaded with low dose nicotine to induce long-term smoking&#xD;
      reduction/abstinence in smokers unwilling to quit. Secondary aims are to investigate changes&#xD;
      in withdrawal symptoms and cravings and to examine whether concomitant use of the E-Cigarette&#xD;
      and smoking is safe. The study will monitor smoking reduction/abstinence effects, changes in&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, and adverse events of a currently marketed device in Italy (&quot;Categoria&quot;&#xD;
      electronic cigarette) using initially for 6 weeks &quot;ORIGINAL&quot; 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges&#xD;
      followed by a further 6 weeks of &quot;CATEGORIA&quot; 5.2 mg nicotine cartridges. The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the E-Cigarette used in a structured protocol is a safe device that allows&#xD;
      smoking reduction or abstinence in smokers possibly by suppressing withdrawal symptoms and&#xD;
      cravings.&#xD;

      The electronic cigarette (E-Cigarette) is an electronic nicotine delivery systems designed&#xD;
      for the purpose of nicotine delivery to the respiratory system where nor tobacco nor&#xD;
      combustion are necessary for its operation. For these reasons, it is possible that this&#xD;
      product may be safer than cigarettes. Marketing claims also include that they can be useful&#xD;
      smoking cessation aids. Although E-Cigarette may produce lung delivery of nicotine similar to&#xD;
      that of tobacco cigarettes and reproduces the gesture component associated with tobacco&#xD;
      smoking, very little is known about the effect of E-Cigarette on the smoking habits of&#xD;
      regular tobacco smokers. Therefore, we designed a prospective observational study consisting&#xD;
      of 8 office-based visits (a baseline visit and a 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12-weeks and a final&#xD;
      visit at 24-weeks) to monitor possible modifications in the smoking habits of a group of well&#xD;
      characterized regular smokers experimenting the e-cigarette focusing on long-term smoking&#xD;
      reduction/abstinence, changes in withdrawal symptoms/cravings and adverse events.&#xD;
      Specifically, 100 smokers will be given &quot;Categoria&quot; electronic cigarette initially loaded&#xD;
      with &quot;ORIGINAL&quot; 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges for 6 weeks followed by &quot;CATEGORIA&quot; 5.2 mg&#xD;
      nicotine cartridges for a further 6 weeks. A final follow up visit will be carried out at 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
