  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical research is to analyze the survival of a cohort of patients&#xD;
      newly diagnosed (incident cases) with idiopathic PAH, familial or associated with the use of&#xD;
      anorectics (isolated pulmonary vascular disease without comorbidity) and identify prognostic&#xD;
      factors using a dynamic model for predicting survival, including prognostic factors evaluated&#xD;
      repeatedly at pre-specified periods during follow-up. In a second step, the investigators&#xD;
      define using this model combinations of parameters to better define the therapeutic goals in&#xD;
      PAH (functional class, exercise testing, hemodynamic, echocardiographic variables, biological&#xD;
      parameters).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by an intense&#xD;
      proliferation of pulmonary arterial wall causing increased progressive pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance, leading to right heart failure and death. Established prognostic factors at&#xD;
      diagnosis were identified 20 years ago at a time when there is no specific treatment for&#xD;
      describing the natural history of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years, new therapeutic classes (similar to prostacyclin, antagonists of&#xD;
      endothelin receptors, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5) have been developed and improved&#xD;
      symptoms, exercise capacity, and hemodynamics in patients with PAH. With the availability of&#xD;
      these new molecules, the clinician is now faced with difficult treatment decisions regarding&#xD;
      the choice of initial treatment and the need for road treatments combined during evolution.&#xD;
      Therapeutic purpose and effect of these different therapeutic strategies on the long-term&#xD;
      survival remain poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it has been clearly demonstrated that clinical parameters (NYHA functional class),&#xD;
      functional (test 6-minute walk) and hemodynamic (cardiac output and pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance) measured before initiation of treatment have a major role in determining the&#xD;
      prognosis, with the contribution of new molecules is important to evaluate the prognostic&#xD;
      value of changes in these factors during follow-up under specific treatment. At the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, including repeat cardiac catheterization rights, it is also important to evaluate&#xD;
      other prognostic criteria substitution, including methods of noninvasive evaluation&#xD;
      (echocardiography, biomarkers).&#xD;
