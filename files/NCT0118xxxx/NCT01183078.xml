  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Utilization of the &quot;wand&quot; method will enhance improvements in drill placement,&#xD;
      locking nail placement during tibia and femur fracture repairs, and offer less radiation&#xD;
      exposure and less operative time. The purpose of this research study is to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of distal locking of intramedullary nails using a standard free-hand technique with&#xD;
      the guided wand technique. Distal locking is the placement of screws through the&#xD;
      intramedullary rod to hold it in place and prevent rotation. Currently, the free-hand&#xD;
      technique is most often utilized. With this technique, the surgeon uses intraoperative x-rays&#xD;
      in order to find the holes in the intramedullary rod to place the screws. The wand technique&#xD;
      uses electromagnetic fields rather than x-rays to find these screw holes. The utilization of&#xD;
      the wand technique could result in improvements in drill placement and locking nail placement&#xD;
      as well as decrease operative time and radiation exposure.&#xD;

      Methods and Measures Patients 18 years of age and older presenting through the emergency room&#xD;
      at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center with tibial and femoral fractures suitable&#xD;
      for operative repair will be prospectively enrolled. Inclusion criteria will include any&#xD;
      patient with a tibia fracture or femur fracture requiring intramedullary nailing. Retrograde&#xD;
      intramedullary nails will be excluded as will nails which are not interlocked. The goal for&#xD;
      enrollment is 24 tibial and 24 femoral fractures. Data including operative time, C-arm time,&#xD;
      and &quot;nail misses&quot; will be obtained in the operating room for 24 tibial and 24 femoral nails.&#xD;
      Surgeons who perform the procedure will have had experience using the freehand technique and&#xD;
      will be trained with the guided wand prior to the experiment. Locking will be performed with&#xD;
      the freehand and the wand technique in alternating order for the two interlocking screws. The&#xD;
      order of which technique is utilized first will be randomly assigned. All procedures will be&#xD;
      timed, and fluoroscopy time, radiation time, and any &quot;nail misses&quot; will be documented. All&#xD;
      tibial nails will be locked with 2 mediolateral screws and all femurs with 2 lateral to&#xD;
      medial screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive follow-up for complications for a 6 month period after surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Intervals of follow-up will be at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
      Anterior-posterior and lateral images will be performed as are already customary and usual at&#xD;
      these time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure(s) The goal is to prospectively assess the &quot;wand&quot; technique as a reliable&#xD;
      alternative to standard interlocking screw placement which reduced operative time, C-arm&#xD;
      exposure and inadvertent &quot;nail misses.&quot; Additionally, it is expected that there will exist no&#xD;
      complications related to the use of this technique.&#xD;
