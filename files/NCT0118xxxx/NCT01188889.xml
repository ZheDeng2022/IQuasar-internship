  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients participating in this study will have a diagnosis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate whether the addition of an investigational drug called RAD001 given&#xD;
      together with Imatinib will better target leukemia stem cells, causing them to die. Stem&#xD;
      cells are a small population of cells, existing primarily within the bone marrow, and are&#xD;
      believed to be responsible for the ongoing risk of disease relapse.&#xD;
