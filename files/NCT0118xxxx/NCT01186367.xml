  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 3 different approaches to exercise&#xD;
      training in women with early stage breast cancer who have completed all primary treatments&#xD;
      (except hormone therapy, if appropriate). Prior research in women with early stage breast&#xD;
      cancer has shown that some treatments may have an adverse impact on physical fitness levels&#xD;
      leading to feelings of fatigue and poor quality of life. Supervised exercise training has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce some of these side-effects. However, all the exercise programs have&#xD;
      followed essentially the same approach. This study is designed to see if a different approach&#xD;
      to exercise training is more effective than the conventional approach currently in use.&#xD;
