      Background Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical approach for a number of different diseases&#xD;
      as it allows for diagnosis and treatment in the setting of a safe and feasible method&#xD;
      offering enhanced cosmesis. The natural evolution of laparoscopy is micro-laparoscopy which&#xD;
      utilizes smaller instruments and optics. Technological advancements have enabled&#xD;
      miniaturization of the surgical equipment without compromising diagnostic or operative&#xD;
      capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Keith Zuccala is currently performing micro-laparoscopic gastric bypass with an identical&#xD;
      safety profile as traditional laparoscopy (NSQIP data comparison between Dr. Laura Choi and&#xD;
      Dr. Keith Zuccala). The current trend in laparoscopy is to minimize incisions and their size&#xD;
      to decrease trauma to the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Both methods have never been compared in a prospective randomized trial to&#xD;
      address the following questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a difference in outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a decrease in postoperative pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does it decrease time off from work?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does micro-laparoscopy increase OR time?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the effect on cost of micro-laparoscopy? Patients will be randomized to one or&#xD;
           the other method, disclosing that to the investigators best knowledge both methods are&#xD;
           equally safe and that Dr. Zuccala has performed several hundred cases using both&#xD;
           methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population Projected sample size would be 50 patients in each group. Accrual should&#xD;
      be feasible over the course of 9-12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection (patients will be followed for a total of 30 days for the purpose of this&#xD;
      study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NSQIP data to assess outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative usage of pain medication while in the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time off from work&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. OR time&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Direct cost of procedure as it relates to material used&#xD;

      This study compares two groups of patients who have voluntarily chosen to undergo roux-n-y&#xD;
      gastric bypass surgery. The groups will be randomized to receive micro-laparoscopic or&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery to be performed by the same surgeon, Dr. Keith Zuccala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Schema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient attends an informational seminar conducted by the Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
           Department&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is scheduled for an initial consultation with the bariatric PA/NP where the&#xD;
           patient provides: a letter of referral for Bariatric Surgery from primary care doctor or&#xD;
           specialty physician; insurance referral; and assurance that health insurance coverage&#xD;
           includes Bariatric Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the initial consultation, the patient is scheduled for the following:&#xD;
           comprehensive blood testing; psychological screening/evaluation; dietary evaluation;&#xD;
           appointment with the surgeon; pulmonary evaluation (if needed); cardiology evaluation&#xD;
           (if needed); gastroenterology evaluation (if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An appointment for medical clearance with the referring surgeon is scheduled and&#xD;
           completed within three weeks of surgery. At this appointment an electrocardiogram (EKG)&#xD;
           and repeat blood work will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is deemed to meet all inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is advised to follow all pre-operative instructions as advised by the&#xD;
           nursing staff and explained in the Danbury Hospital Center for Weight Loss Surgery&#xD;
           Guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical procedures performed are standard for those already utilized daily in the&#xD;
           surgery department for gastric bypass procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is closely observed in the hospital and given specific discharge&#xD;
           instructions upon leaving the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient is followed for a maximum of 60 days after surgery and asked how many days&#xD;
           of work they missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NSQIP data base and patient medical record are used to assess outcome, postoperative&#xD;
           pain, OR time and surgery cost&#xD;
