    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. The trial comprises 2 stages: a dose escalation stage at 8 dose levels of 2, 5, 10,&#xD;
      20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/day,and possibly additional intermediate doses, to determine the&#xD;
      MTD and recommended dose, and a subsequent 2 parts of expansion stage to investigate the&#xD;
      safety profile and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In expansion stage part 1, up to 20 advanced sold tumor subjects will be investigated the&#xD;
      safety profiled and antitumor effect of OPB-51602 at the recommended dose for 3 weeks per&#xD;
      cycle（2 weeks treatment and 1 week washout). In the expansion stage part 2, a maximum of 20&#xD;
      subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Melanoma or Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor&#xD;
      (GIST) will be treated until an investigational Medicinal product (IMP) efficacious case can&#xD;
      be found. subject dosing will be started on Day 1 without 2-day treatment free interval and&#xD;
      continued until Day 28 at recommend dose (4mg) first in cycle 1. After safety and&#xD;
      tolerability are confirmed, same subjects will be treated at the MTD(5mg) from cycle 2&#xD;
      onwards as a once-daily oral dose for 4 weeks per cycle to obtain additional information&#xD;
      about safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of OPB-51602&#xD;

    <description>OPB-51602 at a dose of 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 mg/day,will be orally administered to subjects once daily for 2 weeks in each cycle of treatment in Dose Escalation Stage.A 2-day treatment-free interval will occur on Days 2 and 3 for PK sampling. Study drug administration will resume on Day 4 and continue until Day 17 in cycle 1.In Expansion stage part 1, OPB-51602 will be administered at recommend dose (4mg) for 3 weeks per cycle 9 2 weeks treatment and 1 week washout). There is also 2-day treatment free interval between Day 1 and Day 4 for PK sampling in cycle 1.In Expansion stage part 2, subject dosing will be started on Day 1 without 2-day treatment free interval and continued until Day 28 at recommend dose (4mg) first in Cycle 1. The same subjects will be treated at MTD(5mg)from cycle 2 onwards for 4 weeks per cycle.</description>
