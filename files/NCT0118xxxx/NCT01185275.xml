    <textblock>
      Clinical response, as defined by improvement in asthma quality of life, to bronchial&#xD;
      thermoplasty in patients with severe refractory asthma can be predicted through the use of&#xD;
      clinical, physiologic, biologic and imaging markers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Aim To assess the relationship between baseline clinical, physiologic, biologic and&#xD;
      imaging markers and response to bronchial thermoplasty, defined by improvement in asthma&#xD;
      quality of life, in patients with severe refractory asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the relationship between baseline clinical, physiologic, biologic and imaging&#xD;
           markers and response to bronchial thermoplasty, defined by reduction in severe&#xD;
           exacerbations or healthcare utilization, in patients with severe refractory asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate if baseline clinical, physiologic, biologic and imaging markers are related&#xD;
           to safety of bronchial thermoplasty in patients with severe refractory asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate and validate statistical models that predict response to bronchial&#xD;
           thermoplasty in patients with severe refractory asthma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females age 18 or greater and less than 65&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has asthma and is taking regular maintenance medication for past 12 months&#xD;
             that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at a dosage greater than 1000μg beclomethasone per&#xD;
                  day or equivalent, AND long acting ß2-agonist (LABA) at a dosage of ≥100μg per&#xD;
                  day Salmeterol or equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other asthma medications such as leukotriene modifiers, or anti-IgE, are&#xD;
                  acceptable (Subjects on Xolair® must have been on Xolair for greater than 1&#xD;
                  year).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Asthma confirmed by: (a) b-agonist reversibility of FEV1 ≥ 12 % following 360mcg&#xD;
             albuterol OR (b) methacholine FEV1 PC20 ≤ 8 mg/ml if not receiving an ICS or ≤ 16&#xD;
             mg/ml if receiving an ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. FEV1 ≥ 50% predicted pre-bronchodilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Asthma symptoms on at least two days or one night per week over the last 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is a non-smoker for 1 year or greater (if former smoker, less than 10 pack&#xD;
             years total smoking history).&#xD;

             or urgent health care visit for asthma) during the prior four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has 3 or more hospitalizations for exacerbations of asthma in the previous&#xD;
             year or 1 or more ICU admission for asthma in the previous year.&#xD;

             specific IgE to aspergillus and evidence of central bronchiectasis) that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator would prevent participation in the trial or put the&#xD;
             participant at risk by participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has segmental atelectasis, lobar consolidation, significant or unstable&#xD;
             pulmonary infiltrate, or pneumothorax, confirmed on x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infarction, angina, cardiac dysrhythmia, conduction defect, cardiomyopathy, aortic&#xD;
             aneurysm, or stroke.&#xD;

             pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject uses an internal or external pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Chronic diseases (other than asthma) that in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             prevent participation in the trial or put the participant at risk by participation,&#xD;
             e.g. chronic diseases of the lung (other than asthma), heart, liver, kidney, or&#xD;
             nervous system, or immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of cigarette smoking with &gt; 10 pack years total&#xD;
