  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective evaluation of children with Severe Combined Immune Deficiency&#xD;
      (SCID) who are treated under a variety of protocols used by participating institutions. In&#xD;
      order to determine the patient, recipient and transplant-related variables that are most&#xD;
      important in determining outcome, study investigators will uniformly collect pre-, post- and&#xD;
      peri-transplant (or other treatment) information on all children enrolled into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be divided into three strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum A: Typical SCID with virtual absence of autologous T cells and poor T cell&#xD;
           function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum B: Atypical SCID (leaky SCID, Omenn syndrome and reticular dysgenesis with&#xD;
           limited T cell diversity or number and reduced function), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratum C: ADA deficient SCID and XSCID patients receiving alternative therapy including&#xD;
           PEG-ADA ERT or gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Group/Cohort Stratum will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study follows participants with SCID prospectively, meaning the study enrolls&#xD;
      participants where there is a plan to receive a blood and marrow transplant, enzyme therapy,&#xD;
      or gene therapy in the future. Participants are then followed according to a schedule set out&#xD;
      by the study protocol after the procedure. There are no experimental therapies on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to learn more about: (1) outcomes from the treatment of SCID in the&#xD;
      modern era of medicine (2) what factors lead to the best long-term outcomes, such as best&#xD;
      donor, conditioning regimen, timing of transplant, etc., and (3) what impact newborn&#xD;
      screening and the early diagnosis of SCID has had on the long-term outcomes following BMT or&#xD;
      gene therapy. Information is also being gathered on how and when the immune system recovers&#xD;
      after bone marrow transplant (BMT), quality of life for long-term survivors, and about&#xD;
      whether children develop normally after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This natural history study is the largest coordinated prospective study of participants with&#xD;
      SCID ever performed. Information that investigators will learn, both now and in the future,&#xD;
      will help doctors and other health professionals to better treat children with SCID.&#xD;

    <description>Infant development as measured by Bayley's scales for infant development 3rd edition (BSID-III-R, Bayley, 2006).] The BSID III-R is a standardized developmental exam that is normalized to the age of the child in months. The mean adjusted score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15 (higher being better). Evaluation conducted as per standard of care in participants ≤30 months of age.</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Development By Stratum Measured by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Vineland II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-SCID Treatment-HCT, ERT or GT),Year 1, Year 2, Year 4, Year 5 and Year 8 Post-SCID Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland II measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. Since adaptive behavior refers to an individual's typical performance of the day-to-day activities required for personal and social sufficiency, these scales assess what a person actually does, rather than what he or she is able to do.&#xD;
Summary: The Vineland II is a measure of adaptive behavior in children, adolescents and adults. It yields an overall standard score (Adaptive Behavior Composite, ABC) and age standard scores in four domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Motor Skills, and Maladaptive Behaviour Index.&#xD;
ABC scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (range = 20 to 160). Higher scores suggest a higher level of adaptive functioning. A rise in standard scores from Baseline indicates improvement.&#xD;
Evaluation as per standard of care.</description>

    <description>Cognitive ability assessed using the WPPSI III. The WPPSI-III has been developed and standardized for children ages 2 years, 6 months through 7 years, 3 months of age. The WPPSI-III yields a Verbal Score, a Performance Score, a General Language Score, and a Full Scale Score. These scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The range of possible values is 50 (worst value) to 150 (best value).&#xD;
Evaluation as per standard of care.</description>

    <description>The WISC-IV is designed for children 6 years 0 months to 16 years 11 months. The Full Scale IQ, ranges from 45 to 155 with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Higher scores indicate stronger cognitive function. Scores between 90 and 110 are considered to be within the range of average IQ. Evaluation in accordance with standard of care, participant ages 6 years and above.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-SCID Treatment-HCT, ERT or GT) to Year 1, Year 2, Year 4, Year 5 and Year 8 Post-SCID Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Peds-QL is a generic Health-Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) instrument designed specifically for a pediatric population. It captures the following domains: general health/activities, feelings/emotional, social functioning, school functioning. Higher scores indicate better quality of life (QOL) for all domains of the Peds-QL. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. 4 dimensions (physical, emotional, social, &amp; school functioning) are scored.</description>
