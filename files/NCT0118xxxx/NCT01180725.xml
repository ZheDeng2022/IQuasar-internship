      Background: Constipation is a common problem that affects nearly 60 million Americans. The&#xD;
      treatment of constipation remains challenging with one half of patients dissatisfied with&#xD;
      current therapy. There is a need for a food-based, natural, convenient and tasty alternative&#xD;
      to the currently available OTC laxatives and fiber supplements, particularly for patients&#xD;
      with occasional and mild constipation. Dried plums and prune juice have been traditionally&#xD;
      used for the treatment of constipation but has not been systematically assessed in patients&#xD;
      with well defined constipation. Also, the efficacy, palatability and tolerability of dried&#xD;
      plums in the treatment of chronic constipation have not been examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate and compare the effects of dried plums and psyllium on the overall relief&#xD;
      of constipation symptoms, taste and quality of life in adults with functional constipation in&#xD;
      a randomized crossover controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We propose to study 40 subjects with functional constipation in a single blinded,&#xD;
      randomized, cross-over study comparing 3 weeks of dried plums with 3 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      Psyllium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The primary outcome measure will be the global relief of constipation symptoms&#xD;
      as rated by the subject at the end of each phase of the study. Additionally, we will assess&#xD;
      several secondary outcome measures that will include the number of Complete Spontaneous Bowel&#xD;
      Movements (CSBM) per week, Quality of Life , psychological profile, patient rating of taste&#xD;
      on a VAS scale, patient rating of bloating, distension, satiety and fullness and patient&#xD;
      rating of constipation-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results: We anticipate that treatment with dried plums will improve symptoms of&#xD;
      constipation compared to the baseline. This improvement will be comparable to that achieved&#xD;
      with psyllium (Metamucil) treatment. Additionally, dried plums will offer a natural, food&#xD;
      based, convenient and more tasty alternative to over-the-counter laxatives and fiber&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Constipation as defined by Rome III criteria (3,4). Patients must have symptoms for &gt;&#xD;
             3 days/month for the past three months and report at least two of the following&#xD;
             symptoms â‰¥ 25% of the time: straining, lumpy or hard stool, sensation of incomplete&#xD;
             evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage, use of manual maneuvers, &lt; 3&#xD;
             bowel movements/week. Also, they should have insufficient criteria for IBS, and only&#xD;
             rarely experience loose stools without the use of laxatives&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Adults between the ages of 18-75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients taking drugs that are known to be constipating will be excluded or asked to&#xD;
             discontinue medications for at least 2 weeks and reassessed. For example, we will&#xD;
             recommend that patients taking calcium channel antagonists contact their respective&#xD;
             primary care physicians to explore alternative medications for hypertension such as&#xD;
             beta blockers or ACE-inhibitors. If the calcium channel antagonists can to be&#xD;
             discontinued, patients will be re-screened at least two weeks after the medications&#xD;
             are discontinued. If patients no longer meet inclusion criteria, they will be excluded&#xD;
             from the study. Patients who remain constipated will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with co-morbid illnesses such as severe cardiovascular disease, chronic renal&#xD;
             failure, or those with previous gastrointestinal surgery except cholecystectomy and&#xD;
             appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, strokes, spinal cord&#xD;
             injuries, and those who have problems with cognizance, i.e. a mini-mental score of &lt;15&#xD;
             and/or are legally blind will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with Hirschsprung' s disease, or active local anorectal problems such as anal&#xD;
             fissures, bleeding hemorrhoids, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with alternating constipation and diarrhea and those who fulfill the Rome-III&#xD;
             criteria for irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients using fiber supplements, laxatives, PEG, Tegaserod or Lubiprostone and&#xD;
             unwilling to discontinue these medications at least 2 weeks prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a known allergy to psyllium or plums.&#xD;
