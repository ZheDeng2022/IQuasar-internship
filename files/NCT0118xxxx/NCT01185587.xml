      The purpose of this research is to see if investigators can detect truncated mRNA splice&#xD;
      variants of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel gene, SCN5A, in patients with a&#xD;
      weak heart (Heart Failure) with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
      and compare them to patients with a normal heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction have increased abundances&#xD;
           truncated mRNA splice variants of the SCN5A gene, which portends to sodium channel&#xD;
           dysfunction and an increased risk for sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices (ICDs) who have experienced&#xD;
           shock therapy have increased abundances of truncated mRNA splice variants of the SCN5A&#xD;
           gene compared to similar congestive heart failure patients who have not experienced&#xD;
           shock therapy.&#xD;

      Scientific Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) represents a major health care concern in the United States.&#xD;
      It has been estimated that approximately 5 million patients in the U.S. have CHF, and nearly&#xD;
      550,000 people are diagnosed with this disease annually.1 It is known that sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death occurs more frequently in the setting of structural heart disease. Moreover, the risk&#xD;
      for sudden cardiac death is 6 to 9 times greater in the heart failure population, and cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias are perhaps the leading cause of death in CHF patients. 2,3 Currently, both the&#xD;
      American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association endorse the placement of&#xD;
      internal cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      reasonable life expectancy, and reduced ejection fraction below 40% (class I, level of&#xD;
      evidence A).4 Additionally, placement of ICDs is recommended in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      patients who meet similar requirements with an ejection fraction of less than 35% (class I,&#xD;
      level of evidence B).4 Despite these recommendations for primary prevention of sudden death&#xD;
      by way of ICD implantation, more than half of the patients receiving a device are likely to&#xD;
      not experience an arrhythmic event that necessitates ICD shock delivery.3 ICD devices, on&#xD;
      average, cost $20-50,000 exclusive of operative and follow up costs. Currently, risk&#xD;
      stratification of sudden cardiac death and the need for ICD placement is essentially&#xD;
      dependent upon assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Other methods employed for&#xD;
      risk stratification are signal averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and another&#xD;
      electrocardiographic technique known as T-wave alternans. Although these methods are FDA&#xD;
      approved from risk prediction of cardiac death, such techniques are not widely employed in&#xD;
      the U.S. given equipment and personnel costs to implement them. Thus, alternative testing for&#xD;
      risk assessment for the development of sudden cardiac death in the heart failure population&#xD;
      is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Sodium Channels and the SCN5A Gene:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiac voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channel, SCN5A, is the main channel generating current&#xD;
      for electrical propagation in heart muscle and is the target of many antiarrhythmic drugs.&#xD;
      Defective expression of the cardiac Na+ channel results in increased arrhythmic risk as&#xD;
      evidenced by sudden death in the Brugada Syndrome.5 SCN5A mutations have also been implicated&#xD;
      in the inherited long-QT syndrome, which can result in the development of the fatal&#xD;
      dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes.6 Additionally, mutations&#xD;
      in the SCN5A gene have also been proposed to exist and enhance risk for drug-induced&#xD;
      dysrhythmias.7 Many studies have been done to shed light on the role of this&#xD;
      tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium channel in disease states. It has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      mutated sodium channels in dilated cardiomyopathy may function differently depending upon the&#xD;
      specific mutation type of the principal Na+ channel alpha-subunit.8 Specifically, Nguyen et&#xD;
      al have demonstrated that these mutations may lead to changes in physiological function such&#xD;
      as slower action potential rise time, enhanced late sodium current during steady state, or&#xD;
      impaired inactivation.8 Additional mutations in the SCN5A gene have been linked to shifts in&#xD;
      voltage dependence of Na+ channel inactivation in patients with idiopathic ventricular&#xD;
      fibrillation.9 Additional research has concluded that decreased inactivation of late sodium&#xD;
      currents may contribute to action potential prolongation.10 A different SCN5A gene&#xD;
      abnormality, the E161K mutation, has been shown to lead to decreased sodium current density&#xD;
      and a an 11.9 mV positive shift in the cell membrane half-maximal activation potential.11&#xD;
      Therefore, mutations of the Na+ channel can cause altered channel behavior and arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Valdivia et al. demonstrated that peak sodium current density is reduced 39% in the dog&#xD;
      model, and approximately 57% in explanted failing human hearts, although the mechanism is&#xD;
      unclear.10 Though our understanding of electrophysiological changes in heart failure and&#xD;
      their relationship to arrhythmogenesis remains unclear, it can be inferred that disruptions&#xD;
      in sodium handling - and perhaps increased intracellular sodium - may also result in change&#xD;
      in calcium homeostasis via action of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.12,13 Overall, such changes in&#xD;
      INa are likely to significantly contribute to arrhythmia in the setting of failing&#xD;
      myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the genome level, research has focused on the role of SCN5A gene mutations in&#xD;
      arrhythmogenesis.8,9,14-16 Nevertheless, we have recently described acquired defects in Na+&#xD;
      channel messenger RNA (mRNA) that result in reduced Na+ current and occur only in failing&#xD;
      hearts. Three 3'-terminal SCN5A mRNA splicing variants were identified and characterized in&#xD;
      failing human heart ventricles. These splice variants were predicted to result in the&#xD;
      translation of nonfunctional sodium ion channels that lack an appropriate domain IV pore&#xD;
      region. These three splicing variants for the nonfunctional sodium channel gene product were&#xD;
      denoted E28B, E28C, and E28D. Relative levels of the full length mRNA isoform, E28A, were&#xD;
      decreased by 24.7% in patients with CHF compared to control. Additionally, two truncated&#xD;
      versions of the gene product were increased in heart failure patients, reflecting an acquired&#xD;
      genetic abnormality in production of the SCN5A gene in heart failure. At the same time, the&#xD;
      E28C and E28D mRNA abundances were increased 14.2 fold and 3.8 fold respectively in CHF&#xD;
      patients compared to controls. In order to confirm that truncation variants could contribute&#xD;
      to arrhythmic risk, a gene-target mouse model was created with a nonsense mutation at exon&#xD;
      28. The electrophysiological effect of the presence of this gene truncation was also&#xD;
      examined. It was found that action potential rate of rise was reduced (p=0.02, n=11), and the&#xD;
      action potential amplitude was reduced from 76 ± 1.4 mV to 52 ± 0.6mV (p≤0.01, n=11).&#xD;
      Integrated effect of this truncation was studied by examining bipolar field potentials (FP)&#xD;
      of cardiomyocytes on microelectrode arrays.17 A 70.5% reduction (p&lt;0.05) from -1126 ± 314 μV&#xD;
      (n=6) in WT to 332 ± 174 micro V (n=7) in FP amplitude was observed. Additional measurements&#xD;
      done by this method revealed a delay in FP rise and slowed conduction velocity in the mutant&#xD;
      cells versus normal controls, suggesting that the truncation mutants could cause electrical&#xD;
      abnormalities severe enough to contribute to arrhythmic risk. Also, we showed that&#xD;
      lymphocytes process sodium channels similarly to cardiomyocytes. Thus, lymphocyte SCN5A mRNA&#xD;
      processing may serve as a surrogate marker to assess SCN5A at the cardiac level and may&#xD;
      correlated with arrhythmic risk in high risk populations. This study will assess that&#xD;
      assertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims/Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the abundances of SCN5A mRNA splice variants in patients with CHF and baseline&#xD;
      ejection fractions less than 35% versus normal controls of similar age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the abundances of SCN5A mRNA splice variants in patients with ICD devices who have&#xD;
      and have not experienced ICD shock therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance Sites of Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Illinois Medical Center and Jesse Brown VA Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Research Personnel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator for this study will be Dr. Samuel Dudley, MD, PhD. Dr. Dudley is&#xD;
      the Chief of the Section of Cardiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He is a&#xD;
      Professor of Medicine and a published author in the field of cardiovascular medicine and&#xD;
      physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim 1: We will correlate the amount of white cell Na+ channel splice variants with&#xD;
      ejection fraction in patients with an without heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Aim 2: We will correlate the amount of white cell Na+ channel splice variants with&#xD;
      the number of appropriate ICD shock in patients with ICDs in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires no change in the standard of care. All study participants will be&#xD;
      subjected to phlebotomy at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection and Processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 15 ML of blood will be drawn from study participants from University of Illinois at&#xD;
      Chicago (UIC) or Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center (JBVAMC) who have given informed&#xD;
      consent for phlebotomy and study participation. Samples will be delivered immediately by&#xD;
      study staff (coordinator, CO-PI, etc) to Dr. Dudley's (PI) lab in Room 1133 of the Clinical&#xD;
      Sciences Building (CSB) for processing within 2 hours of collection. Levels of mRNA will be&#xD;
      measured and some of the processed sample may be stored in a -80° F freezer in the same Lab&#xD;
      for up to 7 years. Samples will NOT be stored or processed at JBVAMC or any other facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship of Na+ channel mRNA variant abundances will be compared in subjects with and&#xD;
      without heart failure and in subjects with and without ICD events. The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be the a comparison of mRNA variant abundances. Dependent variables will include heart&#xD;
      failure for aim 1 and number of shocks in aim 2. The number of patients need for each aim is&#xD;
      determined by the variance of the test, the mean difference expected, and some consideration&#xD;
      of the number of covariates that will need to analyzed in the regression analysis.&#xD;
      Previously, we showed that the least sensitive measure was a reduction in E28A abundance by&#xD;
      24%. If we assume that the same percentage reduction will happen in aims 1 and 2, then we&#xD;
      would need about 45 patients in each group to have a 90% power to detect this difference,&#xD;
      assuming a 10% loss rate due to technical errors in the assays. Therefore, we would need a&#xD;
      total of 180 patients for the total trial, 45 with heart failure, 45 controls, 45 ICD&#xD;
      patients with events, and 45 patients without events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables,&#xD;
      and frequencies for categorical variables. Differences in baseline characteristics between&#xD;
      the groups will be examined by use of Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests for categorical and&#xD;
      continuous variables, respectively. Because the number of ICD events recorded is a function&#xD;
      of the observation time, Poisson regression will be used to model any relationship. In this&#xD;
      model, the number of ICD events observed is assumed to be distributed following a Poisson&#xD;
      distribution. That is, for a given period of time, the probability that a certain number of&#xD;
      events has occurred is a function of the event rate multiplied by the duration of&#xD;
      observation. In order to estimate the effects of mRNA variants on the rate of event&#xD;
      occurrence, it is assumed that the event rate is log linear with respect to the predictors of&#xD;
      interest. Solving this equation gives rate ratios comparing the rate of event occurrence in&#xD;
      subjects with and without ICD events. Multiple expressions for the mRNA variant abundances&#xD;
      will be considered, such as the relative abundance of each variant individually, the&#xD;
      abundance of the individual variant as a function of the total Na+ channel mRNA, and the&#xD;
      ratio of the truncations to the full-length Na+ channel mRNA. The regression coefficient will&#xD;
      be estimated for the relationship between the dependent variable, ICD events, and the&#xD;
      independent variables as the log of the rate ratio estimates. Statistical significance will&#xD;
      be determined by using the likelihood ratio test. A p-value of 0.05 or less will be taken to&#xD;
      be statistically significant. Results will be reported as the risk ratio and its associated&#xD;
      95% confidence interval. In order to select variables to be included in the model, we will&#xD;
      consider, conservatively, those variables with a different distribution between the two&#xD;
      groups at a p&lt;0.20. The possibility of multicolinearity will be evaluated. Linear and&#xD;
      non-linear terms will be considered. Normality of the variable distributions will be tested&#xD;
      by a normal probability plot and by a Shapiro-Wilk test. While regression is fairly tolerant&#xD;
      of violations in this regard, transformations will be investigated as necessary.&#xD;
      Homoscedasticity will be evaluated by plot of residuals versus predicted values.&#xD;
      Discrimination of the model will be evaluated by an overall C index and validated by&#xD;
      bootstrap methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results and Pitfalls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not anticipate any complications with acquiring blood samples, analyzing mRNA variants,&#xD;
      or performing the statistics. Nevertheless, the major limitation to this trial is its&#xD;
      retrospective nature. Nevertheless, this data will be useful in the design of future&#xD;
      prospective trials.&#xD;
