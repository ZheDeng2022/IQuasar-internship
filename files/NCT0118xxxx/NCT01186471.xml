  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study in patients with stable schizophrenia will investigate the effect of nicotine on&#xD;
      arousal, cognitive task and social cognition after acute dose administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), three-way-crossover trial&#xD;
      (patients may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) in patients with&#xD;
      stable schizophrenia. The three-way-crossover treatment phase will consist of three blinded&#xD;
      treatment periods separated by a wash out period (the period allowed for the entire&#xD;
      administered drug to be eliminated from the body) of 2 to 7 days. The study duration for each&#xD;
      patient will be approximately 8 weeks. Each patient enrolled will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      Treatment A (1mg nicotine per dosing), Treatment B (2mg nicotine per dosing) or Treatment C&#xD;
      (placebo) during one of their treatment period. The study drug (nicotine or placebo) will be&#xD;
      administered three times daily on Day 1 of each treatment phase as a mouth spray, separated 2&#xD;
      to 3 hours from each other (i.e. 0h; and 2 to 3h; and 4 to 6h post first dosing). Three&#xD;
      different blocks of cognitive assessments will follow, one after each drug administration.&#xD;
      Safety evaluations include adverse event monitoring, vital signs and clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests. Each patient participating will receive 3 identical study drug administrations per&#xD;
      dosing day (2 to 3 hours from each other), resulting in an overall dose of 3 mg nicotine&#xD;
      (Treatment A), 6 mg nicotine (Treatment B) or 0 mg nicotine (Treatment C) per dosing day. By&#xD;
      the end of the study, after the 3-way crossover, each patient will have received 9 mg&#xD;
      nicotine via mouth spray.&#xD;

             least 2 months with antipsychotic therapy (treatment with more than 1 antipsychotic&#xD;
             drug is acceptable provided dose levels have been stable for &gt; 2 months). Fluctuations&#xD;
             in dose levels of the primary antipsychotic treatment are acceptable provided the dose&#xD;
             levels remain constant as from 2 weeks prior to dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known (by the site) disease history of at least 12 months&#xD;

             significant treatment changes were required in the past 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
