  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the experiences of parents, clinician researchers,&#xD;
      and industry professionals who were involved in phase II clinical trials of Ataluren for&#xD;
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We are especially interested in learning about motivations for&#xD;
      being involved in the clinical trial, expectations of the trial, the experience of the trial,&#xD;
      and relationships between the parents of children involved in the trial, the clinician&#xD;
      researchers, and PTC Therapeutics. In addition, we would like to learn more about whether and&#xD;
      how families and advocacy organizations experiences in following the progress of the drug,&#xD;
      encouraging the clinical trial, and supporting the phase II trials may have affected&#xD;
      participants thoughts and feelings about the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Some aspects of the traditional process for the development of new potential therapeutics for&#xD;
      rare disorders and the ensuing research on safety and efficacy are changing. This is due, in&#xD;
      part, to the increased ability of families, parents, individuals with rare disorders, and&#xD;
      advocacy organizations to access and control information, to provide monetary or other&#xD;
      incentives, and to communicate directly with biopharmaceutical companies and clinical&#xD;
      investigators. Increasingly, advocacy organizations (and by extension, the families they&#xD;
      serve) create or participate in disorder registries intended to facilitate research by&#xD;
      industry and access of families to clinical trials; fund promising bench and clinical&#xD;
      research; and lobby for outcomes beneficial to drug developers and researchers, such as&#xD;
      increased funding or facilitated FDA approval. The involvement of families in the research&#xD;
      process is likely to have implications for how willing individuals are to participate in&#xD;
      studies, their expectations and perceptions of the study experience, and their behavior&#xD;
      during the study. Their increased level of involvement may also affect how families perceive&#xD;
      and respond to a clinical trial in which the results are not as promising as hoped, as&#xD;
      quickly as hoped. This partnership approach has implications for biopharmaceutical companies&#xD;
      who sponsor treatment trials and for clinical investigators who lead and implement the&#xD;
      trials. This qualitative interview study aims to describe, from the perspectives of parents&#xD;
      of children involved in a clinical trial, research clinicians implementing the trial, and the&#xD;
      company sponsoring the trial, the experience of this new, more collaborative research&#xD;
      process. In this case, we will examine the Ataluren trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.&#xD;
      The results from this study are hypothesis-generating for downstream research and can inform&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical companies and clinician researchers as they plan and implement clinical&#xD;
      trials for rare disorders and help guide advocacy groups and parent advocates as they partner&#xD;
      with researchers and industry.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  US residents over 18 years of age who have at least one child with Duchenne Muscular&#xD;
             Dystrophy who was enrolled in the phase IIa extension trial or phase IIb trial of&#xD;
             PTC124. Participants must be a primary caregiver for their children, must have been&#xD;
             involved in deciding whether the child would participate in the clinical trial, and&#xD;
             must have accompanied their child to at least one visit to the clinical trial site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinician researchers over 18 years of age who were involved with implementing the&#xD;
             clinical trial at a study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Representatives of PTC Therapeutics over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must be willing and able to complete an approximately 1-hour long&#xD;
        telephone interview in English.&#xD;
