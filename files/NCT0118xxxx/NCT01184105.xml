      A phase I, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study to evaluate systemic and local vaginal exposure to lidocaine and&#xD;
      prilocaine and the metabolites, 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA) and o-toluidine, in female&#xD;
      healthy volunteer subjects following daily application of 60 mg PSD502 or placebo to the&#xD;
      vagina and cervix for seven days&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug is a metered-dose anesthetic spray, which is being developed for the treatment&#xD;
      of premature ejaculation (PE). The use of anesthetic in topical creams has been well&#xD;
      established. The use of a cream does not result in the concentrated drug being in direct&#xD;
      contact with the cells, unlike the spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven clinical studies have already been carried out for the spray in the development of PE.&#xD;
      These studies have demonstrated a prolongation of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and&#xD;
      no safety concerns for male patients or their female partners. The partners of clinical study&#xD;
      participants have been asked to report health changes during the studies. Reports of vaginal&#xD;
      numbness were uncommon; however, effects of the transfer to a partner cannot be excluded.&#xD;
      This study is being conducted to investigate in detail the systemic exposure to PSD502 spray&#xD;
      in order to assess safety in the female partner. The dose level has been chosen because the&#xD;
      total dose applied to the male glans penis is 30 mg, and thus it is potentially possible that&#xD;
      his partner could be exposed to this dose. Therefore, the 60 mg dose was chosen to provide&#xD;
      safety information with a higher margin of exposure.&#xD;

          -  Negative Papanicolaou (Pap) smear performed during gynecological examination at&#xD;
             screening (i.e., Pap smear result that reads negative for any intraepithelial lesions&#xD;
             and reparative or reactive changes and with no sign or presence of infection [e.g.,&#xD;
             bacterial vaginosis, candida, bacterial flora, etc])&#xD;

             the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant abnormality of the vaginal mucosa or cervix that would preclude&#xD;
             interpretation of the examination of these areas or that could be worsened by use of&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Uro-gynecological disease or recent genito-urinary surgery within 8 weeks of&#xD;
