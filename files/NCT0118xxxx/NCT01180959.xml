      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of AvastinTM&#xD;
      (bevacizumab) and Tarceva (erlotinib hydrochloride) can help to control advanced liver&#xD;
      cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary&#xD;
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface&#xD;
      of many tumor cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from&#xD;
      growing. There is a commercially available form of the drug (called Tarceva) that is expected&#xD;
      to be very similar to the erlotinib being used for this study, but it is possible that there&#xD;
      may be some differences between the 2 formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs&#xD;
      during 28-day &quot;study cycles.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive bevacizumab by vein on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle. The first dose of&#xD;
      bevacizumab will be given over about 90 minutes. If you do not have a reaction to the drug,&#xD;
      such as fever and/or chills, the next dose will be given over about 60 minutes. If you still&#xD;
      have no reaction after the second dose, each dose after that will be given over about 30&#xD;
      minutes. If you experience a reaction to the bevacizumab, you may be given Tylenol®&#xD;
      (acetaminophen) by mouth and/or an antihistamine by vein over 30 minutes before each dose to&#xD;
      help minimize the risk of further reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take 1 erlotinib hydrochloride tablet by mouth every day. You should take erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride in the morning with a full glass of water (6-8oz) at least 1 hour before or 2&#xD;
      hours after any food, grapefruit juice, vitamins, iron supplements, or other non-prescription&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests and to check how well&#xD;
           the blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine testing. A 24-hour urine sample may be collected if&#xD;
           needed. If a 24-hour urine sample is needed, you will be provided with a special&#xD;
           container to collect the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about any side effects you may have had and about any drugs&#xD;
           you may be currently taking or have taken since you last saw the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurements of weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 2 and beyond, your vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 2, 4, and every 2 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 8, 10, and so on):&#xD;
&#xD;
      °You will have CT/MRI scans of the abdomen and pelvis and chest scan (if the doctor thinks&#xD;
      they are needed) to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional tests may be done during the study if the study doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive bevacizumab and erlotinib hydrochloride for as long as you are benefitting.&#xD;
      There is no maximum number of cycles that you can receive. If you experience severe side&#xD;
      effects, the treatment on this study may be delayed, stopped, or the study doctor may give&#xD;
      you smaller doses of the study drugs. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse,&#xD;
      the side effects are too severe, or your doctor thinks that it is in your best interest to&#xD;
      stop receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop receiving all of the study drugs, you will return for an end-of-treatment&#xD;
      visit. At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to learn&#xD;
           how well the blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about any side effects you may have had and about any drugs&#xD;
           you may be currently taking or have taken since you last saw the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurements of weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT and/or MRI scans of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end-of-treatment visit, the study doctor will continue to review your medical&#xD;
      records every 3 months until the study analysis is complete. You will also be called every 3&#xD;
      months for as long as the study doctor thinks is needed. During these phone calls, you will&#xD;
      be asked about how you are doing and if you are experiencing any health problems. The phone&#xD;
      call should take about 15 minutes. During the follow-up period, if the study doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is necessary, you may be asked to come in for a clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of metastatic colon and rectal cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride is FDA approved&#xD;
      and commercially available for the treatment of lung cancer. The use of this drug combination&#xD;
      in patients with advanced liver cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 44 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             otherwise eligible for this trial, are allowed to have an appropriately prolonged&#xD;
             International Normalized Ratio (INR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Negative serum pregnancy test in women with childbearing potential (those who are not&#xD;
             surgically sterilized or who are not amenorrheic for &gt;/= 12 months), within one week&#xD;
             prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use effective means of&#xD;
