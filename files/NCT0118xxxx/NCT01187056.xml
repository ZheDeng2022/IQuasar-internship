  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General practitioners (GPs) and patients find it difficult to talk about risk of future&#xD;
      disease, especially when patients have asymptomatic conditions, and treatment options are&#xD;
      unlikely to cause immediate perceptible improvements in well-being. Further studies in risk&#xD;
      communication for disease prevention are needed, as are studies about risk communication&#xD;
      training for GPs. Aim: 1) to systematically develop, describe and evaluate a complex&#xD;
      intervention comprising a training programme for GPs in risk communication and shared&#xD;
      decision-making, 2) to evaluate the effect of the training programme on real-life&#xD;
      consultations between GPs and patients with high cholesterol levels, and 3) to evaluate&#xD;
      patients' reactions during and after the consultations. Hypothesis: 1) patients have better&#xD;
      adherence to chosen treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the complex intervention, based around a training programme, will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a cluster-randomised controlled trial with an intervention group and an active control&#xD;
      group with 40 GPs and 280 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPs receive a questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months about their attitudes towards&#xD;
      risk communication and cholesterol-reducing medication. After each consultation with a&#xD;
      participating high cholesterol-patient, the GPs will complete a questionnaire about decision&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive a questionnaire at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. It includes&#xD;
      questions about adherence to chosen treatment, self-rated health, patient enablement, and&#xD;
      risk communication and decision-making effectiveness. Prescriptions, contacts to the health&#xD;
      services, and cholesterol level will be drawn from the register of the National Health&#xD;
      Service of Denmark at baseline and at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both intervention group and active control group, 12 consultations will be observed and&#xD;
      tape-recorded. The consultations will be divided between 4 GPs with each 3 patients. The&#xD;
      patients from these 24 consultations will be interviewed immediately after the consultation&#xD;
      and re-interviewed after 6 months.Eight purposefully selected GPs from the intervention group&#xD;
      will be interviewed in a focus group 6 months after participation in the training programme.&#xD;
      The process and context of the RISAP-study will be investigated in detail using an action&#xD;
      research approach, in order to describe and analyse research choices, adaptation of&#xD;
      intervention model to the specific context, and GPs' and patients' reactions to trial&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
