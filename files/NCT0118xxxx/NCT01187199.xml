    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of bevacizumab (Avastin) and temsirolimus (Torisel) that can be given with 1 of 3&#xD;
      other study drugs --carboplatin (Paraplatin), paclitaxel (Taxol), or sorafenib (Nexavar). The&#xD;
      safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may eventually cause the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin is designed to damage the DNA (the genetic material of cells)of cancer cells,&#xD;
      which may will eventually cause the cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is designed to damage the DNA of cancer cells, which may eventually cause the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer cells. These&#xD;
      proteins, when active, are in part responsible for the abnormal growth and behavior of cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide which&#xD;
      study drugs you will receive based on the disease type and on the drugs you have taken in the&#xD;
      past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will receive bevacizumab and temsirolimus. The study staff will tell you&#xD;
      which of the other 3 drugs (carboplatin, paclitaxel, or sorafenib) you will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it is decided which drugs you will receive, you will be assigned to a dose level of the&#xD;
      drug combination based on when you join this study. Three (3) to 6 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants on each drug combination will&#xD;
      receive the lowest doses. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it,&#xD;
      if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      of each dose combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your dose of study drugs may be lowered later, if you do not tolerate the study drug&#xD;
      combination well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose is found for each group, up to 10 more participants will be&#xD;
      added to each group at that dose level. This is called an extension group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is about 21 days or 28 days, depending on which study drug combination you&#xD;
      receive.If you experience side effects, the start of the next cycle may be delayed. Your&#xD;
      doctor will tell you on which dose level you will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SORAFENIB ARM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to take sorafenib, you will take it by mouth 1 or 2 times every day (the&#xD;
      study staff will tell you how often to take it). You should take sorafenib on an empty&#xD;
      stomach, either 1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein. The first infusion is over 90&#xD;
      minutes. The next infusion may be over 60 minutes if the first infusion was well-tolerated.&#xD;
      If you tolerate the second infusion well, the third infusion may be over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive temsirolimus by vein. During Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1, it&#xD;
      will be given over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and over 30 minutes in further&#xD;
      cycles, as long you still tolerate it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARBOPLATIN ARM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to take carboplatin,you will receive it by vein over 1 hour on Day 1 of&#xD;
      each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein. The first infusion is over 90&#xD;
      minutes. The next infusion may be over 60 minutes if the first infusion was well-tolerated.&#xD;
      If you tolerate the second infusion well, the third infusion may be over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive temsirolimus by vein. During Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1, it&#xD;
      will be given over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and over 30 minutes in further&#xD;
      cycles, as long you still tolerate it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACLITAXEL ARM DOSE LEVELS 1-8:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to take paclitaxel on Dose Levels 1 - 8, you will receive it by vein over&#xD;
      3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein. The first infusion is over 90&#xD;
      minutes. The next infusion may be over 60 minutes if the first infusion was well-tolerated.&#xD;
      If you tolerate the second infusion well, the third infusion may be over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive temsirolimus by vein. During Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1, it&#xD;
      will be given over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and over 30 minutes in further&#xD;
      cycles, as long you still tolerate it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACLITAXEL ARM DOSE LEVELS 9 - 13:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to take paclitaxel on Dose Levels 9 - 13, you will receive paclitaxel by&#xD;
      vein over 3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein. The first infusion is&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. The next infusion may be over 60 minutes if the first infusion was&#xD;
      well-tolerated. If you tolerate the second infusion well, the third infusion may be over 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle, you will receive temsirolimus by vein. During Day 1&#xD;
      of Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1,&#xD;
      it will be given over 30 minutes on Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 and over 30 minutes in&#xD;
      further cycles, as long you still tolerate it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, breathing rate, heart rate, and temperature).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status) on Days 1 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests on Days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including of your weight and vital signs..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Cycle 2, you will have a CT scan or MRI scan to check the status of the disease every&#xD;
      2-3 cycles. After 6 months, this may be performed up to every 4 cycles if the doctor thinks&#xD;
      it is in your best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for as long as the doctor thinks it is in you best interest. You will&#xD;
      be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab, temsirolimus, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and&#xD;
      sorafenib are all commercially available. Bevacizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and a type of lung cancer. Temsirolimus is FDA approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of kidney cancer that has spread. Carboplatin is FDA approved for the treatment of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. Paclitaxel is FDA approved for ovarian, breast cancer,&#xD;
      and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. It is also approved in combination with cisplatin for the&#xD;
      treatment of ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer. Sorafenib is FDA approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of these drugs together is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 278 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
