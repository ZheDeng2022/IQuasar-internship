      The primary safety objective of this study is to assess the safety of 10 mcg recombinant&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine in the Chinese health neonates. The primary immunogenicity objective is&#xD;
      to assess the antibody response following 3 doses immunization of the 10 mcg experimental&#xD;
      dose and 10 or 5 mcg control dose, Participants will include up to 1740 healthy neonates.&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase III study. This study is designed to investigate&#xD;
      the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 10ug recombinant hepatitis B vaccine&#xD;
      (yeast). Subjects will be stratified by the mother with positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg,&#xD;
      positive for the surface antigen but negative for HBeAg, negative for the HBsAg and HBeAg and&#xD;
      HBeAb and HBcAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified 1: There are 180 neonates born to the mother with positive for both HBsAg and&#xD;
           HBeAg will be randomized into two groups according to the ratio of 2:1. 120 subjects&#xD;
           will receive the 10 mcg experimental vaccine and 60 subjects will receive 10 mcg control&#xD;
           vaccine respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified 2: There are 360 neonates born to the mother with positive for HBsAg but&#xD;
           negative for HBeAg will be randomized into two groups according to the ratio of 2:1. 240&#xD;
           subjects will receive the 10 mcg experimental vaccine and 120 subjects will receive 10&#xD;
           mcg control vaccine respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratified 3: There are 1200 neonates born to the mother with negative for the HBsAg and&#xD;
           HBeAg and HBeAb and HBcAb will be randomized into 3 groups. 600 of them will receive the&#xD;
           10mcg experimental vaccine. 300 subjects will receive 10mcg control vaccine. And the&#xD;
           other 300 subjects will receive 5mcg control vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recombinant hepatitis B vaccine will be administered at m0, 1 and 6. Following each&#xD;
      immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events through 30 days&#xD;
      following each vaccination, serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical conditions&#xD;
      through 6 months post the final vaccination (Day 180 after last vaccination). For the&#xD;
      immunogenicity testing will apply the chemiluminescence immunoassay on serum obtained on the&#xD;
      day 0, 210 and 360 after born.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the early 1980s, human plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccines were developed in China.&#xD;
      The production of these vaccines has not been adequate to meet China's need. Since the&#xD;
      introduction of recombinant vaccines which can be produced in large quantity, at low cost,&#xD;
      the emphasis has been placed on a search for a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. This vaccine&#xD;
      is thought to be safe, immunogenic, particularly in infants born to carrier mothers. Since&#xD;
      1992, the 5mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been used as one of the vaccines in the&#xD;
      expanded immunization programs (People's Republic of China). The 5ug recombinant hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccine (yeast) is efficacious in short time but not to persistent in neonates. The primary&#xD;
      safety objective of this study is to assess the safety of 10 mcg recombinant hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccine in the chinese health neonates. The primary immunogenicity objective is to assess the&#xD;
      antibody response following 3 doses immunization of the 10 mcg experimental dose and 10, 5&#xD;
      mcg control dose, Participants will include up to 1740 healthy neonates.&#xD;

           other 300 subjects will receive 5mcg control vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these neonates will have the vaccination within 24 hours after born. The recombinant&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine will be administered at m0, 1 and 6. Following each immunization, safety&#xD;
      will be measured by assessment of adverse events through 30 days following each vaccination,&#xD;
      serious adverse events and new-onset chronic medical conditions through 6 months post the&#xD;
      final vaccination (Day 180 after last vaccination). For the immunogenicity testing will apply&#xD;
      the chemiluminescence immunoassay on serum obtained on the day 0, 210 and 360 after born.&#xD;
