      The purpose of this study was to measure the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in&#xD;
      eyes of Obstructive Sleep Apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) using optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT), and assess whether it is decreased. The investigators then compared the results with&#xD;
      healthy subjects database of RNFL thickness from another retrospective study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An association between glaucoma and OSAHS has been reported in several studies. Glaucoma is a&#xD;
      progressive optic neuropathy involving loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons at the&#xD;
      level of the optic nerve head.Computerized technologies have now been successfully used in&#xD;
      evaluating retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in glaucoma.Given the evidence of a&#xD;
      possible link between OSAHS and glaucoma, it is reasonable that structural losses in retinal&#xD;
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness would be present in OSAHS.Indeed,decreased retinal nerve&#xD;
      fiber layers was found in patients with OSAHS, the severity of which correlated with the&#xD;
      severity of the patients' OSAHS using scanning laser Polarimetry (SLP).Optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) provides quantitative RNFL thickness data by measuring the difference in the&#xD;
      temporal delay of back-scattered light from the RNFL and a reference mirror.During the past&#xD;
      decade, OCT has been used widely in clinical practice to discriminate glaucomatous eyes and&#xD;
      eyes with early perimetric glaucoma from normal eyes. Several studies confirmed the accuracy&#xD;
      and reproducibility of the RNFL thickness measurements by OCT. The thickness of the&#xD;
      peripapillary RNFL was measured with the Stratus OCT(Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin,CA)using&#xD;
      the fast scan protocol(3.4).Only good quality images, as judged by the well-focused and&#xD;
      centered scans,no artifacts showing distorted anatomy, no missing parts and a signal strength&#xD;
      â‰¥6, were used for further analysis. The considered OCT parameters were overall average RNFL&#xD;
      thickness and the average RNFL thickness in 4 quadrants (superior, nasal,inferior,and&#xD;
      temporal)extracted from the standard RNFL thickness analysis report(RNFL Thickness Average&#xD;
      Analysis Protocol).&#xD;
