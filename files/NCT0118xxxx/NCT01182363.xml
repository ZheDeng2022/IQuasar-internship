      This application to the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board outlines&#xD;
      a research plan devoted to identifying and managing maternal depression in Early Intervention&#xD;
      (EI). The target population is women who's children are enrolled in early intervention who&#xD;
      have experienced an adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as the birth of a child who was born&#xD;
      prematurely, low birth weight, or with birth defects. Early intervention provides&#xD;
      developmental services to the state's birth to three population under the Part C of the&#xD;
      Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). Our intervention strategy involves the&#xD;
      identification of mothers whose children receive early intervention services and who,&#xD;
      themselves, are at risk for depression. Eligible mothers will be offered a preventative&#xD;
      intervention that involves the principles of Problem Solving Treatment (PST). Problem Solving&#xD;
      Treatment is a brief skills-building psychotherapeutic intervention that focuses on specific&#xD;
      daily problems, and applies to these problems a structured approach to finding and evaluating&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a parallel group randomized control trial (RCT) of 188 mother-child dyads.&#xD;
      Mothers in the intervention group will receive 6 sessions of Problem Solving Treatment, which&#xD;
      will be referred to as Problem Solving Education (PSE) in this application. The women in the&#xD;
      control site will receive usual care. Problem Solving Education interventionists (Problem&#xD;
      Solving Educators or PS Educators) will conduct Problem Solving Education with mothers of&#xD;
      children who receive early intervention services through Thom Child and Family Services, Bay&#xD;
      Cove Early Intervention program, South Shore Mental Health (Step One Early Intervention), and&#xD;
      Meeting Street Early Intervention with an enrollment goal of 188 mothers. In addition to&#xD;
      engaging in Problem Solving Education sessions, mothers who agree to participate in the study&#xD;
      will meet with research staff to complete 1)baseline assessment measures at study enrollment&#xD;
      and 2) outcome assessment measures 3 months after baseline assessment and 3) outcome&#xD;
      assessment measures 6 months after baseline assessment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Community-based programs that target vulnerable families consistently identify maternal&#xD;
      depression as a factor that negatively impacts maternal and child outcomes. A population in&#xD;
      particular need of mental health interventions are mothers of children with who have&#xD;
      experienced an adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as the birth of a child who was born&#xD;
      prematurely, low birth weight, or with birth defects, a group with increased incidence of&#xD;
      depression. Children of depressed mothers are at risk for a vast range of poor physical,&#xD;
      cognitive, and emotional problems. Children who have existing underlying developmental&#xD;
      concerns due to adverse birth circumstances are especially vulnerable. Therefore, identifying&#xD;
      at-risk mothers and intervening to prevent the onset or re-occurrence of depression&#xD;
      represents an opportunity not only to help the women affected, but also to improve&#xD;
      developmental and behavioral outcomes for their children. Children under 3 with conditions&#xD;
      that impact their developmental trajectories receive services through federally mandated&#xD;
      Early Intervention (EI) programs; thus early intervention is an important, but underutilized,&#xD;
      setting for identification and intervention with at-risk mothers. While effective&#xD;
      preventative psychosocial treatments for depression exist, none have been delivered and&#xD;
      evaluated in the context of a home-based program specifically for mothers of infants and&#xD;
      children with developmental and other chronic health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographics of early intervention families suggest that mothers of enrolled children are&#xD;
      at risk for depressive illness. Families are poorer (1 in 4 received welfare payments in the&#xD;
      past year), mothers less well educated, and African-Americans are overrepresented (21% vs.&#xD;
      14% of general population), reflecting known risk factors for depression. Almost half of the&#xD;
      infants who enter early intervention in the first year of life, the target group for the&#xD;
      proposed intervention, are low birth weight (LBW) and have significantly higher levels of&#xD;
      demographic risk factors than their normal birth weight peers. Numerous studies have&#xD;
      documented elevated incidence of depression among mothers of early born infants. The youngest&#xD;
      early intervention enrollees are also more likely to have identified disabilities or&#xD;
      conditions, such as cerebral palsy and requirements for assistive technologies that have also&#xD;
      been associated with higher rates of maternal depressive symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strong problem-solving abilities serve as important buffers against the negative impact of&#xD;
      life stressors; whereas limited problem solving skills have been linked to the cause and&#xD;
      persistence of psychological disorders. Problem solving approaches to depression prevention&#xD;
      and treatment are rooted in research that has demonstrated that minor life events or problems&#xD;
      are highly correlated with psychological distress, in general, and with depression,&#xD;
      specifically. Problem solving interventions that promote skill building have demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing behavioral risk, including depression, in a number of settings.&#xD;
      Problem solving education (PSE), a brief skills-building psychotherapeutic intervention that&#xD;
      focuses on specific daily problems, and applies to these problems a structured approach to&#xD;
      finding and evaluating solutions, is one such problem solving approach. Problem solving&#xD;
      education differs from other problem solving interventions in that it can be conducted by a&#xD;
      variety of health providers, who do not have specific training as mental health clinicians.&#xD;
      Sessions are fairly brief (approximately 30 minutes in length) and positive, sustained&#xD;
      effects have been achieved in 6-8 sessions. Problem solving education's success is based on&#xD;
      premise that strong problem solving abilities promote a sense of control and self-efficacy&#xD;
      and buffer the negative effects of life stressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of Problem solving education has been well documented in reducing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and increasing function among patients with major depression and possibly&#xD;
      minor depression and dysthymia. We propose a research plan that involves delivering Problem&#xD;
      solving education to at risk mothers to (i) directly reduce symptom burden among mothers with&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, and (ii) facilitate access to further mental health services.&#xD;
