      Background The present study protocol describes the trial design of a primary care&#xD;
      intervention cohort study, which examines whether an extended, multi-professional physical&#xD;
      activity referral (PAR) intervention is more effective in enhancing and maintaining&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity than ordinary physical activity recommendations. The study&#xD;
      targets patients with newly diagnosed hypertension and/or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include: need of pharmacological therapy; blood pressure/plasma glucose;&#xD;
      physical fitness and anthropometric variables; mental health; health related quality of life;&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness. Methods/Design The study is designed as a long-term intervention.&#xD;
      Three primary care centres are involved in the study, each constituting one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups: 1) Intervention group (IG): multi-professional team intervention with PAR,&#xD;
      lifestyle brochure; 2) Control group A (CA): ordinary recommendations on health behaviours,&#xD;
      lifestyle brochure; and 3) Control group B: treatment as usual (retrospective data&#xD;
      collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is based on self-determination theory and follows the principles of&#xD;
      motivational interviewing. Physical activity is measured with the International Physical&#xD;
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and expressed as metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes per&#xD;
      week. Physical fitness is estimated with the 6-minute walk test in IG only. Variables such as&#xD;
      health behaviours; health-related quality of life; motivation to change; mental health;&#xD;
      demographics and socioeconomic characteristics are assessed with an electronic study&#xD;
      questionnaire that submits all data to a patient database, which automatically provides&#xD;
      instant feed-back on the patients' health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated continuously and the intermediate&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 3 - outcomes of the intervention are extrapolated by economic modelling. The first&#xD;
      statistical analyses and compilation of results will be performed one year after inclusion of&#xD;
      the first patient or when the IG and CA have included 60 and 30 eligible patients&#xD;
      respectively. Discussion By helping patients to overcome practical, social and cultural&#xD;
      obstacles and increase their internal motivation for physical activity we aim to improve&#xD;
      their physical health in a long-term perspective. The targeted patients belong to a patient&#xD;
      category that is supposed to benefit from increased physical activity in terms of improved&#xD;
      physiological values, mental status and quality of life, decreased risk of complications and&#xD;
      maybe a decreased need of medication.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes or hypertension or both and consecutive&#xD;
        primary care patients with suspected type 2 diabetes or hypertension will be screened for&#xD;
        inclusion. The diagnose criterion for type 2 diabetes in both the Intervention and the&#xD;
        Control groups is defined as a 2 x fasting plasma glucose (fP-glu) ≥ 7.0 mmol/l according&#xD;
        to WHO guidelines [29]. The diagnose criterion for hypertension is defined as a resting&#xD;
        systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg. Hypertension is&#xD;
        confirmed by a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: a systolic blood pressure ≥&#xD;
        135 mmHg and/or a&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  13 - diastolic blood pressure ≥ 85 mmHg&#xD;
