  <brief_summary>

      Interactive telephony technologies offer a potentially highly effective, patient-centered&#xD;
      communication modality by guiding parents at home through interactive discussions that can&#xD;
      gather information and actively reinforce recommendations and treatments. Interactive&#xD;
      telephony systems are particularly well suited for use in vulnerable populations since access&#xD;
      to the telephone is nearly universal, and the system does not rely on reading printed text.&#xD;
      The investigators propose to develop and evaluate an integrated patient-centered health&#xD;
      information system, the Personal Health Partner (PHP). The PHP will use fully automated,&#xD;
      interactive, conversations to gather personal health data and counsel parents before&#xD;
      scheduled visits, exchange that data with the child's primary care clinician via the&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR), and offer personalized follow-up assessment and counseling&#xD;
      after visits. The information technology-based approach to be evaluated in this project will&#xD;
      link parents and children outside the clinical setting with their primary care center and&#xD;
      will offer comprehensive assessments AND counseling to reinforce and support parental&#xD;
      behavior change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large gap exists between what is recommended for effective primary care of children and&#xD;
      what actually takes place in pediatric primary care settings, especially in the areas of&#xD;
      preventive care. Furthermore, although medication management (safety and effectiveness)&#xD;
      issues have emerged as an important factor for children, little is known about how medication&#xD;
      is actually used by families at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With growing use of the electronic health record (EHR) come new opportunities to link&#xD;
      patient-centered information with clinical health information systems. Linkage of these&#xD;
      systems has the potential to inform and activate parents, provide much richer data to drive&#xD;
      decision support at the point-of-care, and to provide ongoing support for long-term behavior&#xD;
      change following primary care visits. The use of conversational technologies as the&#xD;
      foundation for the project offers a number of unique advantages especially the support of&#xD;
      lower-literacy populations and near-universal access. Systems like the Personal Health&#xD;
      Partner (PHP) represent a model for the future of ambulatory care and the sustainable,&#xD;
      affordable delivery of higher quality and safer care by primary care clinicians in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parents of children will be enrolled in the study if they meet a set of eligibility&#xD;
             criteria which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age 0 - 11 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A primary care patient at Boston Medical Center&#xD;
