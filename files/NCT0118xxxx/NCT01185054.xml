      The objective of this study is to clarify the current standard of care by determining if&#xD;
      Electrolyte Maintenance Solution (EMS) is truly the optimal fluid to be used in low-risk&#xD;
      children who present to an Emergency Department (ED) with &lt; 72 hours of vomiting or diarrhea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroenteritis remains a major cause of morbidity amongst Canadian children. The primary&#xD;
      treatment focus revolves around the use of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) to treat&#xD;
      dehydration and replace intravascular volume. Since diarrheal disease in Canadian children&#xD;
      usually results in mild dehydration and minimal sodium losses, the use of low sodium&#xD;
      Electrolyte Maintenance Solutions (EMS) has become the standard of care. However, given that&#xD;
      North American children infrequently develop severe dehydration, it is unclear if the routine&#xD;
      use of EMS is justified. When pediatricians directly dispense EMS, 16 children need to be&#xD;
      treated to prevent 1 unscheduled office visit, however the upper bound of the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval is an astounding 508 patients. In addition, EMS is considered by some to be&#xD;
      prohibitively expensive, with 15% of pediatricians believing it to be too expensive for their&#xD;
      patients to purchase. An additional 40% report that taste is a major barrier to consumption.&#xD;
      As a result, oral fluid replenishment is often underutilized and IV rehydration employed&#xD;
      instead. Our goal is to provide evidence to guide the selection of the optimal ORT fluids in&#xD;
      low-risk children, thus increasing its use, enhancing its success, and reducing the reliance&#xD;
      on intravenous rehydration. We hypothesize that the strict adherence to EMS use in low-risk&#xD;
      children may actually be counterproductive by resulting in reduced fluid intake and&#xD;
      potentially increasing the use of intravenous rehydration.&#xD;
