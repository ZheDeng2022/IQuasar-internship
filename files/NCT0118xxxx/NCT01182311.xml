      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing&#xD;
           transmission of the hepatitis B virus. Response rates to the initial three doses of the&#xD;
           vaccine are high, with significant or even complete immune response. However, this level&#xD;
           has been reported to decline rapidly within the first year and more slowly thereafter.&#xD;
           There is little data on the durability and long-term protection provided by the&#xD;
           hepatitis B vaccine administered to adults in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccinated individuals are believed to be protected against hepatitis B virus infection&#xD;
           because of a memory immune response. Even if antibody levels are low, the immune system&#xD;
           will still be able to produce enough antibody to neutralize the hepatitis B virus.&#xD;
           Therefore, booster doses of the vaccine are not recommended, except for some high-risk&#xD;
           individuals such as patients on dialysis. Researchers are interested in determining the&#xD;
           durability of the immune response of the hepatitis B vaccine in adults with low or&#xD;
           intermediate risk for hepatitis B virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine the long-term immune status of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and&#xD;
      negative individuals who received the hepatitis B vaccine during adulthood, compared with the&#xD;
      immune status of individuals who acquired natural immunity by recovering from acute hepatitis&#xD;
      B during adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who were vaccinated against hepatitis B at least 10&#xD;
           years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who contracted and recovered from acute hepatitis B&#xD;
           at least 10 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have well-controlled HIV and were vaccinated&#xD;
           against hepatitis B at least 10 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a single outpatient study visit and potential follow-up visits as&#xD;
           part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire assessing possible risk factors for hepatitis&#xD;
           B infection, and will provide blood samples to test for hepatitis B antibodies and other&#xD;
           immune system studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a letter or phone call with the results of the blood tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who no longer have protective levels of antibody against the hepatitis B virus&#xD;
           will be offered a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. To monitor immune response to&#xD;
           the booster vaccine, additional study visits will be scheduled at 1 and 3 weeks&#xD;
           following the booster.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus will be advised to follow up&#xD;
           with their primary care physician, and may be eligible to participate in ongoing&#xD;
           treatment trials for chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have abnormal blood tests will be referred back to their primary care&#xD;
           physician for investigation of the abnormal tests results, and may also be referred to&#xD;
           other National Institutes of Health protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional tests will evaluate immune response to the measles, mumps, and rubella&#xD;
           (German measles) viruses. Some participants may be advised to have an additional MMR&#xD;
           vaccine through their primary care physician.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B vaccine is very effective at preventing infection with the hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV). Several studies have reported on the long-term efficacy of the HBV vaccine and&#xD;
      indicate a decline in titers of antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) over&#xD;
      time. However, most of these studies were performed in persons vaccinated as infants or&#xD;
      children. This protocol is designed to examine the long-term immune status of HIV positive&#xD;
      and negative individuals who were vaccinated during adulthood, and to compare it to the&#xD;
      immune status of individuals who acquired natural immunity by recovering from acute hepatitis&#xD;
      B during adulthood. Individuals who lost the vaccine-induced humoral immune response, will be&#xD;
      offered a booster vaccination and their immune response to the booster vaccination will be&#xD;
      assessed. In this study, we will recruit 150 subjects who were vaccinated secondary to their&#xD;
      job-related risk of acquiring HBV infection. An additional 50 subjects who had spontaneously&#xD;
      recovered from acute hepatitis B (Bullet) 10 years ago, 50 patients with well-compensated HIV&#xD;
      infection who received HBV vaccine (Bullet) 10 years ago and 10 subjects who were never&#xD;
      vaccinated and never infected with the hepatitis B virus will be enrolled as comparison&#xD;
      groups. All subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their HBV exposure&#xD;
      risk as well as factors that may affect their immune response. Immunological assays include&#xD;
      the quantitation of HBV-specific antibodies and the qualitative and quantitative assessment&#xD;
      of HBV-specific memory B cells and T cells at the indicated time intervals after vaccination&#xD;
      or after recovery from acute hepatitis B. Additional immunological assays include testing for&#xD;
      antibody to measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) viruses to compare the longevity of&#xD;
      antibody response to these vaccines or natural infection to the antibody response to the&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine or natural infection. The results of this study will help to answer the&#xD;
      question whether a booster vaccination is required and at which time after the primary&#xD;
      vaccination course it should be considered.&#xD;
