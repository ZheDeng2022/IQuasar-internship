    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of the Sotera ViSi, an investigational&#xD;
      device, to standard devices in estimating the level of blood oxygen (SpO2) in adult human&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center blinded study that will enroll up to 15 adult subjects, male or&#xD;
      female, of any ethnic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2 and pulse rate measurements reported by ViSi will be compared with simultaneous&#xD;
      measurements of blood SaO2 and pulse rate made by an FDA-cleared CO-oximeter and pulse&#xD;
      oximeter, respectively. The paired measurements will be made in a well-controlled environment&#xD;
      under optimal laboratory conditions.&#xD;

        Healthy adult volunteers, male or female, of any ethnic background. To the extent possible&#xD;
        while still achieving timely enrollment, subjects should vary from one another in their&#xD;
        physical characteristics. Each subject must also meet all of the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria prior to study entry and give informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
