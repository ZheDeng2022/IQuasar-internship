      Tobacco-smoking causes lung function decline with airflow obstruction, which may be&#xD;
      accelerated in persistent smokers.This would eventually lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Hong Kong and globally. Lung&#xD;
      function decline is gradual and not appreciated by the smoker until damage is advanced, and&#xD;
      often under-recognised in the early stages of disease by healthcare providers. Spirometry is&#xD;
      an established lung function measurement tool, and the most simple objective method to detect&#xD;
      lung function decline. There is literature suggesting that newer spirometric parameters, FEV3&#xD;
      and FEV6, which are easier to achieve in the measurement process than conventional&#xD;
      parameters, are comparable alternatives in detecting lung function decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate and compare lung function decline in persistent smokers and non-smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to study the usefulness of FEV3/FVC and FEV1/FEV6 in detecting lung function decline&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to correlate symptom scores with lung function parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate serum biomarker levels with respiratory symptoms and lung function&#xD;
           parameters in smokers and non-smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a follow-up study on a territory wide cohort including smokers and non-smokers, who&#xD;
      have undergone lung function testing in 2001-03. Subjects will be invited to have repeat lung&#xD;
      function assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. smokers have significantly greater decline in lung function compared to non-smokers in&#xD;
           Hong Kong Chinese;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. newer lung function parameters are useful alternatives in detecting lung function&#xD;
           decline&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. serum inflammatory biomarker (IL-8, TGF-β, MMP9, TIMP-1, CRP) levels correlate with&#xD;
           respiratory symptoms and lung function parameters in smokers when compared with&#xD;
           non-smokers&#xD;

&#xD;
      This is a follow-up study on a territory wide cohort including smokers and non-smokers, who&#xD;
      have undergone lung function testing in 2001-03. Subjects will be invited to have repeat lung&#xD;
      function assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demonstration of excessive lung function decline in the local smoking population would&#xD;
      reinforce the anti-tobacco message in the community. Establishing the practical utility of&#xD;
      newer lung function parameters can help to disseminate their utilization for early objective&#xD;
      health information, which would provide incentives for healthcare professionals as well as&#xD;
      individual smokers in the pursuance of smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. smokers have significantly greater decline in lung function compared to non-smokers in&#xD;
           Hong Kong Chinese;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. newer lung function parameters are useful alternatives in detecting lung function&#xD;
           decline&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. serum inflammatory biomarker (IL-8, TGF-β, MMP9, TIMP-1, CRP) levels correlate with&#xD;
           respiratory symptoms and lung function parameters in smokers when compared with&#xD;
           non-smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects In 2001 - 2003, we conducted a multi-center study to recruit 1089 non-smokers for&#xD;
      establishing local reference lung function values, and 694 smokers for investigating the&#xD;
      diagnostic definition of airflow obstruction. The cohort was derived from a random population&#xD;
      sample and the characteristics of the two cohorts have been described in detail in previous&#xD;
      communications. All subjects will be invited to return for spirometry testing. We would&#xD;
      compare their lung function parameters 7 years ago with the repeat measurements obtained in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Subjects will be interviewed using a questionnaire based on the ATS Questionnaire for&#xD;
      Chronic Respiratory Symptoms. In addition, a detailed smoking history will be asked; for&#xD;
      those who have given up smoking in the interval between the previous study and this study,&#xD;
      the time of quitting will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Spirometry. Spirometry with bronchodilator testing will be performed according to the&#xD;
      ATS-ERS guidelines, using Sensormedics Vmax 229. All participating centers are experienced in&#xD;
      lung function testing. Quality control of the tests will be ensured by 1) standardization and&#xD;
      calibration of the equipments prior to commencement of study, 2) briefing session for all&#xD;
      involved technicians conducted by a senior technician, 3) technical quality of raw data will&#xD;
      be scrutinized by a respiratory specialist iii. Seum biomarkers Recruited subjects will be&#xD;
      invited to give 10 ml blood in the same lung function test session.&#xD;
