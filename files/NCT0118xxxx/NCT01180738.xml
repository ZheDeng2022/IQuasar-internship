  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different walking training programs for persons&#xD;
      with chronic stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and overground walking training (OWT) are&#xD;
      two interventions commonly applied for enhancing gait and balance in patients with chronic&#xD;
      stroke. BWSTT and OWT are often used by clinicians separately or in tandem. While various&#xD;
      aspects of the two interventions have been investigated in the past, limited research has&#xD;
      been conducted to compare the effects of the two interventions in patients with chronic&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longer training durations may not always be feasible due to limited reimbursement options,&#xD;
      lack of clinic accessibility, or transportation restrictions for patients with chronic&#xD;
      deficits following stroke. A short burst of training consisting of a ''booster''-like&#xD;
      protocol may provide a convenient option for some patients with chronic stroke to improve&#xD;
      necessary functional skills in a short period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to compare walking speed immediately and 3-months&#xD;
      after a short-burst of body-weight support treadmill training (BWSTT) or overground walking&#xD;
      training (OWT) for adults with chronic stroke. Twenty participants with chronic stroke will&#xD;
      be recruited and screened to determine eligibility for the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either BWSTT or OWT for 30 minutes, 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Outcome&#xD;
      measures will include assessments of gait speed, endurance, walking pattern, fear of falling,&#xD;
      balance confidence, anxiety, and activity and participation in daily life. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      tested prior to (pre-test) and immediately after (post-test) the assigned intervention and&#xD;
      again 3-months after completing the intervention (retention).&#xD;
