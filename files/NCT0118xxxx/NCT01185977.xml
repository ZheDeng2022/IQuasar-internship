  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to evaluate the use of Electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers in&#xD;
      adolescent depression. Two specific hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Early decreases in prefrontal cordance values will be greater in responders to&#xD;
      antidepressant therapy than in medication non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Subjects with high Antidepressant Treatment Response(ATR) Index values [i.e., predicted&#xD;
      to show symptomatic improvement with fluoxetine (FLX)] will achieve greater improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms and in functional status than those with low ATR values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will be undertaken to compare and contrast the cordance changes and ATR&#xD;
      values in medication and placebo-treated responders and non-responders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 26 adolescent subjects with Major Depressive Disorder(MDD), ages 12 to 20, will be&#xD;
      consented and join this project at UCLA. For analytic purposes, we will define an &quot;enrolled&quot;&#xD;
      subject as one who has completed the single-blind lead-in week and one week of double-blind&#xD;
      treatment, and the three EEG recordings at these visits, as any subject who leaves the&#xD;
      project prior to that point cannot contribute useful data to testing our hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who enroll in this project will receive 1 week of single-blind placebo lead-in,&#xD;
      followed by 8 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment either with fluoxetine (FLX), a&#xD;
      Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) with FDA approval for use in this age group, or&#xD;
      with placebo. Brain activity will be assessed with Qualitative EEG (QEEG) recording at&#xD;
      pretreatment baseline, after lead-in, and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment to expand the&#xD;
      evidence base on the neurophysiology of treatment response in adolescents. Subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed for symptom change, adverse events, and suicidality at each visit. Functional&#xD;
      measures related to treatment will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8. Subjects and&#xD;
      the staff who interact with them will be blinded to QEEG biomarker values during the project.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatients with non-psychotic, unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) based on the&#xD;
             K-SADS-PL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A score of ≥ 45 on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (same threshold as&#xD;
             TADS). As with the TADS trial, depressed mood must have been present in at least 2 of&#xD;
             3 contexts (home, school, among peers) for at least 6 weeks prior to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range: 14-18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suicidal ideation are eligible only if the thoughts of death or of life&#xD;
             not being worth living are not accompanied by a plan or intention for self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will have no unstable medical illness that would prevent completion of&#xD;
             participation in the trial (determined as needed from physical examination, ECG,&#xD;
             laboratory safety tests, as well as a review of systems). Other specific exclusionary&#xD;
             criteria also are based on the BRITE-MD parameters, and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. mentally or legally incapacitated, unable to give informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. meets DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
                  disorder, any cognitive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, or major&#xD;
                  depression with psychotic features;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) score ≤ 24;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. evidence of drug dependency or substance abuse within the preceding nine months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. stable and in remission on current psychotropic medication(s);&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. any ECT within the past six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. failure to tolerate FLX or treatment failure with an adequate trial of FLX in the&#xD;
                  current episode;&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. FLX would be contraindicated (e.g., hyponatremia with a prior SSRI);&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. treatment with an MAOI within the past four weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. any medical illness severe enough to significantly affect brain function or to&#xD;
                  interfere with interpretation of study results;&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. history of seizures, brain surgery, skull fracture, significant head trauma, or&#xD;
                  abnormal EEG;&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. psychiatric hospitalization indicated (e.g., imminent danger to self or others);&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. initial QEEG recording is contaminated with artifact so that determination of the&#xD;
                  biomarker is precluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. use of medications known to affect brain function (e.g., antidepressants,&#xD;
                  anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, anticholinergics, antipsychotics,&#xD;
                  benzodiazepines - same list as in BRITE-MD). Based on the TADS trial, we will&#xD;
                  also exclude for concurrent diagnoses of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder&#xD;
                  managed with psychostimulants, pervasive developmental disorder, and mental&#xD;
                  retardation (mild, moderate, severe, or profound);&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. subject is currently pregnant, or is of child-bearing potential and not using a&#xD;
                  medically acceptable means of birth control (defined as oral contraceptive pill&#xD;
                  or implant, condom, diaphragm, spermicide, IUD, s/p tubal ligation, partner with&#xD;
                  vasectomy).&#xD;
