    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder which affects over 700,000 people in the U.S.&#xD;
      The disease can vary in severity and multiple drug classes are available to the disease&#xD;
      depending on disease severity and complications. Our purpose will be to study how PET-CT&#xD;
      scans can be used to better manage Crohn's Disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a gastrointestinal autoimmune disease thought to result from exposure&#xD;
      to luminal antigen. This exposure then results in a robust Th1 mediated immune response which&#xD;
      is not downregulated, resulting in intestinal tissue injury. Crohn's disease most commonly&#xD;
      involves the distal small intestine, a site that can be difficult to visualize given its&#xD;
      central location within the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to any of the standard therapies. Over&#xD;
      40% of patients do not respond to an initial anti-TNF (biologic) agent and approximately 10%&#xD;
      per year lose their response to these drugs. There is no standard definition of what&#xD;
      constitutes a patient who has primary biologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease activity is measured by indices such as the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI).&#xD;
      The CDAI includes a combination of clinical criteria and lab values. However, the CDAI is&#xD;
      limited by reliance on subjective criteria, limiting the score's use as a valid measure of&#xD;
      studying response to medical therapy. Clinically, reliance on CDAI can result in&#xD;
      inappropriate continuation of an ineffective therapy resulting in worsening of underlying&#xD;
      disease, and increasing risk of adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small studies have demonstrated that PET scans may accurately quantify disease activity in&#xD;
      Crohn's. We propose to study CD patients with active flares to assess for a correlation&#xD;
      between PET activity and CDAI. Additionally, we will determine whether PET signal intensity&#xD;
      is predictive of clinical response to therapy with biologic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposes to test the hypothesis that PET can be used to determine which CD patients&#xD;
      with small bowel disease will be true responders (or nonresponders) to biologic therapy at&#xD;
      week 12. The use of PET to determine response to biologic therapy in small bowel Crohn's&#xD;
      disease would be novel.&#xD;
