      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In human DNA, the Fragile X (FMR1) gene helps to regulate the nervous and reproductive&#xD;
           systems. If the gene is abnormal, it can cause different kinds of problems, such as&#xD;
           abnormal menstrual periods, decreased fertility, muscle tremors, and mental retardation.&#xD;
           An abnormal FMR1 gene can also make a person more susceptible to other medical&#xD;
           conditions, such as thyroid problems, high blood pressure, seizures, and depression.&#xD;
           More research is needed on how abnormalities in the FMR1 gene can lead to these&#xD;
           problems, and how often these problems appear in individuals with an abnormal FMR1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in developing a patient registry of women who have an&#xD;
           abnormality in the FMR1 gene. This registry will allow researchers to follow&#xD;
           participants over time and study possible effects of this abnormality on their general&#xD;
           and reproductive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a patient registry of women with an abnormal FMR1 gene and monitor their general&#xD;
      and reproductive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women at least 18 years of age who have an abnormal FMR1 gene on the X chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The following groups of women will be eligible for screening for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have a family member with Fragile X Syndrome or mental retardation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have (or have a family member who has) primary ovarian insufficiency, also&#xD;
           known as premature menopause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who have (or have a family member who has) certain neurological problems such as&#xD;
           tremors or Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be scheduled for an initial study visit at the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Participants who have regular menstrual periods&#xD;
           should schedule the visit between days 3 and 8 of the menstrual cycle; those who do not&#xD;
           have regular periods may have the visit at any time of the month. In addition, all&#xD;
           estrogen-based treatments (such as birth control pills) must be stopped for 2 weeks&#xD;
           prior to the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a full physical examination, provide a medical history, and&#xD;
           provide blood samples for immediate and future testing. Participants will return for&#xD;
           yearly visits for the same tests for as long as the study continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have or develop primary ovarian insufficiency related to the FMR1 gene&#xD;
           will also have tests to measure bone thickness and will have a vaginal ultrasound to&#xD;
           examine the ovaries. These tests will be scheduled for a separate visit, and will be&#xD;
           repeated every 5 years for the duration of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spontaneous 46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a cause of decreased fertility in&#xD;
      approximately 1% of women before age 40. The most common known genetic cause of 46,XX POI is&#xD;
      a pre -mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene. The FMR1 gene is located on&#xD;
      the X-chromosome and contains a CGG repeat in the un-translated region; this CGG repeat is&#xD;
      normally present in less than 55 copies, but has a tendency to expand across generations.&#xD;
      Greater than 200 CGG copies results in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of&#xD;
      heritable mental retardation. A pre-mutation in the FMR1 gene, defined as between 55 and 199&#xD;
      CGG repeats, is associated with POI in women and carries a risk of expanding to the full&#xD;
      mutation in a woman s offspring, resulting in a child with FXS. POI that is associated with&#xD;
      the FMR1 pre-mutation is known as Fragile X-associated POI ( FXPOI ). Approximately 20% of&#xD;
      women with an FMR1 pre-mutation develop FXPOI. Importantly, it is not known why some women&#xD;
      with the pre-mutation develop FXPOI and others do not. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to characterize the natural history of reproductive function in women who are FMR1&#xD;
      pre-mutation carriers by creating a patient registry that will allow us to follow them&#xD;
      longitudinally. Given the relative rarity of this pre-mutation in the general population&#xD;
      (&lt;1%), a patient registry is necessary for enrollment of an adequate number of patients for&#xD;
      clinically significant analyses to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to characterize the natural history of reproductive function in this population, we&#xD;
      will longitudinally track reproductive health of participants, including menstrual history,&#xD;
      pregnancy rate, and biological (serum) markers of ovarian function. The FMR1 pre-mutation may&#xD;
      also be associated with specific general health risks, such as hypertension, thyroid disease,&#xD;
      neurological disorders, and psychiatric disorders. A patient registry will also allow us to&#xD;
      track development of these and other common medical conditions to determine if women with the&#xD;
      FMR1 pre-mutation have increased health risks. Currently, there are no screening guidelines&#xD;
      regarding reproductive or general health for women who carry the FMR1 pre-mutation, and&#xD;
      observations from longitudinal data will help to develop such guidelines. Finally,&#xD;
      standardized guidelines for genetic counseling of women with the FMR1 pre-mutation regarding&#xD;
      genetic risk to their children do not exist, and data collected in this study will enable&#xD;
      this.&#xD;
