    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the concentration of canagliflozin in blood and&#xD;
      urine samples after the administration of canagliflozin to study participants with mild or&#xD;
      moderate hepatic (liver) impairment compared with study participants with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both study participant and investigator will know the name of the&#xD;
      assigned treatment), pharmacokinetic (the study of how drugs are absorbed in the body, how&#xD;
      they are distributed within the body, and how they are removed from the body over time) study&#xD;
      of canagliflozin in adult study participants with mild or moderate hepatic (liver) impairment&#xD;
      compared to study participants with normal hepatic function. Approximately 24 study&#xD;
      participants who meet entry criteria for the study will be classified into 1 of 3 hepatic&#xD;
      function groups: Group 1 (8 study participants with normal hepatic function), Group 2 (8&#xD;
      study participants with mild hepatic impairment) and Group 3 (8 study participants with&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment). The group allocation is based on the Child-Pugh score, an&#xD;
      assessment of 5 clinical measures that is used to characterize the degree of hepatic&#xD;
      impairment. At least 3 men and 3 women will be enrolled in each group and the 3 groups will&#xD;
      be balanced with respect to an average age and body weight. Study participants will be&#xD;
      required to stay overnight at the study center for 5 nights to receive study drug and have&#xD;
      study procedures and safety assessments performed. All study participants will be&#xD;
      administered a single 300-mg oral (by mouth) dose of canagliflozin after fasting (not eating&#xD;
      food) for a period of at least 10 hours. After study drug administration, study participants&#xD;
      will be provided with standardized meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Blood and urine&#xD;
      samples for analyses of canagliflozin and metabolites (M7 and M5) will be collected from&#xD;
      study participants at specified time points up to 120 hours (blood) and 48 hours (urine)&#xD;
      after study drug administration. After discharge from the study center, study participants&#xD;
      will be required to return to the study center for 3 outpatient visits to have study&#xD;
      procedures and safety assessments performed. Study participants will be monitored for safety&#xD;
      during the study by evaluating adverse events reported and results from clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements, and physical examinations.&#xD;
      On Day 1 of the study, a single 300 mg dose of canagliflozin will be orally administered to&#xD;
      study participants after a fasting period of at least 10 hours followed 10 minutes later by a&#xD;
      standardized breakfast that must be eaten within 30 minutes. Study participants are to remain&#xD;
      standing or sitting for the first 4 hours after dosing. At 2 hours after dosing (but not&#xD;
      earlier) all study participants must drink 1 glass of water; drinking of water is allowed&#xD;
      from then onwards.&#xD;
