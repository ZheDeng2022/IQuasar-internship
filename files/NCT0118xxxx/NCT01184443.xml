  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic, olanzapine, for the treatment of youth suffering from Anorexia Nervosa (AN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent males and females between the ages of 11 and 17 years who are being treated by a&#xD;
      physician on the Eating Disorder team at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario will be&#xD;
      invited to join the study if they have been diagnosed with AN or Eating Disorder Not&#xD;
      Otherwise Specified (EDNOS), and if they weigh less than or equal to 85% of their ideal body&#xD;
      weight. Those who meet inclusion and not exclusion criteria, and consent to participating in&#xD;
      the trial will be offered adjunctive treatment with olanzapine. Those who agree to take&#xD;
      olanzapine will belong to the olanzapine group, and those who decline will belong to the&#xD;
      comparison group. Olanzapine doses will be in keeping with the investigators current clinical&#xD;
      practice, with flex doses ranging from 1.25 mg to 10.0 mg daily (the majority of patients are&#xD;
      treated with 2.5 mg or 5.0 mg at bedtime); dose adjustments made based on individual need and&#xD;
      tolerability. Participants will remain in the study for 12 weeks. Those who initially decline&#xD;
      olanzapine treatment may change their minds and take olanzapine up until week 9 of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that those children and adolescents who choose to take olanzapine at entry&#xD;
      into the trial will be more motivated to recover and more compliant with treatment. Compared&#xD;
      to those who do not receive medication, it is expected that these adolescents will&#xD;
      demonstrate reduced disordered eating attitudes and behaviours, as well as an increased rate&#xD;
      of weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it is predicted that the rates of discontinuation and the adverse effects of&#xD;
      olanzapine will be minor given the relatively low dose (as compared to treatment for patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia), slow titration, and short-term use of olanzapine the investigators will&#xD;
      be using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing the well-being and outcome of patients in the two groups, the investigators hope&#xD;
      to begin to answer the question of whether olanzapine does or does not lead to improved&#xD;
      clinical outcome for patients with severe eating disorders such as AN or EDNOS, and the&#xD;
      question of whether the benefits of using the medication outweigh the risks.&#xD;

Patients will typically start oral olanzapine at 2.5mg (rarely 1.25mg) daily for 1 to 2 weeks, and if tolerated and clinically indicated, are increased to 5.0mg daily. The majority of patients will remain on a maintenance dose of 5.0mg, but more agitated patients may take 7.5mg (rarely 10.0mg) daily. Patients will be tapered off as they approach/attain their ideal body weight.</description>
