    <textblock>
      In order to examine potential gender differences in the weight loss response to exercise, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to compare equal energy expenditure of exercise for overweight men and&#xD;
      women using levels of exercise energy expenditure that the investigators have previously&#xD;
      shown to prevent weight gain or promote weight loss. The investigators will randomize men and&#xD;
      women to an exercise group, 5 days/week, for 9 months, with an energy expenditure of 400&#xD;
      kcal/exercise session, a group with 600 kcal/ exercise session, or a control group. 1)The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that men and women randomized to sedentary control will gain&#xD;
      weight, those randomized to 400 kcal/exercise session will maintain weight (will not gain),&#xD;
      and those randomized to 600 kcal/exercise session will lose ~5% of body weight. 2) The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize there will be no differences for weight loss between genders at&#xD;
      either 400 or 600 kcal of energy expenditure of exercise since men and women will have equal&#xD;
      amounts of energy expenditure of exercise. 3) The investigators hypothesize that men and&#xD;
      women randomized to 400 kcal/exercise session will completely compensate for the energy&#xD;
      expended during exercise by altering energy intake and/or spontaneous activity and that men&#xD;
      and women participants randomized to 600 kcal/exercise session will not completely&#xD;
      compensate. The investigators believe the findings from this study could have important&#xD;
      implications for exercise guidelines for weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is recommended by virtually every public health organization; however, the role of&#xD;
      exercise is generally considered secondary to energy restriction for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity. Indeed, an argument can be made that suggests exercise is not effective for weight&#xD;
      loss. Meta-analytic studies consistently find small amounts of weight loss due to exercise&#xD;
      without energy restriction. It is critical to note that there are actually very few&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials using exercise alone for weight loss. We believe that there are&#xD;
      3 critical flaws in the vast majority of the literature. 1)Participants are not supervised&#xD;
      and is generally recorded by self report and is likely poorly estimated and in general,&#xD;
      overestimated. 2)The amount of exercise used is usually prescribed from the guidelines for&#xD;
      recommended levels for physical fitness and to diminish cardiovascular disease, not the&#xD;
      amount that may be necessary for weight loss. 3)The energy expenditure of the exercise is&#xD;
      rarely reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to expend either 400 or 600kcal per exercise session&#xD;
      (or a control group) and will exercise 5 days per week for 9 months. All exercise sessions&#xD;
      will be supervised and the length of the exercise session will be based upon energy&#xD;
      expenditure (kcal/min) at a give heart rate range. To account for improvements in fitness,&#xD;
      energy expenditure will be measured monthly and adjustments to the daily exercise&#xD;
      prescription will be altered accordingly.&#xD;
