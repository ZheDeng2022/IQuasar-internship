  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide clinical data regarding safety and clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      of the ActiSight Needle Guidance System in assisting radiologically guided percutaneous&#xD;
      needle biopsy or aspiration of pulmonary lesions, which is a common procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single-arm study. At least three centers in Canada will&#xD;
      participate in the study and at least 4 different experienced staff radiologists will perform&#xD;
      the procedures for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of forty eight (48) consecutive subjects meeting the eligibility criteria, scheduled&#xD;
      for clinically indicated CT guided lung biopsy or aspiration procedure at the participating&#xD;
      centers will be invited to enroll in the study. To ensure diversity in the study population,&#xD;
      consecutive patients will be enrolled in the following groups until these groups are fully&#xD;
      enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion size ≥1.0 cm and ≤ 1.5 cm: 10 patients; Lesion size &gt;1.5 and ≤ 3.0 cm: 19 patients;&#xD;
      Lesion size &gt;3.0 cm: 19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled at each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be signed prior to the procedure. Subject data collection on the day of&#xD;
      the procedure will include demographics, relevant medical history and vital signs. Enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will undergo CT guided percutaneous lung aspiration and/or biopsy as clinically&#xD;
      indicated by a qualified physician, utilizing the ActiSight Needle Guidance System. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed-up as outlined below to assess adverse events related to the procedure. A&#xD;
      subject's enrollment in the study will be completed after the follow-up visit or after&#xD;
      resolution of any procedure related adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A procedure difficulty classification is defined for this study, based on existing&#xD;
      literature. Difficulty levels for all procedures will be recorded and included in the final&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
