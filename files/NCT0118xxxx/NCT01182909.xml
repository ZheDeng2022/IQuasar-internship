  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in southern China&#xD;
      and Southeast Asia. While infection with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is believed to be necessary&#xD;
      for the development of NPC, non-viral environmental factors have also been implicated to&#xD;
      increase the risk of NPC including consumption of salted fish and other nitrosamine&#xD;
      containing preserved foods, formaldehyde and wood dust exposure, and cigarette smoking. In&#xD;
      addition to environmental factors, it is widely accepted that genetic susceptibility also&#xD;
      plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NPC. Polymorphisms in genes involved in&#xD;
      nitrosamine metabolism and DNA repair have been suggested to be associated with NPC risk, and&#xD;
      various chromosomal regions linked to NPC development have been reported. These associations&#xD;
      highlight the role of both environmental and genomic components in the etiology of NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a longstanding history of international collaborative studies to elucidate the role&#xD;
      of environmental and genetic factors associated with NPC between investigators in Taiwan and&#xD;
      the USA. A case-control study (375 cases; 327 controls) was conducted in the early 1990s, and&#xD;
      a large multiplex family study that was completed in 2006 (358 families; 3,216 individuals).&#xD;
      Results from these studies have provided some of the most comprehensive epidemiological&#xD;
      evidence regarding factors linked to NPC development to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a next logical step, the opportunity now exists to undertake a genome-wide association&#xD;
      study of NPC in Taiwan with carefully collected environmental exposure data to systematically&#xD;
      examine environmental and genetic factors associated with NPC, and to evaluate gene-gene and&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions. The investigators propose a case-control study of 2000 NPC&#xD;
      cases (both retrospective [n=800] and prospective [n=1,200]) and 2,000 age-gender-matched&#xD;
      hospital controls in northern Taiwan. The study objectives are to: 1) evaluate putative&#xD;
      environmental exposures and NPC; 2) assess the effect of genetic factors, including both&#xD;
      single nucleotide polymorphism and copy number variation through analysis of both main effect&#xD;
      and gene-gene interaction; 3) investigate gene-environment interactions by testing for&#xD;
      interactions between significant genome-wide genetic variations and EBV and other identified&#xD;
      environmental risk factors; and 4) examine the natural history of EBV infection.&#xD;
