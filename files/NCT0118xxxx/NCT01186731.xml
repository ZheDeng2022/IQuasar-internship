  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LE-DT is a novel, proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by NeoPharm, Inc.&#xD;
      Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere) is an anti-microtubule agent that prevents cell&#xD;
      division. By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere, the form of LE-DT, shows reduced&#xD;
      toxicity and comparable therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical study. The clinical evidence&#xD;
      obtained from the NeoPharm Phase I study shows fewer side effects and possibly administered&#xD;
      at higher dose to induce greater effectiveness of LE-DT. In addition, docetaxel has shown&#xD;
      positive activity of protein bound taxane therapy in treating patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The current Phase II study is designed to accomplish the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the antitumor effect of 110 mg/m2 LE-DT administered intravenous (IV) every three&#xD;
           weeks in pancreatic cancer patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the progression-free survival and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate secreted protein acid rich in cysteine expression with tumor response&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the safety of LE-DT, in particular peripheral neuropathy, water retention as&#xD;
           well as myelotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To correlate pharmacogenetic variations in patients with LE-DT pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           endpoints, including toxicities.&#xD;
