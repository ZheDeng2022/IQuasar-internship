  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LE-DT is a novel, proprietary delivery system of docetaxel developed by NeoPharm, Inc.&#xD;
      Docetaxel (currently marketed as Taxotere) is an anti-microtubular network agent and is one&#xD;
      of the most active agents in the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (CRPC) and other variety of cancers. Taxotere has poor solubility and is designed to be&#xD;
      administered with Tween 80 in ethanol. This vehicle causes acute hypersensitivity reaction.&#xD;
      By removing toxic detergent used in Taxotere, the form of LE-DT, shows reduced toxicity and&#xD;
      comparable therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical study. The clinical evidence obtained from&#xD;
      the NeoPharm Phase I study shows fewer side effects and possibly administered at higher dose&#xD;
      to induce greater effectiveness of LE-DT. The current Phase II study is designed to&#xD;
      accomplish the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the antitumor effect indicator serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) following&#xD;
           the intravenous (IV) administration of 110 mg/m2 LE-DT every three weeks in patients&#xD;
           with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the measurable soft tissue disease response using the response evaluation&#xD;
           criteria in solid tumor (RECIST) methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate PSA expression with tumor response&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the safety of LE-DT at 110 mg/m2 level, in particular peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
           water retention as well as myelotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the quality of life (QOL)&#xD;

             prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients without evidence of PSA progression must have clinical or radiographic&#xD;
             evidence of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have castrate levels of testosterone (serum testosterone less than 50ng/dl) by&#xD;
             either being on androgen ablation therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone&#xD;
             (LHRH) agonist or have had a prior bilateral orchiectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
