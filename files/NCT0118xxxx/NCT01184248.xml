  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if sound stimulation could improve pure-tone&#xD;
      hearing threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the late 1990s, researchers discovered that acoustic stimuli slow progressive&#xD;
      sensorineural hearing loss and exposure to a moderately augmented acoustic environment can&#xD;
      delay the loss of auditory function. In addition, prolonged exposure to an augmented acoustic&#xD;
      environment could improve age-related auditory changes. These ameliorative effects were shown&#xD;
      in several types of mouse strains, as long as the acoustic environment was provided prior to&#xD;
      the occurrence of severe hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to delaying progressive hearing loss, acoustic stimuli could also protect hearing&#xD;
      ability against damage by traumatic noise. In particular, a method called forward sound&#xD;
      conditioning (i.e., prior exposure to moderate levels of sound) has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      noise-induced hearing impairment in a number of mammalian species, including humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, recent report has suggested that low-level sound conditioning also reduces&#xD;
      free radical-induced damage to hair cells, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, and reduces&#xD;
      Cox-2 expression in cochlea, and can enhance cochlear sensitivity. Specifically, increased&#xD;
      cochlear sensitivity was observed when distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and&#xD;
      compound action potentials (CAPs) were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to forward sound conditioning, backward sound conditioning (i.e., the use of&#xD;
      acoustic stimuli after exposure to a traumatic noise) has been shown to protect hearing&#xD;
      ability against acoustic trauma and to prevent the cortical map reorganization induced by&#xD;
      traumatic noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of animal studies, the investigators conducted a human study in 2007 and&#xD;
      observed that sound stimulation could improve hearing ability. On average, the pure-tone&#xD;
      hearing threshold decreased by 8.91 dB after sound stimulation for 2 weeks. In that study,&#xD;
      however, the investigators observed only the hearing threshold changes by sound stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify the previous ameliorative effect of sound stimulation, the investigators included a&#xD;
      control period in this study.&#xD;
