  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent national surgical quality guidelines (Surgical Care Improvement Project, National&#xD;
      Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures)state that removal of urinary catheters should occur by&#xD;
      post-operative day two for all surgical patients. These guidelines exclude neither patients&#xD;
      who have undergone rectal surgery nor those with epidural analgesic catheters. The common&#xD;
      practice among most colorectal surgeons is to leave urinary catheters in for three to five&#xD;
      days for patients who have undergone rectal operations, due to concern for urinary retention.&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the outcomes of following the national surgical guidelines for&#xD;
      early urinary catheter removal, especially with regards to urinary retention and urinary&#xD;
      tract infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing anterior resection (rectosigmoid), low anterior resection,&#xD;
      abdomino-perineal resection, total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, sigmoid&#xD;
      colectomy, and coloanal anastomosis will be included in the study. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      standard pre-operative work-up prior to the operation. As part of the operative note, the&#xD;
      level of the anastomosis must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients will have foley catheters removed between 0600 and midnight of&#xD;
           post-operative day 3 (Day 0 being the day of operation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients will undergo bladder ultrasound prior to catheter removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients will undergo bladder ultrasound by nursing staff six hours after catheter&#xD;
           removal, and after voiding the first time after catheter removal, or if the patient&#xD;
           experiences symptoms of urinary retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Patients who meet definition of urinary retention (&gt;100cc post-void residual) will undergo&#xD;
      intermittent straight catheterization every six hours or with symptoms. For those who refuse&#xD;
      intermittent straight catheterization, a indwelling urinary catheter will be inserted and&#xD;
      left in for 24 hours before removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. For patients who have low urine output indicating under-resuscitation, indwelling&#xD;
      catheters will be re-inserted and removed when ongoing resuscitation measures are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. For patients who are actively undergoing fluid resuscitation on post-operative day 3 will&#xD;
      not have their urinary catheters removed until resuscitation and monitoring is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Patients who report symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and/or are already on&#xD;
      medications for BPH will be continued on those medications starting on post-operative day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Patients who have persistent urinary retention when they are otherwise ready to be&#xD;
      discharged home will be sent home with a leg bag and follow up in urology clinic for voiding&#xD;
      trial in 1-2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Urinalysis/urine culture will be performed for symptomatic patients.&#xD;
