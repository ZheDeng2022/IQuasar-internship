      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to longitudinally investigate, in head and neck cancer&#xD;
      (HNC) patients, the potential fibrosis-lymphedema continuum. Specifically, we will examine&#xD;
      the development, patterns, progression, and prevalence of late-effect fibrosis and/or&#xD;
      lymphedema, explore potential biological correlatives including pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and genetic polymorphisms, and evaluate the relationship among late-effect fibrosis and/or&#xD;
      lymphedema and select psychosocial stressors that potentially interact with cytokine&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: A minimum of 20 percent of HNC patients will experience late-effect fibrosis and/or&#xD;
      lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: We will be able to differentiate characteristics patterns of the development of&#xD;
      late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: We will be able to differentiate patterns of symptoms associated with late-effect fibrosis&#xD;
      and/or lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: We will be able to differentiate patterns of inflammatory response and the development of&#xD;
      late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: Select polymorphisms will increase the likelihood of development of late-effect fibrosis&#xD;
      and/or lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: Incidence and severity of late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema will correlate with total&#xD;
      dose of radiation to involved anatomical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H: HNC patients with fibrosis and/or lymphedema experience greater levels of depression and&#xD;
      social withdrawal than those without these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The use of aggressive treatment for HNC, particularly combined modality treatment&#xD;
      regimens has resulted in an increase in survival. Unfortunately, this improvement has come&#xD;
      with a marked increase in acute and late-effects. These undesirable treatment outcomes exact&#xD;
      a heavy toll on functional capacity, contribute to a myriad of problematic physical and&#xD;
      psychological symptoms, negatively impact Quality of Life, and likely create a significant&#xD;
      economic burden to both the patients and the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This four year, longitudinal study will examine the development, patterns, nature,&#xD;
      progression, and prevalence of late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema, explore potential host&#xD;
      biological correlatives (pro-inflammatory cytokines and genetic polymorphisms), and examine&#xD;
      select psychological stressors (depression, social withdrawal), associated with late-effect&#xD;
      fibrosis and lymphedema in HNC survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:1. To determine the prevalence and nature of late-effect (â‰¥3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment) fibrosis and/or lymphedema in HNC patients. 2. To explore the relationships&#xD;
      among the biological mechanisms of inflammatory response, genetic polymorphisms, treatment&#xD;
      factors, and late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema in HNC patients. 3. To explore the&#xD;
      relationships among late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema and psychosocial stressors&#xD;
      (depression and social withdrawal) in HNC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: HNC patients will be assessed at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and every&#xD;
      six weeks after treatment up to one year after treatment, and twice more at 15 and 18 months&#xD;
      post-treatment. These intervals were chosen to reduce subject burden as they routinely&#xD;
      coincide with scheduled laryngoscopic procedures. At baseline, the follow assessment will be&#xD;
      undertaken: 1) demographic information and alcohol and tobacco use history; 2) disease&#xD;
      characteristics; 3) presence of tumor related fibrosis and/or lymphedema (laryngoscope with&#xD;
      digital photographs and scoring of internal lymphedema with Patterson Scale) and external&#xD;
      fibrosis/lymphedema with digital photography, physical exam for fibrosis/lymphedema using the&#xD;
      Foldi criteria, and CT scans; 4) blood for inflammatory mediators and polymorphisms; 5)&#xD;
      psychosocial assessments (Center for epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Liebowitz&#xD;
      Anxiety Scale); and 6) functional assessments (MBVS, Cervical Range of Motion [CROM], Neck&#xD;
      Disability Index and VHNSS). Post-treatment, and every scheduled assessment thereafter,&#xD;
      patients will undergo repeat assessments for everything except: demographic information,&#xD;
      medical history, ETOH and smoking history, polymorphisms and MBVs.&#xD;
