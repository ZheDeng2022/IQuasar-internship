      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new drug,&#xD;
      OMP-21M18, when given in combination with FOLFIRI, a standard drug treatment for advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Participants must not have had more than one chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
      their metastatic disease. OMP-21M18 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in the&#xD;
      laboratory) developed to target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles OMP-21M18 will&#xD;
      also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, at up to 6 centres in Australia and New Zealand,&#xD;
      will receive intravenous infusions of OMP-21M18 followed by FOLFIRI every two weeks, until&#xD;
      disease progression or limited by drug toxicity. After 8 weeks, participants will undergo&#xD;
      assessments to determine their disease status. If there is no evidence of disease progression&#xD;
      participants will continue to receive infusions of OMP-21M18 and FOLFIRI every second week,&#xD;
      until disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current cancer therapies often produce an initial reduction in tumour size but may not have&#xD;
      longterm benefits. One possible explanation for this is the presence cancer cells known as a&#xD;
      cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells represent a small part of the tumour but are believed to&#xD;
      be responsible for much of the growth and spread of the cancer. They may also be more&#xD;
      resistant to traditional types of therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new&#xD;
      experimental drug, OMP-21M18, when given in combination with FOLFIRI, a chemotherapy regimen&#xD;
      consisting of the following three medications: folinic acid (leucovorin), 5fluorouracil and&#xD;
      irinotecan. The administration of these three medications is a standard treatment for&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer. OMP-21M18 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in&#xD;
      the laboratory) developed to target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles OMP21M18 will&#xD;
      also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, will be enrolled at up to 6 centres in Australia&#xD;
      and New Zealand. Following informed consent and screening, FOLFIRI will be administered once&#xD;
      every 14 days (or until toxicity necessitates reducing or delaying a dose). OMP-21M18 will be&#xD;
      administered by intravenous (IV) infusion once every 14 days on the same day as FOLFIRI. A&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the data for the 6 participants in each dose&#xD;
      level after the last participant in that group has been treated for 56 days and decide&#xD;
      whether it is safe to move up to the next highest dose level. After confirming the optimum&#xD;
      dose, 14 additional participants will be treated at the highest dose level that the DSMB&#xD;
      considers safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed for disease status every 8 weeks and for safety at every visit&#xD;
      and for 30 days after the end of study drug treatment. Safety will be assessed by adverse&#xD;
      event monitoring, physical examination, vital signs, blood tests, cardiac monitoring, and&#xD;
      participant interview. Response rates, duration of response, time to progression, and&#xD;
      survival will be evaluated requiring CT or MRI scans and CEA (tumour marker) levels at&#xD;
      baseline and then every 8 weeks. The development of antibodies to treatment will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the study and up to 12 weeks after the end of study drug treatment. During the&#xD;
      study blood samples will be taken to assess whether OMP21M18 is producing desired changes to&#xD;
      the genes and proteins related to the cancer (biomarkers). The study includes an optional&#xD;
      part which will investigate how variations in people's genetic makeup affect their response&#xD;
      to medications. This involves the collection of one blood sample just before participants&#xD;
      receive their first dose of study treatment. DNA will be extracted from the blood sample for&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
