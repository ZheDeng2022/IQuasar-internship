  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, safety and tolerability study, which&#xD;
      will be conducted at one study site. This study will include 3 cohorts. Each cohort will have&#xD;
      approximately 5 subjects. Subjects will not be randomized into the study. The first cohort&#xD;
      will receive low dose drug insert, second cohort will receive 2 low dose drug inserts thus&#xD;
      achieving twice the drug levels compared to cohort I and third cohort will receive high dose&#xD;
      drug insert.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and safety of the biodegradable&#xD;
      extended release Latanoprost subconjunctival insert for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)&#xD;
      and ocular hypertension (OHT) patients. Intraocular pressure lowering ability of&#xD;
      biodegradable extended release Latanoprost subconjunctival insert in POAG and OHT patients&#xD;
      will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose inserts have an initial release rate of approximately 1 µg/day slowing to 0.2 µg/day&#xD;
      after approximately 10 days; this release rate is maintained. High dose inserts have an&#xD;
      initial release of approximately 4 µg/day, which slows to approximately 1 ug/day after 10&#xD;
      days. Each drop of Xalatan (the commercial form of latanoprost) contains approximately 1 µg&#xD;
      of latanoprost. The first cohort will receive inserts that initially provide the same dose as&#xD;
      is administered topically before their release rate slows down to a lower dose. The inserts&#xD;
      used in this study are composed of a drug core in a (Poly Lactic Glycolic acid) PLGA polymer&#xD;
      tube. One end of the tube is capped with an impermeable polymer (silicone) and the other end&#xD;
      with a permeable polymer (Polyvinyl alcohol). Drug release occurs across the permeable end&#xD;
      and is a function of internal diameter of the tube. Low dose insert and high dose insert are&#xD;
      exactly the same except that for low dose inserts the internal diameter of the PLGA tubes is&#xD;
      smaller. Thus different release rates (and drug loading) are obtained with the same&#xD;
      formulation. Inserts are designed to provide steady state release for 3-6 months.&#xD;
