      Intestinal absorption of levothyroxine (LT4) tablets depends on its dissolution in gastric&#xD;
      acid secretion, which is reduced after bariatric interventions. Impaired LT4 absorption due&#xD;
      to low gastric dissolution has been reported in patients with atrophic or chronic gastritis.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the absorption of LT4 tablets in morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients before and after Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      LEVOTHYROXINE ABSORPTION IN MORBIDLY OBESE PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER ROUX-EN-Y BARIATRIC&#xD;
      SURGERY INTRODUCTION Levothyroxine sodium (LT4) is an effective drug prescribed as&#xD;
      replacement therapy for patients with hypothyroidism, as a controversial suppressive therapy&#xD;
      for nodular thyroid disease and after surgical removal of thyroid cancer. Incidence rates of&#xD;
      differentiated thyroid cancer of all sizes have increased both in men and women, as have the&#xD;
      rates of autoimmune thyroiditis disease. It is estimated that 3.7% of the United States&#xD;
      population has hypothyroidism, indicating that millions of people are in continuous use of&#xD;
      LT4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absorption of LT4 formulations approximates 80% of the oral dose. It is reduced when LT4 is&#xD;
      ingested concomitantly with several drugs including aluminum hydroxide, cholestyramine,&#xD;
      sucralfate, ferrous sulphate, calcium carbonate, sodium polystyrene sulfonate, as well as&#xD;
      with coffee and fiber supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal absorption of LT4 depends primarily on its dissolution in gastric acid secretion.&#xD;
      Therefore, may be affected by H. pylori infection and autoimmune gastritis. There are&#xD;
      substantial interindividual variations in LT4 requirements dependent on patients age, gender&#xD;
      and body size, with lean body mass being the major determinant of dose correction for LT4.&#xD;
      Morbidly obese patients apparently have impaired LT4 absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of obesity has increased to epidemic proportions. Effective treatment may be&#xD;
      achieved by bariatric surgeries, but these procedures are associated with several&#xD;
      morbidities, such as gastrointestinal and nutritional complications. It is plausible to&#xD;
      hypothesize that since bariatric interventions (such as Roux-en-Y) reduce gastric&#xD;
      hydrochloric acid secretion, they may impair LT4 absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of LT4 tablets in morbidly&#xD;
      obese patients before and after bariatric surgery in order to determine the need for&#xD;
      adjustment of LT4 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients will be recruited from the Gastric Surgery Division of Hospital das&#xD;
      Clínicas. Thirty morbidly obese patients will be divided in two groups. The NS group will&#xD;
      include 15 patients for whom bariatric surgery is planned. Body mass index (BMI) of this&#xD;
      group of patients has to be ≥40 Kg/m2. The S group will include 15 patients who had undergone&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y bariatric surgery 2 to 3 months before inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data and medication information were collected before recruitment. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria includes a previous diagnosis of thyroid cancer, diabetes mellitus in use of&#xD;
      insulin, chronic or atrophic gastritis, and use of medications associated with impaired LT4&#xD;
      absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will signed an informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee&#xD;
      of Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo Medical School (CAPPesq N0 1039/07).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Absorption of LT4 will be measured using a previously described nonisotopic method.&#xD;
      After an overnight fast, a forearm intravenous catheter is inserted and two blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected with a 30-minute interval before administration of 600 µg of oral LT4.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 1440 minutes (24 hours) after&#xD;
      administration of LT4. Patients will fast for five hours after receiving the drug. They will&#xD;
      be then instructed to have a light meal in the evening and to return the next morning in a&#xD;
      fasting state to collect the 24 hour sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum free T4 (FT4), total T4 (TT4) and serum TSH will be determined in all samples by&#xD;
      electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The&#xD;
      concentration of each hormone at baseline will be calculated as a mean of the two samples&#xD;
      collected before the LT4 dose. To correct for endogenous hormone synthesis, the incremental&#xD;
      rise of each hormone concentration (deltaTT4, deltaFT4, deltaTSH) will be calculated by&#xD;
      subtracting the basal value from the subsequent time intervals samples. To evaluate LT4&#xD;
      absorption, the area under the curve of deltaTT4 and deltaFT4 from baseline to 240 minutes&#xD;
      and to 300 minutes (AUC240, AUC300) as well as the peak of deltaTT4 and deltaFT4&#xD;
      concentrations will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum leptin will be measured by Human Leptin Elisa Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in all&#xD;
      patients, before and after weight loss following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic autoimmune gastritis will be ruled out by absence of clinical signs and negative&#xD;
      antiparietal autoantibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Results will be expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD). Analysis of&#xD;
      variance and Tukey Multiple Comparison test, Student's t test and Spearman correlation&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to compare the data. All tests will be performed with a&#xD;
      significance level of 5%.&#xD;
