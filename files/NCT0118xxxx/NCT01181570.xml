  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect and safety of adalimumab in approximately 20 subjects&#xD;
      with mild to moderate psoriasis and sleep apnea and will be conducted in one treatment center&#xD;
      located in Montreal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with psoriasis often have additional disorders such as obesity. Obese patients are&#xD;
      more at risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. This is believed to be caused by both the&#xD;
      collapse of upper airways and inflammation (swelling). Adalimumab, a drug currently approved&#xD;
      by Health Canada for the treatment of psoriasis, blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha). This chemical is present at higher levels in patients with sleep apnea. It is&#xD;
      believed that adalimumab could improve obstructive sleep apnea by lowering the levels of&#xD;
      TNF-alpha.&#xD;
