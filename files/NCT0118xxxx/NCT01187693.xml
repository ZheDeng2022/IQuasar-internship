  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with anatomical leg length discrepancy (LLD) commonly presented excessive subtalar&#xD;
      pronation of the long leg compared to their short leg in order to equalize leg length.&#xD;
      Although such compensation may decrease the stress in the pelvis and/or low back region, the&#xD;
      pronated foot may lead to excessive stress loading onto the ankle or foot, resulting in&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries. Clinically, the pronated foot has been effectively controlled using&#xD;
      functional orthoses with proper posting by adjusting the subtalar joint in the neutral&#xD;
      position. But for people with compensatory pronated foot resulted from anatomical LLD, to&#xD;
      control excessive pronation of the long leg would exaggerate their asymmetry in leg length.&#xD;
      Instead, the pronated foot can be controlled simply by adjusting the length of the short leg.&#xD;
      However, there is limited evidence of such intervention in previous literature. The purpose&#xD;
      of this research project is going to determine the effect of leg length adjustment on&#xD;
      pronation control in people with anatomical LLD. According to this purpose, 5 study&#xD;
      objectives will be developed: 1) to examine the validity and reliability of LLD measurement&#xD;
      using a hand-held laser distance meter, 2) to compare the foot types before and after leg&#xD;
      length adjustment, 3) to compare the kinetic variables before and after leg length adjustment&#xD;
      during quiet stance, 4) to compare the kinetic variables before and after leg length&#xD;
      adjustment during level walking, and 5) to compare symptoms and functional levels related to&#xD;
      low back pain (LBP) before and after leg length adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research project will be designed as a convenience sampling, prospective,&#xD;
      quasi-experimental, and pretest/posttest design. There will be 2 parts in this research: 1)&#xD;
      validity and reliability test of laser measure for leg length and 2) foot morphology and&#xD;
      kinetic analysis before and after leg length adjustment. For the first part of this research,&#xD;
      10 male adults and 20 adults will be recruited for the validity and reliability tests&#xD;
      respectively. Anthropometric measurements, including body height, body weight, foot length,&#xD;
      foot width, and heel-ball distance, will be measured after a consent form is signed.&#xD;
      Participants of the validity test will receive standing pelvic radiography and laser measure&#xD;
      to measure their leg length. Each participant of the reliability test will receive 2 sessions&#xD;
      of laser measure using a hand-held laser-distance meter. For the first session, all laser&#xD;
      measurements will be employed twice by 2 raters with a rest interval of more than 5 min. One&#xD;
      week later, another session of laser measure will be given again by one of these 2 raters.&#xD;
      Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used to test the interrater reliability,&#xD;
      intrarater reliability, and validity of the laser measure method. Standard error of&#xD;
      measurement (SEM), and small real difference (SRD) will be calculated to represented&#xD;
      intrarater reliability also. For the second part of the research, another thirty adults with&#xD;
      compensatory pronated foot resulted from LLD will be included in the research project but the&#xD;
      sample size will be adjusted to the appropriate number according to power analysis. Each&#xD;
      participant will be asked to fill out the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry&#xD;
      Disability Index (ODI) and receive tests containing foot type examination, quiet stance with&#xD;
      eye opening, quiet stance with eye closed, and level walking. All tests will be performed&#xD;
      before and after leg length adjustment. The experiment will be completed after collecting 3&#xD;
      successful trials for each test. All procedures will be done one month later. ANOVA with&#xD;
      repeated measures will be calculated to compare the differences in these variables among&#xD;
      before, immediately after, and 1 month following leg length adjustment when the data fit the&#xD;
      assumptions of normal distribution. Discrete variables or variables with non-normal&#xD;
      distribution were tested using the Friedman test. All statistical analyses will be calculated&#xD;
      using SAS 9.1.3. The significant level was set at Î± = 0.05 while the power was at 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five possible results may be expected from conducting this research project: 1) there will be&#xD;
      good validity and reliability of the laser distance meter to measure LLD, 2) there will be&#xD;
      significant differences in measurements of foot type before and after leg length adjustment,&#xD;
      3) there will be significant differences in kinetic data during quiet stance before and after&#xD;
      leg length adjustment, 4) there will be significant differences in kinetic data during level&#xD;
      walking before and after leg length adjustment, and 5) symptom and functional level related&#xD;
      to LBP will improve after leg length adjustment. Completion of this research project will be&#xD;
      projected to provide solid and objective evidences for leg length adjustment through views of&#xD;
      morphology and kinetics in people with pronated foot due to anatomical LLD.&#xD;
