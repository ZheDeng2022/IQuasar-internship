  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common complaint of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) that negatively&#xD;
      affects physical function, participation in daily activities, employment, and community&#xD;
      involvement. No behavioural intervention for fatigue has been reported for SCI, though the&#xD;
      benefits of such programs have been proven in persons with neurological conditions like&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis and arthritis. Based on a study with people with SCI, an energy management&#xD;
      program (EnMP-1) was developed. The focus of this study is to test EnMP-1. Adults with SCI&#xD;
      living in the community and reporting fatigue as a problem will participate in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants in the EnMP-1 group will show significantly lower fatigue impact&#xD;
      scores and higher self-efficacy scores immediately after, 3 months, and 6 months&#xD;
      post-intervention than EnMP-2 participants.&#xD;

      Detailed Description Extended description of the protocol (Background, purpose, hypothesis,&#xD;
      and inclusion/exclusion criteria already contained in other fields):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol subjects will follow is conceptualized into three periods: the pre-program&#xD;
      phase, the program phase of either the EnMP-1 or the EnMP-2, and the follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-program Phase: Potential subjects will contact the Research Coordinator to volunteer for&#xD;
      the study and to have any questions addressed. At that time, subjects will be screened by&#xD;
      phone or in person using a Participant Screening Questionnaire to ensure that they meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study. If the individual is deemed eligible, the Research&#xD;
      Coordinator will gather demographic information and provide or forward the participant the&#xD;
      pre-program preparation package that includes: a fact sheet about the study; the consent&#xD;
      form; self-reported study measures (one primary for fatigue, one secondary for self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and four co-variate measures assessing depression, pain, and sleep); and a self-addressed,&#xD;
      stamped return envelope. Participants will be contacted one week after the pre-program&#xD;
      package has been sent, to address questions and to verbally assist in completing the outcome&#xD;
      measures, if required. They will be asked to sign the consent form, complete the study&#xD;
      measures and return these in the envelope provided in the package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks later (one-week before the program phase) subjects will be forwarded the study&#xD;
      measures to complete prior to the first session. Subjects will be contacted 1-2 days before&#xD;
      the first session to address concerns, clarify that measures are to be completed and brought&#xD;
      to the first session, and to remind subjects of the date, time and location of the first&#xD;
      session. Subjects who received the workbook will be encouraged to browse and review its&#xD;
      content. The study measures will be collected at the beginning of the first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program Phase: All subjects will participate in the four, two-hour sessions held one week&#xD;
      apart for four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program content for both the EnMP-1 and EnMp-2 group sessions is structured as follows:&#xD;
      Session 1 is an introduction to the group, important concepts, and upcoming session topics;&#xD;
      Session 2 further elaborates on the concepts introduced in session 1 and encourages&#xD;
      self-reflection; Session 3 is the peer to peer contact by phone or in person to assist with&#xD;
      problems and share tips that really worked; and Session 4 concludes the program and serves to&#xD;
      consolidate information learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the week-four session, subjects will be provided with a package that&#xD;
      includes the study measures, a program evaluation and self-addressed stamped envelope. They&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the measures and the evaluation over next week and return them in&#xD;
      the envelope provided. Subjects will be contacted 1-2 days after this last session to address&#xD;
      questions and to remind them to return the measures and program evaluation in the envelope&#xD;
      provided. After one-week, if the package has not been received, subjects will be contacted to&#xD;
      assist with any issues and to encourage return of the package. This will be repeated one&#xD;
      further time to maximize return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase: After the program phase is concluded, there will be a six-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Subjects will be forwarded the self-report study measures and self-addressed stamped envelope&#xD;
      and asked to complete and return them in the envelope provided. Subjects will be contacted&#xD;
      one week after the package is sent to address questions and to remind them to return the&#xD;
      measures in the envelope provided. If the package has not been received, after another week,&#xD;
      subjects will be contacted to assist with any issues and to encourage return of the package.&#xD;
      This will be repeated one further time, a week later, to maximize return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time commitment for participating in this study is between 11-12 hours over 7 months.&#xD;
