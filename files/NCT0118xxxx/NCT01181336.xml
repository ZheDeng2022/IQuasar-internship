  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a single vaccination (injection) with the&#xD;
      investigational influenza vaccine is safe in healthy subjects. The study is also designed to&#xD;
      evaluate four different dose formulations of the vaccine to see which gives the best immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic vaccination against influenza is indicated for &quot;at risk&quot; populations including&#xD;
      patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases (including asthma), chronic heart&#xD;
      disease, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression due to disease or&#xD;
      treatment. Vaccination of the elderly (&gt;65 years) and the residents of nursing homes is also&#xD;
      recommended. The current influenza vaccines available contain subunits from two influenza A&#xD;
      viruses and an influenza B virus and consist either of inactivated whole virus or subunits of&#xD;
      haemagglutinin and neuraminidase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational influenza vaccine (FLU-v) contains multiple highly conserved T cell&#xD;
      epitopes that are present on most influenza viruses, which have been identified as reactive&#xD;
      in different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) populations; thus making it unlikely that anybody&#xD;
      in the vaccinated population would be unable to mount an immune response to at least one of&#xD;
      the epitopes contained in the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the initial exploration of FLU-v in humans, and aims to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised to receive either Low Dose or High Dose FLU-v with or without&#xD;
      adjuvant, or placebo with or without adjuvant. Twenty-four (24) subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to Low Dose and 24 subjects to High Dose. To mitigate risk, a staggered dosing approach will&#xD;
      be used. One subject will receive Low Dose FLU-v without adjuvant, and one subject will&#xD;
      receive placebo without adjuvant, followed 6 hours later by one subject receiving Low Dose&#xD;
      FLU-v with adjuvant, and one subject receiving placebo with adjuvant. All 4 subjects will be&#xD;
      observed overnight. At least 72 hours later and in the absence of any clinically-significant&#xD;
      safety signals (as determined by a Safety Review Committee) the remaining 20 subjects of the&#xD;
      Low Dose group will be dosed. If deemed appropriate by the Safety Review Committee a second&#xD;
      sentinel cohort of 4 subjects will be observed overnight prior to completing the remaining&#xD;
      subjects of the Low Dose group. Following a satisfactory review of safety data from the&#xD;
      combined Low Dose cohorts, subjects in the High Dose group will be vaccinated using the same&#xD;
      staggered dosing approach as used in Low Dose.&#xD;
