  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rasagiline is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), a rapidly progressing disease with a symptomatology&#xD;
      similar to Parkinson's Disease. The major aim of this study is the limitation or halting of&#xD;
      the process of neurodegeneration and influence postural instability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressing disease with a median survival&#xD;
      after onset of symptoms of 5.8 years.PSP is characterized by early falls, vertical&#xD;
      ophthalmoparesis, akinetic-rigid features, prominent bulbar dysfunction and&#xD;
      fronto-subcortical dementia. So far there is no treatment for the disease as the negative&#xD;
      outcomes of the vast majority of studies make it impossible to set standards. As the majority&#xD;
      of patients experience severe falls and vertigo already in the early phase of the disease,&#xD;
      the drug of desire would be able to slow disease progression with a special focus on postural&#xD;
      instability and exert neuroprotective effects. The monoamino oxidase inhibitor Rasagiline&#xD;
      might be able to influence progression of PSP.&#xD;

    <description>Since there is no established treatment regimen for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) patients, the only well characterized medication is L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) therapy. Since this therapy may exert a small effect in PSP patients, begin with L-DOPA therapy or increase in L-DOPA therapy will be used in this trial as rescue medication.</description>
