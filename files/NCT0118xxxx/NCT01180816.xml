  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic&#xD;
      astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of&#xD;
      tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival&#xD;
      durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy has consisted of&#xD;
      surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. More recently, a Phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      published by Stupp et al in 2005 showed a benefit for using radiotherapy plus concomitant and&#xD;
      adjuvant Temozolomide. Still, all patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy,&#xD;
      so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing&#xD;
      quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral&#xD;
      Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can effectively increase the concentration of drug&#xD;
      delivered to the brain while sparing the body of systemic side effects. One currently used&#xD;
      drug called Temozolomide (Temodar) has been shown to be active in human brain tumors but its&#xD;
      actual central nervous system (CNS) penetration is unknown. This phase I clinical research&#xD;
      trial will test the hypothesis that following the standard 42 day Temozolomide/radiotherapy&#xD;
      regimen, Temozolomide can be safely used by direct intracranial superselective intra-arterial&#xD;
      cerebral infusion (SIACI) up to a dose of 250mg/m2, followed by the standard maintenance&#xD;
      cycle of temozolomide to ultimately enhance survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM/AA.&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      SIACI Temozolomide. The investigators expect that this project will provide important&#xD;
      information regarding the utility of SIACI Temozolomide therapy for malignant gliomas, and&#xD;
      may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM is radiation therapy plus concomitant&#xD;
      oral Temozolomide of doses of 75mg/m2 up to 150mg/m2. Because of the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB) where drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one&#xD;
      knows for sure if these oral drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that intra-carotid artery (intra-arterial) delivery is superior to&#xD;
      standard intravenous or oral delivery for increasing the penetration of drug to the brain.&#xD;
      Previous techniques using intra arterial (intracarotid) infusion still were non-selective as&#xD;
      drug delivery still went to all blood vessels in the brain, so patients still had significant&#xD;
      adverse events, such as blindness. Newer techniques in interventional neuroradiology have&#xD;
      allowed for a more selective delivery of catheters into the arterial tree where&#xD;
      chemotherapies can be delivered without the risk of adverse affects such as blindness.&#xD;
      Therefore, this trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to deliver a dose of&#xD;
      Temozolomide intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques in addition to&#xD;
      the standard oral route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of drug&#xD;
      that gets to the tumor but also spare the patient many of the adverse effects from a less&#xD;
      selective delivery. Prior to this single dose of intra-arterial Temozolomide, the patient&#xD;
      will also receive a dose of mannitol that will increase the permeability of the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier to improve delivery of the agent to the brain. After this single dose of mannitol and&#xD;
      Temozolomide, the patient will be evaluated for 4 weeks to assess for toxicity. If there is&#xD;
      no toxicity at this point, then the patient will proceed with oral maintenance Temozolomide&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In summary, this is a Phase I trial that is designed to test the safety of a&#xD;
      single dose of intra-arterial delivery of Temozolomide immediately following 42 days of&#xD;
      radiotherapy/oral temozolomide and prior to starting oral maintenance Temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard of Care Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1-42: Adjuvant dose of Temozolomide 75mg/m2 for 42 days concomitant with focal&#xD;
      radiotherapy Day 42: 4 week rest period Day 70: Maintenance dose of Temozolomide 150mg/m2&#xD;
      once daily for Days 1-5 of a 28 day cycle for 6 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental portion of this proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1-42: Adjuvant dose of Temozolomide 75mg/m2 for 42 days concomitant with focal&#xD;
      radiotherapy Day 42: Single Intra-arterial Mannitol to increase the permeability of the blood&#xD;
      brain barrier followed by Intra-arterial Temozolomide single dose (starting at 75mg/m2 and up&#xD;
      to 250mg/m2) followed by 4 week rest period Day 70: Maintenance dose of Temozolomide 150mg/m2&#xD;
      once daily for Days 1-5 of a 28 day cycle for 6 cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On day 42, subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion&#xD;
           (Mannitol 25%; 3-10 mLs for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This&#xD;
           technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the&#xD;
           intraarterial (IA) delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Following the addition of mannitol, the investigators will deliver a single SIACI dose&#xD;
           of Temozolomide for patients with high-grade glioma. After a one-cycle observation&#xD;
           period to assess for toxicity from the IA infusion, the subject will receive the&#xD;
           standard oral maintenance regimen of Temozolomide chemotherapy. The Intra-Arterial&#xD;
           Infusion Procedure will be done under general anesthesia and standard monitoring will&#xD;
           occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: The investigators will use a single intracranial&#xD;
      superselective intra-arterial infusion of Temozolomide, starting at a dose of 75mg/m2 in the&#xD;
      first three patients. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity during the next 28 days after the&#xD;
      infusion, the patient will then begin standard maintenance oral Temozolomide chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen. The doses will be escalated from 75 to 100, to 150, 200, and finally 250mg/m2 in&#xD;
      this Phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with GBM are also monitored every two months with serial history, neurological&#xD;
      and physical examinations together with serial blood counts, prothrombin time (PT), partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time (PTT) and chemistries. In addition, most patients with GBM have an MRI&#xD;
      performed every two cycles or approximately every two months to assess for tumor progression.&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a Phase I trial, response is not a primary endpoint. However, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate response to the one time IA Temozolomide therapy with a MRI with the injection&#xD;
      of contrast approximately 4 weeks after infusion. Follow-up of all patients in the trial&#xD;
      after the IA Temozolomide therapy will continue until disease progression or death. Survival&#xD;
      will be measured from the time of the dose of IA TemozolomideÂ®. The investigators expect&#xD;
      patients in the trial to be monitored for 12 months.&#xD;
