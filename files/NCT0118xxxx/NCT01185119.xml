    <textblock>
      10 healthy men will be PET-scanned (CNS) twice in random order with infusions of placebo or&#xD;
      Native GLP-1 during hyperglycemic clamp to uncover the metabolic effects of GLP-1 in&#xD;
      perspectives of intervention of macrovascular late diabetic pathology such as stroke and AMI.&#xD;
      Earlier studies have revealed tendencies towards steady glucose metabolism in the CNS despite&#xD;
      fluctuations in blood sugar when infusing native GLP-1.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is epidemically increasing throughout the world. T2D is&#xD;
      frequently associated with multiple complications, where particularly the macrovascular&#xD;
      complications in the form of myocardial infarction with its possible complication of death or&#xD;
      heart failure, cerebral infarction and limb amputation are responsible for a vast increase in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. Apart from the individual burden on the&#xD;
      patient, T2D puts massive pressure on national health economies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that blood glucose lowering drugs, antihypertensive as well as lipid&#xD;
      lowering drugs all play a pivotal role in the treatment of the type 2 diabetic subjects.&#xD;
      Regarding glycemia, there are frequently side effects with the 'classic' drugs such as&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, weight gain, heart failure, and so forth. Another important caveat is that&#xD;
      employing the anti-hyperglycemic drugs either as monotherapy or in combination does not lower&#xD;
      blood glucose to the targets as defined by the ADA. In other words novel anti-diabetic drugs&#xD;
      are urgently required. However, the incretin concept has recently been inaugurated in the&#xD;
      pharmacological scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like peptide-1-receptors (GLP-1R) are abundant on alpha- and beta-cells in the&#xD;
      pancreas, but are also present in the heart and CNS, especially in hypothalamic and&#xD;
      hippocampal regions. A wide range of extrapancreatic effects of GLP-1 have been observed such&#xD;
      as slowed gastric emptying and satiety-stimulating effects through hypothalamic mechanisms.&#xD;
      Recent studies have showed interesting results regarding protection of the heart during&#xD;
      ischemia, and protection of the brain in the acute phases of stroke have been proposed.&#xD;
      Over-all GLP-1 seems to display effects in heart, brain, vessels, kidneys, muscles and&#xD;
      liver(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, our group has in a very recent study been the first, by sophisticated&#xD;
      metabolic techniques, together with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), to demonstrate that&#xD;
      GLP-1 per se reduces cerebral glucose transport in total cerebral grey matter as well as&#xD;
      individual grey matter regions, thereby suggesting that GLP-1 may protect the brain by&#xD;
      limiting intracerebral glucose fluctuation when plasma glucose is increased. In other words,&#xD;
      GLP-1 regulates blood brain barrier (BBB) glucose transfer at normal glycemia and presumably&#xD;
      also during hyperglycemia(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1): T2D is characterized by several hormonal and metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities such as dysfunction of insulin secretion, glucagon excess, impaired&#xD;
      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone with numerous documented effects on the glycemic response. It is&#xD;
      one of the most potent insulinotropic agents known and is secreted from L-cells in the gut&#xD;
      mucosa in response to food ingestion. Effects on the islet-cells are (I) Amplification of&#xD;
      glucose dependent stimulation of insulin secretion (II) Inhibition of glucagon secretion. In&#xD;
      animal and cellular studies GLP-1 stimulates β-cell neogenesis, growth and differentiation,&#xD;
      and in vitro inhibition of β-cell apoptosis is observed. Thus GLP-1 is also a β-cell growth&#xD;
      factor. For now, treatment with GLP-1 has seldom caused hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Based on the findings in the above-mentioned study, we hypothesize that Native&#xD;
      GLP-1 during hyperglycemia will protect the brain in healthy men from hyperglycemia by&#xD;
      reducing blood-brain-barrier glucose transport and brain glucose metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: With well established methodology, to compare the effect of native GLP-1 and placebo,&#xD;
      respectively, on the consumption of glucose in the CNS assessed by uptake of&#xD;
      18-fluro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) monitored by PET-scan of healthy young men during hyperglycemic&#xD;
      pituitary-pancreatic clamp in the perspective of future prevention of macrovascular&#xD;
      complications of diabetes and possibly other diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the project: steady glucose metabolism in the brain during&#xD;
      hyperglycemia with native GLP-1 infusion compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, double-blinded crossover design. Every participant will be&#xD;
      CNS-PET-scanned twice in random order with GLP-1 and placebo-infusions interrupted by a 3-4&#xD;
      week wash-out period between study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed similarly to our previously conducted FDG/PET-study(21) and&#xD;
      pancreatic clamp as done by Nielsen et al.(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLP-1 is a natural peptide hormone that is degraded by the enzyme DPPIV after few minutes in&#xD;
      the circulation. The remaining hormones utilized in this study, are used as tools in the&#xD;
      investigational design and will not be used as medical compounds themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatostatin (Ferring) 300 μg/hour(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin Actrapid (NOVO Nordisk) 0,12 mU/kg/minute (22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucagon (NOVO Nordisk, Glucagen) 0.6 ng/kg/minute(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Growth hormone (NOVO Nordisk) 2 ng/kg/minute(22)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Native GLP-1 (PolyPeoptide) 1,2 pmol/kg/minute (23) Pancreatic and hyperglycemic clamp&#xD;
           Somatostatin is administered to inhibit endogenous production of GLP-1, insulin,&#xD;
           glucagon, and growth hormone. Insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone are administered to&#xD;
           achieve basal hormone levels. 20% glucose is infused to achieve hyperglycemic clamp with&#xD;
           plasma glucose at 9 mM which is by experience the highest level of hyperglycemia&#xD;
           possible while still avoiding breakthrough of natural counterregulatory hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: Apart from its documented effect on glycemic control, GLP-1 has potential protective&#xD;
      impact in the brain. Patients with type-2 diabetes carry a significantly increased risk of&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease and stroke that has not been substantially reduced by current&#xD;
      treatments. Preliminary data suggest that clinical use of GLP-1 can lead to improved&#xD;
      prophylaxis against late diabetic complications, which can be achieved in this patient group&#xD;
      in addition to improved glycemic control. This project is conducted to map the physiology of&#xD;
      GLP-1 in heathy during hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe the current study will provide deeper insight into the extra-pancreatic effects of&#xD;
      GLP-1, with the particular aim to develop efficient prophylaxis against late diabetic&#xD;
      cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications, which outweighs the known adverse effects&#xD;
      of the elements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles described in the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration II and will not be initiated before acceptance is granted from the local Ethics&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent from participants is required before studies can be commenced, and all&#xD;
      participants are covered by insurance according to &quot;Bekendtgørelse af lov om&#xD;
      patientforsikring&quot; and &quot;Lov om erstatning for lægemiddelskader&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent All participants will receive written and oral information about the purpose&#xD;
      and the expected scientific value of the project as well as detailed description of all&#xD;
      procedures and risks involved. Specifically, the participant will be told that participation&#xD;
      is completely voluntary, and withdrawal is accepted at any stage during the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project coordinator, Dr. Michael Gejl Jensen, will provide oral information and hand out&#xD;
      written material including the general information brochure &quot;Before you decide…..&quot; (&quot;Før du&#xD;
      beslutter dig…&quot;). The participant is allowed an accompanying person for the duration of the&#xD;
      meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent is collected after a minimum of 24 hours for further consideration. Both the&#xD;
      responsible physician and the participant sign the consent, and the latter will be provided a&#xD;
      copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Source data (original documentation of clinical findings, printouts, lab&#xD;
      results, and other details necessary to completely reconstruct each study) are stored in case&#xD;
      report forms and a common database. All personal information is locked away and inaccessible&#xD;
      to all but the investigators. Screening ID, randomization ID, and initials in the database&#xD;
      identify participants. The initials will be erased from the database after completion of the&#xD;
      study to ensure anonymity. A separate chart containing screening ID, randomization ID,&#xD;
      initials, and personal data will be stored at another location to allow re-identification of&#xD;
      source data. Social security numbers (Danish: CPR-numbers) are present on electronical&#xD;
      charts, which are kept in the individual electronical patient charts on the hospital server.&#xD;
      This information will only be accessible to personnel in the study-group and not to doctors&#xD;
      treating the patients in any future hospitalization. Data will automatically be erased from&#xD;
      the server after 15 years. The study will be disclosed to the local Data Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial aspects Each participant will receive dkr 2400 as compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applicant will provide the needed work in accordance with present rules and contracts&#xD;
      concerning research fellows at Institute of Pharmacology, University of Aarhus and the&#xD;
      Research Unit, Department of Endocrinology (M), Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
