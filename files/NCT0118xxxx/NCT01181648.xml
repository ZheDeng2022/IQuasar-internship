  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to learn about the quality of life patients have at&#xD;
      the end of treatment. Some patients' cancers are related to human papilloma virus or HPV;&#xD;
      others are not. HPV is a virus that can be sexually transmitted and is known to cause some&#xD;
      types of cancers. If your throat cancer was related to HPV, your doctor can discuss this with&#xD;
      you in detail. The investigators want to see if there are differences in quality of life&#xD;
      between patients whose cancers are caused by HPV and those who cancers are not caused by HPV.&#xD;
      Throat cancers caused by HPV behave differently than throat cancers not caused by HPV. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that patients with these two different types of throat cancer will also&#xD;
      have different experiences after completing therapy. The investigators would like to&#xD;
      understand what those differences are. The long-term goal of this study is to see what&#xD;
      symptoms most patients have. The investigators can then try to treat them earlier, and&#xD;
      hopefully, improve the symptoms. The investigators will also be able to plan more research to&#xD;
      improve treatment for symptoms following treatment for cancer of the mouth and throat.&#xD;

    <description>This study has two components. First, we will conduct a cross-sectional survey of 200 oropharynx cancer survivors, diagnosed with HPV+ tumors, who are at least 12 months from their last treatment. Second, in a subset of 20 survivors of HPV+ oropharynx cancer, we will conduct in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews addressing the psychosocial impact of the HPV diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Survivors will be asked to complete a brief, self-administered, paper-based survey to assess quality of life, mental health and employment status following completion of therapy. Second, in a subset of 20 survivors of HPV+ oropharynx cancer, we will conduct in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews addressing the psychosocial impact of the HPV diagnosis. A follow up letter will be sent to participants who do not return their completed study questionnaires.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified through a Dataline query. While Dataline&#xD;
        should capture most eligible patients, potential subjects can also be identified by a&#xD;
        member of the Head and Neck DMT.&#xD;
