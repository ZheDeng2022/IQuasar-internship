      This study is a blinded randomised study of slow release levobupivacaine vs saline for women&#xD;
      undergoing day case operative pelvic laparoscopy. Participants will be randomly given either&#xD;
      saline or levobupivacaine and efficacy will be measured using ranked ordinal pain scales and&#xD;
      rescue oral analgesia use.&#xD;

      METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a triple-blinded randomised control study to determine whether a continuous&#xD;
      intraperitoneal infusion of levobupivacaine 0.5%, when compared with normal saline 0.9%, in&#xD;
      women undergoing laparoscopic pelvic surgery as day-case, provides effective postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Need for 'rescue' analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain intensity (on movement and rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects from rescue analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction with pain relief&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women undergoing pelvic laparoscopic surgery as a day-case will be invited to take part&#xD;
      in the study. Women will be excluded if they are undergoing surgery for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-operative admission clinic women will receive written information explaining the&#xD;
      trial and inviting them to take part. If they agree to take part, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained on the morning that they arrive in the day ward for the laparoscopic procedure. At&#xD;
      the end of the intended laparoscopic procedure, the peritoneal cavity will be irrigated with&#xD;
      normal saline and then all the irrigation fluid will be removed through suction. The&#xD;
      multihole catheter will then be inserted percutaneously into the surgical area although it&#xD;
      will not be fixed into place. The catheter will be guided into place with the grasper or&#xD;
      irrigator so that the holed portion of the catheter is in the intended area for anaesthetic&#xD;
      infusion. The catheter will then be kept in place using a steri-strip to skin. Finally, the&#xD;
      laparoscopic trocar sites will be closed in the usual way. Women will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive either normal saline 0.9% or levobupivicaine 0.5%. Patients will be randomised at the&#xD;
      start of the procedure so that the infusion can be prepared in time to be started at the end&#xD;
      of the procedure. Randomisation will be undertaken using computer-generated random numbers,&#xD;
      which will be held off site. The syringes and reservoir bladders Page 2 of 5 Version no. - 2&#xD;
      12.10.08&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be consecutively numbered and randomly filled with either levobupivacaine or normal&#xD;
      saline using block randomisation in blocks of 10 to ensure equal number in each group. This&#xD;
      will ensure that the surgeons, the anaesthetist and the patient will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment group. In the event of an untoward incident the code will be broken, a sealed list&#xD;
      being kept on the labour ward cupboard where it will be available 24 hours a day . At the end&#xD;
      of the surgical procedure, a bolus of 5mls of the infusion will be delivered via the&#xD;
      catheter, following which the rate is set at 2ml per hour. Patients will be discharged home&#xD;
      in the usual way but will continue with the infusion for a total of 48 hours. Appropriate&#xD;
      training will be in place for the participants and a leaflet will be given to them for&#xD;
      support which will provide them with written instructions about the infusion device, how to&#xD;
      care for it and how to remove it after the 48 hour period. They will also be provided with a&#xD;
      telephone contact in case of any concerns about the infusion. Women who do not feel confident&#xD;
      in removing the catheter at home will be requested to attend the gynaecology ward to have it&#xD;
      removed by the gynaecology senior house officer. The participants will be provided with&#xD;
      emergency contact telephone numbers if there are any concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been calculated based on the results of the randomised controlled study&#xD;
      of bupivicaine versus normal saline in women undergoing an abdominal hysterectomy (Gupta et&#xD;
      al 2004). In Gupta's study, the bupivicaine group used a total of 30.5mg (SD 15.4) of&#xD;
      ketobemidone in the first 24 hours postoperatively. This compares to the placebo group, who&#xD;
      used 44.3mg (SD 21.6); a clinically significant difference of approximately 30% reduction in&#xD;
      pain in the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an alpha of 0.05, we require a total of 52 patients (26 in each arm) to achieve a&#xD;
      power of 90% (Beta = 0.1).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information relating to postoperative pain will be collected in a specifically designed&#xD;
      pain measurement booklet. This will be completed whilst in hospital and then taken home with&#xD;
      the patient for completion in the remaining 48 hours following surgery. The pages relating to&#xD;
      pain measures experienced in hospital will be recorded on duplicate paper so that one copy&#xD;
      can be retained in the medical records. Patients will be provided with a stamped addressed&#xD;
      envelope for returning the pain measurement booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analgesia used will be recorded by amount and time taken. Pain will be measured at rest&#xD;
      and on movement (walking and coughing) using a 10-point scale and will be taken at 1, 2, 3&#xD;
      and 4 hours. Thereafter the participants will be requested to record the pain intensity on&#xD;
      the evening of the operation, morning-after the operation, afternoon on the following day,&#xD;
      evening on the following day and on the second day after the operation i.e. 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively. Time 0 will be taken to represent the time the infusion was started. Nausea&#xD;
      will be measured on a 10-point scale and will be taken at for the 48 hour period while&#xD;
      recording the pain intensity. Hospital length of stay will be recorded in hours and charted&#xD;
      on the pain measurement booklet. Patient satisfaction will also be recorded as less than&#xD;
      satisfied; satisfied; good or excellent. All patients will be contacted by telephone 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively to enquire about their experiences of using the infusion device and to&#xD;
      request them to return the pain measurement booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance will be at the p=0.05 or less. SPSS software will be used to undertake the&#xD;
      analysis under the supervision of Mr. Robert Hills.&#xD;
