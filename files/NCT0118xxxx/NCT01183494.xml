  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the maximum dose of a certain chemotherapy drug&#xD;
      (irinotecan) that can be tolerated as part of a combination of drugs. There is a combination&#xD;
      of chemotherapy drugs typically used to treat cancer of the colon and rectum: 5-Flurouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan; the combination is known as FOLFIRI. At the present time,&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved this drug combination for the treatment&#xD;
      of cancers of the colon and rectum. The FDA has also approved the use of a drug called&#xD;
      bevacizumab (or Avastin) in combination with FOLFIRI, and this is considered one of the&#xD;
      standards of care for all patients with colon and rectal cancer which has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best dose of irinotecan to use in the combination of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab is not&#xD;
      known. Earlier studies have shown that higher doses of irinotecan can be used safely as part&#xD;
      of the FOLFIRI combination, but it is unclear whether these same doses will be safe when&#xD;
      bevacizumab is added to this combination.&#xD;

    <description>Participants with UGT1A1*/*1 genotype will receive escalating doses of FOLFIRI (folinic acid+fluorouracil+irinotecan) and bevacizumab. The initial dose of irinotecan will be 260 mg/m2 administered as a 120 min intravenous infusion every two weeks. The dosage of irinotecan will be increased to 310, 370, and 420 mg/m2, and further irinotecan doses will be increased by 14%. 5-FU will be administered as a 400 mg/m2 bolus right after the end of the irinotecan infusion, followed by 2,400 mg/m2 over a 46 h continuous infusion plus LV 200 mg/m2 every two weeks. Bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg over 15-30 min IV (after an initial 90 min infusion without a reaction) every two weeks. The first dose will be administrated on day 2 (48 hours after the first irinotecan administration), while the second dose on day 14 (the same day as the second irinotecan administration). No dose escalation will be performed for 5-FU, LV or bevacizumab.</description>
