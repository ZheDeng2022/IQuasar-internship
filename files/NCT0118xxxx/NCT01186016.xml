      This study will test the effects of an educational program about genetics and smoking on&#xD;
      smokers' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors before and after participating in smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment. This includes describing participants' knowledge about genetics and&#xD;
      smoking, their use of strategies to stop smoking, and experiences when quitting smoking. This&#xD;
      study will determine how smokers respond to information about genetics and smoking in&#xD;
      anticipation of using genetic information to individualize pharmacological therapy for&#xD;
      smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups will participate in this study. The experimental group will participate in two&#xD;
      educational sessions about genetics and smoking. The control group will participate in two&#xD;
      educational sessions about nutrition. Both the experimental and control groups will&#xD;
      participate in a standard, group smoking cessation program with 6 weeks of OTC transdermal&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy. Assignment to either of the two groups is random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary specific aim is to compare the effects of the experimental group to the attention&#xD;
      control group on smoking-related mental representations, appraisals, behaviors, and affective&#xD;
      responses over time. The secondary aim is to explore whether personality characteristics&#xD;
      (trait negative affectivity and curiosity) and educational level moderate the effects of the&#xD;
      genetic educational program on smoking-related mental representations, appraisals, behaviors,&#xD;
      and affective responses. The hypotheses of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When compared to the attention control group, the experimental group will demonstrate:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking-Related Mental Representations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Greater knowledge of genetic contributions to smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Greater endorsement of genetic contributions to smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  More positive attitudes towards NRT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increased abstainer and decreased smoker self-schemas&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking-Related Appraisal: greater perceived risk for genetic predispositions to&#xD;
                smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking-Related Behaviors: greater interest in genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When compared to the attention control group, the experimental group will differ in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking-Related Appraisals: self-efficacy for cessation and abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Smoking-Related Behaviors: number of quit attempts, abstinence, nicotine dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Affective Responses: negative affect and intrusive/avoidant thoughts&#xD;

      Background. Reducing cigarette smoking among adults is a major public health objective.&#xD;
      Although the target prevalence for adult smoking is &lt; 12% by 2010 (DHHS 2000), current&#xD;
      estimates indicate that 20.8%, or 45.3 million adults, currently smoke (CDC, 2007). An&#xD;
      estimated 44.2% of smokers tried to quit at least one day in the last 12 months (CDC, 2007),&#xD;
      yet &lt;10% of smokers who try to quit remain abstinent (Benowitz, 2008). Even with intensive&#xD;
      treatment, only 11-20% of smokers are abstinent for 6 months (Sutherland, 2003). Smoking also&#xD;
      results in an enormous economic burden, with health-care and lost productivity costs totaling&#xD;
      approximately $167 billion per year (CDC, 2008). A limitation of current treatment guidelines&#xD;
      is a lack of specificity for individual smokers. Completion of the sequencing of the human&#xD;
      genome and the current focus on genomics (Collins, Green, Guttmacher, &amp; Guyer, 2003) provides&#xD;
      an unprecedented opportunity to study the biobehavioral factors influencing smoking. This&#xD;
      research will contribute to individualized treatment by providing a better understanding of&#xD;
      the effects of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors and their interaction on&#xD;
      smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation, and relapse (Lerman, Schnoll &amp; Munafo, 2007;&#xD;
      Morgan et al., 2003; Swan et al., 2003). Both candidate gene studies to identify specific&#xD;
      genes that affect smoking and pharmacogenomic studies that investigate the effects of&#xD;
      selected genes on treatment response contribute to a growing body of knowledge about genetic&#xD;
      influences on smoking. The anticipated outcome of these studies will be the ability to&#xD;
      individualize type, dose, and duration of treatment based on smokers' genotypes (Lerman,&#xD;
      Schnoll &amp; Munafo). Ultimately, the long-term goal of this research is to decrease relapse and&#xD;
      promote sustained abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Genetic Education and Smoking Model provides a framework for investigating variables that&#xD;
      potentially influence the ways smokers respond to information about: (a) genetic&#xD;
      contributions to smoking and (b) the potential for genetically-informed cessation treatment.&#xD;
      Based on social-cognitive theory and the Common Sense Model (CSM)(Cervone, 2004; Brownlee,&#xD;
      Leventhal, &amp; Leventhal, 2000), the Genetic Education and Smoking Model proposes that genetic&#xD;
      education will influence smokers' mental representations and appraisals about genetics and&#xD;
      smoking in addition to their smoking-related behaviors and affective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As genetically-informed cessation treatment becomes a part of research and clinical care,&#xD;
      smokers will need a degree of genetic literacy to make informed decisions (McInerney, 2002;&#xD;
      Shields, Lerman, &amp; Sullivan, 2004). There is a growing body of scientific knowledge to guide&#xD;
      an educational program about genetic contributions to smoking and the potential for&#xD;
      genetically-informed cessation treatment. Epidemiologic twin studies consistently support a&#xD;
      genetic cause for smoking, with an estimated 56% of the variance for smoking initiation and&#xD;
      67% of progression to nicotine dependence due to additive genetic effects (Sullivan and&#xD;
      Kendler, 1999). Findings from several genome-wide scans using linkage analysis have&#xD;
      identified chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, and 21 as containing possible&#xD;
      susceptibility loci for smoking-related genes (Li,Cheng, Ma, &amp; Swan, 2003; Li, Ma, &amp; Beuten,&#xD;
      2004). Several candidate-genes for smoking heritability have been identified, including&#xD;
      nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), dopamine receptor (DRD2 and DRD4) and transporter&#xD;
      (SLC6A3) genes, the catechol-o-methyl-transferase (COMT) gene, the mu opioid receptor (OPRM1)&#xD;
      gene, and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene (Lerman, Schnoll, &amp; Munafo, 2007; Schnoll,&#xD;
      Johnson, &amp; Lerman, 2007). Polymorphisms of CYP2A6, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, play a major&#xD;
      role in the inactivation of nicotine to its metabolite, cotinine (Messina, Tyndale, &amp;&#xD;
      Sellers, 1997; Benowitz, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims. The primary specific aim is to compare the effects of the experimental group&#xD;
      to the attention control group on smoking-related mental representations, appraisals,&#xD;
      behaviors, and affective responses over time. The primary aim will be achieved using a&#xD;
      randomized, longitudinal, two-group repeated measures design to determine the direct effects&#xD;
      of the intervention on smoking-related mental representations, appraisals, behaviors, and&#xD;
      affective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to explore whether personality characteristics (trait negative&#xD;
      affectivity and curiosity) and educational level moderate the effects of the genetic&#xD;
      educational program on smoking-related mental representations, appraisals, behaviors, and&#xD;
      affective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim will be achieved with multiple and logistic regression to determine whether&#xD;
      personality traits and educational level moderate the effects of the intervention on the&#xD;
      identified smoking-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Participants will be assigned randomly to either the experimental or attention&#xD;
      control groups. The groups will be balanced for gender and number of cigarettes smoked per&#xD;
      day using stratified randomization (Friedman, Furberg, &amp; DeMets, 1996). Age and baseline data&#xD;
      for major study variables will be treated as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group, referred to as the Genetic Education Session (GES) group, will&#xD;
      receive education about two smoking-related genotypes, DRD2 and CYP2A6. The content of GES&#xD;
      session one is basic genetics and includes concepts and terminology, the impact of the Human&#xD;
      Genome Project on health-care and the use of genetic counseling and testing. The content of&#xD;
      GES session two is research about smoking and genetics. The content focuses on the&#xD;
      multifactorial nature of smoking; research findings about genetic contributions to smoking,&#xD;
      specifically for candidate genotypes DRD2 and CYP2A6; and potential applications of this&#xD;
      research for cessation treatment, including legal, ethical and social implications of&#xD;
      genotyping. To control for an attention placebo effect (Meltzoff, 1998), the control group&#xD;
      will receive information about nutritional guidelines as established by the USDA and FDA. The&#xD;
      attention control group will be referred to as the Nutritional Education Session (NES) group.&#xD;
      The content of NES sessions one and two are aimed at understanding and using dietary and food&#xD;
      safety guidelines. Following the genetic or nutritional education sessions, both groups will&#xD;
      receive a standard cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation intervention with NRT in the form&#xD;
      of transdermal nicotine (TN) patch. This intervention will be referred to as the standard&#xD;
      smoking cessation (SSC) sessions. SSC content focuses on the: (a) nature of nicotine&#xD;
      addiction; (b) use of self-change strategies in the form of self-monitoring, stimulus&#xD;
      identification and control, stress management, and relapse prevention; and (3) use of&#xD;
      nicotine replacement to manage craving and withdrawal symptoms. The SSC sessions consists of&#xD;
      four 2-hour group counseling sessions and one follow-up telephone call after the last&#xD;
      session. The intervention will occur over a 5-week period after the GES or NES. Participants&#xD;
      will receive a 6-week supply of TN patches in the following dosages: 21 mg/24hours for 4&#xD;
      weeks and 14 mg/24 hours for 2 weeks (Fiore Jaen, Baker al., 2008). A 1-week supply of&#xD;
      patches will be distributed during SSC sessions 2-3 and a 2-week supply will be distributed&#xD;
      at session 4. The final two weeks of free TN in 14 mg/24hours strength will be mailed to&#xD;
      participants' homes during week 7. Participants will be encouraged to purchase a two-week&#xD;
      supply of the 7 mg/24hours patches for the final two weeks of an 8-week course of TN. They&#xD;
      will also have the option of using combination therapy as recommended in the 2008 guideline,&#xD;
      to augment the TN with other NRT (gum, spray, inhaler) or bupropion SR. This option will be&#xD;
      explained at the time of obtaining informed consent so participants can visit their primary&#xD;
      care provider to obtain prescription medication (nicotine spray or inhaler or bupropion SR)&#xD;
      prior to the SSC. Data will be collected on use of TN alone or in the recommended&#xD;
      combinations. Expired air CO measurements will be conducted at each Session as&#xD;
      feedback/motivation for participants. Session 1 CO measurement will be used as the baseline&#xD;
      CO data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Data collection in the form of self report questionnaires will occur at four&#xD;
      time points, Time 1 through Time 4 (T1-T4). Baseline data collection (T1) will be followed by&#xD;
      randomization to the experimental or control group. T2 data will be collected in two parts&#xD;
      (T2a&amp;b) to obtain initial post-intervention data for variables pertaining to each of these&#xD;
      sessions: T2a will occur at the end of the education sessions (GES or NES) and T2b will occur&#xD;
      at the end of the SSC sessions (i.e., 6 weeks). T2a Questionnaires will be distributed at the&#xD;
      end of these sessions and return by the start of the SSC (Week 3). T2b questionnaires will be&#xD;
      distributed at the end of the SSC. Questionnaires will be returned by postage-paid mail by&#xD;
      Week 8. If needed, participants will be reminded to do this at the follow-up telephone&#xD;
      session. Two additional data collections (T3-T4) will occur at twelve weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      after the end of the SSC. T3-T4 data will consist of self-report questionnaires and in-person&#xD;
      measurement of expired air CO with salivary cotinine verification of abstinence for&#xD;
      participants not using NRT and whose CO measurement is &lt;8-10 ppm (Benowitz et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis. Preliminary analyses of the dependent variables will include frequency&#xD;
      distributions to look for outliers, descriptive statistics and plots to assess normality, and&#xD;
      bivariate scatterplots to evaluate linearity of relationships among study variables.&#xD;
      Statistical methods of dealing with nonnormality, such as transformations of the raw data,&#xD;
      may be employed prior to analysis. For all scales, internal consistency reliability&#xD;
      coefficients will be estimated. All primary analyses will be based on an intent-to-treat&#xD;
      paradigm. Each participant's data will be analyzed according to their randomized assignment,&#xD;
      regardless of whether they completed all intervention sessions. The analysis plan will be&#xD;
      carried out in order to work out any methodological issues, but because this is not a fully&#xD;
      powered study, significant findings are not expected at the .05 level. A more liberal level&#xD;
      of .10 will be used for significance tests, and emphasis will be placed on descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and estimating effect sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, the primary endpoint of mean change over time relative to baseline will be&#xD;
      compared for the experimental and control groups using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)&#xD;
      methodology (Laing &amp; Zeger, 1986). A model will be fit incorporating terms to test the&#xD;
      effects of the intervention and time, covarying for baseline values, for age, and for amount&#xD;
      smoked. An interaction term will also be included to test whether the rate of change over&#xD;
      time is the same for both groups. If difficulties occur with implementing GEE because of the&#xD;
      relatively small number of cohorts per group in the pilot study, the model may be simplified&#xD;
      to a cross-sectional analysis with individuals nested within cohorts at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, multiple and logistic regression will be used to predict the outcome variables&#xD;
      from the independent variables and tests of moderation will be conducted according to&#xD;
      procedures described by Baron &amp; Kenny (1986).&#xD;
