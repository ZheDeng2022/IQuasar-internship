      To investigate the clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with&#xD;
      multivessel disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) either in&#xD;
      infarct-related artery only or in multivessel in Drug eluting stents (DES) era, using the&#xD;
      everolimus-eluting stent (Promus™ Element™ Stent, Boston Scientific) in real-world clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) is a systemic prothrombotic milieu,&#xD;
      often involves more than one coronary artery, even though it predominantly affects plaque&#xD;
      rupture and its consequences in one coronary artery territory (culprit artery territory)(1).&#xD;
      Also, Multivessel disease (MVD), a well known predictor of poor clinical outcomes occurs in&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients (pts) between 40% and 65%(2, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In acute STEMI, achieving the maximum myocardial reperfusion and salvage by primary&#xD;
      percutaneous intervention of culprit lesion is the preferred reperfusion strategy as per the&#xD;
      latest ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines(4, 5). At presently there is no consensus regarding the&#xD;
      management of significant non culprit lesions during the initial presentation in&#xD;
      hemodynamically stable STEMI pts(6, 7).Although multivessel revascularization seems to&#xD;
      improve the myocardial reperfusion and its salvage by limiting infarct size, improving&#xD;
      ejection fraction (EF) and stabilizing the vulnerable plaques in acute AMI presentation,&#xD;
      revascularization of non IRAs yielded conflicting results in the BMS era(2, 7-13). Balancing&#xD;
      the above merits with increased risk of having higher periprocedural MI due to multivessel&#xD;
      stent implantations in non IRAs are paramount importance in deciding the revascularization&#xD;
      strategy in MVD STEMI pts(13-15). Drug eluting stents (DES) implantations after primary PCI&#xD;
      are increasing in the real world scenario after the establishment of its safety by the&#xD;
      multiple Meta analyses and few randomized trials(16-19).Even though DES reduces recurrent&#xD;
      revascularizations in acute STEMI pts, the merits and demerits of its usage in treating non&#xD;
      IRAs in multivessel disease pts with STEMI are largely unknown in this modern PCI era(16,&#xD;
      19). The aim of the study was to compare the clinical outcomes between culprit lesion&#xD;
      revascularization (CLR) group and complete revascularization (CR) group where CR group&#xD;
      includes treatment of both IRA and non IRAs) strategy in MVD STEMI pts in the real world&#xD;
      scenario utilizing DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is established as the treatment of choice&#xD;
      for acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). During the procedure, the&#xD;
      culprit artery recanalization allows reperfusion of the myocardium and improves healing of&#xD;
      the injured tissue (20, 21). Recent studies showed that in the AMI setting, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology involves the whole coronary artery tree (21), and nearly 40% to 65% patients&#xD;
      presenting with AMI have multivessel disease (22), (23), (24), (25) and plaque instability&#xD;
      might develop in a multifocal pattern, resulting in unstable plaques in anatomically remote&#xD;
      locations and may emerge as the cause of recurrent acute coronary syndrome. Current&#xD;
      guidelines of primary PCI recommend treating the culprit vessel in the urgent procedure,&#xD;
      leaving the other untreated vessels to another elective procedure. Multivessel PCI is&#xD;
      recommended only for patients with cardiogenic shock (20, 21, 26). By this strategy, the&#xD;
      operator intends to avoid the potential procedural complications that may deteriorate the&#xD;
      patient's left ventricular function and clinical condition during acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Therefore, only few reports describe the results of simultaneous non culprit&#xD;
      vessel PCI for patients undergoing mechanical reperfusion for STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An early study of primary PCI for patients with multivessel disease showed favorable results&#xD;
      with a strategy of staged percutaneous revascularization after acute recanalization of the&#xD;
      culprit artery (24). In recent years with the use of stents and platelet glycoprotein&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors, the outcome of elective multivessel PCI has markedly improved (27, 28).&#xD;
      More recent reports on simultaneous percutaneous revascularization of non-culprit arteries&#xD;
      indicate that this may be a good strategy for patients with AMI found to have multivessel&#xD;
      disease during primary angioplasty (29). According to some studies involving Coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery, complete revascularization showed to be associated with better&#xD;
      outcomes as compared with incomplete revascularizations (30), (31). In the Bare Metal Stent&#xD;
      (BMS) era, long term event free survival rates of patients undergoing primary intervention&#xD;
      for multivessel disease was shown to be as low as 48.5% (32). In-Stent Restenosis was seen as&#xD;
      one of the major drawback which varied from 8% to as high as 80% at 6 months, according to&#xD;
      both anatomic and clinical risk factors (33). However, introduction of Drug Eluting Stent&#xD;
      (DES) showed promising results and similar results with either PCI with DES or CABG for&#xD;
      patients with multivessel disease were seen(34), (35), [12].&#xD;
