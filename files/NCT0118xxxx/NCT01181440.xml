      This study randomly assigns patients with plantar diabetic foot ulcers to receive&#xD;
      conventional therapy (debridement, infection control, saline-moistened gauze dressings, and&#xD;
      standardized off-weighting) alone or conventional therapy plus Dermagraft(R). Dermagraft is a&#xD;
      device containing live human fibroblasts grown on an absorbable polyglactin (Vicryl) mesh.&#xD;
      Patients are evaluated weekly until Week 12, then every four weeks until Week 32.&#xD;
