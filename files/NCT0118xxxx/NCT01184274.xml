  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because SB939 has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and in&#xD;
      some people and seems promising, but we are not sure if it can offer better results than&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;

      In Part A of this study, SB939 was given to children with solid tumours. The purpose of Part&#xD;
      A of this study is to ind the highest dose of a new drug SB939 that can be giben to children&#xD;
      without causing very severe side effects that are tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B of this study, SB939 will be given to children with leukemia. The purpose of Part&#xD;
      B, is to see whether the dose that was determined to be the best dose for patients with solid&#xD;
      tumours is also the best dose for children with leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part C of this study, SB939 will be given together with 13-cis-retinoic acid. The purpose&#xD;
      of Part C, is to see whether the SB939 dose that was determined to be the best dose in Part A&#xD;
      is also the best dose when given in combination with 13-cis-retinoic acid.&#xD;
