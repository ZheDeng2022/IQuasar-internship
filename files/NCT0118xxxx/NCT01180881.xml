  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to follow up with all of the pediatric brain tumor patients who&#xD;
      received proton beam radiation therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for which&#xD;
      there is baseline neuropsychological testing in order to measure changes, if any, in&#xD;
      neurobehavioral functioning (executive skills, emotional/behavioral functioning, and adaptive&#xD;
      abilities) and their use of special education services at one year or more post-treatment.&#xD;
      The investigators will also correlate neurobehavioral data with pertinent clinical&#xD;
      information. Participation will be maximized through the use of mail-in, parental- and&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to longitudinally examine neurobehavioral functioning outcomes&#xD;
      and use of special education services in brain tumor and CNS tumor patients treated with&#xD;
      proton radiation at MGH. Furthermore, we seek to correlate neurobehavioral data with&#xD;
      pertinent clinical information. We anticipate better neurobehavioral functioning to be&#xD;
      associated with use of protons (vs. photons, as reported in the literature). We also&#xD;
      anticipate the need and utilization of special education services to be lower in brain and&#xD;
      CNS tumor patients treated with protons (vs. photons, as reported in the literature). Lastly,&#xD;
      we anticipate greater neurobehavioral deficits in patients whose proton radiation treatment&#xD;
      involved the craniospinal axis compared to those who received proton radiation to the&#xD;
      involved field.&#xD;
