  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new&#xD;
      experimental drug, demcizumab (OMP-21M18), when given in combination with gemcitabine with or&#xD;
      without (+/-) Abraxane®. Historically, single agent gemcitabine has been the standard&#xD;
      treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, recent data suggests that gemcitabine plus&#xD;
      Abraxane® may be superior to gemcitabine alone, thus this combination is emerging as the new&#xD;
      standard therapy for pancreatic cancer. However, Abraxane® has not been approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatic cancer at this time. Demcizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      and was developed to target cancer stem cells. This study is sponsored by OncoMed&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, which is referred to as OncoMed or the Sponsor in this consent form. The&#xD;
      study is designed to test the safety of demcizumab at different dose levels when given with&#xD;
      gemcitabine +/- Abraxane® and the effects, both good and bad, that it has on participants.&#xD;
      Demcizumab may block the growth of cancer stem cells, the remaining tumor cells, and it may&#xD;
      also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow and spread. Although&#xD;
      demcizumab has been administered with gemcitabine to cancer patients, it has not been given&#xD;
      in combination with gemcitabine and Abraxane®; thus, it is not known if it will provide any&#xD;
      benefit to participants and may cause harmful side effects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current cancer therapies often produce an initial reduction in tumour size but may not have&#xD;
      long term benefits. One possible explanation for this is the presence cancer cell known as a&#xD;
      cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells represent a small part of the tumour but are believed to&#xD;
      be responsible for much of the growth and spread of the cancer. They may also be more&#xD;
      resistant to traditional therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new&#xD;
      experimental drug, demcizumab, when given in combination with gemcitabine, a drug that is a&#xD;
      standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer that has not been treated previously with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Demcizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in the&#xD;
      laboratory) and was developed to target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles&#xD;
      demcizumab will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled at up to 8 centers in Australia, New Zealand, and Spain.&#xD;
      Up to 28 days (4 weeks) prior to treatment you will undergo testing to determine your&#xD;
      eligibility to take part in this study, and then if you are enrolled in the study you will&#xD;
      receive intravenous (in the vein) infusions of the demcizumab administered once every 2&#xD;
      weeks, and gemcitabine and Abraxane® administered weekly for 3 weeks, out of every 4 weeks.&#xD;
      After 9 weeks, you will undergo assessments to determine the status of your disease. If there&#xD;
      is no evidence of progression of your disease or if your tumor is smaller, you will continue&#xD;
      to receive one additional infusion of demcizumab, and you will continue to receive infusions&#xD;
      of gemcitabine and Abraxane® once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks until&#xD;
      it has been shown that your cancer has progressed. You will undergo assessments every 8 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter to determine the status of your disease. If there is no evidence of progression of&#xD;
      your disease or if your tumor is smaller, you will continue to receive one additional&#xD;
      infusion of demcizumab, and you will continue to receive infusions of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      Abraxane® once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks until it has been shown&#xD;
      that your cancer has progressed. You will undergo assessments every 8 weeks thereafter to&#xD;
      determine the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to routine testing of blood and urine (for complete blood counts with&#xD;
      differential and platelets, coagulation studies to determine how quickly your blood is&#xD;
      clotting , serum chemistries, B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP] and Troponin I which indicates&#xD;
      how well your heart if working, and urinalysis), special tests will be performed during the&#xD;
      study at specific time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, you will have and ECG and Doppler echocardiogram performed during screening,&#xD;
      then every 28 days on study and at treatment termination. Your Doppler echocardiograms may be&#xD;
      sent to a Cardiologist at another hospital who may perform a central read on some of the&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiograms in this study. Finally, you will have a head CT or MRI at baseline&#xD;
      and CT scans and/or other radiographs performed every 56 days to assess the status of your&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes an optional part which will investigate how variations in people's genetic&#xD;
      makeup affect their response to medications. This involves the collection of one blood sample&#xD;
      just before participants receive their first dose of study treatment. DNA will be extracted&#xD;
      from the blood sample for testing.&#xD;
