    <textblock>
      Asthma is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation in the airways. Recent research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that one of the reasons for the chronic inflammatory state is an imbalance&#xD;
      between oxidative stress and antioxidative defenses in patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Green tea is a common beverage consumed by Chinese patients from all walks of life. Green tea&#xD;
      contains chemical components that are thought to have immunomodulatory actions in chronic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to recruit 35 patients with stable asthma. Recruited subject will&#xD;
      be given oral tablets containing Green tea extract (GTE) to be taken daily for three months.&#xD;
      Clinical follow up and assessment will be done at baseline, on completion of GTE intake at&#xD;
      three months, and at three months after GTE intake has been stopped. A questionnaire on their&#xD;
      health status and the frequency of symptoms and use of bronchodilators and inhaled steroids&#xD;
      will be completed, spirometry will be done and a venous blood sample will be taken during&#xD;
      recruitment and during each reassessment at 3 and 6 months. Measurement of&#xD;
      oxidants/antioxidants (GSH, GSSG, SOD, CAT and GPx) will be carried out on the blood samples.&#xD;
      Oxidants/antioxidants will be compared and correlated with lung function results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would provide us with pilot data as to whether GTE, a strong antioxidant with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory actions, has any effect on reducing the oxidative stress and improving the&#xD;
      antioxidant status in patients with asthma and whether these changes are accompanied&#xD;
      improvement in clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Green tea extract (GTE) reduces oxidative stress and improves antioxidant defenses&#xD;
      in Chinese patients with asthma&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Asthma constitutes a significant health problem both in Hong Kong and worldwide (1).&#xD;
           Different risk factors for asthma have been identified. These include atopy (2), family&#xD;
           history of asthma, exposure to indoor aeroallergens (3) air pollution (4) and exposure&#xD;
           to environmental tobacco smoke (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Asthma is associated with a chronic inflammatory state in the airway. The inflammatory&#xD;
           component is thought to result from an imbalance between an increased free radical&#xD;
           formation (oxidative stress) and a reduction of antioxidative defenses. Reactive oxygen&#xD;
           species (ROS) such as superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide were found to be&#xD;
           increased in patients with asthma indicating the presence of oxidative stress, and the&#xD;
           increased level of ROS has also been found to correlate with asthma severity (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The airway displays a wide range of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses,&#xD;
           including reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and&#xD;
           glutathione peroxidase (GPx). There is evidence of reduced antioxidant defenses, namely&#xD;
           GPx and SOD activity, in asthma patients (6). Furthermore, the measurement of the&#xD;
           oxidized form of glutathione, (glutathione disulfide, GSSG) could be used as an index to&#xD;
           reflect the degree of oxidative stress in asthma and the level of GSSG has been reported&#xD;
           to be high in the bronchial washings of asthma patients (7). We have reported that&#xD;
           patients with asthma showed significantly increased erythrocyte GSSG, SOD and catalase&#xD;
           activities with concomitant reduction of erythrocyte GPx (8). These results indicate a&#xD;
           state of increased oxidative stress accompanied by an altered state of systemic&#xD;
           antioxidant status in asthma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Green tea represents one of the common beverages consumed by people from all walks of&#xD;
           life. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the major polyphenol (catechin) in green tea.&#xD;
           Green tea extract (GTE) demonstrates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.&#xD;
           GTE has been shown to damp down neutrophil chemotaxis and attenuates&#xD;
           interleukin-mediated inflammatory reaction cascades (9). It has also been shown to&#xD;
           attenuate lung injury in experimental mouse model (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
           This proposal is to investigate the effects of GTE on systemic oxidative and&#xD;
           antioxidative status, and whether these changes are associated with changes in clinical&#xD;
           status in local Chinese patients with stable asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research plan and methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine and compare erythrocyte levels of GSSG, SOD, CAT and GPx in patients with&#xD;
           asthma after 3 months of treatment with GTE and after GTE has been stopped for an&#xD;
           equivalent period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine and compare plasma levels of inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP)&#xD;
           and inflammatory mediators, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is an intervention study with patients serving as their own control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to recruit out-patients with asthma in stable clinical condition&#xD;
      and have no acute asthmatic attack in the recent 3 months prior to recruitment. After initial&#xD;
      assessment, recruited patients will be given GTE to be taken three times a day for 3 months.&#xD;
      They will be reassessed at 3 months when GTE will be stopped and again at the end of 6&#xD;
      months. The clinical status and biochemical parameters when they are on GTE will be compared&#xD;
      with similar parameters when they are not on GTE.&#xD;
