      The study is designed to determine the effect of weekly intramuscular (IM) administration of&#xD;
      30 mcg Avonex (interferon beta 1a) on safety parameters and gadolinium (Gd) enhanced and&#xD;
      T2-weighted cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed (using revised McDonald criteria) relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, open-label, safety study to support registration of Avonex in China by&#xD;
      providing data on the effect of weekly IM administration of 30mcg Avonex on safety parameters&#xD;
      in Chinese patients with clinically diagnosed relapsing MS. This study will also include an&#xD;
      intra-subject exploratory comparison of pre-treatment MRI (at -3 months and at month 0) and&#xD;
      post -treatment MRI (at month 3 and month 6). Up to 60 subjects with relapsing forms of MS&#xD;
      will be recruited to approximately 6 sites in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will consist of screening, a 6 month open-label treatment period, and follow&#xD;
      up at 30 days post-dosing. There will be a total of 8 clinic visits and 1 telephone contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: will be determined 3 months +/- 7 days prior to subjects' first dose of Avonex on&#xD;
      Day 1, at which time a screening MRI with and without Gd-enhancement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period: consists of eligible patients undergoing pre-dosing assessments and&#xD;
      receiving the first dose of Avonex on day 1. Subjects will have a brain MRI within 48 hours&#xD;
      prior to the first injection of Avonex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly doses of open-label Avonex 30mcg IM will be administered for 24 consecutive weeks for&#xD;
      a total of 25 injections per subject. Subjects or their caregivers will be allowed to&#xD;
      self-inject after successful completion of appropriate IM injection training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic at weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24 for safety and laboratory&#xD;
      assessments (including blood sample collection for pharmacodynamic (neopterin) and&#xD;
      immunogenicity testing), and clinician injection site assessments. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      brain MRI with and without Gd enhancement at week 12 and week 24. Subjects will perform&#xD;
      injection site pain assessments on day 1 and at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 recording results on&#xD;
      a visual analog scale. Subjects who prematurely discontinue Avonex may remain in the study&#xD;
      and continue protocol-scheduled visits/evaluations (with the exception of subject and&#xD;
      clinician injection site assessments and neopterin sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who experience new or worsening symptoms suggestive of an MS relapse will have a&#xD;
      neurological worsening visit within 5 days following onset of symptoms. Treatment of&#xD;
      confirmed MS relapses will follow a protocol-specified regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post treatment period: subjects will undergo follow-up assessment at week 24 (at 24+/- 8&#xD;
      hours following their last Avonex injection, if applicable). Subjects will have a telephone&#xD;
      follow up contact conducted 30 (+/- 7 days) after their last study visit to assess AEs and&#xD;
      use of concomitant medications.&#xD;
