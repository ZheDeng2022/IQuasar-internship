      The primary objective of this two-phase trial is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the elimination half-life of NVP in HIV positive pregnant women receiving&#xD;
           it as a single dose in labour in addition to the ZDV and 3TC with or without seven days&#xD;
           phenytoin (pilot PK phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine NVP resistance in HIV positive pregnant women receiving it as a single dose&#xD;
           in labour in addition to ZDV and 3TC with or without seven days phenytoin (main trial&#xD;
           phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this two-phase trial are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of single dose nevirapine with seven days phenytoin as a part of&#xD;
           ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT vs. single dose of nevirapine without phenytoin as a part of&#xD;
           ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the HIV status of the infant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of the ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT with seven days of phenytoin on&#xD;
           the newborn&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: phenytoin reduces the elimination half life of SD NVP and thereby decreases&#xD;
      development of resistance to NVP in HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian and Zambian women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial (VITA2) will be done with phenytoin as enzyme inducer to decrease the elimination&#xD;
      half-life of NVP as it has also shown a significant difference in the elimination half-life&#xD;
      of NVP in the ENVI study and side effects were also transient and mild. The guidelines for&#xD;
      ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT has been changed to a more complex regimen. Therefore addition of&#xD;
      phenytoin OD for 7 days after delivery will not complicate the regimen for the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tanzania and Zambia are among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa most affected by the HIV&#xD;
      pandemic. In 2008, an estimated 85,000 children were living with HIV in Zambia and out of the&#xD;
      89,000 children born to HIV infected women, 28,000 are infected annually. In Tanzania,&#xD;
      140,000 children were living with HIV in 2007. Both countries use NVP alone or in combination&#xD;
      with other drugs as ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. Little data are available on the extent of NVP&#xD;
      resistance in the Tanzanian, Zambian PMTCT setting. Moreover, there is no data available on&#xD;
      the follow-up of mother-infant pair with particular focus on resistance to NVP and the&#xD;
      infants HIV status. No studies have explored possibilities of reducing NVP resistance by use&#xD;
      of an enzyme inducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to the effect of phenytoin on the pharmacokinetics of NVP and the&#xD;
      development of NVP resistance on SD NVP as part of the ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT. This&#xD;
      intervention will be part of the VITA2 trial to test the hypothesis that phenytoin reduces&#xD;
      the elimination half life of SD NVP and thereby decreases development of resistance to NVP in&#xD;
      HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian and Zambian women.&#xD;
