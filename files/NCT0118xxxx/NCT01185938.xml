  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study, prospective, randomized trial evaluating the acute (in-hospital)&#xD;
      pleiotropic and clinical effects of a hydrophilic statin (rosuvastatin) in patients with&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether, in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes not taking statins in chronic administration, high doses of a hydrophilic statin&#xD;
      (rosuvastatin) administered before coronary angiography and/or angioplasty, may exert a&#xD;
      renal-protective effect by reducing the incidence of contrast nephropathy. Contrast induced&#xD;
      nephropathy is defined as increased values of creatinine &gt;= 0.3 mg/dl from baseline values,&#xD;
      within 72 hours after contrast medium exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points: 1) verify if short-term (&lt;48 hours)statin administration reduces the&#xD;
      peak levels and the curve areas of markers of myocardial necrosis throughout the&#xD;
      hospitalization period and if reduces the occurrence of periprocedural infarction.&#xD;
      Biochemical markers (quantitative creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) mass and Troponin I) are&#xD;
      measured at admission and at 6, 12, and 24 hours during the first day then once daily,&#xD;
      immediately before angiography, and 24 hours thereafter. In patients who underwent coronary&#xD;
      angioplasty (PCI), biochemical markers were measured at 12 and 24 hours after the procedure.&#xD;
      Data were fitted, peak values and curve areas calculated; the occurrence of periprocedural&#xD;
      infarction was defined as a CK-MB mass elevation more than three times the upper limit of&#xD;
      normal within 24 hours after PCI. 2) determine the distribution of peripheral lymphocytic&#xD;
      populations at the entry and at discharge using the flow cytometric analysis; 3) analyze the&#xD;
      clinical composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization,&#xD;
      dialysis and stroke at 30 days and 6 months.&#xD;
