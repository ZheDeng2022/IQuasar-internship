    <textblock>
      The thoracolumbar segment fractures are the most frequent along the spine, and surgical&#xD;
      treatment is indicated in unstable fractures. Surgical treatment has been performed through&#xD;
      the posterior fixation pedicle fixation systems, and where necessary complemented by&#xD;
      decompression of the spinal arthrodesis and previous channel. Surgical treatment has been&#xD;
      performed by conventional open approach through the posterior incision on the midline, and&#xD;
      detachment and removal of paraspinal muscles to access the posterior vertebral elements. The&#xD;
      percutaneous minimally invasive surgery was introduced in the context of spinal surgery to&#xD;
      reduce the morbidity associated with conventional open approach. It has been reported the&#xD;
      lowest bleeding intra- and postoperative period, less pain, shorter hospital stay,&#xD;
      rehabilitation and return to work faster with less use of minimally invasive percutaneous&#xD;
      approach of the spine. However, predominates in the literature of clinical case reports and&#xD;
      few prospective and randomized clinical trials. The performance of prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials have been required for the evaluation of the benefits of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery in the treatment of the thoracolumbar spine fractures. The objective of the study is&#xD;
      to compare the surgical treatment of fractures of the thoracolumbar spine using the&#xD;
      conventional open approach or minimally invasive percutaneous approach to the stabilization&#xD;
      of the vertebral segment affected, and using similar type of pedicle spinal fixation system.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in the preoperative, postoperative, 1,2,3,6,12 and 24 months by&#xD;
      parameters related to the perioperative (intraoperative bleeding, surgery time), clinical&#xD;
      (VAS, SF-36, HADS, EQ-5D-5L), images (radiographs and computed tomography). The study results&#xD;
      will impact the guidelines of the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures and may&#xD;
      indicate the advantages or disadvantages of using surgery through conventional open approach&#xD;
      to minimally invasive percutaneous surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: Fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine are the most frequent fractures of&#xD;
      the axial skeleton, and correspond to about 89% of vertebral fractures. Two-thirds of these&#xD;
      fractures occur in the thoracolumbar transition between T11 and L2 (50% of thoracic spine&#xD;
      fractures at T12 level and 60% of lumbar spine fractures at L1 level). Surgical treatment of&#xD;
      thoracolumbar spine fractures has been indicated in unstable fractures with the aim of&#xD;
      stabilizing the fractured vertebral segment and allowing early rehabilitation without the use&#xD;
      of external immobilization and rest in the bed. Conventional surgical treatment has been&#xD;
      performed by means of fixation and posterior arthrodesis of the vertebral segment using&#xD;
      pedicle fixation systems with or without arthrodesis The scientific challenge of the project&#xD;
      is to carry out this method of pioneering study in our country, as no prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial has been performed in our country to compare the outcome of surgical treatment&#xD;
      of thoracolumbar spine fractures through conventional open surgery or surgery Minimally&#xD;
      invasive percutaneous. There are few reports of prospective and randomized trials on this&#xD;
      subject and its implementation has been stimulated to increase the level of evidence related&#xD;
      to the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study will be to compare the results of treatment of thoracolumbar spine&#xD;
      fractures through the open approach (conventional surgery) or percutaneous (minimally&#xD;
      invasive) approach with a pedicle fixation system without vertebral arthrodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that minimally invasive percutaneous surgery has the advantage&#xD;
      of producing less surgical trauma with less intra- and postoperative bleeding, lower pain&#xD;
      intensity, shorter hospitalization time and lower rate of complications, and postero-lateral&#xD;
      arthrodesis Is not required in the treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the clinical and radiographic evaluation (simple radiographs, CT and MRI if necessary)&#xD;
      of the patients the fracture will be classified according to the classification Magerl et&#xD;
      al., and the therapeutic planning defined. Fractures with surgical indication by means of the&#xD;
      posterior approach will be selected for the study and the randomization process performed&#xD;
      individually for each type of fracture (A, B and C) according to the Magerl classification.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized and assigned to two groups: A - conventional open surgery and B -&#xD;
      minimally invasive percutaneous surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment will be performed by stabilizing the fractured vertebral segment (proximal&#xD;
      vertebra and vertebra distal to fractured vertebra and fractured vertebra) by means of a 6.5&#xD;
      mm or 6.5 mm diameter polyaxial pedicle screw system. In the fractured proximal and distal&#xD;
      vertebrae, screws will be used up to the vertebral body and in fractured vertebra shorter&#xD;
      screws that do not penetrate the vertebral body will be used. In the fractured vertebra,&#xD;
      single or bilateral pedicle screw will be used according to the degree of involvement of the&#xD;
      pedicle of the fractured vertebra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vertebral fixation system will be applied through the conventional open approach (group&#xD;
      A) or minimally invasive percutaneous approach (group B) according to allocation after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated through perioperative, clinical, and radiographic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of surgery - time elapsed between incision and closure of the skin. Intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding - a measure of the amount of blood evaluated by the amount of blood drawn and blood&#xD;
      from the compresses and gauzes used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative bleeding - a measure of the amount of blood aspirated through the drain and&#xD;
      measured in the postoperative gauze pads and dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of use of fluoroscopy. Postoperative walking time Length of hospital stay Drugs used in&#xD;
      the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual pain scale (VAS) - evaluated in the preoperative period, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 postoperative&#xD;
      days, 1,2,3,6,12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Outcomes Study 36 - Item Short - Form Health Survey (SF-36) HADS - Hospital Anxiety&#xD;
      Depression Scale EQ-5D-5L Dennis Pain and Work Scale Pain Assessment Scale (Dennis) P1:&#xD;
      absence of pain P2: minimal occasional pain; No need for medication. P3: Moderate pain,&#xD;
      occasional medication and no interruption of professional or daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P4: moderate or severe pain, occasional absence of work, significant change in daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P5: constant, severe pain, use of chronic analgesic medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work ability assessment scale (Dennis) W1: return to previous work (heavy arm activity) or&#xD;
      heavy physical activities W2: return to previous work (sedentary) or heavy physical labor&#xD;
      with restrictions W3: unable to return previous plus works full time in another activity W4:&#xD;
      unable to return full time to work W5: does not work, totally disabled They were evaluated in&#xD;
      the immediate postoperative period, 1,2,3,6,12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic Parameters Simple radiographs in AP and profile - location, fracture&#xD;
      classification, assessment of vertebral body height, evaluation of Farcy's sagittal index,&#xD;
      fractured kyphosis, fractured vertebral kyphosis, intervertebral disc height above and below&#xD;
      fractured vertebra, alignment in AP, (preoperative, immediate postoperative, 1,2,3,6,12 and&#xD;
      24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alignment in the coronal plane will be performed by measuring the angle of Cobb between the&#xD;
      line parallel to the proximal vertebral plaque of the vertebra above the fractured vertebra&#xD;
      and distal vertebral plate below the fractured vertebra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The height of the vertebral body will be evaluated by means of the percentage of compression&#xD;
      of the vertebral body in relation to the adjacent segments. The height of the vertebral body&#xD;
      above (V1) and below (V2) of the fractured vertebra (V3) is considered using the following&#xD;
      formula:% compression = [(A1 + A3) / 2-A2] / (A1 + A3) / 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The kyphosis of the fractured segment will be assessed by the angle formed by the line&#xD;
      parallel to the superior vertebral plate of the vertebra proximal to the fractured vertebra&#xD;
      and by the line of the inferior vertebral plate of the vertebra distal to the fractured&#xD;
      vertebra The sagittal index of the fractured segment (Farcy Index) will be calculated using&#xD;
      the height of the proximal vertebra (A1), height of the fractured vertebra (A2) and height of&#xD;
      the distal vertebra. Sagittal index of the fractured segment = (A3): 100- (2xA2 / A1 + A3)&#xD;
      x100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography - morphology and type of fracture, percentage of compression of the&#xD;
      vertebral canal, positioning of the screws (preoperative and immediate postoperative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression of the vertebral canal will be evaluated by measuring the sagittal diameter of&#xD;
      the vertebral canal (Fig. 8) and the direct measurement of the cross-sectional area of the&#xD;
      vertebral canal using scanning to delimit its perimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positioning of the screws inside the pedicles will be evaluated by means of tomographic&#xD;
      cuts of 2mm. Correct positioning will be considered when the pedicle screw is fully encircled&#xD;
      by the vertebral pedicle and the cortical vertebra is not perforated. The perforation will be&#xD;
      classified as small (≤2mm), medium (2.1-4mm) and severe (&gt; 4mm), and the perforation site:&#xD;
      medial, lateral, superior, posterior will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of implant release, implant breakage and fracture consolidation, loss of&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography - evaluation of the paravertebral musculature - Evaluation of the&#xD;
      transverse sectional area and fat infiltration in the paravertebral musculature by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CT examinations performed to evaluate the position of the metallic implants, fracture&#xD;
      type and the evolution of the morphology of the vertebral body will also be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the paravertebral musculature. In this way it will be possible to compare the effect of each&#xD;
      of the fixation techniques on the musculature trophism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be performed by a senior radiologist with more than fifteen years of&#xD;
      experience in musculoskeletal radiology and with experience in evaluation using quantitative&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient images will be anonymized and presented to the radiologist through the Osirix imaging&#xD;
      software at random. The observer will not be aware of the clinical and surgical information&#xD;
      at the time of the measurements to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two other researchers, a radiologist and a spine surgeon will perform this classification&#xD;
      independently, so as to enable the analysis of Interobserver reproducibility of the&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General risks, local and adverse effects - risks will be defined as any incident, change in&#xD;
      treatment or normal progress regardless of whether or not it is associated with the treatment&#xD;
      being evaluated. The predicted risks related to thoracolumbar spine fractures and their&#xD;
      surgical treatment are superficial infection, deep infection, epidural hematoma, duramater&#xD;
      injury, inadequate position of pedicle screws, radiculopathy, fractured vertebral segment&#xD;
      kyphosis, instability, pain uncontrollable to treatment , Failure of implants, degeneration&#xD;
      of adjacent segments, pressure ulcers and reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse effects will be considered as any undesirable medical event that the study&#xD;
      participant presents (death, deep venous thrombosis, septicemia, pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
      pneumonia, urinary tract infection, acute respiratory failure, multiple organ failures,&#xD;
      hospitalization, prolonged failure of the implants Or intraoperative adverse effects).&#xD;
