  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to to determine whether direct, tailored messaging to&#xD;
      patients prior to scheduling colonoscopy will increase patient adherence to provider&#xD;
      recommendation for screening colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized trial. All eligible subjects (patients&#xD;
      identified to be contacted to schedule screening colonoscopy) will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      three study arms: usual scheduling process (control), a generic message arm, or a tailored&#xD;
      message arm. Patients in the &quot;tailored message&quot; arm will receive a telephone call and be&#xD;
      asked a series of questions that will be used to assign patients to one of four messaging&#xD;
      cohorts. After these questions have been answered, the patient will then receive a tailored&#xD;
      message corresponding to his or her respective messaging cohort, encouraging them to schedule&#xD;
      a colonoscopy with a directed script. In the &quot;generic message&quot; arm, patients will receive a&#xD;
      telephone call and be asked to answer the same series of questions as the &quot;tailored message&quot;&#xD;
      group, then receive a single, standard script encouraging them to schedule a colonoscopy.&#xD;
