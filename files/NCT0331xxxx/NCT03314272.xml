  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate a fully automated algorithm&#xD;
      for the establishment of glycemic control in diabetic patients and to compare the results&#xD;
      with routine management of hyperglycemia in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Upon admission of the patients to the hospital, demographic and physiological data will be&#xD;
      collected including waist circumference and BMI. A set of baseline laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      done for each patient including: glucose level, Hba1c, lipid profile, creatinine level, liver&#xD;
      enzymes and micro albumin/creatinine urinary ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked about the presence of any diabetes complications: nephropathy,&#xD;
      retinopathy and/or neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the induction room, an intravenous cannula will be inserted by an experienced&#xD;
      anesthesiology staff or resident. A three way stopcock will be connected directly to the&#xD;
      cannula. Standard monitors (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and oxygen saturation) will be&#xD;
      connected to the patient. An arterial line will be inserted by the anesthesia resident under&#xD;
      sterile conditions using 20 gauge angiocatheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be started. A baseline glucose level will be taken from a blood gas&#xD;
      sample, from the arterial line inserted at the beginning of the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Control group, patients' glucose levels will be managed as per the anesthesiologist&#xD;
      and/or the anesthesia resident in charge of intraoperative anesthesia management of the&#xD;
      patients. The patient will be given actrapid insulin using the glucose sliding scale for&#xD;
      diabetic patients as set by the protocol set at AUBMC (mentioned in methodology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthesia resident will be just asked to take a blood gas sample for the patient every&#xD;
      30 minutes without telling him/her about the purpose of the study, so he/she will be blinded&#xD;
      and will act accordingly (including administering insulin to the patient or just monitoring&#xD;
      the blood glucose levels without intervening). At the end of the surgery a copy of the blood&#xD;
      gas samples and chart of the patients will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Experimental group, patients will be treated using an automated protocol consisting of&#xD;
      an insulin infusion pump named The Space Glucose Control System by B. Braun, in Melsungen,&#xD;
      Germany. The Space Glucose Control system is a Class IIb medical device. The manufacturer, B.&#xD;
      Braun, received the first CE mark in June 2004. The most recent renewal was in May 2013. At&#xD;
      the bottom of this system, a central user interface is connected with a touch screen&#xD;
      interface in order to enter the data. The glucose reading as measured has to be entered&#xD;
      manually by the medical house staff (anesthesia resident) via the touch screen display. Based&#xD;
      on this input the system gives advice on the insulin infusion rate. The suggested insulin&#xD;
      infusion is displayed on the screen, but has to be entered manually and therefore confirmed&#xD;
      by the medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For glucose measurement, a sample of blood gas will be taken every half an hour. Actrapid HM&#xD;
      will be used in a 4IU/ ml concentration for infusion in a 50 ml syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The range of glucose will be recorded throughout the intra-operative period. The number of&#xD;
      hypoglycemic (&lt;70mg/dl) and hyperglycemic (&gt; 200mg/dl) events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin allergy in patients with diabetes mellitus is a rare condition. Signs and symptoms&#xD;
      including angioedema, hypotension, urticaria and rash, if present, are usually noticed&#xD;
      immediately following the injection. Patients suspected of having insulin allergy will be&#xD;
      treated by stopping the infusion, administering antihistaminic H2 and H1 blockers,&#xD;
      corticosteroids and pressors depending on the magnitude of the allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia defined as blood glucose level less than 70 mg/dl, will be detected and treated&#xD;
      promptly to provide a rise in blood glucose to a safe level in order to eliminate any&#xD;
      potential harm. The intervention will include intravenous infusion of 100 to 200 ml of D5&#xD;
      water over 1 to 3 minutes and repeating blood glucose level after 15 minutes to reach a&#xD;
      target blood sugar of 100. The same intervention will be repeated in case this level wasn't&#xD;
      reached and patient will be withdrawn from the study after two failed correction and will be&#xD;
      treated more aggressively with an infusion of D10W.&#xD;
