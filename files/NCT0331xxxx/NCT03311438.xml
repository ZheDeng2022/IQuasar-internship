      Background: Children with congenital heart defects (CHD) are reported to have poorer oral&#xD;
      health compared with healthy children. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of an intensive oral health care program among children with CHD followed from infancy&#xD;
      to the age of five years, by comparing their oral health status at five years with a control&#xD;
      group of children with CHD who had not received the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In this longitudinal study, children in western Norway with a need for lifelong&#xD;
      follow-up due to congenital heart defects were invited to participate (n=119). Children born&#xD;
      in 2008-2011 were offered a promotive oral health intervention program from infancy to the&#xD;
      age of five years. The outcome measures for evaluating the intervention were dental caries&#xD;
      prevalence, dental erosion, plaque index and gingival bleeding index. The data of the&#xD;
      intervention group were compared with cross sectional oral health data of five year old&#xD;
      controls with CHD born 2005-2007 (already published).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective longitudinal design study, including four cohorts of children with CHD&#xD;
      (born 2008-2011) who required lifelong follow-up for their CHD. Parents, who did not respond&#xD;
      to the initial letter of invitation for their child, received a reminder by mail two months&#xD;
      later. All children in the intervention group were recruited before three years of age. A&#xD;
      total of 119 children (66 girls) were invited to participate and receive an oral health&#xD;
      intervention; at baseline (below three years), at first follow-up (three years) and at second&#xD;
      follow-up (five years). Because parents were responsible for their young children's oral&#xD;
      health, we found no reason to exclude children with co-morbidities such as Down's syndrome,&#xD;
      Di George syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Williams's syndrome and&#xD;
      autism. According to their CHD, the children were divided in three groups; i) left-to-right&#xD;
      shunts, e.g. atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect, ii) obstructions, e.g.&#xD;
      coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis, and pulmonary stenosis, and iii) complex heart&#xD;
      defects, e.g. tetralogy of Fallots, transposition of the great arteries and hypoplastic left&#xD;
      or right heart syndromes. At five years, data on oral health and oral health related&#xD;
      background factors were compared with corresponding published data of 5-year-old children&#xD;
      with CHD, also from Western Norway (n=67, born 2005-2007). The latter group served as&#xD;
      controls. These children were recruited at the age of five years and had not been offered the&#xD;
      intensive oral health intervention program received by children in the intervention group.&#xD;
      The control group had been followed in the PDS in line with the general population of&#xD;
      children, who are offered the first oral examination from three years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caries prevalence (at dentine level) of five year olds in the control group had&#xD;
      previously been compared with the corresponding prevalence of five year olds in the general&#xD;
      population from the national health register &quot;KOSTRA&quot; (Municipality-State-Report of 2010,&#xD;
      2011 and 2012 in three counties in Western Norway, n = 18,974). Likewise the caries&#xD;
      prevalence at age five years of the present intervention group were compared with the general&#xD;
      population (Municipality-State-Report of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, n=26161). Possible time&#xD;
      trends in caries epidemiology of five year olds during 2010-2016 were assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children's clinical oral examinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (below three years of age) a simplified oral examination was performed. Children&#xD;
      were examined sitting on their parents' laps in the dental chair or on a regular chair&#xD;
      examined by the &quot;lap to lap&quot; method. At the first follow-up examination at three years old,&#xD;
      the children sat either on parents' laps or alone in the dental chair. Procedures for the&#xD;
      oral health examination of the intervention and of the control group at five years of age&#xD;
      were the same. Examinations were performed using a mouth mirror and a dental probe under good&#xD;
      lighting conditions. Caries and DDE were registered for all dental surfaces while index teeth&#xD;
      were used for dental erosion, dental plaque and gingival bleeding. Bitewing radiographs (BW)&#xD;
      were only taken in five year olds, when there were molar contacts. Parents with immigrant&#xD;
      background were offered interpreting services if desired. All oral health examinations were&#xD;
      conducted by the same two dentists who previously had collected the published inter- and&#xD;
      intra-observer reliability data of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the various diagnostic systems were as follows: For caries, a five-graded&#xD;
      diagnostic system was used,where enamel lesions were characterised as grades 1 or 2, and&#xD;
      dentine lesions as grades 3, 4, or 5. Secondary caries, filled and extracted (due to caries&#xD;
      only) teeth and the care index (a fraction with filled teeth as numerator and d3-5mft count&#xD;
      as denominator). For dental erosion, a four graded diagnostic system was applied on buccal&#xD;
      and palatal surfaces of the primary maxillary anterior teeth (53-63) and the occlusal&#xD;
      surfaces of all primary molars. Erosion grade 3 was considered severe and grade 4 very&#xD;
      severe. A modified DDE index was selected for DDE registration in which demarcated opacities&#xD;
      were coded 1, diffuse opacities 2, demarcated and diffuse opacities 3, hypoplasia 4,&#xD;
      hypoplasia and opacities 5, post-eruptive breakdown of enamel 6, and atypical fillings 7.&#xD;
      Finally, for dental plaque and gingival bleeding, the PI and GBI were reported around the&#xD;
      marker teeth 55, 51, 65, 75, 71, and 85. The presence of plaque in the four amelo-gingival&#xD;
      areas was assessed with a dental probe and absence of debris was recorded as score 0 and&#xD;
      presence as score 1. Gingival bleeding was recorded by probing cautiously using a WHO&#xD;
      periodontal probe with a 0.5-mm ball tip on six surfaces; mesio-buccal, in the middle of the&#xD;
      buccal surface, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, in the middle of the lingual surface and,&#xD;
      disto-lingual. If bleeding occurred within 10 seconds in at least one of the places, the&#xD;
      tooth was scored 1 (bleeding), otherwise the tooth was scored 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental questionnaire and anamnestic factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of children in the intervention group were asked to respond to a questionnaire at&#xD;
      baseline and at the second follow-up, while parents in the control group were asked at&#xD;
      examination at age five years. The questionnaire contained 30 structured items. The topics&#xD;
      covered were socio-demographic and anamnestic items, items about parental oral health&#xD;
      attitudes, oral health related behaviours, and oral health promotion.The anamnestic&#xD;
      background variables were coded cyanotic (1), not cyanotic (0), heart failure (1) and heart&#xD;
      failure not present (0), taking heart medication (1) and does not take heart medication (0),&#xD;
      low birth weight &lt;2500 g (1) and normal birth weight &gt;2500 g (0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention At baseline (before three years) all parents in the intervention group received&#xD;
      a standardised &quot;knowledge package&quot;, included &quot;Lift the lip program&quot;. Both general and local&#xD;
      interventions were repeated at first follow-up at three years and second follow-up at five&#xD;
      years. Risk assessment was made by the following background factors: 1) dental factors such&#xD;
      as visible caries, visible plaque, gingivitis, erosion and DDE; 2) parental oral health&#xD;
      related behaviours such as oral hygiene habits, dietary habits and use of fluoride; 3) social&#xD;
      factors such as immigrant background where parents showed poor language skills; and 4)&#xD;
      medical factors such as comorbidity and use of medication with drugs sweetened with sucrose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendation from the caries risk assessment was the most intense preventive program&#xD;
      for children with the highest caries risk (those children with the highest number of caries&#xD;
      risk determinants). The children were evaluated based on data from the oral examination,&#xD;
      anamnestic information and information obtained from the questionnaire and accordingly&#xD;
      assigned to different promotive oral health intervention programs, denoted as Program I, II&#xD;
      and III. As all the participants had CHD, stated previously as a risk for reduced oral&#xD;
      Health, the most modest program applied was Program I. The children offered this program had&#xD;
      no other known risk factors for poor oral health than CHD. Program II was assigned to&#xD;
      children who had association with other known risk groups in terms of poor oral health or had&#xD;
      signs of oral disease such as a) enamel caries grade1-2, erosion or DDE; b) findings from the&#xD;
      questionnaire corresponding to additional risk for oral disease beyond what is normal for the&#xD;
      group; c) immigrant background where parents show poor language skills and simultaneously&#xD;
      caries lesions; and d) co-morbidities with additional risk for oral disease. Program III was&#xD;
      assigned to children who also had other known risk determinants like very poor oral health,&#xD;
      signs of severe oral disease or where findings from the questionnaire corresponded to serious&#xD;
      risk of oral disease. After categorising the children to the various programs, each child's&#xD;
      responsible dentist or dental hygienist at the local PDS clinic was contacted by telephone&#xD;
      with information about the project and the findings of the examination. A written report with&#xD;
      a treatment plan and recommendation for follow-up was sent after each oral examination: at&#xD;
      baseline, first follow-up and second follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial intervention plan for recommendations for the PDS dentists for follow-up of the&#xD;
      highest risk children (Program III) included an option of recalls every month during a three&#xD;
      month period. Compliance by the PDS staff with the recommendation for follow-up was evaluated&#xD;
      when the second follow-up for all children was completed. The child's local PDS-clinic was&#xD;
      contacted and feedback in the form of a written list of the child's appointments in the PDS&#xD;
      in the period from baseline to the second follow-up was received. There was no information&#xD;
      about clinical procedures undertaken, only dates of appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the intervention and the&#xD;
      control group. The effectiveness of an early oral health intervention was estimated by&#xD;
      comparing intervention and control groups on clinical oral health outcomes at age five years&#xD;
      using a multiple logistic regression model for each outcome variable. The model was fitted&#xD;
      unadjusted and adjusted for one of the following independent variables at a time: brushing&#xD;
      habit, start age of tooth brushing, diet habit, parent's origin, parent's education,&#xD;
      bottle-feeding, night meals, sugar water, sex, heart problems, cyanosis, birth weight, heart&#xD;
      medication and syndrome.The various dependent dichotomised outcome variables for evaluating&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention program were caries experience, dental erosion, PI and, GBI.&#xD;
      The independent variables used in the logistic regression were selected in relation to known&#xD;
      caries risk determinants and demographic background factors, which could influence the oral&#xD;
      outcomes. In the final model, maximally adjustments were included to guarantee sufficient&#xD;
      power. The adjustments with the largest deviation from odds ratio (OR) were selected in the&#xD;
      unadjusted model if the deviation was at least 10% of the unadjusted OR. For other&#xD;
      comparisons chi-square and independent sample t-test were used. The general significance&#xD;
      level was set to 0.05. The Bonferroni correction was used to address multiple comparisons&#xD;
      leading to the marginal significance levels of 0.0028 when comparing characteristics between&#xD;
      the intervention and control group, and 0.01 for the logistic models. All analyses were&#xD;
      performed using SPSS version 23 (Inc. Chicago, IL, USA) and Matlab 9.0 (Mathworks Inc.).&#xD;
