  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During any general anaesthetic which involves muscle relaxation artificial breathing is&#xD;
      required. This is most commonly provided by pushing air under pressure (positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation) into the lungs via a tube in the airway (the tracheal tube). It has been&#xD;
      observed for many years that with this form of breathing the distribution of gas within the&#xD;
      lungs differs from that seen during 'natural' breathing: more of the gas goes to the upper&#xD;
      parts of the lung than lower parts. This change in how the gas is distributed can lead to&#xD;
      problems with how well oxygen is taken up by blood and carbon dioxide removed from the body.&#xD;
      Previous work using mathematical modelling has found that the position of the tracheal tube&#xD;
      might affect air distribution, but this has previously been difficult to study in 'real&#xD;
      life', requiring the use of radioactive dyes and computerised tomography (CT). However a&#xD;
      bedside test is now available which allows us to study these changes rapidly and&#xD;
      non-invasively, using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The EIT device is commercially&#xD;
      available (PulmoVistaÂ®, Draeger UK) and is used in hospitals worldwide as a bedside monitor&#xD;
      of lung ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effect of tracheal intubation on regional ventilation of&#xD;
      the lungs by comparing measurements before and after the patient is anaesthetised and&#xD;
      intubated. The investgiators aim to show whether altered patterns of ventilation are caused&#xD;
      by patients simply being asleep and ventilated, or whether these changes are due to the use&#xD;
      of a tracheal tube itself. The exact effect of tube position will also be studied by&#xD;
      measuring ventilation as the tube is deliberately advanced until it enters one of the lungs.&#xD;
      This will give us information about the ideal position for a tube within the trachea to&#xD;
      promote optimal ventilation patterns within the lungs&#xD;

    <description>General anaesthesia will then be induced, and when the participant is asleep a further set of measurements will be taken using the Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) belt whilst ventilation is maintained using the normal bag-mask ventilation technique used by anaesthetists in the first few minutes of the anaesthetic. Following this, the trachea will be intubated by the anaesthetist clinically responsible for the patient, and a further set of EIT measurements taken.</description>
