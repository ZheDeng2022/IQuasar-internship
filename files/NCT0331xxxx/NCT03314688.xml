  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized trial evaluating the impact of a dietary and physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines intervention vs. usual care on adherence to breast cancer treatments,&#xD;
      body composition, and changes in biomarkers in 172 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer&#xD;
      scheduled to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the Department of Health and Human Services, the American Cancer Society and others&#xD;
      provide diet and exercise guidelines for cancer survivors. Many women with breast cancer do&#xD;
      not follow these guidelines, and also elect to delay concerted efforts toward following them&#xD;
      until active treatment is complete. However, adoption of these recommended lifestyle&#xD;
      behaviors soon after diagnosis may prevent adverse changes in body composition and breast&#xD;
      cancer biomarkers and may even improve the efficacy of treatment resulting in improved breast&#xD;
      cancer prognosis. Further, by increasing our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the&#xD;
      association between lifestyle behaviors and breast cancer survival, this study will improve&#xD;
      our knowledge of how changes in diet and physical activity influence breast cancer outcomes.&#xD;
      Lastly, guidelines for breast cancer survivors also overlap with those for diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, the latter being a common cause of breast cancer&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will examine, in 172 women newly diagnosed with Stage I-III breast cancer&#xD;
      who are not practicing the dietary and lifestyle guidelines, and who are scheduled to receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, the effect of a 1-year dietary and physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines intervention vs. usual care on the following breast cancer outcomes measured&#xD;
      before beginning chemotherapy (Time 0), post chemotherapy (Time 1), at one-year&#xD;
      post-diagnosis (Time 2), and at two years post-diagnosis (Time 3): adherence to treatment,&#xD;
      and changes in biomarkers, body composition, and quality of life.&#xD;
