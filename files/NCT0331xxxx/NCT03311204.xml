  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, clinical variables related to eyelids that potentially have an effect on&#xD;
      contact lens discomfort will be investigated such as eyelid signs and secretions, eyelid&#xD;
      sensitivity, eyelid microbiome, Demodex infestation and tear film properties. The main aim of&#xD;
      this study is to understand the duration of efficacy of debridement of the eyelid margin and&#xD;
      its impact on various eyelid signs (such as lid wiper epitheliopathy, lid-parallel&#xD;
      conjunctival folds, eyelid sensitivity, meibomian gland morphology and meibum secretions,&#xD;
      palpebral conjunctival reaction, eyelid microbiome and Demodex infestation, tear properties&#xD;
      (both biophysical properties such as tear volume, tear meniscus height, tear evaporation,&#xD;
      tear osmolarity and tear breakup time; and biochemical properties that are tear lipid&#xD;
      analysis). To observe these variables, this study employs a cross-sectional design to study&#xD;
      the effect of treatment at three instances, that is at baseline and two follow-up visits.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Contact lens discomfort (CLD) is a substantial problem experienced frequently by contact lens&#xD;
      wearers and it is the primary factor associated with permanent discontinuation of lens wear.&#xD;
      Studies report that between 43% and 72% of contact lens wearer's dropout due to discomfort.&#xD;
      Reducing the number of contact lens (CL) patient dropouts has been a continuing challenge for&#xD;
      eye care professionals. With more than 125 million contact lens wearers around the world,&#xD;
      patient discontinuations can have a considerable economic impact on an eye care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition: Contact lens discomfort is a condition characterized by episodic or persistent&#xD;
      adverse ocular sensations related to lens wear, either with or without visual disturbance,&#xD;
      resulting from reduced compatibility between the contact lens and the ocular environment,&#xD;
      which can lead to decreased wearing time and discontinuation of contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferences from our earlier study (HC15119) showed that eyelid margin debridement&#xD;
      significantly improves eyelid signs, tear film properties and comfort in contact lens&#xD;
      wearers. But the previous study did not consider the duration of efficacy as the subjects&#xD;
      were only followed up once after 7-10days from treatment. Observing subjects more frequently&#xD;
      will help us understand the duration of efficacy of debridement therapy. Also, the previous&#xD;
      study did not examine the biochemical changes to tear film lipids that are produced by the&#xD;
      eyelids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that debridement of eyelid margins improves lipid secretions that then&#xD;
      help to form a stable lipid layer over ocular surface, thereby improving the tear evaporation&#xD;
      dynamics and comfort in contact lens wearers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of the study is to observe the duration of efficacy of debridement of the eyelid&#xD;
      margins in improving secretions from eyelid glands and whether the debridement helps to form&#xD;
      a stable tear film over ocular surface, thereby improving comfort in contact lens wearers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the effect of BlephEx - debridement therapy (an in-office eyelid&#xD;
      treatment) on eyelid signs and secretions, tear film and contact lens discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe differences in discomfort in contact lens wearers To determine the duration of&#xD;
      efficacy of BlephEx debridement therapy in contact lens wearers, by following up after 12-15&#xD;
      days and 22-25days from the baseline (Treatment) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study employs cross-sectional study design, to observe the effect of treatment&#xD;
      at three instances, one baseline (treatment) visit and two follow-up visits. At the baseline&#xD;
      visit, informed consent will be obtained from the subjects and assessment of the study&#xD;
      variables will be performed. Participants will undergo treatment on the same day with&#xD;
      BlephEx. At baseline, the measurements are performed prior to treatment to record preliminary&#xD;
      scores and then treatment is performed. Participants are asked to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      follow-up visits during which no treatment will be performed, but variables are assessed to&#xD;
      determine the difference from baseline measurements. The 2nd visit will be after 12 -16 days&#xD;
      after the baseline visit. The last follow-up will be 22-26 days after the baseline visit. All&#xD;
      study variables will be assessed during all three visits to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Procedure: BlephEx is an instrument that contains a handpiece used to spin a&#xD;
      medical grade micro-sponge along the edge of eyelids and lashes that helps in removing scurf&#xD;
      and debris from eyelids and helps in exfoliating the lids. A new micro-sponge will be used&#xD;
      for every subject to avoid cross-contamination. This procedure lasts for 6-8 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lid Hygenix is a commercially available formulated hypoallergenic foam cleanser will be used&#xD;
      to moisten the BlephEx debridement tips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the products are commercially available. The procedure is safe, painless and regularly&#xD;
      performed by optometrists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Participant information sheet and informed consent' and 'web-based survey for the end of the&#xD;
      day discomfort rating' will be sent out in the form of an email. Participants who are&#xD;
      interested in participation will respond to the survey and results will be used only after&#xD;
      the subject signs the informed consent in the presence of the investigator, during the&#xD;
      baseline visit. This survey response will be used as baseline data for the end of the day&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
