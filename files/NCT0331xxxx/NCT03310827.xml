    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of nutrigenomics as an intervention for mental health conditions,&#xD;
      a phase I randomized controlled trial of 42 adults (19 to 50 years) with depressive disorders&#xD;
      using a 2:1 ratio of group selection (28 in the intervention {I} group and 14 in the control&#xD;
      {C} group) is proposed. Participants with a confirmed depressive disorder will be recruited&#xD;
      from two local mental health clinics. Those randomized into the I group will do the gene&#xD;
      testing and be provided personalized DNA-based dietary advice from a registered dietitian;&#xD;
      those in the C group will also receive testing but be given general dietary advice by a&#xD;
      registered dietitian. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons (3 and 6 weeks after a&#xD;
      personalized nutrition plan is given) will be analyzed based on records of dietary intakes&#xD;
      (i.e., 3 day food records and food frequency questionnaire) and psychiatric functioning&#xD;
      (e.g., Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,&#xD;
      Outcome Questionnaire - OQ-45). In addition, measures that track physical activity, sedentary&#xD;
      behavior, and sleep quality as well as sociodemographics will be included as covariates.&#xD;
      After the intervention study is completed, in-depth focus group interviews will be conducted.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked questions that will elicit their perceptions of the nutrigenomics&#xD;
      test and the personalized dietary advice provided as well as the behavioural response to&#xD;
      disclosure of genetic information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While evidence suggests that the disclosure of personal genetic information based on&#xD;
      nutrigenomics testing leads to lifestyle behaviour changes in selected populations, the&#xD;
      potential for its use as an intervention in clinical populations, such as those with&#xD;
      depressive disorders, has yet to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: The proposed study will employ a mixed-methods approach and focus on the&#xD;
      following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to examine the efficacy of testing for 12-genes (i.e., CYP1A2, UCP1, MTHFR, HLA,&#xD;
           TMPRSS6, TFR2, TF, MCM6, NOS3, ACE, FUT2, GSTT1, TCF7L2) that assess 11 dietary&#xD;
           components (i.e, caffeine, energy balance, folate gluten, iron, lactose, omega-3 fat,&#xD;
           sodium, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and whole grains) in changing diet quality, eating&#xD;
           behaviours and improving symptoms in adults with depressive disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to conduct a qualitative investigation of participants' experiences with using gene&#xD;
           testing that assesses for dietary components&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Method: To evaluate the feasibility of nutrigenomics as an intervention for mental&#xD;
      health conditions, a phase I randomized controlled trial of 24 adults with depressive&#xD;
      disorders using a 2:1 ratio of group selection (16 in the intervention {I} group and 8 in the&#xD;
      control {C} group) is proposed. Participants with a confirmed depressive disorder will be&#xD;
      recruited from two local mental health clinics. Those randomized into the I group will do the&#xD;
      gene testing and be provided personalized DNA-based dietary advice from a registered&#xD;
      dietitian; those in the C group will also receive testing but be given general dietary advice&#xD;
      by a registered dietitian. Pre- and post-intervention comparisons (3 and 6 weeks after a&#xD;
      personalized nutrition plan is given) will be analyzed based on records of dietary intakes&#xD;
      (i.e., 3 day food records and food frequency questionnaire) and psychiatric functioning&#xD;
      (e.g., Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,&#xD;
      Outcome Questionnaire - OQ-45). In addition, measures that track physical activity, sedentary&#xD;
      behavior, and sleep quality as well as sociodemographics will be included as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention study is completed, in-depth focus group interviews will be conducted.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked questions that will elicit their perceptions of the nutrigenomics&#xD;
      test and the personalized dietary advice provided as well as the behavioural response to&#xD;
      disclosure of genetic information.&#xD;
