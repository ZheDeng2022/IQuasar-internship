  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to answer the research question: Are Japanese bone metastatic CRPC patients&#xD;
      satisfied with their Ra-223 treatment, and what factors drive such satisfaction? It also aims&#xD;
      to determine patient anxiety regarding prostate cancer while on treatment with Ra-223, and&#xD;
      assess the effect on quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, Japanese, prospective, longitudinal, observational, company-sponsored,&#xD;
      multi-center, single arm study that will describe treatment satisfaction with Ra-223 in 150&#xD;
      bone metastatic CRPC patients on 1st to 3rd line CRPC therapy. All outcomes will be obtained&#xD;
      using PRO questionnaires at 4 time points: before treatment, during treatment, and at 1-month&#xD;
      after the last treatment cycle.&#xD;
