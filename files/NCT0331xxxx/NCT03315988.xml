  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The amount of people with diabetes mellitus has now reached over 4 million in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. Type 2 diabetes accounts for the majority of all cases of diabetes and increases the&#xD;
      risk of many other diseases such as heart problems. Plant based diets are thought to be an&#xD;
      effective way to improve markers of health related to type 2 diabetes and heart disease. One&#xD;
      way that a plant based diet improves health could be through reducing waste products that are&#xD;
      generated in the gut by the bacteria that break down food as part of the digestion process.&#xD;
      For example, the digestion of some meats, fish and eggs results in the creation of a&#xD;
      substance called Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO) which has been linked to worse health outcomes&#xD;
      in several studies. However, the full impact on TMAO and blood glucose levels of swapping&#xD;
      regular meat consumption for a plant based vegan diet is not fully understood and requires&#xD;
      further research. Therefore, the aim of this study will be to develop and undertake a&#xD;
      clinical trial to investigate the effects of an 8-week vegan diet on TMAO levels and post&#xD;
      challenge glucose levels in individuals with dysglycaemia (drug naïve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be interventional single group prospective trial of adults aged 18-75 years of&#xD;
      age from a multi-ethnic population with dysglycaemia (drug naïve). A sample of 29 people will&#xD;
      be sought. The dietary intervention (vegan diet) will last 8 weeks. Then, the participants&#xD;
      will go back to their normal diet and come for their final visit after a four week follow-up&#xD;
      period (week 12). To assess the effectiveness of the intervention, primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcome data collected at baseline will be compared with data collected at 1 week, 8 weeks&#xD;
      and 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional single group prospective trial in a patient population with identified&#xD;
      dysglycaemia within the past 36 months defined as 2h post-challenge glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L after&#xD;
      a standard oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c ≥5.7% (39-46 mmol/mol). This phase clinical&#xD;
      trial will evaluate the efficacy and underlining mechanisms of a vegan diet in promoting&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health in those with dysglycaemia. Specifically, this trial will aim to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of an 8-week vegan diet with follow-up at 1, 8 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be co-ordinated within the Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (Leicester&#xD;
      Diabetes Centre) at the Leicester General Hospital. Clinical measurement sessions will be&#xD;
      carried out by the appointed research team. Participants will be asked to visit the study&#xD;
      centre on five occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Description and Definition&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked to follow a diet that excludes foods hypothesised to support&#xD;
      the syntheses of TMAO, particularly meat (any), eggs and fish (any). A number of studies&#xD;
      suggest that dairy products may also have an effect in modulating TMAO production whereas&#xD;
      other studies do not. Therefore, in order to avoid any potential contaminating or confounding&#xD;
      effect, dairy products will also be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diet employed in this study is broadly aligned to a vegan diet. The term vegan will be&#xD;
      used to aid behaviour change and food choice. For example, an increasing array of products&#xD;
      are now pack marked as vegan. The participants will be asked to keep their diet similar to&#xD;
      their original and the Registered Dietitian involved in this study will plan their weekly&#xD;
      menus accordingly.&#xD;
