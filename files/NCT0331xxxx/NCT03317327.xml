      Each subject will participate in the trial until death, drop out, or loss-to follow-up from&#xD;
      the time the subject signs the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a&#xD;
      screening phase of up to 28 days, each eligible subject will receive nivolumab. Two weeks&#xD;
      after start of nivolumab the patients will receive radiotherapy (RT) to a total dose of 60&#xD;
      Gy, given as 1.5 Gy fractions twice daily for a total period of 4 weeks. Treatment with&#xD;
      nivolumab will continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s),&#xD;
      intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Investigator's&#xD;
      decision to withdraw the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedures&#xD;
      requirements, subject receives nivolumab for 12 months, pregnancy, or administrative reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event&#xD;
      monitoring serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected for 90 days after the end of&#xD;
      treatment. Patients without disease progression will have follow-up visits for 4 years after&#xD;
      end of study therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, the aim is to release the brake on the immune response by use of nivolumab, an&#xD;
      inhibitory antibody against Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Nivolumab has shown&#xD;
      efficacy and mild toxicity when given as monotherapy for HNSCC at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every 2&#xD;
      weeks, which is the target dose in the present trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is a powerful inducer of inflammation, and the expression of Programmed&#xD;
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is known to be enhanced by inflammatory cytokines, including&#xD;
      interferon-gamma (IFNg). Experimental evidence from mice models have shown that radiotherapy&#xD;
      induces increased PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting&#xD;
      that HNSCC with T-cell infiltration is more sensitive to radiotherapy. There is thus a strong&#xD;
      rationale for combing PD-1 inhibitors with radiotherapy. However, this potential remains&#xD;
      largely unexplored in humans. The investigators consider that head-and-neck cancer is a&#xD;
      particularly attractive entity for investigating this therapeutic combination, because of i)&#xD;
      the high radiosensitivity of this cancer form ii) the clinical efficacy of Programmed cell&#xD;
      death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors as monotherapy in early clinical trials iii) the&#xD;
      availability of tumor biopsies for translational/biomarker research.The RT given in the&#xD;
      present study gives considerable side effects, related to inflammation that may be enhanced&#xD;
      by Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade.&#xD;
