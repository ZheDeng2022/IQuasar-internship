  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a medication called Venetoclax and a chemotherapy regimen as&#xD;
      a possible treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard Chemotherapy (which includes cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,&#xD;
           dexamethasone, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, etoposide, and cytarabine&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drug and drug combination to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means&#xD;
      that the drug and drug combination is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Venetoclax for this specific&#xD;
      disease, but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax is an inhibitor of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 is critical for keeping cancer cells alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By inhibiting Bcl-2, venetoclax promotes cancer cell death. This drug is currently being used&#xD;
      in other clinical trials for people with certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. There is some evidence from those and other laboratory trials that venetoclax may&#xD;
      kill cancer cells and cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are investigating how safe the combination of&#xD;
      Venetoclax and standard chemotherapy is and how it affects this disease.. The participant&#xD;
      will be given Venetoclax alone first and the standard chemotherapies will be given in&#xD;
      combination. This study aims to provide information to help determine the dose of Venetoclax&#xD;
      , in combination with standard chemotherapy, affects this disease the best and which dose is&#xD;
      the safest.&#xD;
