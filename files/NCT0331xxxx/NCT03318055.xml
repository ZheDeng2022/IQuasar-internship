  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, observational study of adult, non-cardiac, non-obstetric,&#xD;
      elective surgical patients conducted over a period of one week. This large-scale clinical&#xD;
      audit aims to assess the incidence rates of anaemia and hyperglycaemia amongst elective&#xD;
      surgical patients in the Western Cape. A study such as this is essential in the assessment of&#xD;
      the incidence rates of abnormal fasting blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of&#xD;
      perioperative complications for patients. Preoperative anaemia is a modifiable risk factor&#xD;
      and should be identified early and treated appropriately to improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, one third of patients presenting for surgery will be anaemic, according to the WHO&#xD;
      criteria. Preoperative anaemia is considered an independent risk factor for poorer patient&#xD;
      outcomes, with increases in morbidity and mortality as well as prolonged length of hospital&#xD;
      stay. However, the importance of this finding in the preoperative period is often overlooked&#xD;
      and not corrected prior to surgery. The leading cause of preoperative anaemia is iron&#xD;
      deficiency. Iron deficiency anaemia is common in developing countries and results mostly from&#xD;
      nutritional deficiency. Poorly controlled Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is known to have an adverse&#xD;
      effect on perioperative clinical outcomes, with an extended length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. Preoperative identification of patients with DM, provides&#xD;
      a potential opportunity to reduce the risk of adverse surgical outcomes. Early identification&#xD;
      of such patients could facilitate timely intervention and arrangement of appropriate&#xD;
      perioperative and long-term follow-up. Studies have demonstrated that an elevated HbA1c&#xD;
      (indicative of poor glycaemic control in the months preceding surgery) correlates with&#xD;
      increased perioperative risk in known diabetics. On the day of surgery, before induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia, all patients will have a finger prick blood glucose level done by point of care&#xD;
      glucometry, if there is no documented fasting blood glucose value in their ward file. In&#xD;
      patients of unknown diabetic status, should the preoperative value be &gt;7 mmol/l, blood will&#xD;
      be drawn when IV access is established, for HbA1C measurement. In known diabetics, a sample&#xD;
      will be taken for HbA1C, regardless of the preoperative fasting blood glucose level, unless&#xD;
      there is an HbA1C measurement in the previous 3 months. However, should the patient&#xD;
      management have been modified based on the HbA1C result, a repeat HbA1C measurement would be&#xD;
      performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed as part of the routine preoperative evaluation. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained by the anaesthetist from eligible patients who agree to participate&#xD;
      in the study. On the day of surgery, prior to induction of anaesthesia the patients will&#xD;
      receive a finger prick Hemoglobin (Hb) if they have not had a Hb result documented within the&#xD;
      last 3 months. If the results meet the WHO criteria for anemia, a blood specimen will be&#xD;
      collected when inserting the IV line. The blood specimen will be sent for Haemoglobin, mean&#xD;
      cell volume, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) testing. All patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      anemia will receive a patient information leaflet. They will also be referred to their local&#xD;
      clinics or general practitioner for further evaluation and appropriate management.&#xD;
