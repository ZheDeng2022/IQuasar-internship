    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Z-endoxifen&#xD;
      hydrochloride in treating participants who are undergoing breast surgery. Z-endoxifen&#xD;
      hydrochloride may treat or reduce the risk of breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the dermal tolerability and safety of Z-endoxifen hydrochloride (endoxifen)&#xD;
      (ENX) gel administered topically to both breasts at two doses: 10 mg daily (5 mg per breast)&#xD;
      and 20 mg daily (10 mg per breast) in comparison to vehicle placebo gel, using objective&#xD;
      assessments based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the breast tissue concentrations of (E) and (Z) isomers of&#xD;
      N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen (ENX) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) at each dose (10 mg per&#xD;
      day and 20 mg per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the plasma concentrations of (E) and (Z) isomers ENX and 4-OHT at each dose&#xD;
      (10 mg per day and 20 mg per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure plasma hormone levels for steroid hormones (estradiol, progesterone,&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrostenedione [DHEA], androstenedione, testosterone) in comparison to vehicle&#xD;
      placebo gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure serum estrogenic response to topical ENX gel therapy in comparison to vehicle&#xD;
      placebo gel (sex hormone binding globulin and insulin-like growth factor [IGF] pathway&#xD;
      proteins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess changes in coagulation parameters (factor VIII, factor IX, vWF, protein S) in&#xD;
      response to ENX gel therapy in comparison to vehicle placebo gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Using pre- and post-therapy tissue samples, to explore the potential therapeutic effects&#xD;
      of the two doses of ENX gel in comparison to vehicle placebo gel: a) by IHC, Ki67 labelling&#xD;
      (for cell proliferation), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) expression (for&#xD;
      estrogen blockade); b) by expression of a panel of genes reported to change with ENX exposure&#xD;
      (using nanostring assays).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Bank germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for future pooled analyses of polymorphisms in&#xD;
      tamoxifen metabolizing enzymes in comparison to vehicle placebo gel (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess symptoms related to use of endoxifen gel in comparison to vehicle placebo&#xD;
      gel, as assessed by the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Eight Symptom Scale (BESS)&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized in Cohorts 1 and 2. All subjects in Cohort 3 will&#xD;
      receive active agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Participants apply Z-endoxifen hydrochloride gel to both breast skin and keep it&#xD;
      untouched over at least 4 hours once daily for 21-28 days before breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Participants apply placebo to both breast skin and keep it untouched over at least&#xD;
      4 hours once daily for 21-28 days before breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT III: Participants apply Z-endoxifen hydrochloride gel to both breast skin and keep it&#xD;
      untouched over at least 4 hours once daily for 21-28 days before breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 60 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current users of other topical medications on the breast skin must be willing and able&#xD;
