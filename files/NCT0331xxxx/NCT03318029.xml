  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a consensus that vitamin D deficiency is a public health issue because of its&#xD;
      implications in several diseases including, osteopenia, osteomalacia, heart disease, diabetes&#xD;
      (type I and II), inflammatory diseases, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies&#xD;
      in sunny countries have shown that vitamin D deficiency is a common phenomenon, despite the&#xD;
      abundance of sunlight in these places, which shows the influence of diet, skin pigmentation,&#xD;
      cultural habits and also genetic factors on the metabolism of this vitamin. Thus, the study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation is required to obtain the optimal serum&#xD;
      concentration in Brazilian people living both in Brazil and in the United Kingdom and that&#xD;
      this response is dependent on the initial levels, being influenced by sunlight exposure, skin&#xD;
      pigmentation, diet and polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene. Two controlled,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind clinical trials were held (one in the UK and the other in Brazil)&#xD;
      over a period of 12 weeks, with female subjects, Brazilian, aged 20 to 59 years. The women&#xD;
      selected were divided into two groups: Placebo Group and Supplemented Group, the latter&#xD;
      received vitamin D 600 IU. After the analysis of the effect of vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      compared to placebo, the investigators propose to analyse genome-wide transcriptomic&#xD;
      expression in order to associate specific signal transduction and metabolic pathways to&#xD;
      respective vitamin D responses. and a genetic risk score based on polymorphisms will be&#xD;
      constructed. The 'systems level' approach will enable us to identify differences in gene&#xD;
      expression and whether this explains why some individuals are 'good' responders or 'poor'&#xD;
      responders to vitamin D supplementation. This is the first study that will examine two&#xD;
      population groups of the same ethnic group and sex, living in different countries, with&#xD;
      identical design studies. Our results first will determine how important supplementation and&#xD;
      exposure to sunlight are for the serum level of vitamin D by comparing directly, using the&#xD;
      same methodology, people living in different latitudes, as well as the genetic influence on&#xD;
      the response to supplementation. The data will also provide both countries key data about the&#xD;
      need to reconsider new revisions to dietary recommendations for vitamin D in adults.&#xD;

      During this study the subjects were asked to visit the Clinical Investigation Unit, FHMS,&#xD;
      University of Surrey in the UK or the Research Clinic, Faculty of Nutrition, Federal&#xD;
      University of Goiás in Brazil, on two occasions, at the beginning of the study for baseline&#xD;
      measurements and at the conclusion of the study. The investigators examined four to eight&#xD;
      fasted subjects per study morning. Trial visits lasted approximately 45-60 minutes each and&#xD;
      took place in the morning (7am-11am). Participants were offered refreshments at the end of&#xD;
      their appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants wished to be screened for participation in the study, they would receive the&#xD;
      Participant Information Sheet and then be checked against the study inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria using a 'Screening Questionnaire' , administered by a member of the D-SOL Research&#xD;
      Team by phone or self-reported by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible, participants were invited for the baseline visit. At this visit, they were first&#xD;
      given time to discuss the Participant Information Sheet and any questions they may have&#xD;
      regarding the study. Informed consent was discussed and participants were asked to sign the&#xD;
      consent form, and offered a copy to keep for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health and Lifestyle questionnaire administered by a member of the D-SOL Research Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometrics and blood pressure measured, and fasted blood sample taken (serum 25OHD&#xD;
           levels, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, serum calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone,&#xD;
           C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) ≈25ml) with an additional ≈10 ml for genetic profiling and&#xD;
           ≈15 for storage for future measurements of nutritional markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pQCT scan of the non-dominant forearm (UK trial) or dual energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
           (DEXA) scan (Brazil trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of randomly assigned daily supplement (30 days' supply), food diaries and&#xD;
           sunlight dosimeters and sunlight exposure diary to be returned at 12 week visit.&#xD;
           Follow-up appointment details arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final adverse event/compliance interview completed with investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily outdoor exposure diary, food diary and sunlight dosimeter received from&#xD;
           participant and checked for consistency at visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometrics and blood pressure measured, and blood sample taken (serum 25OHD levels,&#xD;
           1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, serum calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, C-terminal&#xD;
           telopeptide (CTX) ≈25ml) with an additional ≈10 ml for genetic profiling and ≈15 for&#xD;
           storage for future measurements of nutritional markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA profiling procedure - After 12 weeks: Selection of participant samples encompassing the&#xD;
      best and worst supplementation-responders in each group, subject to previous consent form&#xD;
      singed by participant. Vitamin D related genes will be genotyped in DNA isolated from the&#xD;
      study blood samples, DNA will be extracted and vitamin D polymorphisms will be determined by&#xD;
      University of Surrey's genetic labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trained phlebotomist took the blood samples required as part of the trial protocol. Medical&#xD;
      cover was available at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the duration of the trial, the participants were contacted via telephone on a&#xD;
      fortnightly basis to discuss any issues with any adverse event and compliance and to maintain&#xD;
      good communication with the participants. In the case of a serious adverse event (SAE) this&#xD;
      would be recorded and reported it to both the Sponsor (University of Surrey) and the Surrey&#xD;
      Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final interview was completed at the final study visit. Participants have also been asked&#xD;
      to return any supplements that were missed to confirm compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For University of Surrey participants: A peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)&#xD;
      scan was performed on the participant's non-dominant forearm at the baseline visit, to&#xD;
      measure volumetric bone mineral density at the 4% and 66% radial site. This will allow for&#xD;
      separate measurements of trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and trabecular&#xD;
      area (4% site) and cortical vBMD and cortical area (66% site), as well as strength strain&#xD;
      index, a measure of bone strength. pQCT also measures bone geometry alongside bone density.&#xD;
      Therefore the muscle cross sectional area can be determined, which is a measure of muscle&#xD;
      force, to which bone strength is adapted to. One scan was performed at baseline only and&#xD;
      effective exposure doses were between ~1.5-1.8uSv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Federal University of Goiás participants: Body composition (absolute and relative amount&#xD;
      of lean and fat mass), whole body mineral density and lower spine and femur bone mineral&#xD;
      density was measured with the use of DEXA (located at the Nutrition Clinic based at the&#xD;
      Federal University of Goiás), at baseline only. Two scans were performed at baseline for each&#xD;
      participant: one to assess the whole body mineral density and body composition, and the other&#xD;
      to specifically assess fracture risk by scanning the spine and femoral head. Effective&#xD;
      exposure doses for theses scans are ~8uSv and ~4uSv respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the body composition, vitamin D status and dietary intake from the self-reported&#xD;
      food diaries will be made available to the subjects upon request. The results from the blood&#xD;
      analysis will be reported to the subject if there are any health concerns raised. If the&#xD;
      results are within healthy ranges the participants will not be contacted unless they&#xD;
      specifically request for this information. The investigators will not be contacting their&#xD;
      general practitioner (GP) if there are any concerns raised in the study however the&#xD;
      investigators will stress that they should contact their GP themselves to discuss the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (2008), the principles of Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with The Medicines for&#xD;
      Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 and Amended Regulations 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed protocol and supporting documents were submitted for review by the University of&#xD;
      Surrey Ethics Committee and the Federal University of Goiás, Brazil. The study received&#xD;
      favourable ethical opinion from both Committees prior to commencing the study. Annual&#xD;
      progress reports and a final report will be submitted to the ethics committees as defined in&#xD;
      their respective regulations.&#xD;
