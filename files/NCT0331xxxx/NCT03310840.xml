      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Neonatal ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a major hospital-acquired&#xD;
      infection in acute care settings, associated with high mortality and poor outcome. VAP is&#xD;
      considered a preventable infection if the risk factors are managed effectively. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate prevalence of ventilator associated pneumonia, its causative&#xD;
      organisms, its risk factors and outcome at our NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study used CDC guidelines for infant's ≤1 year old to diagnose neonatal VAP, in period&#xD;
      from April 2018 to March 2019.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal deaths represent third of the global burden of child mortality [1]. In Egypt,&#xD;
      Infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis/septicemia and other infections account for&#xD;
      28% of deaths during the neonatal period, Survival cannot be achieved without substantial&#xD;
      reductions in infection-specific neonatal mortality [2]. Neonatal sepsis is usually&#xD;
      classified as early or late onset sepsis. Early sepsis occurs within the first 72 hours of&#xD;
      birth and late neonatal sepsis occurs after 72 hours of birth. Early neonatal sepsis is&#xD;
      associated with acquisition of microorganism from mother Late neonatal sepsis usually occurs&#xD;
      due to the lack of aseptic working conditions [3]. The occurrence of late sepsis is&#xD;
      considered an important indicator of quality of care. Mechanical ventilation is an essential,&#xD;
      life-saving therapy for patients with critical illness and respiratory failure. These&#xD;
      patients are at high risk for complications and poor outcomes, including death,&#xD;
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Sepsis, pulmonary embolism, barotrauma, and pulmonary&#xD;
      edema. Such complications can lead to longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer stays&#xD;
      in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital, increased healthcare costs, and increased risk&#xD;
      of disability and death [4, 5]. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as a&#xD;
      nosocomial lower airway infection, i.e. pneumonia, in intubated patients with onset after 48&#xD;
      h or more of invasive mechanical ventilation [6]. VAP is usually caused by airway&#xD;
      colonization by potential pathogens; Sources of airway colonization can be the patient's own&#xD;
      flora, i.e., bacterial overgrowth in oral secretions, reflux and aspiration of gastric fluid&#xD;
      or the patient's environment with its caretakers and equipment [7, 8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanically ventilated babies face a particular risk because artificial airways bypass the&#xD;
      body's defenses against inhaled pathogens and offer new routes for non-air borne pathogens.&#xD;
      Intubation associated lesions of pharynx and trachea lead to bacterial colonization by the&#xD;
      deterioration of the swallowing reflex and the ciliary functions [9].VAP is one of the most&#xD;
      frequently diagnosed nosocomial infections [10] and, after suspected early onset sepsis,&#xD;
      second most reason for antibiotic intervention in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) [11,&#xD;
      12].VAP incidence can be reduced by infection control measures such as VAP-prevention-bundles&#xD;
      [13]. Regarding diagnosis of VAP episode requires a combination of radiological, clinical,&#xD;
      and laboratory criteria. However Center for Disease Control and Prevention/ National&#xD;
      Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (CDC/NNIS) criteria refers to infants younger than 1 year&#xD;
      and do not define specific criteria for the newborn period in term or preterm infants. In&#xD;
      spite of this lack of specificity, most studies of VAP performed in NICUs are based on these&#xD;
      criteria [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keywords: Newborn, Mechanical ventilation, ventilator-associated pneumonia, risk factors,&#xD;
      causative organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Method's: Design: A prospective, observational cohort surveillance, was carried out at our&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) was done during a period from April 2018 to March 2019 to&#xD;
      neonates who needed mechanical ventilation, reviewing data of diagnosis of neonates with&#xD;
      ventilation associated pneumonia used .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Our NICU is a level III, part of a university-teaching hospital, receives referrals&#xD;
      from the whole Upper Egypt. It has approximately 1450 case per year, approximately ~ 5&#xD;
      patients per day. It has approximately 450 case needs MV per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All inborn and outborn neonates who were admitted to the our NICU during the April 2018-&#xD;
      March 2019 were screened for study enrollment and were considered eligible if ventilated for&#xD;
      more than 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates ventilated with Evidence of neonatal sepsis before ventilated. Meconium aspiration&#xD;
      syndromes were excluded. Death within 48 hours of NICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Neonates In our study were classified into two groups; i. Group A: cases with suspected&#xD;
      VAP. ii. Group B: cases without VAP. Because up to this point we don't know the lab result&#xD;
      and microbiology. The diagnosis should be based on all of the three items of radiologic&#xD;
      signs, clinical signs and Symptoms and microbiological findings Cernada M et al [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical records comprising charts, daily flow sheets, laboratory and radiographic&#xD;
           reports were collected prospectively by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonates with suspected VAP in NICU: were diagnosed as VAP according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Modified CDC guidelines for infants≤1 year old)[5,6,13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full history taking:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Including: Patient data, Perinatal history, Present history, Family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Full clinical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. General physical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Growth measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Vital data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. General appearance. ii. Systems assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             2. Respiratory Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Cardio-vascular Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Abdominal Examination. Then Monitoring of the ventilator settings, and fraction of&#xD;
                inspired oxygen (FIO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The clinical criteria for diagnosis; Worsening gas exchange: desaturations pulse&#xD;
           oximetry less than 94%, increase ventilation demand,&#xD;
&#xD;
           And at least three of the following Temperature instability Leukopenia (≤4000 WBC/mm3)&#xD;
           or leukocytosis (&gt;15,000 WBC/mm3) and left shift Band forms (10%) New onset of purulent&#xD;
           sputum or change in character of sputum, or increased respiratory secretions Apnea,&#xD;
           tachypnea, nasal flaring with retraction of chest wall or nasal flaring with grunting&#xD;
           Wheezing, rales, or rhonchi&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Imaging study chest x-ray on admission&amp; follow up, ultrasound, CT scan when&#xD;
                indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Complete blood count, capillary blood gases. C) Septic screening&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Initial evaluation inflammatory mediator (C-reactive protein)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Blood culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Culture of bronchoalveolar lavage: aspirate for culture non-quantitative&#xD;
                     cultures after the third day hen weekly until extubation. Antibiotic&#xD;
                     sensitivity test will be done to all culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     We tried to compare the results of BAL versus blood culture in the diagnosis&#xD;
                     of VAP according to Cantey JB et al[12] ,aimed to intensive role of BAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Microorganisms isolated from blood were compared with that isolated from BAL.&#xD;
                     According to results:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Full agreement: when the same strain of organism has been isolated from the&#xD;
                     blood and endotracheal tube aspirate cultures,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Partial agreement: when the organisms in the blood were found as one of the&#xD;
                     multiple isolates from the endotracheal tube,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. No agreement: when the organism was found in the endotracheal tube aspirate&#xD;
                     and blood was not the same,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lines of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initial (empirical) therapy is most often begun before a definite causative agent&#xD;
                is identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continuing therapy is based on culture and sensitivity results, clinical course&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was explained to each parents of the child before the beginning of the&#xD;
      process. A written consent was obtained from those who welcomed to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality of all data were assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and for homogeneity&#xD;
      variances prior to further statistical analysis. Categorical variables were described by&#xD;
      number and percent (N, %), where continuous variables described by mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (Mean, SD). Chi-square test used to compare between categorical variables where&#xD;
      compare between continuous variables by t-test (One Way ANOVA). A two-tailed p &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with the IBM SPSS 20.0&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
