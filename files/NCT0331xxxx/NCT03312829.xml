  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the body-wide response to infection. People who develop sepsis have an increased&#xD;
      risk of dying. One of the greatest challenges in sepsis is determining what is the pathogen&#xD;
      (bacteria or virus for example) in a timely manner so the most specific antibiotics can be&#xD;
      given to treat the infection. Patients presenting to the hospital and the intensive care unit&#xD;
      often have lung infections. In this study the investigators plan to develop new techniques to&#xD;
      rapidly (less than 6 hours) identify bacteria growing in the airways of patients on&#xD;
      ventilators. The investigators will obtain these samples by suctioning the airways (a routine&#xD;
      procedure) and comparing the bacterial cultures grown by novel culture media with the usual&#xD;
      techniques in the hospital microbiology laboratory. At the same time the investigators will&#xD;
      collect a blood sample. This blood sample will be used to isolate the bacterial genetic&#xD;
      material and use this to compare with bacteria grown on the culture media from the clinical&#xD;
      and the research laboratory. The investigators will also collect information on the patient's&#xD;
      course in hospital. These pilot study results will allow us to integrate this new technique&#xD;
      into routine patient care.&#xD;

      The trial design is a pilot observational feasibility study within three intensive care units&#xD;
      at the Hamilton General Hospital, which is composed of both medical and surgical patient&#xD;
      populations where waived consent has been confirmed and approved by the Hamilton Integrated&#xD;
      Research Ethics Board. The study sample will include 50 patients over the age of 16 that will&#xD;
      be mechanically ventilated for greater than 48 hours with no antibiotic use for the past 24&#xD;
      hours and meet the Johanson Criteria for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) as the gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosis still remain controversial. This Johanson criteria maintains patients&#xD;
      must have 2 out of three criteria to be enrolled in the study and that criteria includes&#xD;
      either a leukocyte count &gt;12,000/mm³ , Fever &gt;38.0ºC and/or a new onset of purulent&#xD;
      endotracheal secretions or change in the character of sputum. Chest x-rays for examination of&#xD;
      a new or progressing infiltrate will be assessed but will not be used for initial inclusion&#xD;
      criteria but possibly in the conclusions when attempting to differentiate VAP from VAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of eligible patients maintains the need for daily screening of patients which&#xD;
      will be done primarily by myself as the co-investigator and from a research assistant through&#xD;
      the secure hospital patient data system. However education of the frontline staff&#xD;
      particularly nursing, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists and staff physicians who will&#xD;
      have direct contact with potential subject is also essential for successful recruitment,&#xD;
      coordination and timing of enrollment. I will create and hold education sessions for all&#xD;
      frontline staff outlining the purpose of the study, patient enrollment criterion and proper&#xD;
      sample collection procedures as well as continual bedside education throughout the course of&#xD;
      the study to ensure all staff will have the information to identify potential study patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients are identified as meeting criteria for enrollment, the research assistant will&#xD;
      be notified at which time the frontline staff will retrieved a premade package for the sample&#xD;
      collection. Using a sterile catheter and a clean technique, two separate tracheal aspirates&#xD;
      will be acquired from the subject and placed in their specialized clinical or research sputum&#xD;
      trap. To acquire two samples, sterile saline irrigation will be permitted and if needed the&#xD;
      splitting of the specimen into the separated collection traps. Concurrently a tube of blood&#xD;
      as well as one set of blood cultures from an established indwelling access (either central&#xD;
      line, arterial line or peripheral blood draw) will be drawn. Clinical lab labels will be&#xD;
      placed on one sputum sample and the set of blood cultures and sent routinely to the&#xD;
      microbiology lab. The research lab bag will contain the second sputum sample and blood tube&#xD;
      labelled with patient identification number and the time of sample collection. To ensure the&#xD;
      ability of culturing for anaerobic bacteria in the research laboratory, an anaerobic pack&#xD;
      will be placed in the research sample bag with the sputum sample and blood tube as well as a&#xD;
      damp paper towel. The sample bag will then be voided of air and sealed. The research bag is&#xD;
      labelled as well with patient identification number and date/time of sample collection which&#xD;
      is then sent to the clinical microbiology lab. The clinical laboratory is then notified of&#xD;
      the incoming research sample which will need to be transported to the research laboratory via&#xD;
      established laboratory transportation protocols. Once the sample is sent, the co-investigator&#xD;
      is notified again and clinical data (leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, arterial blood gases,&#xD;
      temperature, Glasgow coma scale, oxygen requirements, high/low respiratory rate, heart rate,&#xD;
      and blood pressure) for the day of collection and for the following six days including&#xD;
      complete ICU antibiotic usage, extubation date and final patient outcome after 30 days can be&#xD;
      collected and entered into a secure RedCap database. Communication to the research laboratory&#xD;
      will be the responsibility of the co-investigator to ensure samples have arrived and can be&#xD;
      plated in the time set out within the study protocol. Transportation of the samples are&#xD;
      available from 0700 until 2000 Monday through Sunday so identification of potential&#xD;
      enrollment , and collection of samples will be encouraged during these times to ensure&#xD;
      successful arrival and processing of samples at the research laboratory.&#xD;

      Dr. Surette's laboratory has optimized methods or enrichment of bacterial cells directly from&#xD;
      blood allowing for bacterial nucleic acid isolation suitable for molecular profiling with as&#xD;
      little as 1ml of blood. However, this methodology does have a limitation in that the&#xD;
      detection of bacterial DNA does not necessarily imply that there are corresponding viable&#xD;
      bacterial present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the lack of accuracy of this method, the investigators propose to apply our&#xD;
      optimized methods for bacterial cell enrichment from blood and nucleic acid isolation to&#xD;
      ribosomal RNA rather than DNA.&#xD;
