  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the rate of 3-year progression free survival in men&#xD;
      with recurrent PSA-only disease after prostatectomy, who receive combined apalutamide&#xD;
      (ARN-509) and standard ADT with salvage radiation therapy followed by docetaxel, ADT, and&#xD;
      apalutamide, AND who have had testosterone recovery to &gt;100 ng/dl at 36 months. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that AR inhibition with apalutamide added to standard salvage external beam&#xD;
      radiation with androgen deprivation therapy, as well as the addition of 6 cycles of&#xD;
      docetaxel, will further prolong progression free survival.&#xD;
