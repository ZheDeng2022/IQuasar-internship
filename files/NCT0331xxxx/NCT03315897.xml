  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial consists of 2 sub-studies that investigate important novel aspects of&#xD;
      treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) on cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder (BD) and&#xD;
      recurrent unipolar depressive disorder (UD) (defined as minimum 2 treatment-requiring&#xD;
      depressive episodes). The aims of the trial are three-fold. We aim to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of 12 weekly recombinant human EPO infusions on cognition in (i) healthy people with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (substudy 1) and (ii) patients with remitted BD or recurrent UD&#xD;
      (substudy 2), and (iii) explore early treatment-associated neural activity changes that may&#xD;
      predict subsequent cognitive improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. 12 weekly EPO infusions improve cognition in healthy first-degree relatives and remitted&#xD;
      BD patients in comparison with saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. EPO vs. saline-treated participants will display early cognition-related neural activity&#xD;
      in the frontal lobes, which will correlate with cognitive improvement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will include healthy people (sub-study 1) and patients with bipolar disorder or&#xD;
      recurrent unipolar depressive disorder in partial or full remission (defined as a score of&#xD;
      ≤14 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-items and the Young Mania Rating Scale,&#xD;
      respectively (sub-study 2) with objectively-verified cognitive dysfunction. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited from Psychiatric Centres in The Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of&#xD;
      Denmark, consultant psychiatrists in the Capital Region of Denmark, as well as through&#xD;
      advertisements on relevant websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design comprises 4 major assessments (baseline, week 3, week 13, and a 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up after treatment completion) and weekly safety monitoring and study medication&#xD;
      infusions during a 12 week treatment period. The baseline assessment is divided into 2 days,&#xD;
      1-3 days apart for practical reasons and to avoid attrition. On the first day of the baseline&#xD;
      assessment, participants will perform an fMRI scan. On the second baseline day, participants&#xD;
      complete an assessment comprising neuropsychological testing, verbal IQ assessment, and&#xD;
      filling in questionnaires concerning subjective cognitive complaints, quality of life, level&#xD;
      of functioning, and functional capacity, as well as mood symptom severity ratings. Functional&#xD;
      capacity is assessed using a clinician-rated interview and a performance-based task. After 2&#xD;
      weeks of treatment (i.e., 2 doses of EPO or saline) an fMRI scan, neuropsychological testing,&#xD;
      mood ratings, and questionnaires on subjective cognitive difficulties are repeated. After&#xD;
      treatment completion (week 13) and at the 6 month follow-up, the neuropsychological tests,&#xD;
      questionnaires concerning subjective cognitive complaints, quality of life, and functional&#xD;
      capacity (self-reported and performance-based) are repeated. Sleep quantity and quality in&#xD;
      the past three days is assessed before each of the 4 major assessment time point. Blood&#xD;
      samples are collected at baseline, week 3 and 13 for assessment of potential blood-based&#xD;
      biomarkers of pro-cognitive effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharma Consulting Group AB (www.pharmaconsultinggroup.com) has conducted block randomization&#xD;
      for each sub-study group, stratified for gender and age (sub-study 1: &lt; or &gt;=30 years;&#xD;
      sub-study 2: &lt; or &gt;=35 years). Power calculation was also carried out by Pharma Consulting&#xD;
      Group based on findings from a previous RCT in our group assessing the effect of 8 weeks of&#xD;
      EPO treatment on the same cognitive composite score. In this trial, the clinically relevant&#xD;
      differential change between EPO and saline groups following 12 weeks of treatment is assumed&#xD;
      to be at least 0.4 SD (corresponding to a moderate effect size) on the primary outcome with&#xD;
      SD of the change of 0.5. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate, we plan to recruit up to n=58 for each&#xD;
      sub-study to achieve complete data sets for n=52 participants per sub-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the primary, secondary, and tertiary outcomes will be analyzed using Mixed Models&#xD;
      Design and Intention to Treat (ITT) analyses. Functional MRI data are pre-processed and&#xD;
      analyzed with FMRIB Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT) and the 'randomize' algorithm implemented in&#xD;
      FSL (FMRIB Software Library; www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Functional MRI data is analysed using&#xD;
      region of interest (ROI) analyses to assess potential differences in neural activity within&#xD;
      the dorsal prefrontal cortex and the hippocampi between EPO and placebo groups after 2 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment. Exploratory whole-brain analyses are conducted to assess treatment-related&#xD;
      activity change in other brain regions. Any differences in neural activity between treatment&#xD;
      groups are correlated with potential changes in the primary cognitive composite measure after&#xD;
      2 weeks of treatment (week 3) and after treatment completion (week 13). If this correlation&#xD;
      is significant, multiple regression analyses will be performed with adjustment for mood&#xD;
      symptoms, age, and gender to assess the potential predictive value of early neural activity&#xD;
      change for potential pro-cognitive efficacy after 12 weeks of EPO treatment.&#xD;
