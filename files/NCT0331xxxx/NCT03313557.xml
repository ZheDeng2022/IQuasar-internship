  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomised study designed to provide continued access to AZD1775&#xD;
      for eligible patients with advanced solid tumours who have previously completed an AZD1775&#xD;
      clinical pharmacology study and to investigate the safety of a once daily monotherapy regimen&#xD;
      of AZD1775 in patients with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who completed 1 of the parent clinical pharmacology studies are eligible for&#xD;
      this study after a washout period of at least 4 days (minimum duration defined in the parent&#xD;
      study protocol) and meet the eligibility criteria specified in this protocol. Patients who&#xD;
      discontinue early from the parent study will be considered by the Sponsor and treating&#xD;
      physician on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients will continue to receive AZD1775 as long as they are benefiting&#xD;
      from treatment in the Investigator's opinion and do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
