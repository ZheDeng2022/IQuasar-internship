  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study whose purpose is to assess the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have experienced disease progression after treatment with&#xD;
      sorafenib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      every 21 days, until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiotherapy will commence on day 2 of the first cycle of pembrolizumab, and&#xD;
      will be delivered in 5 fractions over 8-15 days in accordance with institutional protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan,&#xD;
      confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-8 weeks following initial documentation of&#xD;
      objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using both RECIST 1.1and (iRECIST)&#xD;
      guideline (Seymor 2017).&#xD;
