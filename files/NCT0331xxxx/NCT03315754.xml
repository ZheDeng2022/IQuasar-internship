  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single-arm, open-label, 60-month follow-up phase IIb clinical trial.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the absence of biopsy detectable Gleason&#xD;
      grade 4 or 5 prostate cancer tumors anywhere in the prostate gland on 12-month,&#xD;
      post-treatment biopsy following TOOKAD® Soluble-VTP. Men with Gleason score 7 (3+4) prostate&#xD;
      cancer on one half of the prostate will receive TOOKAD® Soluble VTP under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Treatment will consist in hemiablation procedure designed to destroy the lobe of the prostate&#xD;
      gland that contains the Gleason score 7 (3+4) cancer. Afterwards, patients will be followed&#xD;
      for 5 years (60 months) with clinical evaluation, questionnaires on QOL, erectile and urinary&#xD;
      functions, and PSA testing. In addition, treatment outcomes will be assessed based on&#xD;
      prostate biopsy results at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the TOOKAD® Soluble&#xD;
      treatment. All patients will undergo biopsy at 3 and 12 months. If the Month 3 biopsy is&#xD;
      positive for any cancer, patients will be allowed a single re-treatment by TOOKAD® Soluble&#xD;
      VTP to one or both lobes.&#xD;
