  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work2Prevent will advance the science by adapting, tailoring, and pilot-testing a novel&#xD;
      social and structural-level HIV intervention for YMSM and YTW of color ages16-24 aimed at&#xD;
      increasing economic stability (i.e., employment) through youth empowerment and asset&#xD;
      development, and decreasing HIV risk behaviors (i.e., sex work) associated with social and&#xD;
      economic marginalization.&#xD;

    <measure>Information Systems Success Model Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (up to 2 weeks after completion of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Information Systems Success Model (ISSM) will be used to assess for intervention acceptability and satisfaction. The 21-item scale measures four sub-domains: information quality, handbook quality, perceived usefulness, and overall satisfaction. Every item is scored on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 5 being &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. Responses are averaged within each sub-domain to produce four sub-domain scores. The four sub-domain scores are then averaged to produce an overall ISSM score (1-5; higher scores indicate higher acceptability/satisfaction).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Completing Two or More Workshop Sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Intervention (up to 2 weeks after completion of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Workshop completion will be used to assess for intervention feasibility, as the workshop sessions are the intervention. Workshop completion will be defined as having attended at least two of the four workshop sessions and will be measured by tracking participant attendance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Job seeking self-efficacy is defined as one's perceived ability and confidence to perform job search and application activities. The 12-item Job Seeking Self-Efficacy (JSS) scale uses response values on a 1-10 score, with 1 being &quot;Not at All Confident&quot; and 10 being &quot;Very Confident&quot;. Responses are averaged to yield a total score, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy. Change in JSS will be calculated by subtracting the JSS score at baseline (T1) from the JSS score at the 8-month follow-up (T3) (-9 to +9; negative change indicates decreased self-efficacy, while positive change indicates increased self-efficacy).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Protean Career Attitudes Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Protean career attitudes (PCAs) are defined as having self-direction in the pursuit of success in one's work. PCAs have previously been found to be associated with positive career satisfaction and self-perceived success. The validated 7-item scale measures two sub-domains: self-directed attitudes and values-driven attitudes. Every item is scored on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 5 being &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. Responses are averaged within each sub-domain to produce two sub-domain scores, which are then averaged as well to produce an overall PCA score. Change in PCA score will be calculated by subtracting the score at baseline (T1) from the score at the 8-month follow-up (T3) (-4 to +4; negative change indicates decreased PCAs, while positive change indicates increased PCAs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Self-Reported Hours Worked Per Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Employment status will be assessed using self-reported average number of hours worked each week. Change in hours worked per week will be calculated by subtracting the baseline (T1) value from the follow-up (T3) value (negative change indicates fewer hours worked per week, while positive change indicates more hours work per week).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Self-Reported Sexual Risk Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual risk behaviors will be measured using 6 yes/no items assessing for engagement in the following behaviors during the past 6 months (this refers to the 6 months prior to the baseline visit for the first assessment and 6 months prior to the 8 month visit for the second assessment) for Phase 2, and the last 3 months for Phase 3:&#xD;
condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with male partner of unknown HIV status&#xD;
anal intercourse with 3 or more males&#xD;
sex with male partner with a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)&#xD;
CAI with HIV+ male partner&#xD;
anal intercourse with condom failure&#xD;
transactional sex work involvement&#xD;
Responses will be averaged at each assessment. Change in sexual risk behaviors will be calculated by subtracting the average at baseline from the average at the 8-month follow-up (range: -1 to +1; negative change indicates fewer sexual risk behaviors, while positive change indicates more sexual risk behaviors).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Oral Chlamydia Test Result</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Chlamydia infection will be assessed at baseline and follow-up using an oral sample. The test yields a positive (1) or negative (0) result. The number of positive test results at baseline and follow-up will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Anal Chlamydia Test Result</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-Up (8 months for Phase 2, 3 months for Phase 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Chlamydia infection will be assessed at baseline and follow up using an anal sample. The test yields a positive (1) or negative (0) result. Number of positive test results at baseline and follow-up will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

          <title>Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Score</title>
          <description>Job seeking self-efficacy is defined as one's perceived ability and confidence to perform job search and application activities. The 12-item Job Seeking Self-Efficacy (JSS) scale uses response values on a 1-10 score, with 1 being &quot;Not at All Confident&quot; and 10 being &quot;Very Confident&quot;. Responses are averaged to yield a total score, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Scale Score</title>
        <description>Job seeking self-efficacy is defined as one's perceived ability and confidence to perform job search and application activities. The 12-item Job Seeking Self-Efficacy (JSS) scale uses response values on a 1-10 score, with 1 being &quot;Not at All Confident&quot; and 10 being &quot;Very Confident&quot;. Responses are averaged to yield a total score, with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy. Change in JSS will be calculated by subtracting the JSS score at baseline (T1) from the JSS score at the 8-month follow-up (T3) (-9 to +9; negative change indicates decreased self-efficacy, while positive change indicates increased self-efficacy).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Protean Career Attitudes Scale Score</title>
        <description>Protean career attitudes (PCAs) are defined as having self-direction in the pursuit of success in one's work. PCAs have previously been found to be associated with positive career satisfaction and self-perceived success. The validated 7-item scale measures two sub-domains: self-directed attitudes and values-driven attitudes. Every item is scored on a 1-5 scale, with 1 being &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 5 being &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. Responses are averaged within each sub-domain to produce two sub-domain scores, which are then averaged as well to produce an overall PCA score. Change in PCA score will be calculated by subtracting the score at baseline (T1) from the score at the 8-month follow-up (T3) (-4 to +4; negative change indicates decreased PCAs, while positive change indicates increased PCAs).</description>
