      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cabozantinib (XL184)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of Nivolumab&#xD;
      and Cabozantinib as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Cabozantinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for&#xD;
      other uses. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for&#xD;
      this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib has been used in some phase I studies and information from those other research&#xD;
      studies suggests that cabozantinib may help to shrink or stabilize breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancers are recognized by the immune system, and under some circumstances, the immune system&#xD;
      may control or even eliminate tumors. An antibody is a natural protein made by the immune&#xD;
      system that binds other proteins and molecules to fight infection and its ill effects.&#xD;
      Antibodies stimulating the immune system have been developed for treatment of human cancers.&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active&#xD;
      against cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at how the participant's type of breast&#xD;
      cancer responds to the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast&#xD;
             cancer, with metastatic disease. Participants without pathologic or cytologic&#xD;
             confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from&#xD;
             physical examination or radiologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor expression both &lt;10% by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 negative by IHC or non-amplified as determined by&#xD;
             the current ASCO-CAP criteria. If patient has more than one histological result, the&#xD;
             most recent one has to be considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease by RECIST version 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is safely accessible,&#xD;
             at baseline and 7-14 days prior to C3D1. Participants for whom newly-obtained samples&#xD;
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or participant safety concern) may submit an&#xD;
             archived specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: After the first 6 participants undergo biopsy on cabozantinib, we will review their&#xD;
        adverse event profiles to ensure no more than a 20% rate of grade 3 or higher bleeding or&#xD;
        wound healing complications occur. If more than 2 patients (&gt;20%) have safety concerns, we&#xD;
        will reassess the safety of collecting the research biopsies. Full review of all grade&#xD;
        (including grade 1 and 2) may also prompt changes and will be reviewed by the study team.&#xD;
        Exelixis may be consulted if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy: Participants may have received 0-3 prior chemotherapeutic regimens&#xD;
             for metastatic breast cancer and must have been off treatment with chemotherapy for at&#xD;
             least 14 days prior to registration. Participants should also be adequately recovered&#xD;
             from acute toxicities of prior treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior biologic therapy: Patients must have discontinued all biologic therapy at least&#xD;
             14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy: Patients may have received prior radiation therapy in either&#xD;
             the metastatic or early-stage setting. Radiation therapy must be completed per the&#xD;
             following timelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy to the thoracic cavity or abdomen within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
                  registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy to bone lesions within 2 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiotherapy to any other site within 4 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In all cases, there must be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤1(Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL&#xD;

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or 2.0 x ULN in&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional ULN or&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ≤ 3 × institutional ULN for participants with documented liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt;1.5 ×institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min (using&#xD;
                  Cockcroft-Gault formula) for participants with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential is defined as: participants who have not reached a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause&#xD;
             other than menopause) and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries&#xD;
             and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female and male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate&#xD;
             method of contraception. Contraception is required starting with the first dose of&#xD;
             study medication through 150 days (5 months) after the last dose of study medication .&#xD;
             Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and&#xD;
             copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated&#xD;
             in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;

             signed the informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 12 weeks before the first dose of study treatment. Complete wound&#xD;
             healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Minor surgery (including uncomplicated tooth extractions) within 28 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment with complete wound healing at least 10 days&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment. No clinically relevant ongoing complications&#xD;
             from prior surgery are not eligibile.&#xD;
&#xD;

             by the treating physician. Participants with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical&#xD;
