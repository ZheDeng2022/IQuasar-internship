      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of olaparib and how well it&#xD;
      works with radium Ra 223 dichloride in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to the bone and other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are&#xD;
      proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP&#xD;
      from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Radioactive&#xD;
      drugs, such as radium Ra 223 dichloride, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not&#xD;
      harm normal cells. Giving olaparib and radium Ra 223 dichloride may help treat patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

      dichloride (radium-223). (Phase 1) II. Evaluate the radiographic progression-free survival&#xD;
      (rPFS). (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate safety and tolerability as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate rPFS as stratified by disease extent (=&lt; 20 or &gt; 20 bone lesions) and prior&#xD;
      docetaxel use (yes or no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate rPFS in patients harboring or lacking evidence of homologous recombination&#xD;
      deficiency (HRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate rPFS in patients based on prior abiraterone and/or next generation androgen&#xD;
      receptor (AR) antagonist (enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide or other agent) use (yes&#xD;
      versus no) for either hormone sensitive or castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;

      IX. Evaluate time to increase in the total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level defined as an&#xD;
      increase of &gt;= 25% from baseline at &gt;= 12 weeks, in patients with no decrease from baseline,&#xD;
      or as an increase of &gt;= 25% above the nadir, confirmed &gt;= 3 weeks later, in patients with an&#xD;
      initial decrease from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Evaluate time to first subsequent anti-cancer therapy (including AR signaling agents,&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents) or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Evaluate time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). XII. Evaluate overall survival&#xD;
      (OS).&#xD;

      VIII. Evaluate family history of cancers in the study population and correlate family cancer&#xD;
      history with germline mutation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Correlate presence or absence of RAD51 with somatic and germline homologous recombination&#xD;
      gene mutation status, PSA response, and PFS between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Evaluate the changes in whole genome sequencing (WGS) of plasma cell-free circulating DNA&#xD;

&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients receive radium Ra 223 dichloride intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days&#xD;
      1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive radium Ra 223 dichloride IV over 1 minute on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive radium Ra 223 dichloride as in Arm I. Patients with radiographic&#xD;
      progression may crossover to Arm I. If patients have already completed all 6 infusions of&#xD;
      radium, they will receive monotherapy with olaparib. If they have not yet completed all 6&#xD;
      radium-223 infusion, they will continue radium-223 infusion until completion and receive&#xD;
      concurrent treatment with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
