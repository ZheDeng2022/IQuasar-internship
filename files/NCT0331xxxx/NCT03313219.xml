  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and, tolerabilitytolerance, pharmacokinetices&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of escalating single doses and subsequent multiple dose of Gentuximab&#xD;
      Injection in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors and to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose（MTD） and dose limiting toxicities（DLT）.with single and subsequent&#xD;
      multiple intravenous infusion in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors and&#xD;
      to provide a basis for the protocol design of later clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and tumor response of multiple dose of Gentuximab Injection in patients with&#xD;
      late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety profile of Gentuximab Injection will be explored together with the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with Gentuximab Injection&#xD;
      to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties&#xD;
      of Gentuximab Injection will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at&#xD;
      different dose levels.&#xD;

SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>

    <description>Patients are assigned to a dose level at the time of study entry and scheduled to receive i.v. of a single dose. The patient enter the subsequent multiple dose i.v. in a 7-day cycle if no DLT in 21 days after the first dose. The study period of each subject will be up to 4 cycles until the tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD will be determined by assessing DLT in each cohort from cohort 1 to 6, using a 3+3 dose escalation model. Cohort A begin at 4mg/kg IV and the dose escalated in separate cohorts from 8mg/kg IV, 12mg/kg IV，16mg/kg IV and 20mg/kg IV. If there is no DLT observe in any of these 3 patients in 7 weeks, then the trial proceeds to enroll 3 patients into the next higher dose cohort. If one subject develops a DLT at a specific cohort, an additional 3 patients are enrolled into that same dose cohort. Development of DLTs in more than 1 of 6 patients in a specific dose cohort suggests that the MTD has been exceeded, and further dose escalation is not pursued.</description>
