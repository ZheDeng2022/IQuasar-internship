      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      mRNA-4157 alone in participants with resected solid tumors and in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with unresectable solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-part, dose-escalation study of mRNA-4157 monotherapy in participants with&#xD;
      resected solid tumors (Part A) and of mRNA-4157 in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      participants with both unresectable (locally advanced or metastatic) solid tumors (Parts B&#xD;
      and C) and resected cutaneous melanoma (Part D). Parts A and B will include a dose escalation&#xD;
      phase of the study to identify doses of mRNA-4157 for the expansion phase of the study. Doses&#xD;
      of mRNA-4157 will be administered to participants in a dose escalation regimen. Participants&#xD;
      in Parts B, C, and D dose expansion phase will receive mRNA-4157 at a recommended dose for&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;
