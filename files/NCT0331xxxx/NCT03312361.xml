    <textblock>
      To determine if a prolonged high altitude simulation test (HAST) lasting two hours,&#xD;
      identifies more patients at risk of respiratory failure than the standard HAST lasting 20&#xD;
      minutes, in patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) and severe pulmonary restriction. To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of supplemental oxygen administered in those with a positive HAST in the&#xD;
      NMD population.&#xD;

      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were screened for eligibility during a regularly scheduled clinic visit in which&#xD;
      spirometry was performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Society recommendations.4&#xD;
      If eligible, they were approached by a Research Coordinator and invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The study visit was organized within 4 weeks of screening and included both diagnostic&#xD;
      and (if applicable) therapeutic HCT trials. After enrolment, patients' local medical records&#xD;
      were reviewed for baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the HCT, a brief focused history including current respiratory symptoms was&#xD;
      performed. Study participants sat for a minimum of 5 minutes before baseline measurements&#xD;
      were taken. Vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure), capillary blood gas,&#xD;
      transcutaneous capnography and pulse oximetry were performed immediately prior to the start&#xD;
      of testing. The transcutaneous CO2 and SpO2 values obtained just prior to provision of the&#xD;
      gas mixture were considered the baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Procedures: Study participants underwent a standard 20 minute HCT and if eligible&#xD;
      (i.e. not positive or test not terminated) then immediately continued on to complete the 120&#xD;
      minute extended HCT. A gas mixture of 15% oxygen in nitrogen from a specially prepared&#xD;
      cylinder was administered via a non-rebreather mask sealed to the face. Flow was adjusted for&#xD;
      patient comfort, and to match inspiratory flow by maintaining non-rebreather bag inflation&#xD;
      thus ensuring no entrainment of room air (between 6-15 L/minute). The patient would breathe&#xD;
      this mixture for up to 120 minutes, or until they met stopping criteria. Continuous pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, transcutaneous capnography and respiratory rate were recorded throughout the HCT.&#xD;
      Patients were asked to indicate the severity of dyspnea every 10 minutes using the modified&#xD;
      Borg scale. Capillary blood gases were drawn at the end of the standard and prolonged HCTs&#xD;
      (i.e. immediately after 20 and 120 minutes, respectively). The patient was observed for 20&#xD;
      minutes after completion of the HCT, or until oxygen saturation and transcutaneous pCO2&#xD;
      returned to baseline levels. The HCT was considered positive and the test was stopped if any&#xD;
      of the following occurred: i) oxygen saturation &lt;88% for two consecutive minutes (as per&#xD;
      institutional cutoff for prescription of oxygen); ii) ≥ 10mmHg rise from baseline in&#xD;
      transcutaneous CO2 sustained for 2 minutes and confirmed by capillary blood gas; iii) severe&#xD;
      symptoms such as dyspnea or confusion; iv) or participant request to stop testing. Repeat&#xD;
      complete vital signs were performed prior to the end of the study visit.&#xD;
