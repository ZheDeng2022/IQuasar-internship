  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, open-label, multi-arm, parallel multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study&#xD;
      to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and patient-reported quality of life of&#xD;
      JCAR017 in combination with various agents. This protocol is intended to evaluate various&#xD;
      drug combinations with JCAR017, as separate arms, over the life of the protocol, using the&#xD;
      same objectives. Each combination will be evaluated separately (ie, the intention is not to&#xD;
      compare between combinations) for the purposes of the objectives, trial design, and&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The following combinations will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab Arm B: JCAR017 in combination with CC-122&#xD;
      (avadomide) Arm C: JCAR017 in combination with CC-220 (iberdomide) Arm D: JCAR017 in&#xD;
      combination with ibrutinib Arm E: JCAR017 in combination with relatlimab and/or nivolumab Arm&#xD;
      F: JCAR017 in combination with CC-99282 Additional arms will be added by way of amendment&#xD;
      once combination agents have been selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 parts: dose finding (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2). Dose&#xD;
      expansion may occur in one or more arms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase 1, different arms may be opened to test JCAR017 in combination with combination&#xD;
      agent(s) in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B-cell NHL. Within each arm, different doses&#xD;
      and schedules of JCAR017 and the combination agent(s) may be tested in several cohorts and&#xD;
      subcohorts per arm. During Phase 2 of the study, the expansion of any dose level and schedule&#xD;
      for any arm that has been shown to be safe may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A will test JCAR017 in combination with Durvalumab Arm B will test JCAR017 in combination&#xD;
      with CC-122 Arm C will test JCAR017 in combination with CC-220 (iberdomide ) Arm D will test&#xD;
      JCAR017 in combination with ibrutinib. Arm E will test JCAR017 in combination with relatlimab&#xD;
      and/or nivolumab Arm F will test JCAR017 in combination with CC-99282 All subjects from Phase&#xD;
      1 and Phase 2 will be followed for 24 months following JCAR017 infusion. Post-study follow-up&#xD;
      for survival, relapse, long-term toxicity (including new malignancies), and viral vector&#xD;
      safety will continue under a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) protocol for up to 15 years&#xD;
      after the JCAR017 dose as per health authority regulatory guidelines.&#xD;
