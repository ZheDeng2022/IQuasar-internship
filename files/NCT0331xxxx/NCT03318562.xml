  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD), safety, antitumor activity, and PK of&#xD;
      eFT508 in female subjects who have pathologically documented, radiographically measurable,&#xD;
      metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable TNBC and have received prior cancer therapy&#xD;
      regimen for metastatic disease, and in male and female subjects who have histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically confirmed advanced HCC not amenable to surgical resection and have failed&#xD;
      systemic therapy.&#xD;
