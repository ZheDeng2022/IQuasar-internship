      This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant&#xD;
      females 19 years and older that is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic 2017 monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine&#xD;
      (2017 H7N9 IIV) administered at different dosages given with AS03 adjuvant and phosphate&#xD;
      buffered saline (PBS) diluent, with AS03 adjuvant only, and without adjuvant. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into 5 study groups, stratified by age. The study will enroll up&#xD;
      to 420 individuals 19-64 years old and up to 300 individuals who are 65 years old and older.&#xD;
      Study duration is approximately 16 months with subject participation duration approximately&#xD;
      13 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered intramuscularly&#xD;
      at different dosages approximately 21 days apart given with or without AS03 adjuvant; 2) to&#xD;
      assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses&#xD;
      following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered intramuscularly at different&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for&#xD;
             all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 years of age and older, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are in good health*. *As determined by medical history and physical examination to&#xD;
             evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined&#xD;
             as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the&#xD;
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.&#xD;
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no&#xD;
             hospitalizations, ER, or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms that need&#xD;
             medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no&#xD;
             change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of&#xD;
             deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,&#xD;
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same&#xD;
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as&#xD;
             determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will&#xD;
             not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic&#xD;
             or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator&#xD;
             or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or&#xD;
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of&#xD;
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment&#xD;
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the&#xD;
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there&#xD;
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses&#xD;
             to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the&#xD;
             exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria),&#xD;
             herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pulse is 47 to 100 bpm, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive (subjects &lt;65 years of age), 85&#xD;
             to 160 mmHg, inclusive (subjects = / &gt; 65 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of childbearing potential* must use an acceptable contraception method** from 30&#xD;
             days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy,&#xD;
             hysterectomy, or successful Essure(R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal&#xD;
             sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after&#xD;
             the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             **Acceptable contraception includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from&#xD;
             sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized&#xD;
             partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving&#xD;

             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess&#xD;
             safety parameters as required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal&#xD;

        <description>For each unsolicited AE experienced, the participants were asked if he/she had received medical attention, defined as hospitalization, an emergency room visit, or an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason. AEs characterized by such unscheduled medical care were designated as MAAEs. NOCMCs are defined as any new ICD-10 diagnosis that is applied to the participant during the duration of the study, after receipt of the study agent, that is expected to continue for at least 3 months and requires continued health care intervention. PIMMCs constitute a group of AEs that includes diseases which are clearly autoimmune in etiology and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders which may or may not have autoimmune etiologies.</description>

Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. Seroconversion was defined as Neut pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and post-vaccination titer &gt;=1:40 or pre-vaccination titer 1:10 or greater and minimum 4-fold rise in post-vaccination antibody titer. Day 22 is 21 days after the first dose of H7N9.</description>
