  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a herpesvirus that causes two distinct clinical&#xD;
      syndromes.Primary infection is manifested as varicella (chickenpox), whereas reactivation of&#xD;
      latent VZV results in a localized eruption known as herpes zoster. More than 99.6% of people&#xD;
      40 years of age orolder had evidence of previous VZV infection. This study plans to have&#xD;
      30000 adults 40 years of age or older involoved in a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of an investigational live attenuated varicella-zoster virus&#xD;
      vaccine. The investigational vaccines are produced by Changchun Changsheng biotechnology co.&#xD;
      LTD. The incidence of herpes zoster and the severity, and duration of the associated pain and&#xD;
      discomfort were measured after the vaccination. And the safety of the varicella-zoster virus&#xD;
      vaccine is also evaluated.&#xD;
