  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial designed to:&#xD;
      1) demonstrate the degree to which administered andexanet doses can reverse Factor Ten A&#xD;
      (FXa)-inhibitor induced anticoagulation; and 2) evaluate the safety and PK/PD of andexanet in&#xD;
      healthy Japanese subjects taking direct FXa inhibitors at therapeutic doses.&quot;&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Must be in reasonably good health as determined by the Investigator based on medical&#xD;
             history, full physical examination (including blood pressure and pulse rate&#xD;
             measurement), 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Subjects with&#xD;
             well-controlled, chronic, stable conditions (e.g., controlled hypertension,&#xD;
             non-insulin dependent diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism) may be enrolled based&#xD;
             on the clinical judgment of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For all cohorts except Cohort 5, subjects must be of Japanese ethnicity, defined as&#xD;
             having four ethnic Japanese grandparents. Subjects may not have lived outside of Japan&#xD;

             multivitamin and mineral supplementation will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Agrees to comply with the contraception and reproduction restrictions of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men whose sexual partner is of childbearing potential and/or who are not&#xD;
                  monogamous must be using two acceptable methods of contraception, at least one of&#xD;
                  which must be a barrier method (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom), for the&#xD;
                  entire duration of the study and for at least 1 month following study-drug&#xD;
                  administration; and men must refrain from attempting to father a child or&#xD;
                  donating sperm in the 1 month following the study-drug administration. Periodic&#xD;
                  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and&#xD;
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Men who report surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral vasectomy) must have had&#xD;
                  the procedure at least 6 months before study drug administration.&#xD;

                  and noted in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of&#xD;
                  the case report forms (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential must be using two medically acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception, at least one of which must be a barrier method (e.g., non-hormone&#xD;
                  containing intra-uterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom,&#xD;
                  diaphragm plus condom), from the time of Screening and for the duration of the&#xD;
                  study, through at least 1 month following study drug administration. Note: Oral&#xD;
                  and topical hormonal contraceptive use, as well as the use of hormone-containing&#xD;
                  intra-uterine devices, is not permitted due to their increased risk of&#xD;
                  thromboembolism. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post- ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception; OR&#xD;

                  and/or bilateral oophorectomy) must have had the procedure at least 6 months&#xD;
                  before study drug administration. Surgical sterilization procedures should be&#xD;

      <desc>Treatment emergent AEs occurring between informed consent and the Termination Visit will be recorded on the e-CRFs. All AEs should be monitored until they are resolved, reach a level of stability and are not expected to improve further, or are clearly determined to be due to a subject's stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness. Any AE that begins after completion of the study and that the Investigator considers to be related to study medication, must be reported to Portola.</desc>
