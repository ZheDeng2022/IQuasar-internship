  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye complaints occur in 5.5 to 33.7% of the population, and are ranked as the most&#xD;
      frequent symptoms of patients visiting ophthalmologists. Dry eye syndrome is caused by the&#xD;
      reduced production and/or improper quality of the tear film. One of the causes of reduced&#xD;
      tear production is Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's is estimated to affect up to 4 million&#xD;
      patients in the US alone. It affects mostly middle aged women (40-50 years of age) with a&#xD;
      female to male prevalence ratio of 9:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LO2A ophthalmic solution in&#xD;
      the symptomatic treatment of dry eye in patients with Sjögren's syndrome. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP,and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-masked, comparative study versus Systane ultra UD, to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of LO2A eye drops for symptomatic improvement of dry eye in Patients&#xD;
      with Sjögren's syndrome. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of&#xD;
      two treatment groups, LO2A or Systane ultra UD, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to two weeks and a 3-month double blind&#xD;
      treatment period (topical application of eye drops four times daily)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 subjects are planned to be recruited to this study, randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms using a 1:1 active (LO2A) to Systane ultra UD ratio.&#xD;
