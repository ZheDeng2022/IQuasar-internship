  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether co-administration of belimumab and a single&#xD;
      cycle of rituximab will optimize treatment with belimumab, which will result in improvements&#xD;
      of clinical status with a favorable safety profile, by comparing subjects randomized to&#xD;
      belimumab plus rituximab versus belimumab plus rituximab-placebo. Approximately 280 subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms; belimumab plus&#xD;
      rituximab-placebo (Arm A, control), belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B, combination), or&#xD;
      belimumab plus standard therapy (Arm C, reference). Arm A and Arm B will be double-blinded&#xD;
      and Arm C will be open-labeled. The open-label arm will provide a qualitative reference to&#xD;
      standard therapy. Belimumab will be administered as subcutaneous (SC) and rituximab-placebo&#xD;
      or rituximab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusions. The total duration of the&#xD;
      study is for 104 weeks. Double-blinded phase will be for 52-weeks with subjects from Arm A&#xD;
      and B who cannot tolerate discontinuation of immunosuppressant or taper of corticosteroids.&#xD;
      Subjects in Arm C will continue to receive belimumab SC and their stable immunosuppressant&#xD;
      during Weeks 53 through 104.&#xD;
