  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study focuses on the causal relationship between mycotoxin exposure (particularly&#xD;
      aflatoxin B1), birth outcomes, and height for age among young children in Nepal. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown a strong association of stunting with mycotoxin exposure yet causality has&#xD;
      not been proven. Thus, this study will provide a better understanding of the association&#xD;
      between maternal and/or early life mycotoxin exposure (rates in the blood and breast milk)&#xD;
      and infant and young child growth. This information is essential if we are to more fully&#xD;
      understand and effectively address the high rates of stunting in Asia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, a research prioritization meeting organized by IFPRI and the Bill and Melinda Gates&#xD;
      Foundation on food-borne toxins concluded, &quot;While there is solid association of stunting with&#xD;
      exposure to mycotoxins, the causality has not been proven and the percentage of stunting&#xD;
      attributable to mycotoxins in general or to specific mycotoxins is not known.&quot; (IFPRI/BMGF&#xD;
      2012) In other words, the extent of the problem, although widely suspected, has been poorly&#xD;
      documented and the biological mechanisms thought to be involved remain poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To contribute to a better understanding of the mycotoxin-stunting relationship, the Feed the&#xD;
      Future Feed the Future Nutrition Innovation Lab-Asia proposes to explore the impact of&#xD;
      mycotoxins, with a focus on mycotoxins on child nutrition in Nepal. Through its PoSHAN study,&#xD;
      the Nutrition Innovation Lab-Asia is currently undertaking research in Nepal in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Child Health Division of the Ministry of Health and Population and multiple local&#xD;
      partners on how investments in agriculture can achieve significant impacts on maternal and&#xD;
      child nutrition, and on demonstrating how large-scale programs best incorporate such evidence&#xD;
      into cost-effective multi-sectoral interventions. Adding a study component on food safety&#xD;
      (mycotoxin contamination of the food supply) will significantly enhance our understanding of&#xD;
      nutrition outcomes linked to investments in agriculture. As noted by participants of the&#xD;
      IFPRI/BMGF (2012) meeting, &quot;only 35% of stunting of children can be attributed to known&#xD;
      factors&quot;. This leaves room for research to uncover other suspected contributors to the&#xD;
      world's huge nutrition problems, which could then lead testable recommendations for&#xD;
      innovative interventions to address newly identified factors. The team will assess current&#xD;
      mycotoxin risk so that potential mitigation strategies can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the significant statistical associations shown between mycotoxin exposure in children&#xD;
      and height gain in infants and young children, the Nutrition Innovation Lab-Asia will&#xD;
      undertake an mycotoxin birth cohort study to further the understanding of the causal&#xD;
      relationship between past and current mycotoxin exposure (maternal and infant), birth&#xD;
      outcomes and length-for-age in Nepali infants and young children. The study will also seek to&#xD;
      validate the use of low cost data collection methods (e.g. dried blood spots versus venous&#xD;
      blood samples) for mycotoxin analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the relationship of maternal mycotoxin exposure in pregnancy and birth&#xD;
           outcomes, including infant birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the relationship of exposure to mycotoxin of infants through breast milk and&#xD;
           their linear growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the relationship of exposure to mycotoxin through complementary feeding and&#xD;
           linear growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To enumerate the relative contributions of maternal and infant mycotoxin exposures in&#xD;
           impairing linear growth, controlling for other potential explanatory factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlling for factors such as diet, maternal education, maternal height and BMI, household&#xD;
      socio-economic status, infections and inflammation, and other elements such as storage&#xD;
      patterns, knowledge of food contaminants and mitigation practices, the specific hypotheses of&#xD;
      this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is an incremental effect of in utero, lactation and complementary feeding&#xD;
           mycotoxin exposures on rate of length gain and stunting outcomes for age Z-scores in&#xD;
           children at 2 year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maternal exposure to mycotoxins will be significant predictor of birth weight in&#xD;
           infants, thereby being a significant contributor to the burden of stunting at 2 years of&#xD;
           age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exposure to mycotoxins through breast milk before 6 months of age along with continued&#xD;
           exposure through both breast milk and complementary foods (after 6 months of age) is a&#xD;
           significant contributor to the burden of stunting at 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improper farm management, food processing and storage practices are significantly&#xD;
           related to higher levels of serum mycotoxins in the blood of mothers and their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Knowledge of the problem of food-borne contaminants is associated with improved food&#xD;
           processing and storage practices.&#xD;
