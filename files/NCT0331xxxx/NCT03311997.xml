  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide reliable evidence on how to best treat proximal&#xD;
      hamstrings avulsions, and our primary aim is to compare the reported outcome of patients&#xD;
      treated non-operatively with patients treated with suture anchor reattachment of the tendons&#xD;
      using the Perth Hamstrings Assessment Tool (PHAT) at 24 months.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of proximal hamstrings avulsions is controversial and patients with this injury&#xD;
      will get treatment recommendations based not on scientific evidence but on personal&#xD;
      preferences of their surgeon. The literature is totally devoid of studies comparing the two&#xD;
      treatment options; non-operative and operative treatment. In Sweden, it is probably more&#xD;
      common to treat these injuries nonoperatively. This is in contrast to existing literature&#xD;
      that suggests that better outcomes are expected with operative treatment. However, there is a&#xD;
      very clear publication bias in the literature. In fact, of the more than 40 published&#xD;
      clinical studies, only a handful mentions the results of non-operatively treated injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review examining 13 original studies, patient satisfaction ranged from 88% to&#xD;
      100% after surgical treatment. In nine of the studies strength of hamstrings were reported&#xD;
      and ranged from 78% to 101% of the uninjured side. However, residual pain is common, ranging&#xD;
      from 8 to 61% in a group of 203 patients and in a recent unpublished study the lower&#xD;
      extremity functional score were similar in patients treated by either modality. Additionally,&#xD;
      serious nerve injuries after surgery have been reported and infection, anchor failure and&#xD;
      re-rupture occur. The reoperation rate in a study by Sarimo et al. was 12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, multicentre, preference-tolerant, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing operative to non-operative treatment of proximal hamstrings avulsions. The study&#xD;
      will include a concurrent prospective cohort observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible study population will consist of patients with an acute, avulsion of hamstrings&#xD;
      tendons diagnosed in a hospital in Sweden, Norway or Finland and subsequently referred to one&#xD;
      of the study sites. All patients fulfilling the inclusion and not meeting the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be asked to participate in the study. After the patient´s enrolment has been&#xD;
      confirmed and informed consent is obtained a set of questionnaires is provided for background&#xD;
      data on medical history, activity levels and a recall assessment of the pre-injury functional&#xD;
      status. When these questionnaires are completed, the patient is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to non-operative treatment an appointment with a physiotherapist&#xD;
      follows and the study rehabilitation protocol is explained. If the patient is randomized to&#xD;
      surgery, the procedure is scheduled at the earliest convenient time but no later than 2 weeks&#xD;
      from inclusion. The surgical procedure and rehabilitation protocol is standardized among&#xD;
      sites. The same rehabilitation protocol is used for both treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 24 months. In-person participant follow-up visits will&#xD;
      occur at enrollment (baseline), at-surgery, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months&#xD;
      post-surgery. Data for outcomes and radiographs will be collected at follow-up visit.&#xD;
