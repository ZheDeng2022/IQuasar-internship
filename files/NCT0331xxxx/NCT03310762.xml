  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world in part, due to the low&#xD;
      coverage (54%) for all basic vaccinations. Low uptake, lack of awareness among parents to&#xD;
      complete the recommended immunization schedule and inability to remember vaccine appointments&#xD;
      are some of the key factors hindering improvement in uptake of immunization services. On the&#xD;
      supply side, ineffective methods to track children's' vaccine doses means that there is no&#xD;
      reliable mechanism to verify vaccine administration and estimate accurate immunization&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to develop and test two types of silicon bracelets for children to&#xD;
      stimulate immunization demand and simultaneously address supply side verification issues.&#xD;
      These bracelets use a combination of numbers and symbols to denote the age of the child and&#xD;
      due vaccines and are designed for illiterate or uneducated mothers; are low-cost and&#xD;
      adaptable to most local settings. At the time of vaccine administration, the appropriate&#xD;
      symbol denoting the vaccine on the bracelets is punched and therefore the bracelets can serve&#xD;
      as effective reminders for mothers for timely immunization of their child and as a tool for&#xD;
      vaccinators to verify vaccine administration and coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individually randomized, three-arm parallel group design randomized control trial will be&#xD;
      conducted with equal allocation in the two treatment groups and control group. Children in&#xD;
      intervention group A will receive the simple silicon bracelets, children in intervention&#xD;
      group B will receive the bracelets developed by Alma Sana Inc. and children in the Control&#xD;
      group will not receive any intervention. The impact of these immunization reminder bracelets&#xD;
      on immunization coverage and timeliness will be evaluated through a randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT) across 4 immunization centers in Karachi. To evaluate the bracelets' impact, variables&#xD;
      of interest-coverage and timeliness rates of pentavalent-3/PCV-3/polio-3 and Measles 1&#xD;
      vaccine will be compared between Group A and the Control Group and Group B and the Control&#xD;
      Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed results include increase in immunization coverage and timeliness of&#xD;
      Pentavalent-3/Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-3)/Polio-3 and Measles-1 in the&#xD;
      intervention versus control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide evidence of the bracelet's effectiveness for the global health&#xD;
      community and provide a simple tool for strengthening routine immunization efforts in&#xD;
      Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the intervention is improvement in both immunization coverage rates and&#xD;
      timeliness among the study participants through introducing simple silicon bracelets as&#xD;
      childhood vaccination reminders and trackers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individually randomized, three-arm parallel group design randomized control trial will be&#xD;
      conducted with equal allocation to evaluate the impact of the Alma Sana bracelet and simple&#xD;
      silicon bracelet by comparing the variables of interest (coverage and timeliness rates of&#xD;
      (pentavalent-3/PCV-3/polio-3 and Measles 1) between treatment groups and the Control Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A consent form will be used to seek consent from caregivers accompanying the child to screen&#xD;
      the child for the study. Among those who provide consent, a screening form will be used to&#xD;
      identify the eligible participants. After screening, seeking consent from primary caregivers&#xD;
      (mother and/or father) they will be randomized into the treatment groups (to receive the&#xD;
      bracelet) or to serve as a control. The randomization sequence will be created using Stata&#xD;
      version 13 with a 1:1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 3, 6, 9 and 12. The allocation&#xD;
      sequence will be concealed from the study staff responsible for screening and enrolling&#xD;
      participants in serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. After randomization, each child&#xD;
      will be assigned a unique study ID (a sticker containing the study ID will be pasted on the&#xD;
      child's government issued EPI card).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the procedures in the intervention and control groups are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group A and B: Children in both the intervention groups (A and B) will receive&#xD;
      the two different bracelets to be placed on the child's wrist. Additionally, mothers will be&#xD;
      provided instructions explaining the use of the bracelet and helping them decode the symbols&#xD;
      to enable them to use the bracelet to remind themselves of their child's vaccinations.&#xD;
      Children will receive the scheduled EPI vaccine by the vaccinator who will then punch a hole&#xD;
      in the child's bracelet to denote vaccine administration. The child's vaccine data will be&#xD;
      recorded in the EPI card and EPI register as per routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants (irrespective of whether they are in the treatment group A or B or control&#xD;
      group) will receive the routine EPI vaccinations as per Pakistan's EPI Immunization schedule&#xD;
      (one dose of BCG and polio soon after birth, 3 doses of Pentavalent/Polio/PCV at 6, 10 and 14&#xD;
      weeks, and 2 doses of Measles vaccine and 9 and 15 months of age) and the vaccinator will&#xD;
      record the child's immunization data in the EPI immunization card as well as EPI register.&#xD;
      The difference between the intervention and standard care is only the provision of bracelets&#xD;
      which provide an additional source (apart from the EPI cards) to record and track&#xD;
      vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Children in the control group will receive the scheduled EPI vaccine from the&#xD;
      vaccinator. The child's vaccine data will be recorded in the EPI card and register as per&#xD;
      routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be done using the following documents over 5 total visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrollment Form: At the child's first visit to the center, the field worker will note&#xD;
           the name and age of the child along with the immunizations received during the visit in&#xD;
           addition to basic demographic information in the enrolment form. This information, along&#xD;
           with basic biographic information is recorded routinely by vaccinators in their&#xD;
           government issued permanent medical registers. An immunization visit typically takes&#xD;
           between 10 and 15 minutes, not including any time spent waiting to be seen by the&#xD;
           vaccinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up Form: For the follow up visits by the caregivers to get the subsequent&#xD;
           vaccinations (3 - 4 visits), field workers will be based at the participating EPI&#xD;
           centers throughout the follow-up period. Each follow-up visit takes about 10-15 minutes&#xD;
           of the caregivers time, not including any time spent waiting to be seen by the&#xD;
           vaccinator. Each child in the study is provided a unique EPI number by the EPI staff as&#xD;
           per routine and also a study ID by a field worker. The linkage between the EPI number&#xD;
           and the ID number will be maintained after data collection is complete. The field&#xD;
           workers will use these IDs to identify the study participants when they come for&#xD;
           follow-up visits. At each follow up visit, the field worker will record the vaccine&#xD;
           administered and date for each child in the study, including verifying data on past&#xD;
           immunizations and due vaccines (follow-up form attached). Therefore, for each study&#xD;
           participant, the field workers would collect data 3-4 times during the follow-up period.&#xD;
           The minimum duration of follow up provided to each participant will be until the child&#xD;
           receives Measles-1 vaccine (given at 9 months of age per WHO recommendations). The&#xD;
           maximum duration of follow up provided to each participant will be 11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Completion Form: After the completion of follow-up period, short (15-20 minutes) phone&#xD;
           or in-person interviews will be conducted to collect follow up vaccination data (if&#xD;
           missing) and data on experiences of study participants regarding the bracelets&#xD;
           (completion form attached). Phone numbers and addresses are provided as part of the&#xD;
           Enrollment form. It is culturally acceptable for in person interviews to be conducted in&#xD;
           their home. Key data points would include reasons for drop-outs, whether mothers&#xD;
           understood how to use the bracelets, how often mothers said their babies wore the&#xD;
           bracelets and why, what mothers liked and disliked about the bracelets and whether&#xD;
           mothers would continue using the bracelets as reminders moving forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat analysis will be used-that is, all subjects will be analysed with the&#xD;
      assumption that they remained in the treatment group to which they were initially assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y=c+β1T1+β2T2+γX+ε&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y is the relevant outcome measure (for instance Penta-3 coverage) C is the constant that&#xD;
      gives the value of the outcome for the control group T1 and T2 are treatment dummy variables&#xD;
      for group 1 (Alma Sana bracelets) and group 2 (Simple silicon bracelets) β1 and β2 will&#xD;
      provide the difference in outcome variable between treatment one and the control group and&#xD;
      treatment 2 and the control group respectively X is the set of possible covariates (gender,&#xD;
      mother's education)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression will be used to determine whether the difference in outcome between the&#xD;
      two treatment groups and control group are statistically significant and whether the&#xD;
      difference in outcome between the two treatment groups is statistically significant from each&#xD;
      other.&#xD;
