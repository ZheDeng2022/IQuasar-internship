  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A distal radius fracture is a break at the wrist end of the long bone on the outside of the&#xD;
      forearm. It is common, and can cause problems with stiffness, pain and use of the hand and&#xD;
      arm for several months. This study is investigating whether imagined movements whilst in the&#xD;
      plaster improve dexterity, reduce pain or improve movement when the plaster is removed. As&#xD;
      this is a pilot study the aim is to test research and assessment procedure to guide further&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imagined movements involve imagining the wrist moving, without actually moving the wrist. It&#xD;
      has been suggested that immobilisation, for example in plaster, can affect the part of the&#xD;
      brain responsible for movement and sensation. It has also been suggested that imagined&#xD;
      movement can reduce this impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is investigating subjects over the age of 50 with relatively low impact trauma.&#xD;
      Younger subjects and higher velocity injuries will be excluded as this introduces an unwanted&#xD;
      variable. Likewise, any fractures requiring surgery, or subjects with pre-existing upper limb&#xD;
      injury or deformity will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate following their attendance at the local Accident and&#xD;
      Emergency department in Newport, South Wales, or the minor injuries department at Ysbyty&#xD;
      Ystrad Fawr Hospital, Ystrad Mynach. Sampling will run for approximately 2 months and all&#xD;
      participants will be given standard exercises. All participants will attend an appointment at&#xD;
      approximately 1 week and be randomised into treatment or control group. The treatment group&#xD;
      will be taught imagined movements and be asked to perform these for 10 minutes, four times a&#xD;
      day, the control group will continue with standard exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will attend again for assessment of dexterity, pain and movement after the&#xD;
      plaster has been removed, (4-8 weeks dependent on team). This concludes the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At initial attendance in Accident and Emergency, subjects that meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be offered an information sheet, and will be asked whether they want to be included in&#xD;
      the trial. If they agree, a consent form regarding being contacted about the study and an&#xD;
      assessment form will be completed by the advanced nurse practitioner. The forms will be given&#xD;
      to the primary researcher and filed securely to comply with The Data Protection Act. All&#xD;
      patients, including those who do not wish to participate or don't meet the criteria will be&#xD;
      given the standard advice and exercise booklet. This is usual for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead researcher will contact each subject within 3 days to discuss the study, and arrange&#xD;
      an appointment at 7-10 days to begin the study. This is necessary ethically in order to&#xD;
      provide a 'cooling-off' period for the subjects to consider whether they wish to participate.&#xD;
      It will also give time for radiology reports to be completed and any subjects with discounted&#xD;
      radius fracture can be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects attending the initial appointment at 7-10 days in the outpatient&#xD;
      physiotherapy department will be offered the full consent form. Those that do not attend or&#xD;
      do not consent will be referred back to Accident and Emergency and return to usual care.&#xD;
      Those that consent will be randomised into control or intervention group using a computerised&#xD;
      random number generator. The control group will continue with maintenance exercises. Having a&#xD;
      control group means that the intervention (imagined movements) can be isolated and tested&#xD;
      with greater confidence. This helps to improve the quality of the study and this benefit to&#xD;
      the study is believed to outweigh the small risk that having a control group would raise. By&#xD;
      having the control group follow usual care as closely as possible further minimises ethical&#xD;
      issues and potential risks. All efforts have been made to ensure this but it is recognised&#xD;
      that all participants will need to attend two appointments that they would not normally&#xD;
      attend on normal care. These are necessary to provide a cooling off period and collect data&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will have the same exercises as the control group plus imagined wrist&#xD;
      exercises. The exercises will be taught to the subject by reading through the booklet with&#xD;
      them, this ensures the advice is standardised. As the intervention is targeting part of the&#xD;
      brain involved in the control of movement, high frequency is considered important. The&#xD;
      imagined movement programme, is amalgamated from two previous studies and will consist of&#xD;
      imagined wrist movement in all planes. The frequency of 15 minutes every waking hour from one&#xD;
      study is deemed impractical and another study suggests that 15 minutes of mental practice a&#xD;
      day preserved range of motion. Therefore approximately 10-15 minutes, four times a day has&#xD;
      been selected as a practical compromise and mirrors routine advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An appointment will be arranged as soon as is practically possible, aiming for the same day&#xD;
      or day after removal of plaster at approximately 4-8 weeks, (varies between teams). This is&#xD;
      to reduce the chance of movement out of plaster affecting the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 4-8 week appointment the primary outcome measures of dexterity using the Purdue&#xD;
      peg-board, and secondary outcome measures of pain and active wrist range of motion will be&#xD;
      measured and recorded in the outpatient physiotherapy department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomised into control or intervention group which will reduce&#xD;
      selection bias. Only standardised objective outcome measures are being used which reduces the&#xD;
      chances of the researcher influencing responses. As this is a small, educational study there&#xD;
      is no funding and therefore the researcher will be randomising the participants, providing&#xD;
      the exercises, and assessing the outcome measures. It is recognised that this is a potential&#xD;
      source of bias as the researcher is not blind to group allocation, however, as this is a&#xD;
      pilot study this is felt to be an acceptable weakness and will be recognised in write up. It&#xD;
      is also a valuable educational experience for the student researcher to be involved in each&#xD;
      part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broadly the timetable will be two months of recruitment followed by data collection which&#xD;
      will continue for up to eight weeks after recruitment has terminated. Data analysis and&#xD;
      interpretation will commence whilst collection is ongoing and continue for approximately two&#xD;
      to four weeks. The final reporting and write up will follow this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling is planned to run for 2 months and all potential subjects meeting the criteria will&#xD;
      be given the opportunity to participate. Metrics from the local departments, (after allowing&#xD;
      for subjects not consenting or meeting the criteria), suggest this could produce a sample&#xD;
      size of around 40. This is difficult to predict but one of the aims of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      test these procedures. Recruitment will be initially undertaken by advanced nurse&#xD;
      practitioners in Accident and Emergency.&#xD;
