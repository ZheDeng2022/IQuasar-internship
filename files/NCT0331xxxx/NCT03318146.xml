  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the most frequent cause of irreversible &amp; preventable blindness worldwide,&#xD;
      affecting about 2% of the world's population in people over 40. The major risk factor, and&#xD;
      only treatable factor in glaucoma, is increased intraocular pressure (IOP). IOP reduction can&#xD;
      slow or arrest the progression of vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment consists of drops administered on a daily basis with unfortunately low&#xD;
      patient compliance, increasing the chance of blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eximore's product aims to eliminate the need to apply eye drops on a daily basis and thus&#xD;
      solves the significant problem of patient compliance.&#xD;

      Device Description - A combination of punctual plug (new product) as delivery system for&#xD;
      Latanoprost (already approved drug). The plug has 2 different sizes of &quot;big plug&quot; (450 µg&#xD;
      API) and &quot;small plug&quot; (250 µg API) (Neck diameter of 1.08 mm and 1.06 mm, accordingly) EXP-LP&#xD;
      punctum plug is intended to be used as drug delivery system to improve patient compliance and&#xD;
      outcomes. EXP-LP is a combination therapy non-invasive insert that replaces eye drops and&#xD;
      provides sustained drug therapy for chronic eye problems such as glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xalatan (latanoprost) has been marketed for nearly 15 years, and its performance in reducing&#xD;
      IOP is well established Study Design - This is a prospective, single center, open-label,&#xD;
      controlled (&quot;split body&quot; design) non-randomized study performed in early visual field defects&#xD;
      open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Justification - 40 patients with open angle early visual field defects&#xD;
      glaucoma (treated with eye drop medications) or ocular hypertension will be enrolled to the&#xD;
      study. Due to early feasibility stage of the study, no formal sample size calculation was&#xD;
      done for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent to treat (ITT) population, defined as enrolled participants including those who&#xD;
      leave the study prematurely during the screening period (before EXP-LP insertion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of Participant Withdrawals - Participants who leave the study prematurely during the&#xD;
      screening period (before EXP-LP insertion) will not be replaced and will not be accounted for&#xD;
      in the ITT study population. The discontinuing patient will be followed for safety by a phone&#xD;
      call, one month after exiting the study. Each case of premature withdrawal will be properly&#xD;
      recorded in the Screening Failure Log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Screening - Prior to any study-related procedure, delegated study team members will&#xD;
      approach potentially eligible adult subjects diagnosed with early visual field defects open&#xD;
      angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Those who may be eligible will be offered the choice&#xD;
      of undergoing screening to be enrolled in the study or receiving standard public treatment&#xD;
      for their current illness without participating in the study. Subjects who do not meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria or who are for any other reason determined to be too ill for inclusion in&#xD;
      the study, or who decline to participate in the study, will be considered and recorded as&#xD;
      &quot;screen failure&quot; and receive standard and appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: The informed consent document will be signed and dated for screening and&#xD;
      enrollment and each patient consenting will be documented in the patient medical binder. The&#xD;
      patient will be given a copy of the consent form together with the study doctor's letter at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment. The clinician will ask the patient about his plans and his&#xD;
      willingness to attend all scheduled follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient is considered as a Block unit and each of his eyes is considered the&#xD;
      investigational unit. Patients will be identified by a serial number and will be numbered&#xD;
      according to their serial recruitment (2 digits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL PROCEDURES: All study visits will be performed at morning time (8 a.m. to 10 a.m.) in&#xD;
      order to unify measurements and reduce intra-patient variations (across measurements). After&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, a case record form (CRF) including all aspects listed below&#xD;
      will be recorded. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be monitored&#xD;
      according to ophthalmic standard examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening and pre-insertion washout, as part of pre-operative visit (2-4 weeks&#xD;
      before grafting procedure - visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following signing of informed consent, potential patients that their treated IOP is lower&#xD;
      than 26 mmHg on at least 2 consecutive examinations will be screened for study enrolment by&#xD;
      assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The following assessments will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting IOP (see details below) Eligible patients will be required to stop taking&#xD;
           (wash-out) their glaucoma eye-drops medications in both eyes until their IOP level is&#xD;
           increased by at least 3 mmHg from start of washout in both eyes Visit 2: Screening &amp;&#xD;
           EXP-LP plug insertion in one eye and Xalatan © eye-drops in the second eye, (2 weeks or&#xD;
           4 weeks after beginning washout, visit 2a or 2b accordingly) The below mentioned 3 mmHg&#xD;
           increase (inclusion criteria #4) is examined at visit 2a (two weeks after first&#xD;
           screening visit) for safety reasons, to ensure the patient &quot;untreated IOP&quot; will be&#xD;
           monitored (&lt;31 mmHg for glaucoma patients or &lt; 33 mmHg for ocular hypertension&#xD;
           patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case their IOP level is yet to be influenced by the washout (less than 3 mmHG increase),&#xD;
      an additional visit (2b, 4 weeks after first screening visit) will be scheduled and performed&#xD;
      with the patient. In case the patient IOP was increased by less than 3 mmHG in visit 2b, or&#xD;
      either the patient IOP is &gt;30 mmHg for glaucoma patients or &gt;32 mmHg for ocular hypertension&#xD;
      patients (exit criteria) that patient will discontinue the study and will be recorded as&#xD;
      screening failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once inclusion criteria #4 is verified (either 2a or 2b) study eligibility will be confirmed&#xD;
      and the following assessments will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medications. EXP-LP insertion - As detailed in the Investigator Brochure there&#xD;
           will be 2 sizes of the EXP-LP medicated punctual plug: &quot;big&quot; and &quot;small&quot;, stored and&#xD;
           packed separately. The most suitable size will be pre-defined by the investigator&#xD;
           performing the procedure and will be documented in the CRF. The patient will be offered&#xD;
           to choose which of his eyes should have the PLUG inserted - limiting investigator bias.&#xD;
           The selected eye will be documented in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to plug insertion prophylactic topical antibiotic (one eye-drop) will be given to the&#xD;
      selected eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plug will be inserted to the lower lacrimal punctum (tear duct) using routine curved eye&#xD;
      forceps and under topical anesthesia with drops and using the physician biomicroscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xalatan © administration - the second eye will receive mono-treatment of Xalatan © (Pfizer,&#xD;
      latanoprost mono-treatment eye drops) as an internal control. According to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions for use - the recommended dosage is one drop once daily. Study administration&#xD;
      will be in the evening time. Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after&#xD;
      administration and the maximum effect is reached after 8 to 12 hours. Xalatan will be&#xD;
      administered by the patient until end of the study, and mis-compliance will be documented in&#xD;
      the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study Patient Discharge form - Study qualified personnel will instruct the patient before&#xD;
      discharge with specific home instructions and emergency contact numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term follow up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3-8: clinical and biomicroscope examinations (see appropriate time windows below)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed during each visit at the hospital clinic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sitting IOP The patient will be asked to report any ophthalmic complication: for&#xD;
           example: Intraocular inflammation, ocular redness, eyelid edema and hyperaemia&#xD;
           conjunctival erythema (see anticipated complications list above) - all will be&#xD;
           investigated by the sub-investigator using Visit safety Follow-Up Form. In addition, the&#xD;
           patient will be questioned regarding his general morbidity, any other Adverse Events and&#xD;
           concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plug tolerability follow-up - During each visit, placement of plug will be verified. If the&#xD;
      plug is not visualized or if the subject is inconvenienced by the inserted plug, the&#xD;
      investigator can choose to insert another plug with a different size up to a maximum of 3&#xD;
      replacements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The plug should not be reinserted in case a moderate to serious AE is observed, e.g.&#xD;
           rejection or immune reaction, moderate to severe conjunctival hyperemia, moderate to&#xD;
           severe Intraocular inflammation, corneal Keratitis (see Table 5, State of the Art Safety&#xD;
           Risks, Latanoprost for Glaucoma, Literature Based; Causes, Mitigation &amp; Relation to&#xD;
           EXP-LP plug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any of the following AEs: initial irritation, local discomfort, increased lacrimation,&#xD;
           dry eye, mild conjunctival hyperemia, mild Intraocular inflammation or blepharitis may&#xD;
           be resolved within a week - treatment with lubricating drops or topical antibiotics&#xD;
           maybe consider according to the physician judgment. In case of persistent occurrence the&#xD;
           plug will be replaced with a smaller type if applicable Each replacement will be&#xD;
           reported in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 8: Investigational EXP-LP plug removal (termination): (3 months (+\- 7 days) from plug&#xD;
      insertion) In addition to the above mentioned study evaluations, EXP-LP plug will be removed&#xD;
      by study qualified investigator under prior topical prophylactic antibiotic (one eye-drop)&#xD;
      topical anaesthesia drops, using a biomicroscope and routine curved eye forceps. Intactness&#xD;
      of the plug will be examined and recorded in the CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Study Termination form - Study qualified personnel will instruct the patient before&#xD;
      discharge with specific medication instructions and prescriptions for both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Un-scheduled visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigator will instruct the patient to immediately contact the study team in&#xD;
      case of: plug loss, intraocular inflammation, eyelid edema and keratitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must call the study nurse to schedule an un-scheduled visit which may only be&#xD;
      performed by one of the study investigators, and will be reported to the principal&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unscheduled visits the patient will be clinically managed by the study team with&#xD;
      additional full eyes examination to be done at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring and Quality Control - The investigator, through an appointed Clinical&#xD;
      Research Associate (CRA), will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality&#xD;
      assurance and quality control systems with written Standard Of Procedures to ensure that&#xD;
      trials are conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in&#xD;
      compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s), including&#xD;
      ISO 14155:2011.The investigator will be responsible for ensuring direct access to all trial&#xD;
      related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing&#xD;
      by the hospital, and inspection by Israeli regulatory authorities. Quality control should be&#xD;
      applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been&#xD;
      processed correctly. The study CRA will verify that (a) The rights and well-being of human&#xD;
      patients are protected, (b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable&#xD;
      from source documents and (c) The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently&#xD;
      approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with the applicable regulatory requirement(s)&#xD;
      (including ISO 14155:2001). The monitor will submit a written report after each trial-site&#xD;
      visit or trial related communication. A report should include the date, site, name of the&#xD;
      monitor, and name of the investigator or other individual(s) contacted. A report should&#xD;
      include a summary of what the monitor reviewed and the monitor's statements concerning the&#xD;
      significant findings/facts, deviations and deficiencies, conclusions, actions taken or to be&#xD;
      taken and/or actions recommended to secure compliance. To ensure compliance of this&#xD;
      investigator initiated trial with current national regulations and the ICH guidelines, data&#xD;
      generated by this study will be available for inspection upon request by representatives of&#xD;
      the local health authorities- IRB or the national authorities - MOH, or any entity providing&#xD;
      support for this trial. The general scope of such visits would be to inspect study data&#xD;
      (regulatory requirements), source documentation and CRF completion in accordance with current&#xD;
      GCP, the ICH guidelines and the respective local and national government regulations and&#xD;
