  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fenestrated endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is a procedure to treat&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysms which are not amenable to conventional repair or stenting. A stent&#xD;
      is placed in the aorta and confines blood flow to a normal diameter lumen to remove pressure&#xD;
      on the diseased aortic wall. Fenestrations (custom holes in the graft) are necessary to&#xD;
      maintain blood flow to abdominal organs when the aneurysm sac extends to far proximally.&#xD;
      These fenestrations are then typically aligned with their respective vessels using covered&#xD;
      stents. These stents also help keep the arteries open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately some of the stents currently used occlude either immediately or over time,&#xD;
      which can lead to organ failure, morbidity and death. A recent advancement in stent design&#xD;
      has heparin bonded to the stent surface which prevents clot from forming. This new design has&#xD;
      been shown to help maintain stent patency in other parts of the body. The investigators&#xD;
      believe it may do the same for FEVAR patients. The proposed study is a 20-patient pilot to&#xD;
      assess the safety of substituting a heparin bonded stent graft for FEVAR branches over a&#xD;
      period of one year. Patients who are deemed eligible for FEVAR by a UHN multidisciplinary&#xD;
      vascular conference will be recruited to the study. All the branches in their FEVAR will use&#xD;
      the Viabahn BX stent in place of the current standard of care stent. They will then be&#xD;
      followed per the standard of care for one year. Adverse events will be recorded and the rate&#xD;
      of occlusion will be assessed based on CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that using heparin bonded stent grafts is safe and they will&#xD;
      have a low rate of occlusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FEVAR branches can occlude jeopardizing perfusion of the organs they supply. A recent study&#xD;
      has shown the rate of patency as 95.7% at 1 year and 88.6% at 4 years. Pooled analysis has&#xD;
      shown a 4.5% rate of renal artery occlusion during 12 month follow up with 2.3% going on to&#xD;
      dialysis and 1.4% requiring permanent dialysis. 1.8% of patients can go on to have mesenteric&#xD;
      stenosis though these have been due to technical issues with the stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have previously shown that the patency of vascular grafts can be improved by bonding&#xD;
      heparin bonding to the surface of a graft material. For example in surgical bypass a Dacron&#xD;
      graft bonded with heparin outperformed a conventional PTFE graft in terms of patency and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Endovascular stent grafting with heparin bonded PTFE has also been shown&#xD;
      to be superior to PTFE alone with a primary patency of 86.4% vs 79.9% in femoropopliteal&#xD;
      disease. A recent trial has demonstrated impressive patency of 73% in long segment&#xD;
      femoropopliteal disease (TASC C and D lesions) using a self expanding version of the heparin&#xD;
      bonded, covered, Viabahn stent graft. Heparin bonded stent grafts have shown promise in&#xD;
      preserving patency of other vessels. A pilot study demonstrating the safety of using the&#xD;
      Viabahn Bx in FEVAR will support the rationale for larger studies of this question including&#xD;
      randomization between conventional and heparin bonded stent grafts.&#xD;
