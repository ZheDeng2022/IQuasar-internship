    <textblock>
      Accumulation of intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) due to increased supply of fatty acids can&#xD;
      induce defects in the insulin signaling cascade, causing skeletal muscle insulin resistance.&#xD;
      However, the causes for muscle insulin resistance are not well understood. The association of&#xD;
      elevated IMCLs and insulin resistance has been shown in obese humans and individuals with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes as well as several animal models of insulin resistance. Despite the strong&#xD;
      relationship between IMCLs and insulin resistance, this suggested relationship disappears&#xD;
      when well-trained endurance athletes are included into this consideration as this group is&#xD;
      highly insulin sensitive. This metabolic enigma has been termed the 'athlete's paradox'. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is to resolve the mechanisms contributing to the athlete's paradox.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by an increasing insensitivity of muscle, fat and&#xD;
      liver cells to the hormone insulin. About 9% of the global population is affected by this&#xD;
      condition and mortality risk is twice as high in individuals with diabetes compared to&#xD;
      similar-aged people without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle is of particular importance for glucose homeostasis, since in healthy subjects it&#xD;
      accounts for 80-90% of postprandial insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. After cellular&#xD;
      uptake of glucose by the specialized glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), glucose is phosphorylated&#xD;
      and stored as glycogen. In individuals with obesity or T2D, the capacity for insulin to&#xD;
      facilitate glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is impaired. This reduced response of a&#xD;
      given insulin concentration to exert its biological effect is termed insulin resistance.&#xD;
      Subsequent diminished insulin secretion due to β-cell failure results in fasting&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and overt diabetes. Importantly, muscle insulin resistance is the initial&#xD;
      defect occurring in the development of T2D and precedes the clinical development of the&#xD;
      disease by up to 20 years. Intracellular defects in glucose transport have been identified as&#xD;
      the limiting step for insulin-mediated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. Impaired muscle&#xD;
      glucose transport activity is likely a consequence of ectopic lipid accumulation and&#xD;
      subsequent dysregulation of intramyocellular fatty acid metabolism. Indeed, results from&#xD;
      normal weight, nondiabetic adults suggest that intramyocellular triglyceride content is a&#xD;
      strong predictor for muscle insulin resistance. Of note, the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance occurred without changes in intramyocellular triglyceride content, thus&#xD;
      dissociating the amount of these neutral storage lipids from insulin resistance. Instead, the&#xD;
      bioactive lipid species diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramides have been implicated in&#xD;
      interfering with insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis in obese and insulin resistant&#xD;
      individuals and individuals with T2D by activating members of the protein kinase C (PKC)&#xD;
      family while ceramides mediate an increase in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and an&#xD;
      association of PKCζ and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt2. To add another layer of complexity, DAGs&#xD;
      seem to exert their detrimental intracellular effects in a subspecies- (mostly C18:0, C18:1,&#xD;
      or C18:2 DAGs) and stereo-selective manner (sn-1,2 stereoisomer DAG). Taken together,&#xD;
      excessive amounts of bioactive intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) contribute to defective&#xD;
      insulin signaling in obese individuals and patients with T2D. Surprisingly, endurance&#xD;
      athletes have comparable amounts of IMCLs, but remain highly insulin sensitive. This&#xD;
      metabolic conundrum has been termed &quot;athlete's paradox&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims at resolving this conundrum with mass-spectrometry based&#xD;
      state-of-the-art methodology by analysing lipid subspecies in endurance-trained athletes,&#xD;
      untrained healthy individuals and insulin-resistant individuals.&#xD;
