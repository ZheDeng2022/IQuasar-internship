  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a visual remediation&#xD;
      intervention for people with schizophrenia. The intervention targets two visual functions&#xD;
      that much research has shown are impaired in many people with the disorder, namely contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity and perceptual organization. The first phase of the study will test the effects&#xD;
      of interventions targeting each of these processes, as well as the effects of a combined&#xD;
      package. A control condition of higher-level cognitive remediation is included as a fourth&#xD;
      condition. The second phase of the study will evaluate the effectiveness of the most&#xD;
      effective intervention from the first phase, but in a new and larger sample of individuals.&#xD;
      Outcome measures include multiple aspects of visual functioning, as well as visual cognition&#xD;
      and overall community functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is increasingly clear that people with schizophrenia have a range of visual perception&#xD;
      impairments, including in low-level vision (e.g., acuity, contrast sensitivity) and mid-level&#xD;
      vision (e.g., perceptual organization, coherent motion detection). These impairments are&#xD;
      significantly related to poorer performance on cognitive (e.g., visual learning and memory)&#xD;
      and social cognitive (e.g., facial emotion decoding) measures, and to worse functional&#xD;
      outcomes. To date, there is no accepted technique for visual remediation for schizophrenia,&#xD;
      and almost no work has been done in this area. However, visual remediation is a&#xD;
      well-developed subfield within cognitive rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      patients, and initial studies of short-term visual perceptual learning in schizophrenia&#xD;
      indicate that plasticity exists that could support longer-term changes. Therefore, the&#xD;
      overall goal of the proposed project is to test a visual remediation intervention for&#xD;
      schizophrenia and determine its effects on specific visual targets with well-understood&#xD;
      neurobiological mechanisms. The goal of the R61 is to determine the optimal intervention for&#xD;
      improving the targets of contrast sensitivity (CS) and perceptual organization (PO).&#xD;
      Extensive evidence exists for impaired CS and PO in schizophrenia. Moreover, these targets&#xD;
      are prototypical examples of gain control and integration, respectively, which were&#xD;
      identified by the NIMH-sponsored CNTRICS initiative as being the two core mechanisms involved&#xD;
      in visual disturbances in the disorder. The investigators will examine two computer-based&#xD;
      interventions. One, ULTIMEYES (UE), targets CS. The other, contour integration training&#xD;
      (CIT), targets PO. The investigators will also examine the effects of combined treatment&#xD;
      (UE&amp;CIT). An active computer-based control treatment will be included. There will be 40&#xD;
      sessions, with assessments after every 10 sessions (N=20/group). The R61 Specific Aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of UE and CIT on CS and PO targets, respectively, to determine if&#xD;
      treatment effects meet a pre-specified effect-size criterion. Results of the R61 will be used&#xD;
      to identify the treatment (UE, CIT, or UE&amp;CIT) and duration (i.e., dose) that most&#xD;
      effectively and efficiently improves the target(s). The goal of the R33 is to conduct an&#xD;
      initial randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the optimal treatment identified in the R61. The&#xD;
      R33 Specific Aims are to: 1) replicate and extend R61 results supporting visual target&#xD;
      engagement in an adequately powered RCT (N=50/group); and 2) determine if visual target&#xD;
      engagement is associated with improvements in cognition, social cognition, and functional&#xD;
      capacity. If the R33 hypotheses are confirmed, results will inform the design of a later RCT&#xD;
      to further explore mediators and moderators of treatment effects, and to move towards a&#xD;
      precision medicine approach, wherein we determine which individuals are most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from this intervention.&#xD;
