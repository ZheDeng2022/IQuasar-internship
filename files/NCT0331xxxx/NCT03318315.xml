    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, un-blinded, Phase II study in males and non-pregnant females, who are&#xD;
      in good health, 19 to 64 years of age. This study is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic AS03 (GSK) adjuvanted 2017 monovalent&#xD;
      inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine, when two doses are administered 21 days apart either&#xD;
      sequentially or simultaneously (within 15 minutes) with licensed seasonal influenza vaccine.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups. The study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 150 individuals who have no history of influenza A/H7N9 infection or prior&#xD;
      receipt of an influenza virus H7 subtype vaccine. Study duration is approximately 16 months&#xD;
      with subject participation duration of approximately 13 months. The primary objectives of&#xD;
      this study are: 1) to assess the safety and reactogenicity following sequential or&#xD;
      simultaneous IM administration of 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and one dose of&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4); 2) to assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses&#xD;
      against A/H7N9 at approximately 21 days following receipt of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted&#xD;
      2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM approximately 21 days apart; 3) to assess the serum HAI and&#xD;
      Neut antibody responses against the seasonal influenza strains at approximately 21 days&#xD;
      following receipt of IIV4.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, un-blinded, Phase II study in males and non-pregnant females, who are&#xD;
      in good health, 19 to 64 years of age. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic AS03 (GSK) adjuvanted 2017 monovalent&#xD;
      inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (2017 H7N9 IIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (3.75 mcg&#xD;
      of HA per dose with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) diluent), when two doses are administered&#xD;
      21 days apart either sequentially or simultaneously (within 15 minutes) with licensed&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccine. Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups.&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV, each dose administered IM&#xD;
      approximately 21 days apart, and one dose of licensed seasonal IIV4 will be administered IM&#xD;
      simultaneously (within 15 minutes) with the first dose of AS03 adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV.&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive one dose of IIV4 approximately 21 days prior to the IM administration of&#xD;
      two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV; each dose of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV will&#xD;
      be given approximately 21 days apart. Group 3 will receive one dose IM of IIV4 as an&#xD;
      un-blinded comparator. The study will enroll approximately 150 individuals who have no&#xD;
      history of influenza A/H7N9 infection or prior receipt of an influenza virus H7 subtype&#xD;
      vaccine. Study duration is approximately 16 months with subject participation duration of&#xD;
      approximately 13 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety&#xD;
      and reactogenicity following sequential or simultaneous IM administration of 2 doses of&#xD;
      AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4); 2) to assess&#xD;
      the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses against A/H7N9 at approximately 21 days following&#xD;
      receipt of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM approximately 21 days&#xD;
      apart; 3) to assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses against the seasonal influenza&#xD;
      strains at approximately 21 days following receipt of IIV4. The secondary objectives are: 1)&#xD;
      to assess unsolicited non-SAEs following sequential or simultaneous IM administration of&#xD;
      AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4); 2) to assess MAAEs,&#xD;
      including NOCMCs and PIMMCs, following sequential or simultaneous IM administration of&#xD;
      AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and IIV4; 3) to assess the HAI and Neut antibody responses at&#xD;
      21 days following receipt of 1 dose of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment. Non-serious AEs were collected from participants at follow up visits through approximately 21 days after each vaccination. The site investigator determined vaccine related as &quot;a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the AE.&quot; Adverse events were MedDRA coded and are summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC).</description>

             evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined&#xD;
             as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the&#xD;
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.&#xD;
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no&#xD;
             hospitalizations, Emergency Room (ER), or urgent care for condition and no adverse&#xD;
             symptoms that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental&#xD;
             oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or&#xD;
             frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition&#xD;
             in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of&#xD;
             health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons,&#xD;
             as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this&#xD;
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a&#xD;

             risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not&#xD;
             indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes&#xD;
             subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no&#xD;
             deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a&#xD;
             medication change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with&#xD;
             the evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled&#xD;

        <title>Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Serum Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Antibodies Against the 2017 H7N9 Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) Strain After Second H7N9 Vaccination</title>
        <description>Blood was collected for HAI assay at conducted with the 2017 H7N9 vaccine virus as the antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 21 days after the second dose of H7N9, which is Day 43 for Group 1 and Day 64 for Group 2.</description>

          <description>Blood was collected for the serum neutralizing antibody assay conducted with the 2017 H7N9 vaccine virus as the antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 21 days after second dose of H7N9, which is Day 43 for Group 1 and Day 64 for Group 2.</description>
          <population>Participants included in the mITT population are those who received the first study dose have immunogenicity results at baseline and at least one timepoint post baseline. If baseline results are unavailable for an assay at baseline, the participant is not included in mITT analysis at any timepoint for that assay only.</population>

          <description>Blood was collected for the serum neutralizing antibody assay conducted with the 2017 H7N9 vaccine virus as the antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. Seroconversion was defined as neutralizing antibody pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and post-vaccination titer 1:40 or greater, or pre-vaccination titer 1:10 or greater and minimum 4-fold rise in post-vaccination antibody titer. 21 days after second dose of H7N9 is Day 22 for Group 1 and Day 43 for Group 2.</description>

        <description>Blood was collected for serum neutralizing antibody assay at conducted with the H7N9 vaccine virus as the antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm from the available results. 21 days after first dose of H7N9 is Day 22 for Group 1 and Day 43 for Group 2.</description>
