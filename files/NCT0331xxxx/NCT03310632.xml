  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antroquinonol is proposed for the treatment of neoplasms. The proposed clinical trial is a&#xD;
      Phase I/II study designed to evaluate antroquinonol in combination with nab-paclitaxel and&#xD;
      gemcitabine in first line treatment naïve subjects with Stage IV metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      carcinoma. The first part of study will focus on the treatment of pancreatic cancer with 200&#xD;
      mg TID and 300 mg TID, clinical treatment duration of 4 weeks, to determine the MTD or MFD&#xD;
      (based on PK and capsules strength) of antroquinonol in combination with a standard dose&#xD;
      regimen of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. The extended Phase II will focus on the efficacy&#xD;
      of antroquinonol with SOC. Safety and pharmacokinetic profiles will be studied in the&#xD;
      proposed clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Golden Biotech are planning a Phase I/II study to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and to evaluate safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of antroquinonol in combination with nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine in first line&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in DDI and dose escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation part of the study will be conducted to characterize the safety of&#xD;
      antroquinonol in combination with the standard of care (SOC) (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine)&#xD;
      and to identify the MTD of antroquinonol in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The&#xD;
      MTD is the dose level at which &lt;33% (2/6) of patients experience a DLT. Within the dose&#xD;
      escalation part of the study, a total of 6 patients will be enrolled in a run-in DDI portion&#xD;
      to assess the effect of antroquinonol (a cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A4/CYP2C8 inhibitor) on the PK&#xD;
      of paclitaxel (a CYP3A4/CYP2C8 substrate). Patients within this cohort (Cohort 1) will&#xD;
      receive treatment as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 0 (28-day cycle): nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 (as per SOC)&#xD;
           via intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1 (28-day cycle): antroquinonol 200 mg administered TID on Days 1 through 28 and&#xD;
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and&#xD;
           15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intense PK sampling to assess the PK of paclitaxel will be conducted in Cycles 0 and 1. The&#xD;
      primary PK endpoints will include Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUCinf. Available bioanalytical data will&#xD;
      be assessed in an ongoing manner to assess the effect of antroquinonol on the systemic&#xD;
      exposure (Cmax and AUCs) of paclitaxel. Data will be reviewed by the Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (SMC) prior to enrollment of additional patients into the dose-escalation part of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort 1, the occurrence of DLTs will be assessed from Day 1 to Day 28 of Cycle 1. If ≤1&#xD;
      patient experiences a DLT, dosing in the dose escalation part will proceed. If ≥2 patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT, dosing in the dose escalation part of the study will be discontinued. If ≤1&#xD;
      patient in Cohort 1 experiences a DLT then dosing in Cohort 2 of the dose escalation part&#xD;
      will proceed as follows: - All Cycles: antroquinonol 300 mg administered TID on Days 1&#xD;
      through 28 and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15 (ie, 1 cycle = weekly for 3 weeks, then 1 week off) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patients will be enrolled initially into Cohort 2, these patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      DLTs within the first 28-day dosing cycle. This cohort will be expanded to 6 total patients&#xD;
      if 1 DLT is observed in the first 3 patients within Cohort 2. If ≤1 DLT is observed at the&#xD;
      300 mg dose then the 300 mg dose will be considered the MFD. If &gt;1 DLT is observed at the 300&#xD;
      mg group then 200 mg will be considered the MTD and/or the SMC will review the available data&#xD;
      and determine the MTD/recommended dose (RD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled into the dose escalation part of the study (Cohorts 1 and 2) will continue&#xD;
      to receive treatment with antroquinonol (200 or 300 mg, respectively) in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine in 28-day cycles at the discretion of the Investigator without a&#xD;
      maximum duration until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of patients to be entered in the dose escalation part of the study will&#xD;
      depend on the emergence of DLTs at each dose level and the total number of dose levels&#xD;
      investigated. Up to 12 patients are planned to be treated in the dose-escalation part if no&#xD;
      patient needs to be replaced for DLT and safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the cohort expansion part of the study, up to an additional 40 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the MTD or MFD/RD. The dose level in the cohort expansion phase will not exceed&#xD;
      the MTD, or highest safe dose tested in the dose-escalation phase if MTD is not reached.&#xD;
      Patients in the cohort expansion will receive treatment as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - All Cycles: antroquinonol at the MTD or MFD/RD administered TID on Days 1 through 28 and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 via IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 (ie,&#xD;
      1 cycle = weekly for 3 weeks, then 1 week off) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled into the cohort expansion part of the study will continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment with antroquinonol at the MTD or MFD/RD in combination with nab-paclitaxel +&#xD;
      gemcitabine in 28-day cycles at the discretion of the Investigator without a maximum duration&#xD;
      until unacceptable toxicity or PD.&#xD;

Run-in DDI and dose escalation:&#xD;
Six patients will be enrolled in the run-in DDI cohort of the dose-escalation part of the study (ie, Cohort 1) and 3 to 6 patients may be enrolled in Cohort 2. The total number of patients to be entered in the dose-escalation part of this study will depend on the emergence of DLTs at each dose level, but will be up to 12 if no replacement occurs at the 2 predefined dose levels.&#xD;
Phase II&#xD;
Cohort expansion:&#xD;
Up to an additional 40 patients may be enrolled at the MTD or MFD/RD. A power calculation was not employed to determine the sample size of the study, as this is aproof of concept study with a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of antroquinonol in combination with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.</intervention_model_description>
