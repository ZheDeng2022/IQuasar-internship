      This study is aims at determining the inter laboratory variation when using the thrombin&#xD;
      generation assay calibrated automated thrombogram (TGA CAT). It is thus, not a clinical trial&#xD;
      in its usual meaning. However, to achieve relevant test samples one patient will be treated&#xD;
      with two different study drugs as part of the trial and therefore, approval by&#xD;
      Läkemedelsverket is needed. Test plasma samples will be sent out to five participating&#xD;
      centers in the Scandinavian countries (Gothenburg and Stockholm, Sweden, Århus Denmark, Oslo&#xD;
      Norway and Helsinki Finland) and coefficients of variance (CV) and level of agreement will be&#xD;
      analyzed. To obtain representative plasma samples with a wide range of thrombin generation&#xD;
      capacity (TGC), blood samples will be collected from research persons that has given informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. To obtain plasma with low TGC, blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn from patients with severe hemophilia (n=4)(study group 1), to obtain plasma with normal&#xD;
      TGC, blood samples will be drawn from healthy volunteers (n=3)(study group 2) and to obtain&#xD;
      plasma with high TGC, plasma will be collected from healthy volunteers (n=3)(study group 3)&#xD;
      that at previous measurements have been shown to have a TGC&gt;2SD of the median of the control&#xD;
      population. Moreover, one patient with severe hemophilia A (HA) will be treated with two&#xD;
      factor FVIII concentrates, one with standard half- life (Advate™) and one with a pro-longed&#xD;
      half-life (Adynovate™) at two separate occasions (Treated HA person). By taking repeated&#xD;
      blood samples after administration, samples with a wide range of FVIII levels and TGC:s will&#xD;
      be obtained. Moreover, the effect of using plasmas with low, normal and high TGC for&#xD;
      normalization will be investigated. Plasma samples will be collected as soon as approval from&#xD;
      the Swedish medical agency (SMA) has been obtained, we count on sending them to participating&#xD;
      centers March 2017. All laboratory measurements, data analysis and report writing will be&#xD;
      concluded before December 31 2017.&#xD;

      Main goal The aim is to further improve the inter-laboratory variability for the TGA-CAT&#xD;
      (Thrombin generation assay-calibrated automated thrombogram) method by using an elaborate&#xD;
      standardization protocol and in extension making the use of large prospective multi-center&#xD;
      studies a reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the inter-laboratory variability by evaluating an enhanced standardized&#xD;
           TGA-CAT protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate if the inter-laboratory variability of the TGA-CAT method is effected by&#xD;
           administration of a recombinant FVIII product (Advate) in a person with severe&#xD;
           hemophilia A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate if the inter-laboratory variability of the TGA-CAT method is effected by&#xD;
           administration of a long acting FVIII product (Adynovate) in a person with severe&#xD;
           hemophilia A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate three reference plasma´s ability, through normalization of data, to improve&#xD;
           the lab-to-lab variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction The TGA CAT method has proved its usefulness for multiple purposes including&#xD;
      diagnosis and management of bleeding disorders (1, 2), detecting hyper coagulability (3, 4),&#xD;
      and monitoring and characterization of oral anticoagulant drugs (5, 6). Most of these studies&#xD;
      are single-center studies and large prospective multi-center studies are needed to further&#xD;
      validate the results. These multi-center studies have proved to be hard to produce due to&#xD;
      lack of standardization of the method. In the last couple of years several articles have&#xD;
      addressed the problem with large inter-laboratory variability for the TGA-CAT method by&#xD;
      presenting thoroughly worked-out standardization protocols. Focus has been put both on the&#xD;
      method itself and its pre-analytical factors as well as the usage of reference plasmas (RP)&#xD;
      for normalization of results. One article showed that the choice of RP for the normalization&#xD;
      of results could greatly reduce the inter-lab variability and that certain RP have a better&#xD;
      ability to do so (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately a number of recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) and IX (rFIX) drugs with prolonged&#xD;
      half-life have been developed and are about to or even have reached the market. The length of&#xD;
      the pro-longed activity of the drug differs between patients and a need for individual&#xD;
      tailoring of the patient´s drug administration is obvious. Thrombin generation could prove to&#xD;
      be an excellent tool in tailoring the optimal drug administration and monitoring the effect&#xD;
      of the drug for each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials Thrombin generation Thrombin generation will be measured according to&#xD;
      the method described by Hemker et al.(8): calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT,&#xD;
      Thrombinoscope BV, Maastricht, the Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reagents PPP-reagent LOW (1 pM), PPP-reagent (5 pM), Thrombin Calibrator and FluCa-kit&#xD;
      (TS31.00, TS30.00, TS20.00 and TS50.00, Thrombinoscope BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands) will&#xD;
      be used in the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples Three different plasmas will be tested, normal plasma, hypo- and hypercoagulable&#xD;
      plasma. Normal and hypercoagulable plasma will be pooled from 3 donors and hypocoagulable&#xD;
      plasma will be collected from 4 donors. Hypocoagulable plasma will be collected from five&#xD;
      haemophilia A (HA) patients regularly treated at the Malmö Coagulation Unit by taking 10 4.5&#xD;
      mL tubes of citrated blood at one occasion. Normal plasma will be collected from 3 co-workers&#xD;
      at the same unit, each person donating 13 tubes of 4.5 mL citrated blood. Hypercoaguable&#xD;
      plasma will be prepared from 3 healthy volunteers, shown to have TGA CAT parameter values &gt;2&#xD;
      SD of median by taking 13 tubes of 4.5 mL citrated blood. Plasma from one patient with severe&#xD;
      HA patient that have been given FVIII-concentrates, Advate™ respectively the long-acting&#xD;
      Adynovate™ at two separate occasions will also be tested. After informed consent the patient&#xD;
      will be asked not to take his regular profylaxis dose for 72 hours. The patient will be given&#xD;
      Advate™ and Adynovate™ respectively at 30 U/kg. The monitoring samples will be taken 1h, 8h,&#xD;
      24h, 36h and 48h (Advate™) and 1h, 24h, 36h, 48h and 72h (Adynovate™) after injection. At&#xD;
      each time point 3 tubes of 4.5 mL blood will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference plasmas Siemens Control Plasma P diluted 1:5 will be used as hypocoaguable RP,&#xD;
      HemosIL calibration plasma (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, Ma, USA) will be used as&#xD;
      Standard RP and as hypercoagable plasma PS-DP (protein S-deficiency plasma)(Enzyme research&#xD;
      laboratories, South Bend, In, USA) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Raw data will be collected and analyzed at the Coagulation Unit, Skåne&#xD;
      University Hospital, Malmö. Each participating center will be matched with Malmö Coagulation&#xD;
      unit in a test of agreement where Bland-Altman bias plot will be used. The mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV%) will be calculated for each center with and&#xD;
      without normalization and displayed in a table. The Advate/ Adynovate elimination profiles&#xD;
      will be plotted and multivariate repeated measurements analyses of variance including a&#xD;
      general test for parallel curves, will be applied to evaluate differences between Centers in&#xD;
      the elimination profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study aims to evaluate the inter-laboratory variability of TGA-CAT performed&#xD;
      TGT with a highly standardized protocol, how the use of RFs for normalization of data impact&#xD;
      on variability of results and to evaluate the usefulness of TGA-CAT in monitoring prolonged&#xD;
      FVIII drug administration. All Fluorometers of the participating center´s should be serviced&#xD;
      and have temperature calibrated to 37 C prior start of the study. The latest software version&#xD;
      must be installed (Thromboscope BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands, version V5.0.0.742). All&#xD;
      laboratory equipment, pipettes, water baths, water purifiers, etc., needs to be calibrated.&#xD;
      All plasmas, TGA-CAT reagents needed for the study will be administered and distributed to&#xD;
      all participating centers by the Coagulation Unit, Malmö. An USB-memory stick containing a&#xD;
      plate set-up scheme file and a video file covering critical pre-analytical and analytical&#xD;
      steps will also be provided alongside the samples and reagents. Three pooled plasmas (normal,&#xD;
      hypo- and hypercoaguable), three RF, five Adynovate and five Advate monitoring samples will&#xD;
      be run five times on five different days by each participating center, following a scheme&#xD;
      provided in the USB-memory stick, with two different triggers, PPP-reagent LOW (1 pM) and&#xD;
      PPP-reagent (5 pM). Two test runs are scheduled each day to maximize RF and reagent usage.&#xD;
      The reason for testing three different types of RF is the fact an earlier study results&#xD;
      implied a better reduction of variability when using, for an example a hypocoaguable RF to&#xD;
      hypocoaguable plasmas (9).&#xD;
