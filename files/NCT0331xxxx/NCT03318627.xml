      Relevant problems of rotator cuff repair:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High retear rate after rotator cuff repair of 13%, despite regard of the criteria for&#xD;
           &quot;reparability&quot; of a tear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long and exhausting rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair with an abduction splint&#xD;
           for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that high tension repair has a higher retear rate than low tension&#xD;
      repair, regardless of the tear size. The investigators also believe that abduction of the arm&#xD;
      can reduce relevant tension on the repair. But not each repair benefits equally from this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of this hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ingenious advantage of this new parameter (intraoperative repair tension) is, that it can&#xD;
      be influenced. In future, if this hypothesis would be true, the repair tension could be&#xD;
      reduced intraoperative by release, side-to-side (margin convergence) repair or medialization&#xD;
      of the footprint and thereby convert a high risk to a low risk tension repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it could be that patients with a low tension repair does not necessarily have to&#xD;
      wear an abduction splint. And on the other hand, high tension repair patients should probably&#xD;
      wear the abduction splint longer with gradually reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research plan focused on a new intraoperative (arthroscopic) determinable&#xD;
      parameter (&quot;repair tension&quot; on footprint in 0° and 40° abduction) to determine the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence after tendon repair in rotator cuff tears, which are pre- and intraoperative&#xD;
      defined as &quot;reparable&quot;. Therefore, the tension of the repaired tendon is measured&#xD;
      intraoperative with a spring balance (newtonmeter) and correlated with the postoperative&#xD;
      retear-rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Measure intraoperative repair tension with the arm in 0° and 40° of abduction&#xD;

      How the investigators plan the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective clinical study, risk category A. It is one-armed (all participants have&#xD;
      the same procedure/rehabilitation) and single-blinded (participants doesn't knows the repair&#xD;
      tension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are an orthopaedic clinic in Zurich (Universitätsklinik Balgrist, Zürich)&#xD;
      with about 250 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs per year. Our plan is to recruit at least&#xD;
      100 participants in a year for this prospective clinical study. The participants have to&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criterions. The diagnosis for the rotator cuff tears are made on the&#xD;
      basis of arthro-MRI scans. The investigators do the operations in our clinic. The entire&#xD;
      follow-up is one year for each participant. We plan three regular postoperative&#xD;
      consultations. The tendon healing is controlled postoperative by ultrasound (six weeks and 4&#xD;
      month postoperative) and by MRI (one year postoperative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0: participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who are suitable for the study, will be recruited in the clinic for the&#xD;
      study. They are aware of the essential information and the process and have 14 days time to&#xD;
      read the information paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: preoperative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters are collected by default:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Arthro-MRI (fatty infiltration, tear size, tendon retraction, length of central tendon)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RX (Critical Shoulder Angle)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: intraoperative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative procedure is standardized:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative immobilisation in an abduction splint in 40° abduction with passive&#xD;
      mobilisation (physiotherapy) without adduction for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Pain-VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound (retear yes/no) The abduction splint is removed. Other six weeks mobilisation&#xD;
           active and active-assisted without weights and strength until the 12th week (clinic&#xD;
           standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: 4 months postoperative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters are collected by default:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active ROM (abduction, flexion, external rotation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive ROM (glenohumeral abduction, external rotation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective shoulder value&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain-VAS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound (retear yes/no) There is an increase in strength and agility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: 1 year postoperative phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters are collected by default:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive ROM (glenohumeral abduction, external rotation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective shoulder value&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  MRI (fatty infiltration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray (critical shoulder value) The study is finished for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      How the investigators can realise the aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Correlation of intraoperative repair tension in 0° and 40° abduction on footprint with&#xD;
      postoperative healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators measure intraoperative repair tension for each participant in 0° and 40°&#xD;
      abduction in gram with a spring balance. Then, measurement of healing rate of these tendon&#xD;
      reconstructions over one year. The investigators do three regular follow-ups. In week 6 and&#xD;
      month 4, control of healing with ultrasound and one year postoperative with an MRI scan.&#xD;
      Intraoperative repair tension is correlated with retear rate. Cut-off value to separate high&#xD;
      risk and low risk tension repairs is evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Correlation of other parameters with postoperative healing: The investigator correlate&#xD;
      other parameters with the postoperative healing. Following parameters are collected in&#xD;
      preoperative MRI scans: tear size in cm, tear retraction in cm, central tendon length in cm,&#xD;
      fatty infiltration with the classification of Goutallier I-IV. In preoperative x-rays we&#xD;
      measure the critical shoulder angle in degree. Intraoperative measurement of: tendon quality&#xD;
      in four stages and the tear pattern visual (see above, &quot;Visit 2&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Can intraoperative repair tension be predicted preoperative by MRI findings?: For this&#xD;
      question, measurement of following parameters: tendon size in cm, tendon retraction in cm,&#xD;
      length of central tendon in cm and fatty infiltration with the classification of Goutallier&#xD;
      I-IV. Statistical evaluation with correlation of intraoperative repair tension with these MRI&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Correlation of high repair tension with pain: Correlation of pain with repair tension.&#xD;
      Measurement of pain in each consultation with a visual analogue scale from 0-10 (0 no pain,&#xD;
      10 very much pain). Measurement range of motion of the participants (active and passive) and&#xD;
      correlate stiffness with pain and with repair tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Correlation of repair tension with postoperative muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration&#xD;
      and tendon length: Measurement of muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration and tendon length in the&#xD;
      MRI scan preoperative and one year postoperative to compare. The muscle atrophy is quantified&#xD;
      with tangent sign and occupation ratio. Fatty infiltration with the classification of&#xD;
      Goutallier and tendon length in cm. Then, correlation pre- and postoperative changes with the&#xD;
      repair tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Lower retear rate in type B- and C-reconstruction compared to type A- reconstruction?&#xD;
      (type A-C) If possible, the investigators want to correlate different reconstruction types&#xD;
      (A-C) with similar tension repairs.&#xD;
