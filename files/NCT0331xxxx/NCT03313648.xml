      Background &amp; Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related death in the world. The 5-year recurrent rate of HCC after first curative&#xD;
      resection is 77%~100%. Laparoscopic repeat liver resection (LRLR) has been shown in small&#xD;
      retrospective studies to be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (rHCC) in selected patients, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been&#xD;
      increasingly performed for treating recurrent tumors involving the liver after hepatectomy.&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the short-term and long-term outcome of laparoscopic&#xD;
      hepatectomy (LH) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of rHCC.&#xD;
