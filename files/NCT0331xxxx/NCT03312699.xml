    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use an existing, unique clinical cohort: the longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort of younger (21-40 years) and elderly (&gt;65 years) subjects whose yearly influenza&#xD;
      vaccine responses have been studied extensively since 2007, to gain molecular and cellular&#xD;
      mechanistic insights into the impaired vaccine responses in the elderly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV study of sixty 21-40 and &gt;65 year old adult volunteers who previously&#xD;
      participated in vaccine studies with our program. All participation is by invitation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will be enrolled into two groups. Group A: Up to 30 healthy adult volunteers&#xD;
      age 21-40 who will be given seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) prior&#xD;
      to flu season for each of 5 years. They will also be given an inactivated Hepatitis A vaccine&#xD;
      in the spring of years 1 and 2. Each volunteer will complete a total of 4 visits for each&#xD;
      immunization: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8, Day 12-15, and Day 26-30&#xD;
      (post-immunization). All visits will consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring&#xD;
      for serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of this group will be randomized to receive either a Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide&#xD;
      Vaccine or Typhoid Vaccine Live Oral Ty21a vaccine in year 3. Each volunteer will complete a&#xD;
      total of 4 visits for this immunization: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8 post completion of&#xD;
      injection or final oral dose, Day 12-15 and Day 26-30 (post-immunization). All visits will&#xD;
      consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring for serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Up to 30 healthy adult volunteers age 65 plus who will be randomized and given&#xD;
      seasonal trivalent high dose inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or trivalent adjuvanted&#xD;
      trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluad) prior to flu season for each of 5 years. They&#xD;
      will also be given an inactivated Hepatitis A vaccine in the spring of years 1 and 2 and&#xD;
      aTyphoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine in year 3. Each volunteer will complete a total of 4&#xD;
      visits for each immunization: Day 0 (pre-immunization), Day 6-8, Day 12-15, and Day 26-30&#xD;
      (post-immunization). All visits will consist of drawing blood for study assays and monitoring&#xD;
      for serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of subjects (with a target of 10 younger and 10 older subjects depending on health),&#xD;
      will undergo bone marrow aspirates one or two years after typhoid vaccination.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Receipt of inactivated vaccine 14 days prior to study vaccination or planned&#xD;
             vaccination prior to Day 28 after study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 60 days of study vaccination or planned&#xD;
             vaccination prior to Day 28 after study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Donation of the equivalent of a unit of blood within 6 weeks prior to enrollment or&#xD;
             planned blood donation prior to Day 28 after study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to enrollment or planned use of&#xD;

         10. Need for allergy immunizations (that cannot be postponed) between Days 0 and 28&#xD;
             post-immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant or lactating woman for all but influenza vaccine. A woman who is pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding may be evaluated by the Protocol Director to determine if influenza&#xD;
             vaccination would affect volunteer safety and may be included at the discretion of the&#xD;
             investigator. Blood sample collection will be adjusted as necessary for volunteer&#xD;
             safety (e.g. blood collection volume for a pregnant woman would follow the minimal&#xD;
             risk guidelines of 50 ml in an 8 week period and collection may not occur more&#xD;
             frequently than 2 times per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any condition, which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with&#xD;
             volunteer safety, study objectives or the ability of the participant to understand or&#xD;
             comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
