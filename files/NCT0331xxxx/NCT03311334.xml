  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter study of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion in&#xD;
      combination with checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) in adult patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors, that consists of 2 parts: dose search part of the study (Phase 1b and Phase 1b&#xD;
      Enrichment Cohort) and the dose expansion part of the study (Phase 2). In Phase 1b of this&#xD;
      study there will be 2 arms: Arm 1 and Arm 2. In Arm 1, there will be 6 to 12 patients who&#xD;
      will be dosed with DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion and nivolumab and in Arm 2 there will be 6 to 12&#xD;
      patients who will be dosed with DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion and pembrolizumab. In addition, an&#xD;
      enrichment cohort of a further 10 patients who have locally advanced or metastatic Renal Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma or Urothelial Cancer with primary or acquired resistance to previous checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors will be enrolled into Phase 1b of the study to help evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion at the safe dose level identified in the&#xD;
      dose-search part of the study, and will be dosed with DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion and nivolumab,&#xD;
      or DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion and pembrolizumab, as per the investigator's preference. At the&#xD;
      safe, recommended dose determined in Phase 1b, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC)&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in Phase 2 of the study with DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion, exploring&#xD;
      the combination with pembrolizumab (Arm 2). In Phase 2, approximately 40 patients with PROC&#xD;
      will be initially enrolled; additional patients may be enrolled to further assess anti-tumor&#xD;
      activities, but the total sample size will not exceed 60 patients. This brings the total&#xD;
      maximum study population to approximately 84 patients.&#xD;
