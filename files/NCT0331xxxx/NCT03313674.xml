  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder, characterized by&#xD;
      a recurrent temporal relationship between the season of year, the onset and the remission of&#xD;
      a major depressive episode. Estimates of the annual prevalence state that 1-6% of the&#xD;
      population will develop SAD with the larger prevalences found at greater extremes in&#xD;
      latitude. SAD is most likely triggered by the shortening photoperiod experienced in the&#xD;
      winter months leading to a deterioration of mood. Recent cross-sectional neuroimaging studies&#xD;
      have found cellular and neurotransmitter changes in response to seasonality, ultimately&#xD;
      having an impact on the affect of patients. Conversly, this study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      changes in neurocircuitry related to depression and euthymic states. Patients with SAD offer&#xD;
      a unique ability to study these changes since they have predictable triggers for the onset of&#xD;
      depression (i.e. the winter months) and remission (i.e. the summer months).&#xD;

    <description>Sigh-SAD measures Depressive Severity specifically in SAD patients. It contains 29 items, with the total score ranging from 0 to 29. Higher values in the scale indicate worse depression severity.&#xD;
Of the 29 items, 21 question (adapted from the Hamilton Depression scale) are used to determine typical depression severity, with an additional eight items for the &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms which are presented in seasonal affective disorder. The final score is summed, with equal weighting, to give the total score.</description>
