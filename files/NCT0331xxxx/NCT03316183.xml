      The purpose of this study is to compare patients' metabolomic profiles who are managed with a&#xD;
      brain monitor that measures cerebral oxygen to those who are managed by conventional measures&#xD;
      to hopefully decrease postoperative neurologic and cognitive deficits and improve quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neurologic and cognitive decline remain common complications that adversely affect patients'&#xD;
      outcome after cardiac surgery. By incorporating a brain monitor that measures cerebral oxygen&#xD;
      content into our perioperative management we aim to decrease postoperative neurologic and&#xD;
      cognitive deficits and improve quality of life in this patient population. We also aim to&#xD;
      uncover how the compromised brain alters its metabolism in response to ischemic injury and&#xD;
      how this new information can guide new preventive treatment methods for vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive&#xD;
      monitor that estimates cerebral oxygenation through measurements of regional venous&#xD;
      saturation. It is based on measuring intravascular oxyhemoglobin fraction in a small sample&#xD;
      of cerebral cortex through the skull using near-infrared light spectroscopy. Cerebral&#xD;
      oximetry examines all reflected light, from both pulsatile arterial and non-pulsatile venous&#xD;
      blood, without requiring pulsatility, hence cerebral oximetry can continue to monitor brain&#xD;
      oxygenation during both CPB and circulatory arrest. With this advantage, cerebral oximetry is&#xD;
      widely utilized in our daily cardiac anesthesia practice, routinely for surgeries requiring&#xD;
      circulatory arrest, and for other elective CABG and valve replacement/repair surgeries in&#xD;
      some institutions. Despite its wide use, controversy still exists in its interpretation and&#xD;
      ability to optimize cerebral outcome after cardiac surgery. Key questions to be answered are:&#xD;
      1) the desaturation threshold associated with poor prognosis; 2) the absolute desaturation&#xD;
      value at which adverse clinical outcome increases, and 3); if the relative trend is more&#xD;
      important to signal approaching deterioration. All of these questions are relevant to our&#xD;
      clinical practice yet remain unanswered. Our research study aims to take a first step towards&#xD;
      identification of the ideal method of utilizing cerebral oximetry in cardiac surgeries to&#xD;
      improve neurological outcome through increasing precision in managing hemodynamic as well as&#xD;
      laboratory values through a treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second component of this study incorporates metabolomic profiling as we refine the&#xD;
      perioperative management of cardiac surgery patient to improve their cerebral outcome.&#xD;
      Despite enormous research efforts over the last decades, currently there is no specific and&#xD;
      single neurologic biomarker (or panels of biomarkers) that has been validated for clinical&#xD;
      use. Meanwhile, neuro-imaging (CT and MRI) remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      cerebral injury. Organ-specific biomarkers, if identified, have the potential to be a&#xD;
      reliable and cost-effective method to diagnose, guide management, classify severity of&#xD;
      stroke, anticipate cognitive function, and predict complications. Recently, metabolomic&#xD;
      profiling has enabled comprehensive analyses of changes in metabolic fuel selection in a&#xD;
      variety of models, including cardioplegic arrest. Advances in analytical technology have&#xD;
      enabled quantitative analysis of several hundreds of metabolites in a single measurement with&#xD;
      high throughput and sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic profiling entails quantitating small-molecule metabolites from body fluids or&#xD;
      tissues in a single step, and possesses the potential for early diagnosis, therapy monitoring&#xD;
      and investigating the pathogenesis of various diseases. This biomarker detection is conducted&#xD;
      in cells, tissues, or biofluids by either nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or&#xD;
      mass spectrometry (MS) which then undergoes multivariate data analysis. Jung et al., using&#xD;
      1H-NMR spectropy combined with multivariate statistical analysis assessed stroke patients. In&#xD;
      this study perturbed metabolic pattern in both plasma and urine from patients with known&#xD;
      cerebral infarction incidents were assessed to identify a specific proteome associated with&#xD;
      stroke. A similar investigation has been conducted with a wider quantification of&#xD;
      neuroproteomics using a rodent model. Biomarker prognostic of acute kidney injury in patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has also been investigated. Despite its potential for&#xD;
      wide application, metabolomic profiling has not seen its utilization to guide neuroprotective&#xD;
      management in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We believe the unique combination of these&#xD;
      two methods poses a valuable opportunity not only to improve the patient's neurocognitive&#xD;
      outcome, but also to gain insights on which biomarkers represent cerebral ischemia or other&#xD;
      signs of cerebral injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to: 1. Assess the transcerebral metabolomic profile and neurocognitive&#xD;
      outcome in response to cerebral injury in patients monitored and treated according to&#xD;
      cerebral oximetry (NIRS) and those that are just monitored with NIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on available literature, our working hypothesis is that compared to monitored only&#xD;
      patients, cerebral fuel utilization will be differentially affected in patients monitored and&#xD;
      treated by tightly following a specific neuroprotective algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.a. Test the plasma concentrations of metabolites representing the amino acid, carbohydrate,&#xD;
      energy, lipid, and nucleotide pathways using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass&#xD;
      spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.b. Compare the neurocognitive function of treated and untreated patients using a&#xD;
      comprehensive test battery consisting of 5 assessment modalities at baseline, at the time of&#xD;
      discharge and 6 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
