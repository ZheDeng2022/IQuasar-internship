    <textblock>
      The current way that pain is treated after trauma and injury is problematic. Most often pain&#xD;
      after trauma is treated with opioids (ex. Percocet® or Vicodin®) or anti-inflammatories (ex.&#xD;
      ibuprofen). Both of these medications can cause side effects and opioids have been related to&#xD;
      the development of addiction. In addition, there are not any treatments that prevent pain&#xD;
      from going on to become persistent (last beyond it is supposed to) or chronic (lasting 3&#xD;
      months or longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain is an enormous problem and there an urgent need to find both alternatives to&#xD;
      opioid pain medications and medications that prevent pain from becoming chronic. The&#xD;
      ATTAC-Pain (Altering The Transition from Acute to Chronic Pain) study proposes to examine&#xD;
      whether duloxetine (a medication that is marketed for depression, anxiety, and specific types&#xD;
      of pain conditions), can reduce acute and chronic pain among adults who come to the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED)with muscular pain (such as neck pain after a car accident or low back pain).&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll 60 patients who come to the ED. Patients will be eligible if they&#xD;
      report moderate to severe muscular pain (such as pain in the back, neck, or shoulders).&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be randomized to receive duloxetine 30mg, duloxetine 60mg, or&#xD;
      placebo (2/3rd chance of being in one of the duloxetine groups). The study team will follow&#xD;
      patients for six weeks and collect information on pain outcomes and use of pain medications.&#xD;
      Investigators aim to determine if duloxetine can (1) reduce acute pain symptoms following the&#xD;
      ED visit, (2) prevent the transition to persistent pain (having pain 6 weeks after the&#xD;
      initial ED visit), and (3) decrease opioid use following a motor vehicle collision (MVC). The&#xD;
      results of this study will ultimately help determine if duloxetine can be used as a&#xD;
      non-opioid pain treatment option that reduces acute pain and prevents the transition to&#xD;
      chronic pain. This in turn can improve recovery, reduce opioid use and its consequences, and&#xD;
      decrease health care costs.&#xD;

      There is an urgent need for new non-opioid pain management options to prevent the development&#xD;
      of chronic musculoskeletal pain in patients experiencing acute pain and injury. Investigators&#xD;
      propose to address this unmet need by intervening at the point when pain is still acute with&#xD;
      pain management that is intended to alter the mechanisms involved in the transition from&#xD;
      acute to chronic pain. The proposed study, &quot;Altering The Transition from Acute to Chronic&#xD;
      Pain (ATTAC-Pain): A randomized clinical trial of duloxetine for the treatment and prevention&#xD;
      of musculoskeletal pain,&quot; will examine the ability of duloxetine to improve pain outcomes in&#xD;
      individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll a total of sixty participants. Eligible patients who consent to the&#xD;
      study will: be randomized in the ED, receive a dose of study drug (duloxetine 30mg,&#xD;
      duloxetine 60mg, or placebo) in the ED, and be discharged from the ED with a two week supply&#xD;
      of study drug. Following discharge, the patient will receive follow-up assessments via&#xD;
      internet-based surveys and phone to monitor for adverse events and evaluate patient outcomes.&#xD;
      The patient will also return to the study site for an in-person follow-up interview 6 weeks&#xD;
      after their initial ED visit. The study team will recruit participants at the Rhode Island&#xD;
      Hospital and the Miriam Hospital EDs. The results of this study will be used as basis for a&#xD;
      potentially high impact large-scale trial examining an important new non-opioid pain&#xD;
      treatment option that reduces acute pain and prevents the transition to chronic pain. This in&#xD;
      turn can improve recovery, reduce opioid use and its sequelae, and decrease health care&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
