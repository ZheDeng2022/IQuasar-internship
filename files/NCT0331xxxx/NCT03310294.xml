  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herpes labialis (HL) is the result of the presence of a virus called HSV-1 and is a common&#xD;
      disease. Because of its visibility due to cold sores it has a serious impact on social life.&#xD;
      Until now there is no effective treatment to prevent virus outbreaks. However, prebiotics and&#xD;
      probiotics have both been shown to have a favorable and supportive effect on the immune&#xD;
      system in different health conditions such as influenza, atopic dermatitis and diarrhea, so&#xD;
      it is possible that they are able to have a favourable effect also on HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently completed pilot clinical trial (Protocol Number 08-SBUS-2-GRA-01, EVIM-1) was&#xD;
      completed using a fermented milk (minidrink) containing a combination of L. rhamnosus and&#xD;
      FOS; it showed promising results in the reduction of HL recurrences in a population of 78&#xD;
      subjects with HSV-1. The study investigated the effect of pre- or probiotics or a combination&#xD;
      of the two on the recurrence of HL lesions as well as on the immune system in general,&#xD;
      showing that the consumption of a minidrink containing the probiotic L. rhamnosus or a&#xD;
      minidrink containing a combination of L. rhamnosus and FOS reduced the occurrence and the&#xD;
      incidence of recurrent HL lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study: corroborate whether the consumption of a minidrink containing a&#xD;
      combination of L. rhamnosus and FOS results in less recurrence and a better progression of HL&#xD;
      lesion, in a larger population. In addition, the response of the consumption of the minidrink&#xD;
      on the QoL and the response on immunity specific biomarkers were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 152 patients were eligible to participate in the study and after a run-in period of&#xD;
      two weeks consuming a placebo minidrink were randomized to one of the two experimental study&#xD;
      groups: placebo minidrink (n=79) and a minidrink containing a combination of a pre- and&#xD;
      probiotic (n=78). These minidrinks were consumed until the end of the study (day 140). At day&#xD;
      33 of the study the lip most prone to the development of a lesion was stimulated with UVB to&#xD;
      provoke a lesion. During the entire study period subjects were checked for any clinical signs&#xD;
      of a lesion, completed a self-assessment regarding the lesion and a QoL questionnaire at&#xD;
      baseline (day 14), at day 49 and the end of the study (day 140). In addition, a blood sample&#xD;
      was collected at baseline, at day 49 and at the end of the study to be analyzed for&#xD;
      HSV-specific antibody concentrations , to check immune system specific functions.&#xD;

      Background: Herpes labialis is the result of the presence of HSV-1 and is a common disease.&#xD;
      Because of its visibility it has a serious impact on social life. Until now there is no&#xD;
      effective treatment to prevent virus outbreaks. However, prebiotics and probiotics have both&#xD;
      been shown to have a favorable and supportive effect on the immune system in different health&#xD;
      conditions such as influenza, atopic dermatitis and diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently completed pilot clinical trial (Protocol Number 08-SBUS-2-GRA-01, EVIM-1) parallel&#xD;
      groups, placebo controlled, triple blind, single center, randomized study, with a fermented&#xD;
      milk (minidrink) containing a combination of L. rhamnosus and FOS showed promising results in&#xD;
      the reduction of HL recurrences in a population of 78 subjects with HSV-1; the study&#xD;
      investigated the effect of pre- or probiotics or a combination of the two on the recurrence&#xD;
      of HL lesions as well as on the immune system in general, showing that the consumption of a&#xD;
      minidrink containing the probiotic L. rhamnosus or a minidrink containing a combination of L.&#xD;
      rhamnosus and FOS reduced the occurrence and the incidence of recurrent HL lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: corroborate whether the consumption of a minidrink containing a combination&#xD;
      of L. rhamnosus and FOS results in less recurrence and a better progression of HL lesion, in&#xD;
      a larger population. In addition, the response of the consumption of the minidrink on the QoL&#xD;
      and the response on immunity specific biomarkers were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: 152 patients were eligible to participate in the study and after a run-in period of&#xD;
      two weeks consuming a placebo minidrink were randomized to one of the two experimental study&#xD;
      groups: placebo minidrink (n=79) and a minidrink containing a combination of a pre- and&#xD;
      probiotic (n=78). These minidrinks were consumed until the end of the study (day 140). At day&#xD;
      33 of the study the lip most prone to the development of a lesion was stimulated with UVB to&#xD;
      provoke a lesion. During the entire study period subjects were checked for any clinical signs&#xD;
      of a lesion, completed a self-assessment regarding the lesion and a QoL questionnaire at&#xD;
      baseline (day 14), at day 49 and the end of the study (day 140). In addition, a blood sample&#xD;
      was collected at baseline, at day 49 and at the end of the study to be analyzed for&#xD;
      HSV-specific antibody concentrations (circulating concentrations of IgG1 and IgG3 (Th1) and&#xD;
      IgG4 (Th2), NK activity, CXCL10 analyzed by ELISA at days 14, 49 and 140).&#xD;
&#xD;
      as regards the primary endpoint results have shown that there was a significant decrease&#xD;
      (54.3%) in the recurrences of Herpes labialis lesions, post UV stimulation, at day 49 (V4)&#xD;
      compared to placebo in the PP population with consumption of the study product minidrink with&#xD;
      fermented low fat milk added with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and FOS. Considering the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints in the PP population, considering the number of subjects who presented lesions&#xD;
      between V0 and V5, the number of lesions is reduced significantly (both statistically and&#xD;
      clinically) in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. There was a decrease in the&#xD;
      lesion size in the treatment group when compared to placebo although the statistical&#xD;
      significance is marginal. As regards 'Subjective assessment of pain', evaluated by means of a&#xD;
      VAS scale, significant pain reduction was found in the treatment group compared to the&#xD;
      placebo group. As regards immunological parameters was shown an increase in CXCL10 at V4 in&#xD;
      the study group compared to the placebo group. As regards IgG1, IgG3 and IgG4 (V0, V4 and V5)&#xD;
      although substantial increases were registered for some of these parameters, these were not&#xD;
      sufficient to describe a definite trend. The natural killer (NK) cell activity did not show&#xD;
      significant difference in their functional activity in the treatment group as compared to the&#xD;
      placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been verified through quality of life questionnaire (SF-36 questionnaire) that&#xD;
      treatment improved Mental Health in the treatment group (Nervous, Peaceful, Happy, Down in&#xD;
      Dumps, Sad) compared to the placebo group and clinical significance was found at V4 and V5.&#xD;
      General Health and Vitality has been improved at V4 and V5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each trial participant the adverse events/serious adverse events occurrences and a brief&#xD;
      clinical examination were assessed. No special or unusual features of the safety evaluations&#xD;
      were found.&#xD;
