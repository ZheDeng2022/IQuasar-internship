        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-45 (both inclusive), as determined by&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory test values, vital signs and 12-lead&#xD;
             ECGs at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers from at least three months before receiving the first dose of study drug&#xD;
             and for the duration of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the&#xD;
             restrictions and schedule of procedures as defined in the protocol, as confirmed&#xD;
             during the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers of child-bearing potential and less than one year post-menopausal&#xD;
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test and be non-lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers who have been post-menopausal for more than one year and have&#xD;
             elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or are treated with hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (HRT) or female volunteers who have been permanently sterilised&#xD;
             (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers of child-bearing potential who are sexually active must use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after&#xD;
             completion of the study. Acceptable highly effective methods include: established use&#xD;
             of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception (resulting in a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year); placement of an intrauterine device or&#xD;
             intrauterine system; true abstinence where this is already established as the&#xD;
             volunteer's preferred and usual lifestyle; a male partner who has undergone&#xD;
             sterilisation (provided that they are the sole sexual partner and that the&#xD;
             vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male volunteers must not donate sperm during the study and for 90 days after&#xD;
             completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to consent to have data entered into The Over Volunteering Prevention&#xD;
             System (TOPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months that&#xD;
             there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or who have taken monoamine&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, Seville orange marmalade&#xD;
