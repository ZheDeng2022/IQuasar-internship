  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 126 premenopausal women (42 lean, 42 obese with central obesity, 42 obese with&#xD;
      peripheral obesity) will be recruited. Anthropometric measurements and body composition using&#xD;
      DEXA will be collected. Overnight fasted subjects will be asked to give baseline blood&#xD;
      samples before consuming a meal containing 6 mg 57Fe in the form of FeSO4. Subjects will&#xD;
      return after 14 days and a blood sample will be collected for measurement of isotopic&#xD;
      enrichment into red blood cells, serving as well as a baseline for the OGTT. Subjects will&#xD;
      then be asked to ingest a solution of glucose (50g) containing 100 mg of iron in the form of&#xD;
      sodium ferrous citrate (SFC), after which blood samples will be collected 2 hours post iron&#xD;
      and glucose load. All three blood samples collected at baseline, 2 weeks post labeled iron&#xD;
      load, and 2 hours post glucose/iron load will be analyzed for their levels of iron, glycaemia&#xD;
      and inflammatory parameters.&#xD;

      1. Obese subjects with central and peripheral obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the first phase, overweight/obese subjects with a BMI 28-35 Kg/m2 will be invited&#xD;
           to a screening. At the screening, anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference)&#xD;
           and body composition (using BIA and DEXA) will be measured. Based on the subject's&#xD;
           distribution of body fat, those who have a predefined % body fat between 45-55% will be&#xD;
           invited to join the study and they would fall into one of the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  42 subjects with &gt;43% fat in the android sector (area from the pelvis to 20% of the&#xD;
                distance between the pelvis and the neck cuts) according to the DEXA results&#xD;
                (central adiposity) would be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  42 subjects with &lt;43% fat in the android sector according to DEXA (peripheral&#xD;
                adiposity) would be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lean subjects At the same time, anthropometric (weight, height, waist circumference) and&#xD;
           body composition (using BIA and DEXA) measurement will be conducted on interested lean&#xD;
           subjects (BMI 20-25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight fasted subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T0:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a determination of the type and degree of obesity through the measurement of&#xD;
      weight, height, BMI, and WC, followed by both BIA screening and DEXA scan to obtain a more&#xD;
      detailed image about the status of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fasting blood sample of 10 ml (4 ml EDTA coated tubes, 6 ml uncoated tubes) will be drawn&#xD;
      to measure the inflammatory status, glycaemia, and iron levels of the participant by&#xD;
      determining CRP, alpha-glycoprotein, hepcidin, ferritin, TfR, TIBC, HbA1c, insulin, FPG,&#xD;
      serum iron, CBC and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this blood test, the subject will be given a meal including 57Fe (6 mg iron as FeSO4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second venous blood sample of 10 ml (4 ml EDTA coated tubes, 6 ml uncoated tubes) will be&#xD;
      drawn for analysis of hemoglobin and erythrocyte isotopic composition as well as for the&#xD;
      determination of serum ferritin, transferrin receptor, C-reactive protein, alpha-glycoprotein&#xD;
      and hepcidin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third venous blood sample of 10 ml (4 ml EDTA coated tubes, 6 ml uncoated tubes) will be&#xD;
      drawn to measure the level of glucose, insulin, TG, FFA, TIBC and serum iron. This blood test&#xD;
      will be an indicator of the level of glycaemia and iron appearance in the blood of the&#xD;
      subject through the earlier ingestion of OGTT and oral iron load.&#xD;
