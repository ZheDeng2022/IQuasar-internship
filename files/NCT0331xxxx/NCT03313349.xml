    <textblock>
      Evaluating interventions for children/adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity&#xD;
      Disorder (ADHD) is a field that offers many challenges. Even though psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      treatment for ADHD is recommended as the first choice in many countries(1), the evidence base&#xD;
      for this is inconsistent and outcome specific (2). For instance, parent training may not have&#xD;
      significant effects on the core Symptoms of ADHD (3). However, trials suggest that it&#xD;
      facilitates skills in other areas. One area where it is of potential value is social&#xD;
      functioning (4). The randomized controlled trial (RCT)described here will test the&#xD;
      therapeutic value of a package of psychological interventions designed to target social&#xD;
      functioning for children and adolescents with ADHD. It will be conducted in a special school&#xD;
      environment designed specifically for children with severe behavioral problems. Therefore,&#xD;
      routine provision is already substantial. As a result, it was not possible to include a &quot;no&#xD;
      intervention group&quot; (control group) for ethical reasons. Therefore, the value of social&#xD;
      skills intervention was examined by comparing different &quot;doses&quot; of the routine intervention&#xD;
      by testing a usual provision (UP) group against an enriched/need-based (ENP) form of&#xD;
      provision.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, the former Danish minister of Social Affairs presented a national plan for the help&#xD;
      and treatment of people with ADHD. Acknowledging the rise in the number of citizens in&#xD;
      Denmark with an ADHD diagnosis, the Danish government supported an enhanced effort to offer&#xD;
      this group adequate treatment. The government's aim was to secure an increased quality of&#xD;
      life for individuals with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ministry of Social Affairs sees ADHD as a cluster of co-occurring difficulties that&#xD;
      creates various problems in life for affected individuals. The main goal with the national&#xD;
      plan, was (i) to provide early years help for children, (ii) to prevent the development of&#xD;
      ADHD type of problems, and (iii) to provide the proper treatment for people, who already have&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plan did not consider the biological perspectives, and medicinal treatment is not&#xD;
      mentioned as a part of the plan - while non-pharmacological interventions, such as parent&#xD;
      training, were considered the first priority (5). This priority for non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions rested partly on ethical considerations, although the report suggests that a&#xD;
      number of training programs are evidence-based. The evidence-base for non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions remains complex. For instance, the benefits of parent training and&#xD;
      child-focused treatments for core ADHD symptom control is limited - especially when blinded&#xD;
      outcomes are considered (6). In contrast, parent training seems to improve parenting and&#xD;
      reduce conduct disorder (7). Social skills training may also have value (8). This is&#xD;
      important as, although behavioral problems are not considered a core symptom in ADHD, social&#xD;
      functioning deficits are recognized in many children with ADHD (9) and conduct disorder is a&#xD;
      relatively common comorbidity (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a society like Denmark, where people with ADHD receive psychosocial treatment and support&#xD;
      from the Social Services before they are considered for medical treatment, it is vital that&#xD;
      studies of nonpharmacological interventions are conducted. The investigators have to analyze&#xD;
      to what extend the interventions can have an effect and on which areas of functioning we can&#xD;
      expect improvement. In Denmark, children with most severe behavior problems are treated in&#xD;
      special educational settings. In these settings, nonpharmacological treatment is the norm.&#xD;
      Considering this, more studies should be conducted in such settings to see if the approaches&#xD;
      used are of value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed RCT will contribute to the knowledge about the value of nonpharmacological&#xD;
      interventions, especially with regard to social functioning and skills for ADHD, by&#xD;
      investigating treatment in a special school setting providing care for children/adolescents&#xD;
      with severe ADHD symptoms and behavior problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the benefits of enriching and extending an&#xD;
      existing non-pharmacological intervention for social skills deficits in ADHD currently&#xD;
      delivered in a special school environment. To do this, we will compare usual provision (UP)&#xD;
      with an enhanced and need based provision (ENP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does enriching and extending an existing nonpharmacological intervention for social&#xD;
           skills increase its effectiveness in terms of social skill improvements?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do these effects persist to 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the enriched intervention reduce core symptoms of conduct disorder and ADHD&#xD;
           compared to the routine one?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does medication taken during the study moderate the outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ethical reasons, it is not possible in this study to have a control group that does not&#xD;
      receive treatment. The Ministry of Social Affairs legislation does not allow students to be&#xD;
      in a control group with no treatment in a special school setting. Due to these circumstances,&#xD;
      the study will be a pragmatic RCT study. Therefore, a two-arm RCT will be carried out to&#xD;
      evaluate whether the effectiveness of the intervention is greater when delivered in an&#xD;
      &quot;enriched/need Based provision&quot; (ENP) format compared to a &quot;usual provision&quot; (UP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enlisted at the three schools in Denmark; Pilelygaard, Pilen and&#xD;
      Kompasset - each part of an organization called Behandlingsskolerne which has approximately&#xD;
      100 students enrolled at any time. Daily treatment is primarily offered in a school setting,&#xD;
      but can take place elsewhere (visiting a café, walk in the park etc.). Family work will be&#xD;
      carried out in the student´s home or at school meetings. Students in these schools do not&#xD;
      have ASD as a primary diagnosis or a very low IQ. However, the level of comorbidity is high.&#xD;
      More than half of the students have more than one diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of staffing is high with 1:2 staff to student ratio. Many of the staff are trained&#xD;
      to deliver psychological treatment. Both teachers and social workers are all trained in a&#xD;
      cognitive approach and follow the guidelines of specialized psychologists in the treatment.&#xD;
      The staff are supervised on a regular basis and participate in meetings with the school unit,&#xD;
      class team, and the psychologists to secure every student´s progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study are all students enlisted at Behandlingsskolerne. An Organization&#xD;
      that houses several special schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children from 6 to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatric institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis F.90.1 - Hyperkinetic behavioral disorder (ICD10), or history of behavioral&#xD;
           problems in multiple settings (School, Home, leisure time).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents/caregivers with no reported mental illness or severe addictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing diagnosis of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intellectual disability with an IQ &lt; 70 WISC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the Ministry of Social Affairs legislation, students with ADHD are offered private&#xD;
      treatment in special schools when education and treatment is not possible in public schools.&#xD;
      Each student is individually evaluated by Social Service officials before being offered&#xD;
      private treatment. When the student´s parents and the Social Service Department first&#xD;
      consider Behandlingsskolerne as an option, the student´s files are send to the school and a&#xD;
      meeting is held between the parents, officials and the school. Taking into consideration the&#xD;
      diagnosis, the school history and recommendations from the family, the student is placed in a&#xD;
      school unit within the organization - one that is judged able to meet the student´s unique&#xD;
      needs. The study will consider each student enlisted in these three school units between the&#xD;
      dates 01.03.17 and 01.09.18. Students meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in this RCT consist of two versions of a package of psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      sessions given to the students and students' parents. Trained psychologists offer a number of&#xD;
      sessions in which problems regarding ADHD and/or behavioral problems are addressed. The&#xD;
      following describes the standard interventions offered at Behandlingsskolerne for children&#xD;
      with ADHD and severe behavioral problems (The content of the therapeutic approach is&#xD;
      available from the author):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention with students:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapy sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishing relationship with student&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychoeducation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions with parents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapy sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishing relation with parents and within the family&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychoeducation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the UP and ENP groups: The UP-group receives a fixed amount of&#xD;
      intervention = five sessions (three for the student and two for the parents) each month in&#xD;
      which relevant treatment is picked from the intervention approaches mentioned above. The&#xD;
      ENP-group receives the same treatment options from the intervention list but in an enhanced&#xD;
      form. This group receives not less than seven sessions (four for the student and three for&#xD;
      the parents). Furthermore, in the ENP-Group, there is no limit regarding the number of&#xD;
      interventions. The psychologist will evaluate how many sessions he considers are needed to&#xD;
      progress in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychologists will report the progress in treatment for the students in the study at&#xD;
      monthly meetings. They track the therapy sessions offered for each student in a registration&#xD;
      sheet. At these meetings, the ethical perspectives are discussed and the extent of the&#xD;
      treatment is considered. If a student is not making progress, or even getting worse, a shift&#xD;
      from the UP group to the ENP-Group is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A psychiatric assessment has been performed on every student in the study in a hospital in&#xD;
      Denmark. These took into account the typical range of information required from an assessment&#xD;
      from multiple sources and across multiple settings. Considering the medical history,&#xD;
      diagnostic interviews, and test results, all students participating are diagnosed with&#xD;
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and not ASD or with an IQ of less than 70.&#xD;
      Behavioral problems are diagnosed in the hospital or described in the school records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes T1 to T4 outcomes were measured using the following scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social skills (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SRS - Social Responsiveness Scale - (teachers/social workers). The SRS test assess the&#xD;
           functioning in general on five subscales: Social Cognition, Social Communication, Social&#xD;
           Consciousness, Social Motivation, and Stereotypic behavior. The SRS is specially design&#xD;
           to identify different types of abnormalities in social functioning and describe social&#xD;
           problems (Wigham et al, 2012). The SRS is completed by a teacher or social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABBAS II - Adaptive Behavior Assessment System - (for both teacher/social workers and&#xD;
           parents). The ABAS II test assesses adaptive behavior in three domains: conceptual,&#xD;
           social, and practical functioning. Beside the domain targeting the social skills in the&#xD;
           test, many of the subscales can be linked to social functioning in general and the test&#xD;
           is sensitive to progression/maturation (Harrison et al, 2003). The ABAS II is completed&#xD;
           by both parents and teacher/social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD symptoms and conduct problems (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SDQ - Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire - (teachers/social workers). The SDQ is the&#xD;
           most used test in Denmark for screening psychopathologies. The test covers four problem&#xD;
           areas: Hyperactivity/Attention, Behavioral Problems, Emotional Problems, and Peer&#xD;
           Problems (Niclasen et al, 2012). The SDQ is completed by a teacher or social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ADHD-RS - Attention deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale - (teachers/social&#xD;
           workers). The ADHD-RS test is used to identify traits in ADHD on two subscales:&#xD;
           Attention and Impulsivity/Hyperactivity (DuPaul et al. 1998). The ADHD-RS is completed&#xD;
           by teacher or social worker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will employ an ITT analysis, with multiple imputation of missing data,&#xD;
      using linear mixed models to compare the two trial arms on an aggregate score on the two&#xD;
      social skills scales at T2. T1 scores will be included in the model as a covariate. Secondary&#xD;
      analysis will use similar models for other outcomes at other time-points. To obtain adequate&#xD;
      statistical power, the two treatment arms will be split equally using a 1-to-1 ratio.&#xD;
      Clinically valuable change (MIREDIF) on the primary outcome requires a minimum 15 scale point&#xD;
      improvement which is equivalent to a .6 standard deviation change. This require 32 Students&#xD;
      (16 in the Study Group and 16 in the Control Group) to obtain a power of 80% (100% - errors&#xD;
      of type II) using a conventional statistical level of significance of 5%. The group will be&#xD;
      stratified for sex of participant and by which unit they are attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderator Analysis: We will record the nature of all treatment (including medication)&#xD;
      received, and this will be summarized and quantified and used as a moderator in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval and Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard ethical procedures will apply. Students and participants will give written informed&#xD;
      consent. We are obliged to protect all data collected and the data can only be used in an&#xD;
      anonymous form. Associate Professor Henrik Skovlund from University of Århus is responsible&#xD;
      for monitoring and securing all the ethical aspects of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study are allocated to each arm by using randomization system. After&#xD;
      determining which of the three school Units the student will attend, the participants are&#xD;
      distributed in to one of the two arms at each school (UP &amp; ENP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not possible to fully blind parents and students as they have to give informed consent.&#xD;
      Teachers and social workers will be kept blind to allocation as far as possible . They are&#xD;
      not directly involved in the treatment measured in this study, even though they play a great&#xD;
      part in it. The blindness of the teachers and social workers is important as they will be&#xD;
      providing the ratings used in the analyses.&#xD;
