  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for cancer&#xD;
      abnormality in one of the following genes: CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK4, or CDK6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Abemaciclib&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Abemaciclib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in this study, the participant must have an abnormality in one of the&#xD;
      following genes: CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK4, or CDK6. Abnormalities in these genes may cause&#xD;
      the cancer to grow more rapidly. CDK4 and CDK6 are proteins that are involved with the cell&#xD;
      growth process. D-type cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, and CCND3) are proteins that help control the&#xD;
      activity of CDK4 and CDK6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abemaciclib is being studied as a treatment for people with advanced cancer. Abemaciclib is a&#xD;
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cell growth. In this&#xD;
      research study, the investigators are hoping to learn whether Abemaciclib can be used to slow&#xD;
      or stop the growth of cancers with specific genetic abnormalities.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid&#xD;
             tumor of a non-breast origin, for which standard therapy proven to provide clinical&#xD;
             benefit does not exist or is no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to Arm 1: Participants must have a confirmed CCND1, 2, or 3 high-level&#xD;
             amplification, CCND1 mutation, or a CCND1 splice variant expected to lead to nuclear&#xD;
             retention of cyclin D1 protein, via DFCI/BWH OncoPanel or any CLIA-certified method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For enrollment to Arm 2: Participants must have a confirmed CDK4 or CDK6 high-level&#xD;
             amplification, identified via DFCI/BWH OncoPanel or any CLIA-certified method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have evaluable or measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1 (see APPENDIX A).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of abemaciclib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after completion of abemaciclib&#xD;
             administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational agents,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, or major surgery within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin&#xD;
             C) prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had oral targeted therapy or oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
             (TKIs) within 5 half-lives prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have recovered to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse&#xD;
             events as a result of previous treatment prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with hematologic lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with symptomatic CNS metastases who are neurologically unstable and/or&#xD;
             require radiation therapy are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with brain metastases that do not meet the above criteria in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the treating investigator are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic disease is allowed as long as symptoms are controlled and stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because abemaciclib is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with abemaciclib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with abemaciclib. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known HIV-positive status are ineligible because these participants&#xD;
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug (EIAED) who cannot be&#xD;
             transferred to a non-EIAED (e.g., levetiracetam, lacosamide, lamotrigine, etc.) prior&#xD;
             to the initiation of protocol therapy.&#xD;
