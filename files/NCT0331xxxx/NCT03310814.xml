      This study compares the efficacy of a non-practitioner assisted direct-to-consumer (DTC)&#xD;
      self-driven approach to nutrigenomics versus a personalized practitioner-led method. The&#xD;
      secondary aims are to use this data combined with participant feedback to generate more&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While nutrition is a widely accepted tool for the prevention of long-term health conditions,&#xD;
      current approaches have not adequately reduced chronic disease morbidity. Nutrigenomics has&#xD;
      great potential, however, it is complicated to implement. There is a need for products,&#xD;
      derived from nutrigenomics, which are easily understood, accessible and utilized. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a non-practitioner assisted&#xD;
      direct-to-consumer (DTC) self-driven approach to nutrigenomics versus a personalized&#xD;
      practitioner-led method. The secondary aims are to use this data combined with participant&#xD;
      feedback to generate more effective nutrigenomics-based products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 4-month study used a mixed-methods design that included: 1) a phase 1 randomized control&#xD;
      trial that examined the effectiveness of a multi-faceted, nutrition-based gene test&#xD;
      (components assessed included the major nutrients, food tolerances, food taste and&#xD;
      preferences, and vitamins) in changing health behaviours; followed by 2) qualitative&#xD;
      investigation that explored participants' experiences. The study recruited 57 healthy males&#xD;
      and females (35-55 years) randomized as a 2:1 ratio where 38 received the intervention&#xD;
      (gene-test results plus personalized nutrition report) and 19 were assigned to the control&#xD;
      group (gene-test results report emailed). Both groups received follow-up emails with&#xD;
      nutrition-related tips and reminders. The primary outcomes of interest measures included&#xD;
      changes in diet (nutrients, healthy eating index), self-efficacy, quality of life and&#xD;
      anthropometrics (BMI, waist:hip) measured at baseline, post-intervention (3 and 6 weeks), and&#xD;
      the final visit. After the study has been completed, participants in the control group will&#xD;
      also receive their personalized nutrition report.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adults, aged 35-55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability to understand sign an informed consent and to give a buccal DNA swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to improve their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Medically stable. Subjects diagnosed with diet-related chronic disease were able to&#xD;
             enroll in the study, provided that their condition was stabilized or well controlled&#xD;
             for at least six months at the time of the baseline visit. Determination of stabilized&#xD;
             medical condition was based on established clinical guidelines (e.g., Canadian&#xD;
             Diabetes Association Clinical Guidelines and Canadian Cardiovascular Society&#xD;
             Guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Currently on a therapeutic or restrictive diet (e.g., Atkins).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of 2 or more chronic diseases or unstable chronic disease as deemed by&#xD;
             accepted clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical diagnosis of any mental health condition.&#xD;
