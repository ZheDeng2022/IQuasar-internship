  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is considered the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide and affects&#xD;
      children and women in both non-industrialized as well as industrialized countries. The main&#xD;
      regulatory molecule of iron metabolism is hepcidin, a hormone produced in the liver that&#xD;
      regulates intestinal iron absorption, placental transport, recycling of iron by macrophages&#xD;
      and release from stores. The expression of hepcidin is regulated by many mediators, one of&#xD;
      which is Matriptase-2 - a transmembrane protease. Complete loss of function leads to the rare&#xD;
      disease iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). Matriptase-2 is encoded by the gene&#xD;
      TMPRSS6 and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs855791 causes a non-synonymous&#xD;
      substitution (V736A) that reduces the activity of the protease to inhibit hepcidin&#xD;
      transcription. Genome wide association studies have identified the TMPRSS6 SNP rs855791 has a&#xD;
      strong association with red blood cell and iron parameters in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study is to measure oral iron absorption and systemic iron utilization&#xD;
      into red blood cells (RBC) using oral isotopic labels in subjects homozygotes for common&#xD;
      variants of the TMPRSS6 gene with the SNP rs855791 (A736V); AA vs. VV subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to conduct an iron absorption study in 80 Taiwanese women of reproductive age,&#xD;
      non-pregnant, non-anemic, investigating the effect of the genetic variants of the SNP&#xD;
      rs855791. The participants will be split in two groups of equal size; wild type AA vs.&#xD;
      mutation VV. Iron absorption and systemic utilization will be assessed by two test meals&#xD;
      containing stable isotopes of iron.The primary outcome of the trial is the oral iron&#xD;
      absorption from a test meal as compared between the two genotypes AA vs. VV. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are the comparison iron status markers between the two genotypes.&#xD;
