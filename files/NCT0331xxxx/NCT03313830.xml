  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle protein synthesis can be stimulated by ingestion of protein sources, such as whey,&#xD;
      casein or soy. Protein supplementation can be useful to restore protein turnover after&#xD;
      exercise but also to preserve skeletal muscle mass and function in aging adults. Ingestion of&#xD;
      large doses of essential amino acids (EAA) or certain protein supplements may be an effective&#xD;
      strategy to induce muscle protein synthesis. However, in many cases, it may not be practical&#xD;
      or feasible to consume a large volume of amino acids or protein required for an effective&#xD;
      response by muscle. Several evidences show how reduced strength and muscle mass, even in&#xD;
      early life, are predictors of early mortality which explicit the importance of developing&#xD;
      more effective methods to improve muscle quality. Therefore, identifying the better sources&#xD;
      of protein that have higher anabolic potency is of high significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the anabolic potency and efficacy of a new and novel&#xD;
      Whey Protein Hydrolysate mixture (WPH) on skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy young&#xD;
      subjects (age 20-35 yr). Previous studies on rats indicate WPH induces significant increases&#xD;
      in muscle protein synthesis compared with carbohydrates or whey-amino acid mixture. WPH&#xD;
      contains mostly peptides, which have physiological effects and could be absorbed more&#xD;
      rapidly. Preliminary data from preclinical study has also demonstrated that WPH can stimulate&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis at lower doses compared with intact whey proteins. Thus, WPH could&#xD;
      be absorbed more rapidly and may maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Although there&#xD;
      is substantial data on the individual effects of BCCA and intact protein such as whey, there&#xD;
      have been no clinical investigations that have explored the efficacy of WPH for stimulating&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose that WPH will increase muscle protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will compare the response of WHP to the response of WHEY when equal protein is provided&#xD;
      in both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 healthy subjects will be recruited and will receive both WPH and WHEY supplementation in a&#xD;
      single blind crossover design. Muscle protein synthesis will be measured on both occasions.&#xD;
      This acute study will allow to determine whether low dose WPH supplementation will be an&#xD;
      effective nutritional treatment to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in young adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis will be tested in 10 healthy young adults (20-35 yr). The subjects&#xD;
      will be studied in the post-absorptive state on two different days, during which they will&#xD;
      randomly assigned to drink a WPH or WHEY mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of muscle protein synthesis will be taken at baseline, one and three hours following&#xD;
      nutrient ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome of the proposed work is the identification of a new nutritional strategy&#xD;
      for activating skeletal muscle protein synthesis. The findings of the proposed studies will&#xD;
      have a positive impact, because they will allow us to translate this information into&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical interventions to improve muscle size, strength and function and&#xD;
      improve recovery after conditions associated with muscle wasting.&#xD;
