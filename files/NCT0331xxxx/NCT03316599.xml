      This research study is a Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial. It will test the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of an investigational drug ficlatuzumab when combined with Nab-paclitaxel and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine, with the goal of determining the maximally tolerated dose of ficlatuzumab when&#xD;
      combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ficlatuzumab is a type of drug called a &quot;monoclonal antibody.&quot; It is thought to work by&#xD;
      targeting hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which is a HGF-c-Met inhibitor. The activation of&#xD;
      the receptor tyroside kinase c-Met via its ligand, HGF, mediates proliferation, motility, and&#xD;
      differentiation in a variety of cancers including pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer&#xD;
      and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment consists of 4 week treatment cycles. Ficlatuzumab will be administered on day 1 and&#xD;
      15 of each cycle. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be administered on days 1,8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects continue in study until disease progression, adverse event/toxicity, death or either&#xD;
      the subject or sponsor discontinues the study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cytologically- or histologically-confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma or poorly&#xD;
             differentiated pancreatic carcinoma that is metastatic to distant sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other histologies such as neuroendocrine and acinar cell carcinoma are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible if they received adjuvant treatment after surgical resection&#xD;
             with single-agent gemcitabine or gemcitabine/capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin&#xD;
             that was completed &gt;12 months before enrollment. Similarly, adjuvant radiation +/-&#xD;
             chemosensitization with 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, or gemcitabine is allowed if&#xD;
             completed &gt;12 months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants are required to have measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), defined as at&#xD;
             least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
             diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with&#xD;
             spiral CT scan. See section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants enrolled must have disease that is accessible for tumor biopsies and must&#xD;
             agree to a pre-treatment tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available in&#xD;
             participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be&#xD;
             eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have completed any major surgery or open biopsy ≥4 weeks from start of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above 1.5 × upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of ficlatuzumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because Hepatocyte Growth Factor inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents&#xD;
             used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and&#xD;
             4 months after completion of ficlatuzumab administration.. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or any other investigational agents for the treatment of locally&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of any other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy, immunotherapy, or biological agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             Screening for brain metastases with head imaging is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to ficlatuzumab or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior or current synchronous malignancy, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignancy that was treated with curative intent and for which there has been no&#xD;
                  known active disease for &gt;3 years prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ, or&#xD;
                  prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, without evidence of prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing, clinically significant peripheral neuropathy, defined as CTCAE grade 2&#xD;
             or higher neurosensory or neuromotor toxicity, regardless of etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, NYHA class III/IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ficlatuzumab is hepatocyte growth&#xD;
             factor inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with ficlatuzumab, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with ficlatuzumab. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
