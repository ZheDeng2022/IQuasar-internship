  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, double blinded, randomized, clinical study investigating the effects of high&#xD;
      frequency SCS over exiting nerve roots at T9 for the treatment of chronic back or back and&#xD;
      leg pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will have two permanent stimulators placed over the exiting nerve roots at T9 at&#xD;
      the implant visit. The stimulators can easily be removed for non-responders. High frequency&#xD;
      stimulation is typically programmed below sensory threshold. This type of stimulation lends&#xD;
      itself to a placebo-controlled trial. For this study subjects will be randomized 1:1 at&#xD;
      enrollment into a high frequency or sham group. Neither the subjects nor experimenters will&#xD;
      be made aware of their randomization assignment for at least the first month of the trial.&#xD;
      Subjects belonging to both groups will be unblinded to their assignment at the 1-month or a&#xD;
      later visit (including unscheduled visit) if they have a VAS &gt; 30 mms. Subjects belonging to&#xD;
      the sham group will be reprogrammed with HF stimulation at this point. Subjects belonging to&#xD;
      the HF stimulation group will keep stimulating with HF. Subjects reporting a VAS &lt; 30 mms&#xD;
      will continue to be blinded.&#xD;
