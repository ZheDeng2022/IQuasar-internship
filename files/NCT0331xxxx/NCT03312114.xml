  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Programmed death-1 receptor ligand (PD-L1) the ligand for PD-1 is a key therapeutic target in&#xD;
      the reactivation of the immune response against multiple cancers. Pharmacologic inhibitors of&#xD;
      PD-1 have also demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity and are currently under active&#xD;
      clinical exploration. avelumab (MSB0010718C; anti-PD-L1 is a fully human anti-PD-L1 igG1&#xD;
      antibody that has shown promising efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in multiple tumor&#xD;
      types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the mainstream treatments of cancer therapy along with&#xD;
      surgery and chemotherapy, yet RT is the only treatment that does not leave the patients&#xD;
      immunocompromised (unlike chemotherapy) and keeps the dying tumor / antigen depot within the&#xD;
      host (unlike surgery), providing an opportunity for antigen presentation. Therefore, RT is a&#xD;
      rational choice to combine with immunotherapy for cancer treatment.&#xD;
