      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the relative bioavailability of sotagliflozin following single doses of 3&#xD;
      sotagliflozin prototype tablet formulations p1, p2 and p3 versus the reference tablet&#xD;
      formulation in fasted conditions in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of sotagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide&#xD;
           following single doses of 3 sotagliflozin prototype tablet formulations p1, p2 and p3&#xD;
           and of the reference formulation in fasted conditions in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical and laboratory safety of single oral doses of 3 sotagliflozin&#xD;
           prototype tablet formulations p1, p2 and p3 and the reference tablet formulation in&#xD;
           fasted conditions in healthy subjects.&#xD;

      Total duration is 37 to 75 days for each subject, with 2 to 21 days screening period; 4&#xD;
      dosing days, i.e. one in each of the 4 treatment periods. Observation period in each&#xD;
      treatment period is 6 days. Washout between dosing days is 7 to 10 days. Follow-up visit is&#xD;
      14-21 days after last dosing.&#xD;
