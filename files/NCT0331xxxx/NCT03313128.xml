  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled cohort study to assess the effect of improved sanitation on oral&#xD;
      rotavirus vaccine performance in low-income urban neighbourhoods of Maputo, Mozambique. The&#xD;
      specific hypotheses are that: (1) access to improved sanitation is associated with increased&#xD;
      oral rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity; (2) enteric infection concurrent to oral rotavirus&#xD;
      vaccination is associated with reduced oral rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity; and (3)&#xD;
      Environmental Enteric Dysfunction is associated with reduced oral rotavirus vaccine&#xD;
      immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be enrolled from the intervention and control arms of a previous&#xD;
      sanitation trial (NCT02362932) post-intervention and will be enrolled at no later than eight&#xD;
      months' gestation and then followed to 4 months of age of the infant. Blood samples and&#xD;
      faeces will be taken from the infant at the time of administration of the first dose of the&#xD;
      oral rotavirus vaccine and four weeks after the second dose of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of interest in the study is oral rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity among&#xD;
      participating vaccinated infants. Seroconversion is defined as a ≥ fourfold rise in serum&#xD;
      anti-rotavirus IgA titers between first dose of oral RV vaccine and 4 weeks (+/- 1 week)&#xD;
      after second dose of oral RV vaccine. Enteric infections are defined as the presence of ≥ 1&#xD;
      of the following enteric infections in stool: adenovirus 40/41, rotavirus A, norovirus&#xD;
      GI/GII, Salmonella spp. (including serovars Typhi and Paratyphi), Campylobacter spp. (C.&#xD;
      jejuni, C. coli, C. lari), Shigella spp. (S. boydii, S. sonnei, S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae),&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile Toxin A/B, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) LT/ST, E. coli O157,&#xD;
      Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) stx1/stx2, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio&#xD;
      cholerae, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium spp. (C. parvum, C.&#xD;
      hominis). Environmental Enteric Dysfunction is measured via a combined disease activity score&#xD;
      including faecal markers of intestinal inflammation and permeability: neopterin, α-1&#xD;
      antitrypsin, and myeloperoxidase in stool.&#xD;
