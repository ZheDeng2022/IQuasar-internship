  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the method of analysing Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
      (PET) images to assess lung inflammation. Development of novel therapeutic drugs requires a&#xD;
      biomarker which is sensitive to the underlying disease and can respond to therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions. PET is a potential imaging biomarker which can target molecular and cellular&#xD;
      processes. There is currently no standardised method of analysing PET lung data and a lack of&#xD;
      validation for the existing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is divided in to two parts. Part A aims to determine the best method to perform&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/CT lung analysis and how it correlates with cell counts from bronchoalveolar&#xD;
      lavage (BAL) samples taken from participants with active pulmonary sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will compare imaging data from healthy volunteers who have either undergone a&#xD;
      Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (whereby the lung is temporarily inflamed) or saline&#xD;
      equivalent to determine whether lung inflammation can be detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT. No&#xD;
      medications will be given and patients will not be asked to stop or change existing&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation plays an important role in a myriad of human diseases. Interstitial Lung&#xD;
      Diseases (ILDs) are characterised by widespread inflammation and represent a major burden to&#xD;
      the health sector. Imaging offers a method of assessing lung inflammation which is&#xD;
      non-invasive and may help facilitate the development of new therapeutic drugs. Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET) is a sensitive imaging modality that uses radioactive material to&#xD;
      highlight areas of disease. 18F-FDG is the most common radioactive tracer; it accumulates in&#xD;
      cells with an increased metabolic rate. Previous studies have shown that inflammatory cells&#xD;
      have an increased metabolic rate, thus PET imaging could highlight inflammation. 18F-FDG PET&#xD;
      has been used in many studies exploring lung diseases; the concentration of tracer is thought&#xD;
      to relate to the severity of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no standardised method to analyse FDG-PET scans to assess the&#xD;
      concentration of tracer in the lung (and therefore inflammation). A major challenge is&#xD;
      providing corrections to ensure that the image only represents tracer in the lung tissue.&#xD;
      Such corrections are non-trivial and affect how images are interpreted. A robust validation&#xD;
      is needed to ensure that the analysis methods used in FDG-PET images truly represent the&#xD;
      degree of lung inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of this study aims to validate and compare the different analysis methods. Pulmonary&#xD;
      sarcoidosis is a disease characterised by widespread lung inflammation. In Part A of the&#xD;
      study the investigators will recruit patients with this condition, as well as age and gender&#xD;
      matched (wherever possible) healthy volunteers. All Part A participants will receive one&#xD;
      dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. The investigators will assess the uptake of 18FDG from PET&#xD;
      images from patients with sarcoidosis versus those taken from healthy volunteers to validate&#xD;
      and assess the reliability of the analysis method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part B of the study the investigators will recruit healthy volunteers aged 50 or more. If&#xD;
      sarcoidosis patients in Part A are 50 years old or more, the age-matched HV will be recruited&#xD;
      in to Part B instead, thus potentially minimising the number of HVs that might need to be&#xD;
      recruited in to Part A of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this research study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To compare FDG-PET derived tissue inflammation measures against measures of inflammation&#xD;
      from BAL samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) To compare different models of 18F-FDG lung analysis in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) To identify whether FDG PET is sensitive enough to detect a change in inflammation&#xD;
      induced in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

    <description>PET/CT will be performed at Cambridge University Hospital's PET-CT unit, Cambridge.&#xD;
Participants in Part A of the study (sarcoidosis and HVs) will receive one PET/CT scan. A Cine-CT scan will be performed immediately prior to the 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. Settings for the CT scans will be determined by clinical protocols, radiation dose will be kept as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) consistent with UK legislation.&#xD;
After 6 hours of fasting and if blood glucose concentration is ≤11mmol/L participants will proceed to undergo an 18FDG PET/CT scan.&#xD;
18F-FDG will be administered intravenously at a dose of approximately 200 MBq.&#xD;
Positron emission scanning will involve a 60-minute dynamic acquisition from the lungs.</description>
