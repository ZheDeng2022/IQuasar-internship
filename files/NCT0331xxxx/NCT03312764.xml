  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of a digital&#xD;
      diabetes prevention program for improving weight, glucose control, and secondary risk factors&#xD;
      among people with prediabetes compared to an enhanced standard care plus wait-list control.&#xD;
      Exploratory assessments of implementation facilitators and barriers will also be completed to&#xD;
      determine strategies for integrating external diabetes-prevention interventions within&#xD;
      healthcare settings.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes is an increasingly prevalent condition, characterized by glucose levels that are&#xD;
      above normal but below the threshold for diabetes. Previous studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle interventions targeting changes in diet, physical activity, sleep, and&#xD;
      stress can reduce the risk of progressing from prediabetes to Type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes&#xD;
      Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) currently recognizes both in-person and online programs&#xD;
      that meet requirements to deliver approved curriculum, provide health coaching and group&#xD;
      support, and equip participants with behavioral skills and self-monitoring tools to support&#xD;
      behavior change. While non-randomized trial data demonstrate that an online digital program&#xD;
      was successful for producing meaningful weight loss and improved glucose control, the goal of&#xD;
      this randomized, controlled trial is to definitively evaluate the efficacy of the program for&#xD;
      improving weight, glucose control and secondary risk factors compared to current standard&#xD;
      care for prediabetes. In addition, few trials have examined the implementation factors that&#xD;
      could speed the uptake of efficacious diabetes prevention interventions for delivery in&#xD;
      regular clinical practice. Qualitative information on key organizational stakeholders (e.g.,&#xD;
      physicians, office managers) will be gathered to provide information on perceptions of the&#xD;
      online program characteristics, outcomes, and resources concurrently with strategies to&#xD;
      promote adoption and implementation in health care settings.&#xD;

    <description>This qualitative assessment will identify the overall implementation climate for a digital DPP. Key informant interviews will be used to elicit stakeholder perceptions, which will be coded for meaning and grouped into categories. The categories will then be integrated to determine possible implementation strategies for this type of program. As such, there is a single assessment that will result in multiple categories. We identified the a priori hypothetical categories, but may find additional categories and may not find perceptions that align with the current categories. This is a single section since these qualitative outcomes may be variable.&#xD;
Physician, other health professional, and administrator perceptions of:&#xD;
The value and practicality of integrating a new DPP within their facility&#xD;
Barriers to DPP sustainability&#xD;
Contextual readiness for a diabetes prevention initiative&#xD;
Factors that would facilitate implementation&#xD;
Indicators of successful implementation</description>

The class will focus on healthful eating based on the current MyPlate recommendations, guidance on gradual increases in moderate intensity physical activity, and action planning to be shared with friends and/or family. Control participants will also be given the opportunity to participate in the online digital intervention upon completion of the 12-month follow-up assessment.</description>
