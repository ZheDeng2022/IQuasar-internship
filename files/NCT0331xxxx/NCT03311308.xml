  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part in this clinical research study because they have&#xD;
      advanced, un-resectable stage III or IV Melanoma. If they participate they will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) or the combination of Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) plus&#xD;
      Metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) and the investigational drug, Metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups - either Arm A or Arm B. In Arm A,&#xD;
      patients will receive pembrolizumab alone. In Arm B, patients will receive both pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are randomized to Arm A, they will be administered pembrolizumab (200 mg), by IV,&#xD;
      every three weeks. After the first three doses, pembrolizumab dosing can be changed to 400mg&#xD;
      IV every 6 weeks, at the treating physician's discretion. Pembrolizumab can be administered&#xD;
      up to two years, if disease does not progress or have unacceptable toxicity. However, if the&#xD;
      disease progresses the patient may continue on the study if they are clinically stable or&#xD;
      clinically improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are randomized to Arm B, they will be administered pembrolizumab (200 mg), by IV,&#xD;
      every three weeks, plus metformin (500 mg), twice a day for nine weeks. Metformin will be&#xD;
      taken in the morning and evening, 12hrs apart, with food. After the first three doses,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab dosing can be changed to 400mg IV every 6 weeks, at the treating physician's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for patients who have attained a confirmed&#xD;
      complete response that have been treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab and had at&#xD;
      least two treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial complete response&#xD;
      was declared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 5 years after removal from study or until death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first, through standard of care visits, phone call or by medical records review.&#xD;
