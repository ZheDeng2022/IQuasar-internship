Dose escalation will stop if ≥2 DLTs are seen at a dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of the 6 patients at that level has a DLT. If no patient in the 3-patient cohort has a DLT and the dose level is under final consideration of the MTD, an additional three patients will be treated at that level for confirmation.</description>
