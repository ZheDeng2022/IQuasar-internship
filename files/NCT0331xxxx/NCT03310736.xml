  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, observational study to demonstrate the clinical&#xD;
      validity of the Intrinsic LifeSciences (ILS) Intrinsic Hepcidin IDx™ Test in the diagnosis&#xD;
      and management of iron deficiency (ID) in adolescents and young adults. This test is&#xD;
      considered non-significant risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is composed of two phases, and no investigational intervention&#xD;
      agent. Oral iron therapy will be recommended by each subject's primary care clinician or&#xD;
      his/her designate according to standard clinical care. There is no randomization. Subjects&#xD;
      will be screened for enrollment by study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic Testing Phase (Study Visit 1). Enrolled subjects will have a study blood draw.&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be assessed for presence of ID as defined by the reference standard:&#xD;
      ID: Ferritin &lt; 20 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will be assessed for presence of anemia as defined by: Anemia - Hemoglobin&#xD;
      ≤ 11 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those determined to have ID and/or anemia and are prescribed oral iron therapy by their&#xD;
      clinician will continue to the next phase in the study. For those without ID or anemia, or&#xD;
      who meet Observation of Treatment Phase exclusion criteria, study participation will be&#xD;
      complete. The expected duration of subject involvement for the Diagnostic Testing Phase is 1&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation of Treatment Phase (Study Visits 2 and 3). Subjects identified as having ID&#xD;
      and/or anemia and who have been prescribed oral iron therapy by their physician according to&#xD;
      standard of care, and do not meet Observation of Treatment Phase exclusion criteria, will&#xD;
      continue to the Observation of Treatment Phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal dose, frequency, and timing of oral iron therapy are unknown and are based more&#xD;
      on clinical experience than evidence. In 1998, based on expert opinion, the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control (CDC) suggested 3 mg/kg/day of elemental iron for treatment of IDA in&#xD;
      children. Patients with ID who do not have anemia (LID) should also have their iron stores&#xD;
      repleted with treatment dose iron supplement. Given the effects of acute/chronic disease on&#xD;
      serum ferritin and the dietary/diurnal variation of serum iron/TfSat, the absence of&#xD;
      biochemical evidence of ID on a single measure does not rule out ID that may respond to&#xD;
      empiric supplementation. Therefore, patients with anemia but without biochemical evidence of&#xD;
      ID (AneID) may have masked ID and treatment with a finite course of supplemental iron therapy&#xD;
      is unlikely to result in harm and may improve hemoglobin. Thus, we expect all subjects with&#xD;
      ID and/or anemia will be recommended treatment by their clinician with ferrous sulfate at&#xD;
      treatment at standard doses for adolescents and young adults of 3-5 mg elemental iron/kg/day,&#xD;
      up to a maximum of 195 mg of elemental iron per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will provide responsible clinicians with recommendations for ferrous sulfate&#xD;
      treatment along with references to relevant clinical guidelines and research. The clinicians&#xD;
      will be asked to provide the research team confirmation that the patient followed the oral&#xD;
      iron treatment recommendations. If they did not, they will be asked to indicate what&#xD;
      treatment, if any, they did advise for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who continue to the Observation of Treatment Phase will have two follow-up visits&#xD;
      and laboratory testing, including a study draw for hepcidin at each visit, to assess response&#xD;
      to oral iron supplementation at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-5 weeks (+/- 7 days) of therapy, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 weeks (+/- 7 days) of therapy.&#xD;

    <description>ILS scientists developed the bioanalytical method for quantitation of human serum hepcidin using a Beckman FX automated liquid handling platform. The method uses a competitive ELISA format that has a proprietary sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody to hepcidin that captures native hepcidin in a sample. During the reaction a competition between a synthetic, bioactive, biotinylated hepcidin tracer and native hepcidin occurs. Bound biotinylated tracer is detected with a streptavidin-HRP conjugate and TMB substrate. Quantitation is based on an eight-point standard curve using validated, synthetic hepcidin calibrators. The standard curve and the hepcidin concentrations of patients samples are calculated using 4-parameter logistic curve fitting (Prism; Graphpad, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Serum hepcidin concentrations are expressed in ng/ml serum.</description>

      Any remaining blood, serum or plasma specimens will be stored in a deidentified fashion in an&#xD;
      annotated repository at IntrinsicDX for future research on ID and anemia to be conducted by&#xD;
      the participating investigators. The key to the deidentified specimens will be held at BCH&#xD;
      and will not be shared with the sponsor. After the primary study has been published, the data&#xD;
      will be anonymized by destroying any deidentifier keys.&#xD;
