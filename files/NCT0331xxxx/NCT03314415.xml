  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether robotic assistance can help facilitate&#xD;
      adherence, engagement, and weight loss in participants enrolled in a behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      program. All participants will be enrolled in the same Web-based weight loss program and take&#xD;
      part in &quot;robotic assistance sessions&quot; either early or late in the five-week study. These&#xD;
      robotic assistance sessions involve speaking one on one with a robot about diet-related&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the start of the five-week study, all participants will be enrolled in a Web-based&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss program. The weight loss program places particular emphasis on hunger&#xD;
      reduction and craving control for both weight loss and prevention of weight regain. The&#xD;
      program will consist of six videoconference sessions delivered by a qualified coach. Menus&#xD;
      and other program materials will be available to the participants throughout the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also will be assigned to attend one-on-one &quot;robotic assistance sessions&quot; either&#xD;
      early or late in the five-week study. During each robotic assistance session, the participant&#xD;
      will speak with the robot about his/her progress with the weight loss program. The robot is&#xD;
      programmed to respond to specific issues raised by the participant, but a human operator with&#xD;
      thorough knowledge of the weight loss program will be available in case the conversation goes&#xD;
      &quot;off script.&quot; This human operator can initiate robot behaviors and prompt verbal responses&#xD;
      through a text-to-speech interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study will be used to refine the robot for future use and determine whether&#xD;
      robotic help can improve a participant's experience in a previously tested weight loss&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported eating behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, once during with-robot phase, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, consisting of 18 items, which will be used to assess eating behavior on a 4-point response scale (4=definitely true;3=mostly true;2=mostly false;1=definitely false). Responses to each of the 18 items are given a score between 1 and 4 and item scores are summed into scale scores for cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating. Total scores will be reported and higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint, uncontrolled, or emotional eating. Questionnaires are self-administered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported food cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, once during with-robot phase, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Food Cravings Questionnaire - Trait, which will be used to assess food cravings on a 6-point response scale (1=Never or NA;2=Rarely; 3=Sometimes;4=Often;5=Usually;6=Always). Responses to each of the 39 items are given a score between 1 and 6 and item scores are summed into scale scores with higher scores being indicative of greater eating pathology, body mass index (BMI), low dieting success and increases in state food craving during cognitive tasks. Total scores will be reported. Questionnaires are self-administered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, once during with-robot phase, Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the RAND 36-Item Short Form Survey, which will be used to assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. Items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.</description>

    <measure>Participant engagement with the robot</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scales, measured by the robot, will be analyzed to evaluate participant engagement during each of the ten 15-minute robotic assistance sessions that will occur over the course of two weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Robot adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Robot adherence will be measured based upon attendance to the robotic assistance sessions. Each participant will be scheduled to attend ten robotic assistance sessions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Two 24-hour periods</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake will be determined by two 24-hour diet recalls. One 24-hour recall will occur during the with-robot phase and the other will occur during the without-robot phase.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the iDiet will be measured by the number videoconference sessions attended by the participant. Each participant will be scheduled to participate in six videoconference sessions (one/week), each one hour long.</description>
