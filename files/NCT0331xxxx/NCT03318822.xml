    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the usability and tolerability of this jugular vein&#xD;
      compression device in a population of helmeted and non-helmeted competitive high school,&#xD;
      collegiate and professional athletes in the sports of football and rugby. This study differs&#xD;
      from previous work in that it is designed to capture additional data related to the athlete&#xD;
      experience wearing the jugular vein compression device in older and more elite playing&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant morbidity, mortality, and related costs are caused by traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (TBI). A simple, effective, and lightweight device worn by athletes or war fighters in the&#xD;
      field, designed to mitigate TBI resulting from blast trauma or concussive events, would save&#xD;
      lives, and the huge costs incurred for life-treatment of surviving victims. An&#xD;
      externally-worn medical device that applies mild jugular compression according to the&#xD;
      principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver (the Device) is being developed by Q30 Sports Science,&#xD;
      LLC (Q30). Preliminary research suggests that the Device has the potential to reduce the&#xD;
      likelihood of TBI. The currently developed collar has been approved for studies in humans and&#xD;
      the results indicate safety for use during high demand and maximal exertion activities.&#xD;
      Regarding safety, the externally worn collar is meticulously designed to mimic the body's own&#xD;
      omohyoid muscle actions upon the jugular veins that will provide similar pressure and volume&#xD;
      increases not to surpass that of a yawn or the mere act of just lying down. This study will&#xD;
      investigate the tolerability of this device in athletes participating in the competitive&#xD;
      sports of football and rugby at the high school, collegiate or professional levels.&#xD;
