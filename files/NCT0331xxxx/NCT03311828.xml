      This pilot phase I clinical trial studies how well copper 64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab positron&#xD;
      emission tomography works in diagnosing patients with multiple myeloma that has come back.&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures, such as copper 64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab positron emission tomography, may&#xD;
      help evaluate the extent of multiple myeloma in patients prior to the initiation of treatment&#xD;
      and ultimately monitor disease status/response during and post treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and tolerability of unlabeled daratumumab followed by&#xD;
      64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab positron emission tomography, at each dose level, by evaluation of&#xD;
      toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Generate initial estimates of the biodistribution of the 64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab and the&#xD;
      preferred dose of cold antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the dose of pre-administered unlabeled daratumumab that optimizes image quality&#xD;
      of 64Cu-anti-CD38 (daratumumab)-NHS-DOTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the sensitivity of 64Cu-anti-CD38 (daratumumab)-NHS-DOTA in detecting lesions&#xD;
      compared to 18F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 10-45 minutes, and within 6 hours,&#xD;
      patients receive copper 64Cu-DOTA-daratumumab IV on day 0. Patients undergo PET on days 1 and&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 7 days and then at 2 weeks.&#xD;
