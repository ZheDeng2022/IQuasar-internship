  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before the age of 14 years, 1% of the paediatric population will develop a seizure. The only&#xD;
      systematically required complementary examination is an electroencephalogram (EEG).&#xD;
      Additional biological or radiological examinations depend on the circumstances, the past&#xD;
      medical history of the patient and other associated symptoms or clinical signs. A seizure can&#xD;
      be the first sign of acute intoxication and represents a severity criterion. Failure to&#xD;
      detect the toxic cause of a seizure can lead to a delay in the access or administration of an&#xD;
      antidote if applicable. This can lead to target organ toxicity due to the absence of specific&#xD;
      treatment. In the current French guidelines for a first seizure, a toxicological analysis is&#xD;
      recommended if there is a possibility of exposure to toxic medications or products. However,&#xD;
      this screening is often missing, unless a witness suggests that the child may have been&#xD;
      exposed to a toxin.The recognition of a paediatric toxidrome is low among paediatricians,&#xD;
      paediatric neurologists or emergency physicians. This is due to a lack of knowledge in&#xD;
      clinical toxicology and the screening for toxic aetiology is not frequently or irrelevantly&#xD;
      prescribed. There is an increasing number of proconvulsive molecules on the market. These&#xD;
      molecules are not targeted in classic toxic screening. As result, a toxic cause of a seizure&#xD;
      may be missed unless specific screening is performed. For all these reasons, little is known&#xD;
      about the prevalence of toxic causes after a first episode of non-febrile seizure and&#xD;
      probably under estimated in the paediatric population, especially in young children. New&#xD;
      technologies for toxic detection like chromatography combined with mass spectrometry allow&#xD;
      wide screening on different matrix. Initially dedicated to forensic analysis, they are more&#xD;
      widely accessible for the exploration of the patients. The CASTox study is based on this&#xD;
      context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim will be to evaluate the prevalence of a toxicological cause by a systematic&#xD;
      blood and urine screening of children admitted to Toulouse paediatric emergency unit for a&#xD;
      first afebrile seizure. Moreover, secondary aim will be to describe the effect of the&#xD;
      systematic screening on the management of the children.&#xD;

      Before the age of 14 years, 1% of the paediatric population will develop a seizure. The only&#xD;
      systematically required complementary examination is an electroencephalogram (EEG).&#xD;
      Additional biological or radiological examinations depend on the circumstances, the past&#xD;
      medical history of the patient and other associated symptoms or clinical signs. A seizure can&#xD;
      be the first sign of acute intoxication and represents a severity criterion. Failure to&#xD;
      detect the toxic cause of a seizure can lead to a delay in the access or administration of an&#xD;
      antidote if applicable. This can lead to target organ toxicity due to the absence of specific&#xD;
      treatment. In the current French guidelines for a first seizure, a toxicological analysis is&#xD;
      recommended if there is a possibility of exposure to toxic medications or products. However,&#xD;
      this screening is often missing, unless a witness suggests that the child may have been&#xD;
      exposed to a toxin.The recognition of a paediatric toxidrome is low among paediatricians,&#xD;
      paediatric neurologists or emergency physicians. Since the end of the 90s, the molecules&#xD;
      usually incriminated with seizure onset after intoxication are: with a high risk (polycyclic&#xD;
      antidepressant, theophylline, isoniazid); intermediate risk (fluoroquinolones, tramadol,&#xD;
      lidocaine, lithium, anticonvulsive medications) and low risk (selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors). Among infants, the molecules are quite different mainly because of the&#xD;
      unintentional or malicious aspect of the intoxication and are dominated by sympathomimetic&#xD;
      agents, antihistamine drugs, anticholinergic molecules, antidepressants and muscle relaxants.&#xD;
      New drugs have been associated with seizures in young intoxicated children like bupropion,&#xD;
      tramadol and venlafaxine. These agents are not detected by usual toxic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient and after getting the signed consent form, a toxicological analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on blood and urine samples to extensively screen for proconvulsive molecules&#xD;
      (alcohols, polycyclic antidepressants, salicylates, anticonvulsive medications&#xD;
      (carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid), drugs (cocaine and its metabolites, amphetamines,&#xD;
      methamphetamine (ecstasy), cannabis, buprenorphine, methadone, mephedrone, codeine,&#xD;
      pholcodine, hydromorphone), benzodiazepines, caffeine, theophylline, lidocaine, isoniazid,&#xD;
      mefenamic acid, tramadol, ephedrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This analysis will be performed using classic approach (immunoenzymatic detection) and by&#xD;
      chromatography (GC) associated to mass spectrometry (MS) (Laboratory of Toxicology,&#xD;
      University Hospital of Toulouse) - The other clinical data, biological results or tests&#xD;
      requested by the physician in charge will be reported from the computerized medical file of&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient hospitalized, a follow-up visit will be scheduled during hospitalization in&#xD;
      order to report management of the children.&#xD;
