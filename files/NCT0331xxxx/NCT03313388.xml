    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of tart cherry juice consumption on endurance exercise&#xD;
      performance, fat metabolism during exercise, blood pressure, and recovery from exercise as&#xD;
      assessed by muscle pain, muscle strength and electrical properties of muscle. Comparisons&#xD;
      will be made to Gatorade consumption. Participants include those who are moderately active&#xD;
      and have experience with cycling.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tart cherries are rich in bioactive components (i.e. flavonoids) that have anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      and anti-oxidant properties. Inflammation and lipid peroxidation causes damage of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle membranes during intense exercise. The damage of muscle increases the amount of time&#xD;
      for muscle to recover from intense exercise, and can cause muscle strength to be reduced for&#xD;
      days. When tart cherries in a concentrated form (i.e. as juice or powder) are consumed in the&#xD;
      days leading up to intense exercise, there is a protective effect against inflammation, and&#xD;
      lipid peroxidation . This theoretically prevents damage to the lipid component of muscle&#xD;
      fibre membranes and helps to preserve muscle function - when muscle is damaged by intense&#xD;
      exercise (i.e. either repetitive aerobic activity or high-force muscle contraction),&#xD;
      consumption of cherry juice enhances the rate of muscle strength recovery following exercise&#xD;
      compared to when a placebo (i.e. non-cherry) beverage is consumed . Muscle damage may be&#xD;
      protected by cherry juice consumption; however, all studies evaluating the protective effect&#xD;
      of cherries have assessed muscle damage by measuring muscle proteins in the blood. This&#xD;
      rather indirect measure of muscle damage is highly variable and not always an accurate&#xD;
      assessment of muscle damage; this may be why some studies indicate a reduction in markers of&#xD;
      muscle damage with cherry juice consumption while others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more direct assessment of muscle damage can be obtained by applying electrical stimulation&#xD;
      at different frequencies to a muscle before and after intense exercise and assessing the&#xD;
      reduction in force output in response to low-frequency and high-frequency stimulation. After&#xD;
      intense exercise, the force output at low frequencies of stimulation is often reduced, while&#xD;
      the force output at high frequencies is maintained; a phenomenon termed &quot;low frequency&#xD;
      fatigue&quot;. When muscle is stimulated to contract (either voluntarily by the nervous system or&#xD;
      involuntarily through electrical stimulation) calcium is released inside muscle. This calcium&#xD;
      release leads to muscle contraction. When muscle undergoes intense exercise, there is damage&#xD;
      to muscle membranes, including membranes inside muscle that are responsible for calcium&#xD;
      release. This causes a lower amount of calcium to be released with each muscle contraction.&#xD;
      Normally, if high frequencies of electrical stimulation are applied to muscle, a very large&#xD;
      amount of calcium is released inside muscle - an amount which is &quot;more than enough&quot; to cause&#xD;
      a high amount of muscle contraction and high force output. If muscle fibre membranes&#xD;
      responsible for release of calcium are damaged, a lower amount of calcium is released, but&#xD;
      because &quot;more than enough&quot; calcium is usually released with high frequency stimulation, the&#xD;
      lower amount of calcium released with muscle damage is still enough to cause high force of&#xD;
      muscle contraction. The force response to low frequencies of stimulation; however, is&#xD;
      dramatically reduced when muscle is damaged - usually only a small amount of calcium is&#xD;
      released when low frequencies of stimulation are delivered to muscle. Following muscle&#xD;
      damage, the smaller amount of calcium released causes lower force production at low&#xD;
      stimulation frequency. Low force production at low stimulation frequencies, with a relatively&#xD;
      maintained force production at high stimulation frequencies therefore indicates that muscle&#xD;
      damage has occurred. This lower muscle force capability at low frequencies of stimulation has&#xD;
      dramatic effects on endurance performance because typical endurance performance relies on&#xD;
      repeated low-force muscle contractions, as opposed to the few high-force contractions that&#xD;
      might be required in other sports (i.e. short sprinting events or field events such as shot&#xD;
      put).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study we are proposing will use this measurement (i.e. ratio of low frequency force to&#xD;
      high frequency force output) as a more direct measure of muscle damage. We predict that if&#xD;
      cherry juice is consumed in the days leading up to a bout of muscle-damaging endurance&#xD;
      exercise, muscle damage will be lower (as indicated by a faster recovery of low-frequency&#xD;
      fatigue following the bout of exercise) than when a comparison-drink (i.e. Gatorade) is&#xD;
      consumed.&#xD;
