  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated virus&#xD;
      vector (rAAV2tYF-GRK1-RPGR) in patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa caused by RPGR&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes a non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1/2 dose escalation portion, and a&#xD;
      Phase 2 randomized, controlled, masked dose expansion portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 participants will be enrolled into the dose escalation portion of the study.&#xD;
      Each participant will receive the study agent by subretinal injection in one eye on a single&#xD;
      occasion. Enrollment will begin with the lowest dose and will proceed to higher doses only&#xD;
      after review of safety data by a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Within groups 1&#xD;
      through 3 and 5 and 6, enrollment of participants will be staggered by at least 2 weeks to&#xD;
      allow adequate time for review of safety information by the investigators and sponsor. Within&#xD;
      Group 4, enrollment of the first 3 pediatric participants will be staggered by at least 2&#xD;
      weeks to allow adequate time for review of safety information by the investigators and&#xD;
      sponsor. Study agent administration will occur on Day 0. There are a total of 15 visits over&#xD;
      approximately 36 months, and long-term follow-up evaluations annually at years 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the phase 1/2 portion of the study is completed, approximately 12 participants, who&#xD;
      were not part of the Phase 1/2 portion of the study, will be enrolled into the dose expansion&#xD;
      portion of the study. These participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment groups (i.e., Group 1 [low dose] and Group 2 [high dose]). Each participant will&#xD;
      receive the assigned dose of AGTC-501 in one eye on a single occasion.&#xD;
