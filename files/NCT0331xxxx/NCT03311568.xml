  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is (1) to test and further develop a new non-invasive ultrasound method,&#xD;
      and (2) to gain new insight into microcirculatory alterations during critical disease,&#xD;
      particularly in critical septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although early identification and treatment of sepsis have had top priority among the working&#xD;
      tasks of the international 'Surviving Sepsis Campaign' society (collaboration of the Society&#xD;
      of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) for several&#xD;
      years, which have led to improved survival over the last two decades, there is no objective&#xD;
      validated diagnostic test to identify or to support the clinical diagnosis at an early stage.&#xD;
      Analogous, there is no validated monitoring system available to guide and evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of stabilizing measurements in sepsis, or other critical disease, at the&#xD;
      microcirculatory level. And thus, there is an enormous knowledge gap regarding dynamic&#xD;
      changes at the microcirculatory level during sepsis and other critical disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal with this study is to investigate the robustness of this new US-technology, regarding&#xD;
      its ability to identify and monitor critical microcirculatory impairment during critical&#xD;
      disease. The investigators believe this technology may improve early diagnosis and thus early&#xD;
      initiation of adequate treatment in septic shock. Its mobile and non-invasive qualities, as&#xD;
      in most ultrasound methods, substantiate its availability to a wide range of clinical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical disease, e.g. life threatening septic shock triggered from infections with&#xD;
      multiorgan failure, demands aggressive medical treatment in specialized intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICU). Incidences and mortality of sepsis vary significant, depending on regional medical&#xD;
      culture, diagnostic criteria and the time span and method of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common clinical appearance of critical disease is often life threatening low blood pressure,&#xD;
      impaired consciousness up to coma, abnormal breathing patterns, and then subsequently&#xD;
      secondary organ failures which further increases mortality. The influence of these&#xD;
      'macro-haemodynamic symptoms', i.e. physiologic aberrations that can be assessed using&#xD;
      standard patient monitoring systems, on the tissue micro-circulation where organ damage and&#xD;
      finally cell death occurs, is only indirectly available for assessment. Basically, the coarse&#xD;
      therapeutic approach to circulatory shock is to normalize macro-haemodynamic parameters,&#xD;
      without any robust method to evaluate and monitor micro-circulatory effects. Thus, following&#xD;
      current guidelines and clinical practice, it is sometimes not known for sure, on an&#xD;
      individual basis, whether treatment and stabilization measures increase survival chances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of the microcirculation have been performed using invasive micro-dialysis, direct&#xD;
      orthogonal polarization spectral imaging and direct side-stream dark-field microscopy. The&#xD;
      wide use of these methods is challenged by the fact that they are very expensive and demand&#xD;
      extended operator expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think there is sufficient evidence to claim that further improvement in&#xD;
      early diagnostic and therapy guidance of sepsis, septic shock and other critical disease,&#xD;
      depends on increased knowledge of microcirculatory alterations, and widespread affordable&#xD;
      technical solutions to detect and monitor the course of sepsis and other critical disease at&#xD;
      the microcirculatory level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU), Department of Circulation and&#xD;
      Medical Imaging (ISB), new ultrasound technology has been developed by Professor Hans Torp,&#xD;
      which may offer an operator-independent, affordable and non-invasive method to evaluate&#xD;
      microcirculation in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, ultrasound is unique in that sense that it facilitates non-invasive imaging of&#xD;
      anatomy and physiology. The unique with this new probe is the emittance of ultrasound waves&#xD;
      from the whole cross-section of the probe surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the expected spectrum of microcirculatory impairment during different stages of&#xD;
      sepsis, septic shock and comparable critical disease, firstly US registrations are needed&#xD;
      from persons with known normal microcirculation. Then, registrations of normal&#xD;
      microcirculation are needed in persons exposed to increasing amounts of circulatory stress.&#xD;
      Finally, microcirculatory conditions will be observed in patients with critical septic shock.&#xD;
      Thus, firstly healthy volunteers are included, then stabile patients undergoing major planned&#xD;
      surgery, and finally patients in critical septic shock demanding advanced intensive care&#xD;
      treatment and monitoring.&#xD;
