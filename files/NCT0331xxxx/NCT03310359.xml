  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Astaxanthin is a natural compound, present in many foodstuffs and available as a nutritional&#xD;
      supplement that has been shown to have beneficial effects on many of the features of insulin&#xD;
      resistance/glucose intolerance, at least in animals. The goal of this project is to provide a&#xD;
      validation of astaxanthin effects on metabolic regulation in humans and their mechanism(s) of&#xD;
      action, to determine if astaxanthin could have any value as a &quot;neutraceutical&quot; to help&#xD;
      improve regulation of glucose and fat metabolism in subjects with insulin resistance/ glucose&#xD;
      intolerance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Astaxanthin is a molecule of the carotenoid class that is abundant in marine animals and&#xD;
      plants, with the algae Haematococcus pluvialis being a particularly rich source. Astaxanthin&#xD;
      is a potent anti-oxidant with a unique property of being able to insert into membranes and&#xD;
      lipid bilayers. Astaxanthin has also been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent. As&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation are present in individuals with insulin resistance,&#xD;
      astaxanthin offers promise as a potential therapeutic for this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of formulations of astaxanthin that are available for use in humans. With&#xD;
      regard to controlled studies in humans, astaxanthin has been given at doses as high as 40&#xD;
      mg/day for periods from 2 to 12 weeks. Improvements in inflammation and oxidative stress were&#xD;
      frequently observed. With regard to metabolic regulation, improvements have been seen in HDL&#xD;
      and LDL levels, while others have found no changes. Glucose and insulin levels appear to be&#xD;
      unaltered: This lack of effect may be due to only healthy, though in some cases overweight or&#xD;
      obese, subjects being studied. In none of these studies, were any abnormal safety lab values&#xD;
      or adverse events reported. One of the intents of the current project is to perform more&#xD;
      detailed metabolic characterization of astaxanthin treatment effects in research participants&#xD;
      with insulin resistance/glucose intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp procedure (HEC) will be used to assess insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and responsiveness by measuring glucose disposal rate (GDR). Investigators will&#xD;
      also perform Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTT), indirect calorimetry (IDC), and 24 hour&#xD;
      measurement of ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM).&#xD;
