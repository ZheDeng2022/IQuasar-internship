             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator and heart surgery team, the patient is not an&#xD;
             appropriate candidate for surgery, and the use of the ARTO System is technically&#xD;
             feasible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates will be excluded from enrollment in the study if ANY of the following conditions&#xD;
        apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the femoral vein and internal jugular vein cannot&#xD;
             accommodate a 16 F catheter or the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter&#xD;
             would interfere with advancement of the catheter or ipsilateral DVT is present&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hemodynamic instability (systolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg without afterload reduction or&#xD;
             cardiogenic shock or the need for inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon pump)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior mitral valve surgery or valvuloplasty or any currently implanted prosthetic&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  In the judgment of the Investigator, patients in whom the presence of a permanent&#xD;
             pacemaker or pacing leads would interfere with placement of the test device or the&#xD;
             placement of the test device would disrupt the leads&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Irreversible bleeding disorder, history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or&#xD;
             refuses blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
