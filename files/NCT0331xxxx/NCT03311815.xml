      NGS studies will be done in stem cell leukemic population. The analysis of the samples to the&#xD;
      diagnosis will be carried out using the 26 consensus genes: ASXL1 had, CBL, CEBPA, DNMT3A,&#xD;
      EZH2, FLT3, GATA2, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, MPL, MLL, NPM1, NRAS, PTPN11, RUNX1, SETBP1,&#xD;
      SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, WT1. Regarding the 26 genes panel, it would have the&#xD;
      advantage that the quantification of DNA from each sample will be carried out by fluorimetry&#xD;
      using the AmpliSeq or TruSeq on Ion platforms torrent Proton or MySeq are handled in&#xD;
      different laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using NGS techniques the investigator will detect the recurrently mutated genes in AML to&#xD;
      establish the biological role of each mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular characterization of the 700 samples which are estimated to pick up during the&#xD;
      project will consist of massive sequencing of genes recurrently mutated in AML (ASXL1, had,&#xD;
      CBL, CEBPA, DNMT3A, EZH2, FLT3, GATA2, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KIT, KRAS, MPL, MLL, NPM1, NRAS,&#xD;
      PTPN11, RUNX1, SETBP1, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, WT1). Found mutations will be&#xD;
      collated in the different databases of somatic variations to establish which of them could be&#xD;
      classified as a driver or passenger.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients diagnosed with AML (new diagnosis or relapsed/refractory disease) can be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to establish a platform for comprehensive diagnostic and research platform&#xD;
      in the context of the Spanish PETHEMA cooperative group, constituted by 80 institutions and&#xD;
      seven central laboratories with extensive technological capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study. It will be performed in 7&#xD;
      central laboratories (Hospital Universitario la Fe, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca,&#xD;
      Hospital 12 de Octubre, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocío, Hospital Reina Sofía,&#xD;
      Hospital Dr. Negrín and Clínica Universidad de Navarra) from the spanish PETHEMA group that&#xD;
      will receive and process bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from AML patients at&#xD;
      diagnosis and at resistance or first and subsequent relapses. In parallel, all patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the ongoing PETHEMA epidemiologic registry of AML with a large number of&#xD;
      clinical data however no safety information/Adverse Events about drug treatments will be&#xD;
      collected. Currently, the PETHEMA group is reporting 600 newly diagnosed patients per year&#xD;
      and accounts for 5000 cases in the data-base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the investigator will analyze 450 samples from 450 newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients that will participate in this study in a period of 2 years (225 per year). This&#xD;
      means that roughly 40% of all AML patients from the PETHEMA group institutions will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, other 250 samples from relapsing/refractory patients will be included in 2&#xD;
      years. Of these 250 samples form relapsing/refractory patients, it is expected that 150&#xD;
      samples will be drawn from patients in whom the sample was already analyzed at diagnosis in&#xD;
      the current study, and 100 samples will be drawn form 100 additional patients that were not&#xD;
      previously included in the study at the initial diagnosis. So, the expected distribution of&#xD;
      analyzed samples will be: 450 at diagnosis, 150 resampling at first relapse from patients&#xD;
      already analyzed at diagnosis, and 100 samples at first or subsequent relapse from patients&#xD;
      not included in the study at the time of diagnosis. The investigator expect at least 500&#xD;
      patients and 700 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular diagnosis by NGS will be rapidly reported to the treating physician (&lt;48-72 hours),&#xD;
      in order to facilitate inclusion of patients in potential targeted therapy trials in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the analysis of leukemic cells in samples from a large cohort of patients treated&#xD;
      homogeneously, it is intended to delve into the prognostic value of genetic lesions that are&#xD;
      observed at diagnosis by means of a large panel of mutations by next-generation sequencing.&#xD;
      Thanks to this ambitious cooperative study, the investigator will be in an unprecedented and&#xD;
      novel situation to understand the cellular mechanisms associated with chemoresistance of&#xD;
      leukemic cells. This could allow us to design new therapeutic strategies of personalized&#xD;
      medicine that will be able to eradicate these cells with minimal toxic effects on patients&#xD;
      with AML.&#xD;
