  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding is recommended as the ideal form of nutrition for newborns and infants at least&#xD;
      for the first 6 months of life by several Institutions such as the American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When breastfeeding is not possible or not desirable, bottle-feeding, in most cases using a&#xD;
      proper infant formula, is the right alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both facial and cranial growth and development rely on genetic and external stimuli; the&#xD;
      latter are provided also by activities of sucking, swallowing and chewing. Considering this,&#xD;
      it is important to show the differences between the activities of the muscles (masseter,&#xD;
      temporalis and buccinator) in charge of sucking during breastfeeding or bottle-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activities of the muscles were evaluated through SLI, which consists of the assessment of&#xD;
      muscle functioning by analyzing the displacement of a defined point on a given muscle. This&#xD;
      displacement is tracked over time with respect to a fixed frame of reference, thus providing&#xD;
      velocity data (i.e. speed) for a certain point on the muscle during muscle contraction. The&#xD;
      use of SLI allowed us to determine the activity of oral muscles on the different types of&#xD;
      feeding and to compare their strength and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal aims of the present study was to assess the activity of the orbicularis oris muscle&#xD;
      (OM) and of the masseter, temporalis and buccinator muscles (MM, TM and BM) (i.e. the muscles&#xD;
      in charge of sucking during breastfeeding) during breastfeeding and bottle-feeding by means&#xD;
      of SLI. The new Chicco feeding bottles Natural Feeling (Natural Fit) 0m+, 4m+ and 6m+ were&#xD;
      used according to the age of the infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the following parameters were evaluated comparing breastfeeding and bottle-feeding:&#xD;
      feeding efficiency (measured as ml/minute milk intake considering an interval of 15 minutes)&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation during feeding (assessed by pulse oximetry). Moreover colic-like&#xD;
      symptoms over 9 weeks (0 to 4 weeks infant only) were evaluated through the Infant Colic&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By means of SLI technique positive preliminary results as regards comparison between bottle&#xD;
      feeding with the New Chicco Bottles and breastfeeding were reached; these results allow to&#xD;
      conclude that, considering feeding features related to growth and development, bottle-feeding&#xD;
      with the new Chicco bottles can biomimic the suction muscular dynamics of breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proper growth is confirmed in bottle-feeding groups also by means of evaluations of growth&#xD;
      parameters, and it is guaranteed by the evaluation of the oxygen saturation during feeding,&#xD;
      that is similar among groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards evaluation of colic underlying causes in infants ages 0-4 weeks it is possible to&#xD;
      state that no differences were found in bottle-fed and breastfed infants: given the lack of&#xD;
      differences between the groups, whichever the underlying reason for colic symptomatology&#xD;
      could exist, it is possible to infer that using one or the other kind of feeding does not&#xD;
      have an impact on symptoms, or had a minor one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards the product satisfaction evaluated comparing the bottle-fed groups positive&#xD;
      results were reached in all the evaluation, at V2, Week 5 and Week 9, reaching always a mean&#xD;
      score &gt; 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the positive results above outlined a confirmatory study, envisaging a bigger&#xD;
      sample size, it is advisable, to confirm and emphasize the results already achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each trial participant the adverse events/serious adverse events occurrences and a brief&#xD;
      clinical examination were assessed during Visits. No special or unusual features of the&#xD;
      safety evaluations were found.&#xD;
