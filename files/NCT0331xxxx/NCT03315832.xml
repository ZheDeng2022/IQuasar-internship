  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, with&#xD;
      increasing prevalence. Recent guidelines recommend aortic valve intervention (surgical aortic&#xD;
      valve replacement [SAVR] or transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR]) in severe AS, as&#xD;
      soon as symptoms or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction occur, in order to improve clinical&#xD;
      outcome and achieve LV mass (LVM) regression. The highest amount of LVM regression is&#xD;
      obtained during the first year. Nevertheless, there is heterogeneity in LV remodeling and&#xD;
      residual LV hypertrophy is associated with poorer postoperative improvement in cardiac&#xD;
      function and morphology. Incomplete regression of LV hypertrophy at 12 months after SAVR is a&#xD;
      powerful predictor of adverse outcome. Yet, the use of specific pharmacological therapy to&#xD;
      improve postoperative LVM regression could be an appealing therapeutic option after aortic&#xD;
      valve intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (RAASb) and more particularly angiotensin-II&#xD;
      receptor blockers (ARBs) are efficient in reducing LVM in hypertensive patients, as&#xD;
      emphasized by several meta-analyses. In addition, ARBs improve myocardial relaxation,&#xD;
      diastolic function, decreased hypertrophy and may have anti-fibrotic effects. In a recent&#xD;
      retrospective study from our group, RAASb prescription after SAVR was associated with&#xD;
      increased survival, but confirmation through a randomized trial is mandatory. In a&#xD;
      prospective randomized single-center study, the use of candesartan was associated both with&#xD;
      LV and LA remodeling as compared to the conventional management. Nevertheless, these results&#xD;
      are based on echocardiographic data, which is not the gold standard for the assessment&#xD;
      cardiac remodeling, and no placebo or active comparator was tested to control the impact of&#xD;
      ARBs in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this Phase II study is to investigate the efficacy of valsartan,&#xD;
      introduced postoperatively, as compared to placebo, on 1-year changes in indexed LVM, as&#xD;
      assessed by CMR, in patients undergoing aortic valve intervention (SAVR or TAVR) for AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare the efficacy of valsartan vs. placebo in terms of&#xD;
      one-year changes (difference from baseline) in cardiac function and in cardiac morphology,&#xD;
      one-year exercise capacity and one-year changes in biomarkers related to cardiac function. In&#xD;
      addition, the assessment of the safety of valsartan will also be considered as secondary&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARISTOTE trial is a multicenter prospective phase II, randomized, double-blind study&#xD;
      including patients with the diagnosis of severe AS and indication for valve intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active treatment is valsartan, an orally active, potent, and specific angiotensin II&#xD;
      receptor antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized between 2 groups (valsartan versus placebo) and the treatment&#xD;
      will be initiated (80 mg daily) at 5±4 days following aortic valve intervention. The&#xD;
      comparative treatment will be a placebo; tablets of valsartan and placebo have a similar&#xD;
      appearance and administration mode. Patient in the control group will receive a placebo using&#xD;
      the same protocol as the valsartan group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be cautiously monitored and any adverse events will be collected. The dose&#xD;
      will be increased at 160 mg daily 13±2 days after aortic valve intervention and, if well&#xD;
      tolerated, for the remaining period of the study. The tolerance will be regularly assessed&#xD;
      and dose adjusted according to a pre-specified algorithm.&#xD;
