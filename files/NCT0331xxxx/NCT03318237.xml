      Epilepsy affects a significant number of children in the United States. The majority of&#xD;
      patients achieve control of their seizures by conventional treatment strategies including&#xD;
      medications. However, one third of patients do not achieve satisfactory seizure control with&#xD;
      medications alone. Ketogenic diet and lifestyle modifications may also be tried. In some of&#xD;
      these children, the seizure focus can be localized to one area of the brain and the seizures&#xD;
      are resistant to conservative treatment strategies. These children may have subtle&#xD;
      structural/developmental abnormalities in their brain, the most frequent of which is focal&#xD;
      cortical dysplasia. These are localized areas of abnormal lamination of the cerebral cortex&#xD;
      that can be extremely subtle and difficult to detect, even with state of the art magnetic&#xD;

      1. Abstract Epilepsy affects a significant number of children in the United States. The&#xD;
           majority of patients achieve control of their seizures by conventional treatment&#xD;
           strategies including medications. However, one third of patients do not achieve&#xD;
           satisfactory seizure control with medications alone. Ketogenic diet and lifestyle&#xD;
           modifications may also be tried. In some of these children, the seizure focus can be&#xD;
           localized to one area of the brain and the seizures are resistant to conservative&#xD;
           treatment strategies. These children may have subtle structural/developmental&#xD;
           abnormalities in their brain, the most frequent of which is focal cortical dysplasia.&#xD;
           These are localized areas of abnormal lamination of the cerebral cortex that can be&#xD;
           extremely subtle and difficult to detect, even with state of the art magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI). More importantly, these lesions may be amenable to surgical resection&#xD;
           resulting in marked decrease in frequency or even resolution of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality without ionizing radiation that has played a&#xD;
           central role in the assessment of anatomy, physiology/pathophysiology of children with&#xD;
           epilepsy. It is particularly useful in children with refractory focal epilepsy. Prior&#xD;
           studies have shown that high resolution, high-field (3T) MR imaging of the brain helps&#xD;
           to identify subtle focal epileptogenic abnormalities, including focal cortical&#xD;
           dysplasia, in some patients. However, there is scarce data directly comparing the&#xD;
           performance of ultra high-field (7T) MRI, currently an investigative technique offering&#xD;
           optimized contrast and signal-to-noise rations and superior spatial resolution, with&#xD;
           clinically available 3T MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ultra high-field (7T) MR imaging&#xD;
           improves detection and characterization of subtle structural epileptogenic abnormalities&#xD;
           in children with focal epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The importance of this research is that identification of a focal epileptogenic lesion&#xD;
           in children with refractory epilepsy has fundamental management implications, as&#xD;
           surgical removal of such lesion may dramatically improve outcomes and the chance of&#xD;
           seizure freedom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objectives of Investigators' project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To evaluate the performance of 7T MRI in detecting structural abnormalities in children&#xD;
           who have had 3T MRI-negative focal epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To characterize conventional and advanced neuroimaging features of epileptogenic lesions&#xD;
           such as cortical dysplasias and neuroglial tumors at 7T MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Background High-resolution brain MRI is currently an integral component in the&#xD;
           diagnostic evaluation of children with focal epilepsy. When focal epileptogenic&#xD;
           abnormalities are identified, such as cortical dysplasia, the management strategy&#xD;
           includes evaluation for potential surgical resection, which may dramatically improve&#xD;
           outcome. The current clinical state of the art of 3T MRI has superior sensitivity over&#xD;
           conventional 1.5T MRI. However focal cortical dysplasia remains one of the most common&#xD;
           pathological diagnoses after pediatric epilepsy surgery, even when not detected by&#xD;
           current MRI exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures. The&#xD;
                investigators plan to perform 7T brain MRI in children with the diagnosis of&#xD;
                epilepsy and findings on EEG suggestive of a focal structural abnormality. The 7T&#xD;
                MRI exams will be performed at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) as part of their&#xD;
                outpatient evaluation. The investigators plan to accrue approximately 50&#xD;
                participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Before recruiting children with epilepsy, approximately 2-10 healthy adult&#xD;
                volunteers will be recruited for the purpose of optimizing the imaging acquisition&#xD;
                protocol. These adults will be consented using a separate consent form, also&#xD;
                attached to this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Children will be eligible if they have already had a 3T MRI examination and do not&#xD;
                have any contraindications to MR examinations. A consent form signed by the&#xD;
                patients' parent/legal care giver will be required to indicate agreement to&#xD;
                participate in the study. In addition, a consent form signed by the patient (if&#xD;
                over 15 year of age) or an assent form signed by the patient (if between 8-15 years&#xD;
                of age) will be required to indicate agreement to participate. Patient charts will&#xD;
                be reviewed for history and diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants. The&#xD;
                anticipated duration of this study will be 2-5 years beginning in April 2017. The&#xD;
                7T MRI exam will be performed in a single visit. This project may involve one&#xD;
                additional trip to the hospital for patient subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if&#xD;
                applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
                N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have&#xD;
                current therapy stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
                N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group. N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria. Removal criteria&#xD;
                will be defined as participants who are unable to tolerate the MR procedure due to&#xD;
                previously unknown claustrophobia, inability to tolerate lying still for the exam&#xD;
                period, or due to presence of ferromagnetic implants preventing imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if&#xD;
                a participant's participation in the study ends prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not applicable. This is not a treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and management will be implemented with the following guidelines to ensure&#xD;
      their confidentiality and safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Confidentiality of Data: A master list separate from data forms that have only a study&#xD;
           number will be used to maintain confidentiality of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Security: The master list and backup copy will both be kept only on secure Johns Hopkins&#xD;
           computers. Only de-identified data will be stored on a non-Johns Hopkins personal&#xD;
           computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anonymization: The identifiers will be destroyed after publication. The other data will&#xD;
           be retained for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Confidentiality: All data and records generated during this study will be kept&#xD;
           confidential in accordance with Institutional policies and HIPAA on subject privacy and&#xD;
           that the Investigator and other site personnel will not use such data and records for&#xD;
           any purpose other than conducting the study. Safeguards are described under Data&#xD;
           Collection and Management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Inclusion Criteria i. Male or female children between 6-21 years of age undergoing an&#xD;
           MRI for focal epilepsy at the Johns Hopkins Hospital OR ii. Adult healthy volunteer.&#xD;
           iii. Willing to undergo an additional MRI exam in the 7T scanner at Kennedy Krieger&#xD;
           Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Exclusion Criteria i. Presence of any contraindication to MR examinations as defined&#xD;
           by MRI Safety Screening Sheet ii. History of Metal in the Skull/Eyes iii. Pregnancy at&#xD;
           the time of the scan iv. Patient subjects in unstable clinical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Only patients with a clinical indication for brain MRI examination will undergo 7T&#xD;
                MRI. All examinations will be performed without intravenous contrast and in an&#xD;
                outpatient setting, without the need for deep sedation or general anesthesia.&#xD;
                Although classified by FDA as an investigational device, the 7T MR system has been&#xD;
                ruled as a non-significant risk device by the same agency. This finding is&#xD;
                stipulated in Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff --Criteria for Significant Risk&#xD;
                Investigations of Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices issued July 14, 2003. A&#xD;
                copy of the ruling has been uploaded in Section 3.0 for your review. In well over&#xD;
                1000 studies done at 7T in the last decade at multiple institutions (University of&#xD;
                Minnesota, Massachusetts General Hospital, NIH), no significant risks have been&#xD;
                found. Some subjects have experienced dizziness. A potential concern with MR&#xD;
                studies at high fields is radiofrequency heating due to radiofrequency power&#xD;
                deposition in the subject. The FDA has set strict guidelines to guard against this&#xD;
                risk. Such power deposition increases with the square of the magnetic field&#xD;
                strength. However, even at 7T it is possible to stay well within these guidelines,&#xD;
                especially with the pulse sequences the investigators will employ. To be 100% sure&#xD;
                of compliance with FDA guidelines, the software of the manufacturer monitors power&#xD;
                deposition continuously and scans are not possible to implement if the power&#xD;
                deposition would exceed guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Documents have been uploaded in Section 3.0 regarding federal guidelines supporting&#xD;
                the position that a 7 Tesla MR scanner represents no significant risk to human&#xD;
                subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Theoretical concepts and prior clinical studies justify the interest in applying&#xD;
                high-resolution, ultra high-field MRI as a tool to evaluate detailed brain anatomy&#xD;
                and physiology in children with focal epilepsy. Most studies comparing the&#xD;
                diagnostic yield of 3T versus 1.5T imaging in detecting structural lesions in&#xD;
                patients with focal epilepsy reached positive conclusions concerning the rates of&#xD;
                newly detected lesions at 3T Very few comparative studies have investigated the&#xD;
                diagnostic yield of 7T with respect to conventional MRI, however these included&#xD;
                both examinations performed at 1.5T and at 3T.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The employment of 7T MRI provides superior capability in characterizing anatomical&#xD;
                and physiological brain parameters. In collaboration with MR physicists affiliated&#xD;
                with Johns Hopkins and with Kennedy Krieger Institute, our imaging acquisition&#xD;
                protocol should include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  High-resolution anatomical sequences, such as volumetric T1-weighted MP2RAGE&#xD;
                     and 2D gray-white tissue border enhancement (TBE) Fast Spin Echo&#xD;
                     (FSE)-Inversion Recovery (IR). These images are optimal for evaluating the&#xD;
                     interface between the cortex and the juxtacortical white matter when&#xD;
                     attempting to detect subtle focal cortical dysplasias, an important cause of&#xD;
                     focal refractory epilepsy in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Susceptibility-weighted imaging. 7T has been shown to offer superior&#xD;
                     sensitivity in detecting abnormal blood products and iron deposition in the&#xD;
                     cerebral parenchyma, in addition to the exquisite depiction of the normal and&#xD;
                     abnormal cerebral venous anomaly. These images may also be used for subjective&#xD;
                     evaluation of oxygen extraction fraction in the brain, and for quantitative&#xD;
                     mapping of iron deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). Both&#xD;
                     techniques explore the diffusivity of water molecules in the intra- and&#xD;
                     extracellular spaces of the brain, along with the directionality of movement.&#xD;
                     The acquisition generates parameters of white matter integrity and anisotropy,&#xD;
                     including mean diffusivity, longitudinal and radial diffusivity, and&#xD;
                     fractional anisotropy. With this information, detailed in vivo maps of white&#xD;
                     matter fibers (tractography) can be produced, as well as maps of anatomic&#xD;
                     connectivity (connectome). DKI is a novel diffusion imaging technique that&#xD;
                     explores the non-Gaussian distribution of white matter molecules and is able&#xD;
                     to further characterize the complexity of white matter microstructure. DKI has&#xD;
                     thus far been scarcely explored in the study of pediatric neurological&#xD;
                     disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Resting-state functional MRI. Several studies have shown disturbance of&#xD;
                     functional pathways in children with focal refractory epilepsy. This technique&#xD;
                     relies on the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect, does not require&#xD;
                     tasks as in other Functional MRI (fMRI) acquisitions, and can be postprocessed&#xD;
                     to generate maps of functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  MR Spectroscopy (MRS): 1H MRS is a noninvasive imaging technique that can&#xD;
                     easily be added to the conventional MRI sequences and is able to measure&#xD;
                     metabolism in the brain. Metabolic changes arising from pathology that can be&#xD;
                     visualized by MRS may not be apparent from anatomy. During a seizure, the&#xD;
                     metabolic demands exceed the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the portion of&#xD;
                     the brain that is undergoing the enhanced electric activity. Under these&#xD;
                     circumstances, metabolic changes can be detected by MRS, including the&#xD;
                     production of lactate and, if prolonged, the reduction of N-Acetyl Aspartate&#xD;
                     (NAA), and an increase in Cho. These abnormalities can still be observed after&#xD;
                     seizure activity ceases. Another common clinical scenario for the use of MRS&#xD;
                     is temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) to help localize the source of the seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Images acquired from 7T MRI examinations will not be used in isolation to guide&#xD;
                patient care. In the event that 7T discloses a focal structural abnormality of the&#xD;
                brain that was not detected at 3T MRI, this finding will be evaluated by a&#xD;
                multidisciplinary team responsible for care of the particular patient. Management&#xD;
                decisions will then be suggested to the patient and family considering all the&#xD;
                clinical, electrographic, and neuroimaging data available.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for&#xD;
                non-FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant&#xD;
                populations are changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Justification and safety information if non-FDA approved drugs without an&#xD;
                Investigational New Drug (IND) will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary outcome variable. The primary outcome variable is the sensitivity of 7T&#xD;
                brain MRI in the detection of subtle cortical abnormalities in children with focal&#xD;
                epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary outcome variables. The secondary outcome variables include subjective&#xD;
                characterization of subtle epileptogenic lesions, and quantitative metrics from&#xD;
                advanced MR sequences such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional&#xD;
                anisotropy (FA) may be obtained from DTI sequences. Quantitative parameters may&#xD;
                also be obtained from other imaging techniques such as MR spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis. N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Early stopping rules. N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected&#xD;
                frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All participants will undergo the informed consent process. Children over the age&#xD;
                of 15 will be asked to document their consent by signing the consent form. Children&#xD;
                between the ages of 8 and 15 years of age will be asked to indicate their assent by&#xD;
                signing the assent document. Assent will be obtained for children &lt;8 years of age&#xD;
                by monitoring visual and vocal indications as well as body language. Parents of all&#xD;
                children will be asked to document their consent of the procedure on the consent&#xD;
                form.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The effects of magnetic fields in an MRI scanner have been extensively studied, and&#xD;
                there are no known risks with an MRI exam. Participants may, however, be bothered&#xD;
                by feelings of confinement (claustrophobia), and by the noise made by the image&#xD;
                acquisition during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Steps taken to minimize the risks. Participants will be asked about&#xD;
                contraindications to MR examinations (as outlined by the MRI screening sheet).&#xD;
                Participants will wear earplugs and earphones while in the magnet. Participants may&#xD;
                not participate in this study if they have a pacemaker, an implanted defibrillator&#xD;
                or other implanted electronic or metallic devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. Adverse events,&#xD;
                unanticipated problems, and study deviations will be reported to the IRB in writing&#xD;
                by study personnel within 5 days of learning of the event. Serious adverse events&#xD;
                will be reported immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of&#xD;
                confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
                There are no known or anticipated legal risks associated with participating in this&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Financial risks to the participants. There are no known or anticipated financial&#xD;
                risks associated with participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society. i.&#xD;
           Individual participant&#xD;
&#xD;
           Individual participants may benefit by receiving higher end, non-invasive, non-contrast&#xD;
           MR imaging studies that may (or may not) increase sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
           diagnosis and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Society Society may benefit if investigators are able to establish the value of 7T&#xD;
           MR imaging in focal pediatric epilepsy. By developing a high-resolution 7T brain MRI&#xD;
           protocol for pediatric epilepsy, the data obtained from these exams may serve as the&#xD;
           basis to alter diagnostic workup. This may ultimately improve early detection and&#xD;
           characterization of lesions, and guide surgical planning, and may facilitate better&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Payment and Remuneration&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Detail compensation for participants including possible total compensation, proposed&#xD;
           bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All studies will be performed in addition to a clinically indicated MRI appointment. No&#xD;
           additional costs or billing will be generated to the patients. Subjects may receive a&#xD;
           copy of their images on compact disc upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Costs a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants&#xD;
           and identify who will pay for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient subjects will not incur any additional costs directly related to their participation&#xD;
      in this project. The 7T MRI exams will be funded by a research grant.&#xD;
