  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, multi-centre study aiming at comparing the efficacy of&#xD;
      Olaparib and Cediranib vs. weekly Paclitaxel in terms of progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      platinum refractory or resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to three treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq every week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Cediranib 20 mg/day + Olaparib 600 mg / day (i.e. 300 mg BD) given every day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Cediranib 20 mg/day given 5 days per weeks + Olaparib 600 mg / day (i.e. 300 mg&#xD;
           BD) given 7 days per weeks&#xD;

             obtained and averaged).&#xD;
&#xD;
