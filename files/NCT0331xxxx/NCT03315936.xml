    <textblock>
      This first-in man trial is designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 894416&#xD;
      in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose proportionality after single dosing of BI 894416 as oral&#xD;
      solution will be explored, the investigation of PK of BI 894416 as tablet formulation and the&#xD;
      exploration of relative bioavailability of BI 894416 as tablet formulation compared to oral&#xD;
      solution.&#xD;
