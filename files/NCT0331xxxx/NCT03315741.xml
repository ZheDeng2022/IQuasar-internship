      This is a phase 1, non-randomized, single-arm, open label, single center clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine the tolerability and safety of pirfenidone in patients with BOS associated with&#xD;
      lung GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Such a trial is a necessary step prior&#xD;
      to an evaluation of efficacy, as pirfenidone is known to be associated with adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) of the liver, gastrointestinal system and skin, organs frequently affected in GVHD.&#xD;
      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled, all patients will follow the same drug titration&#xD;
      approach. The primary endpoint will be drug tolerability as measured by: the number of&#xD;
      patients that are able to maintain the recommended dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/d) without&#xD;
      dose reduction lasting more than 21 days, due to adverse events (AEs). Changes from Baseline&#xD;
      to Week 52 will be studied using validated health-related quality of life scales. Eligible&#xD;
      patients aged &gt; 18 years must have a diagnosis of BOS according to pre-specified criteria.&#xD;
      Patients will be required to have an %FEV1 or %FVC decline &gt;20% from pre-transplant baseline&#xD;
      and symptoms of dyspnea, or cough. Eligible patients will enter the Screening Period, which&#xD;
      may last up to 28 days. The dose of pirfenidone will be titrated over 3-8 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      will have a telephone assessment at Week 1 and 2. An in-clinic assessment will occur every&#xD;
      1-3 months as part of their usual clinical care in the Stanford University Lung GVHD clinic.&#xD;
      Patients will complete an AE and dosing compliance diary. If patients discontinue study&#xD;
      treatment early for any reason, they will continue with all scheduled study procedures&#xD;
      through Week 52. All deaths will be reviewed by a Mortality Assessment Committee (MAC). An&#xD;
      external Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor patient safety during the study.&#xD;

    <measure>The number of participants that do not require a reduction in drug dose for more than 21 days due to adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will count the number of participants that do not require a reduction in drug dose of more than 21, non-continuous days due to adverse events. Tolerability will be assessed during continuous treatment. If the medication dosage increase results in the reoccurrence of a moderate adverse event or serious adverse event, lasting more than 21 days, then the event would be defined as &quot;not tolerated&quot;. If adverse events resolve before 21 days, then participants will attempt to again up-titrate the Pirfenidone dose, as tolerated. If at least 25% of participants tolerate the drug, then investigators will deem that this study demonstrates adequate tolerability to proceed to a larger trial to examine drug efficacy.</description>
