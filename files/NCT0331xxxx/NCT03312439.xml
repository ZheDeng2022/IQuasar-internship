  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of elderly will increase rapidly in Europe in the next 30 years, which affects the&#xD;
      country's economic and social development, welfare, health care, and also the individuals.&#xD;
      Future challenges include creating opportunities for people to maintain a high well-being in&#xD;
      later stages of life, and coping with diseases and disability. Physical exercise and avoiding&#xD;
      obesity have the potential to increase quality of life in the elderly by preventing CVD and&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is a intervention study where the overarching aim is to evaluate whether&#xD;
      a primary prevention with the focus of decreasing obesity and increasing objective measures&#xD;
      of physical activity will decrease the future risk of the endpoints cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      stroke, diabetes, falls, fractures, dementia and death, in a population based cohort of&#xD;
      70-year-old women and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: In a population based cohort of 5000, 70-year old women and men;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the association between risk factors assessed at baseline, with focus on&#xD;
           objective measures of physical activity and body fat distribution, and the endpoints&#xD;
           described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether individuals given the prevention will have a lower future risk of&#xD;
           the endpoints described above than 70-year olds in general Swedish population, after&#xD;
           adjustments for differences in the different covariates at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second part, a follow up will be conducted after 5 years where all participants will be&#xD;
      tested again. One aim is to evaluate whether the changes in the risk factors assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, with focus of objective measures of physical activity and body fat distribution,&#xD;
      are associated with the risk of CVD and stroke. We will also again investigate whether the&#xD;
      intervention give will influence the future risk of non-communicable disease.&#xD;

      Effects of Primary Prevention on Non-communicable Disease in Elderly People-An Intervention&#xD;

&#xD;
      Working plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project overview- The Healthy Aging Initiative (HAI) HAI is a population-based health&#xD;
      examination and intervention where all individuals living in Umeå municipal area are invited&#xD;
      to participate when they are exactly 70 years old. Information from population registers is&#xD;
      used to contact eligible individuals, who received printed information about the research&#xD;
      project. Telephone contact is made shortly thereafter, during which individuals accept or&#xD;
      decline the invitation to participate. As we aim to investigate a sample representing the&#xD;
      general population, no eligible participant is excluded. The 70-year-old participants visit&#xD;
      the clinic at 2 occasions a week apart. At the first visit, traditional and potential novel&#xD;
      risk factors for non-communicable disease are measured (please see details below), blood&#xD;
      samples are sent for analyses, and participants are sent home with accelerometers to collect&#xD;
      data on physical activity and sedentary behavior. At the second visit, all participants are&#xD;
      informed about the results of tests performed. They also receive counseling with focus on&#xD;
      physical activity using motivational interviewing which is a directive patient-cantered&#xD;
      counseling style to help the participants to explore and resolve their ambivalence about&#xD;
      behavior change. Based on the results, the participants will also be given medical advice, or&#xD;
      referred to primary care for follow up. They are also contacted at 6 months, 12 months per&#xD;
      telephone for follow up, and we are planning for an in-clinic follow up after 5 years. The&#xD;
      project started 5 years ago with the aim to include 2500 men and 2500 women. October 12,&#xD;
      2017, 3700 individuals have been included with a participation rate of 71%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires, basic measurements and blood samples All participants are asked to answer a&#xD;
      comprehensive questionnaire organized in the following themes; socio-demography, lifestyle,&#xD;
      mood, cognition, living habits, woman´s health, and medical history. Height, weight, forced&#xD;
      expiratory flow, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, blood glucose and blood lipids are&#xD;
      measured/analyzed during the visit using standardized methods. In addition all subjects are&#xD;
      asked to leave blood samples for later analyses of markers for primarily cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. All subjects participating in the project are also asked to leave blood samples for&#xD;
      DNA extraction. In this DNA, candidate genes will be analyzed and finally a GWAS including&#xD;
      2.4 million genetic markers will be performed for the outcomes of physical activity, muscle&#xD;
      strength and body fat distribution, blood pressure, blood glucose and blood lipids. Blood&#xD;
      samples are stored in the local biobank until the preplanned analyses of risk factors for&#xD;
      non-communicable disease presented above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of body fat distribution and ectopic fat Peripheral quantitative computed&#xD;
      tomography (pQCT 2000, Stratec, Germany) is used to obtain slices (taken as a percentage of&#xD;
      limb length from the distal end of tibia, is used to measure bone density and muscle density,&#xD;
      that is an estimate of ectopic fat accumulation at the 66% tibial scan site. Additionally,&#xD;
      areal bone density, visceral fat, subcutaneous fat and gynoid fat are measured using&#xD;
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the new Corescan soft ware using a Lunar I-DXA (GE&#xD;
      Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective measures of physical activity Objective measures of physical activity is measured&#xD;
      using a triaxial accelerometer (GT3X+, Maribo Medical, Denmark) during 1 week. The&#xD;
      accelerometer is worn around the waist as this place has been shown to produce the most&#xD;
      accurate results during validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of muscle strength, balance and gait Isometric muscle strength of the&#xD;
      non-dominant hand is measured using a validated isokinetic hand dynamometer. Postural&#xD;
      instability is studied when standing on a force plate with preferred placements of the feet.&#xD;
      The instability is estimated by calculating the variability in the centre of pressure in&#xD;
      relation to the supported foot area - with and without vision. The methods for testing have&#xD;
      been developed exclusively for this project since clinical measurements used today are&#xD;
      lacking in sensitivity. Details surrounding specific methods have been development in a joint&#xD;
      cooperation with researchers from the Department of Integrative Medical Biology, Physiology&#xD;
      unit (Professor Benoni Edin and Göran Westling, PhD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we measure gait variability using a 6-meter gait test and the GAITRite system (CIR&#xD;
      Systems, Sparta, NJ, USA). There are two separate tests. The first is conducted using&#xD;
      self-selected speed without performing any tasks. The second is performed at a self-selected&#xD;
      speed while performing a dual-task to increase the involvement of higher cortical functions&#xD;
      on the gait variability. Balance and gait are of interest in the present project as measures&#xD;
      of frailty, and of interest with respect to the risk of falls and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the health investigation when all data has been collected All participants are informed&#xD;
      about the results of the tests performed. Participants are also given advice based on their&#xD;
      results with special emphasis on increasing the amount of physical activity. They are also&#xD;
      advised to search medical care or referred based on risk factor evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of non-communicable disease within the cohort. Information on diagnosis from&#xD;
      1987-01-01 and onwards is obtained by record linkage with the National Hospital Discharge&#xD;
      Register (HDR), covering all public inpatient care in Sweden, and the National Hospital&#xD;
      Outpatients Register, covering all public outpatient care in Sweden from 2003-01-01,&#xD;
      administered the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden. Diagnosis were recorded&#xD;
      using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 9 (1987-1996) and version 10&#xD;
      (1997 and later). Deaths occurring during the study period are collected through the National&#xD;
      Cause of Death Register, administered by the Center for Epidemiology at the National Board of&#xD;
      Health and Welfare in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescribed drugs for every subject in the cohorts based on social security number is&#xD;
      available from the National Prescription Database at the National Board of Health and Welfare&#xD;
      from 2005-07 and onward. Permission for merging data files has been obtained from the&#xD;
      National Board of Health and Welfare. Socioeconomic data will be searched at Statistics&#xD;
      Sweden (www.scb.se).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods Differences between two different groups will be investigated using&#xD;
      student's t-test for independent samples and differences between 3 groups will be&#xD;
      investigated using Analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Association between&#xD;
      risk factors and future risk of CVD, stroke and diabetes will be investigated using&#xD;
      multivariable adjusted Cox regression models. Cox regression models will also be used to&#xD;
      investigate changes in the different risk factors during the 5 years of follow up in relation&#xD;
      to the later risk of CVD, stroke and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical power To estimate the statistical power with respect to the effect of the cohort&#xD;
      investigated, we first evaluated the risk of disease and death in the total Swedish&#xD;
      population of 70-year old men and women that lived in Sweden 2006 (n=72375). During 5 years&#xD;
      of follow up, 8969 subjects died, 2695 individuals suffered a first myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      2855 suffered a stroke, according to national registers. If we assume a similar risk of CVD,&#xD;
      stroke and death in our cohort there will be 620 deaths and 383 incident cases of CVD or&#xD;
      stroke during 5 years of follow up. Thus, also under two-tailed hypothesis testing, the total&#xD;
      number of outcomes will enable detection of numerically small associations, and small&#xD;
      differences in associations. Concerning the evaluation of the intervention given among the&#xD;
      HAI participants, compared to the rest of the Swedish population of 70 year old men and&#xD;
      women, we assume that the intervention will reduce the future risk of the combined endpoint&#xD;
      death, myocardial infarction and stroke by at least 15%. If we then assume a sample size of&#xD;
      3500 individuals (in each group) and a significance level of 0.05, we will have 96% power to&#xD;
      detect a difference. Given that the control group will be much larger, the statistical power&#xD;
      is likely to be adequate also for detecting smaller differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Only the research leader will have access to social security numbers&#xD;
      from where the identity can be traced from individual data. No individual data will be&#xD;
      presented. Permission for these studies has been obtained from the Regional Ethical Review&#xD;
      Board in Umeå and conforms to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (Dnr&#xD;
      07-031M with extensions), and for the genetic part (06-134 and 09-029).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and clinical relevance Non-communicable disease is the main cause of death and&#xD;
      morbidity worldwide. The number of elderly will increase rapidly in the next 30 years and&#xD;
      currently there are severe economic problems for Swedish health care with decreasing number&#xD;
      of hospital beds and personnel as a result. The idea is that the very old should live at home&#xD;
      healthy longer and that health care should be provided outside hospitals and specialized&#xD;
      care. In another project we have investigated the incidence of myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      stroke in the total Swedish population above 50 years of age, i.e. in 3.29 million&#xD;
      individuals. In this cohort, 28,268 individuals suffered a myocardial infarction and 29,708&#xD;
      individuals suffered a stroke at a mean age of about 77 years in 2006. Thus, any preventive&#xD;
      measures that could decrease the future risk of CVD and stroke in our cohort of 70-year olds&#xD;
      would be of high importance. Furthermore, the potential of preventive measures in our cohort&#xD;
      is high given that; 41% of the participants collected so far have systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      above 140, 16% are obese (BMI of at least 30) and 61% of the participants do not reach the&#xD;
      minimal amount of physical activity as suggested by the World Health Organization.&#xD;
