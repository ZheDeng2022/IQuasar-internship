  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a psychiatric disorder that affects mood, thoughts and is usually accompanied&#xD;
      by physical annoyances. It affects the person's eating habits, his sleep, the way he sees&#xD;
      himself and the way he thinks and understands. Depressed emotion has great tension, lasts&#xD;
      longer and leads to a reduction in the person's functioning in many areas of his life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is the psychiatric disorder characterized by a multitude&#xD;
      of diverse organic responses as well as a generalized, persistent and indeterminate anxiety&#xD;
      that covers almost all of the individual's activities. It is a diffuse and intense negative&#xD;
      mood and anxiety that is present for most of the day and whose exact causes are often&#xD;
      undetectable.&#xD;

      The Hamilton Depression Scale is the most widely used scale for measuring the severity of&#xD;
      depression worldwide. It was designed to measure the severity of depression in already&#xD;
      diagnosed patients with major depressive disorder. It includes 17 entries rated from 0 to 2&#xD;
      or from 0 to 4, thus giving a total score ranging from 0-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scores are scored through the symptoms reported by the patient during the interview, the&#xD;
      evaluator's observations and the information collected from third parties (relatives,&#xD;
      nurses). The markings do not distinguish between the intensity and frequency of the symptoms,&#xD;
      but these two should be equally at the discretion of the assessor. The scale covers the&#xD;
      condition of the patient in the week preceding the mark for most symptoms, except for sleep&#xD;
      disorders related to the last three days.Health-related quality of life is calculated using&#xD;
      weighted questionnaires focusing on the general health level of the individual or the impact&#xD;
      of specific diseases on the quality of life of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires are based on a common theoretical background, according to which the&#xD;
      measurement of biological functionality is a basic, but not sufficient, assessment of health.&#xD;
      Apart from the good functioning of organic systems, which represents the traditional&#xD;
      biomedical model of health, the need for an assessment of the general well-being and&#xD;
      functioning of the individual in all areas of his life is also important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EQ-5D questionnaire is a self-completed tool for measuring the quality of life and&#xD;
      consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part records the person's health profile. Five dimensions are used, referring to&#xD;
      (a) mobility, (b) self-handling, (c) routine activities, (d) pain-discomfort and (e)&#xD;
      stress-depression. Each of these dimensions takes three values: 1 = no problem, 2 = some&#xD;
      problems, 3 = significant problems. Altogether, three health situations are recorded,&#xD;
      representing 243 cases. The best mental state is described as &quot;11111&quot;, meaning that there is&#xD;
      no problem in terms of mobility, self-care, routine activities, pain and anxiety. The worst&#xD;
      mental health status gets the &quot;33333&quot; values, which means significant problems in the above&#xD;
      five dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part presents a visual analogue scale (VAS) in the form of a &quot;health thermometer&quot;,&#xD;
      which takes values from 0 = worse mental health to 100 = excellent mental health.&#xD;
      Intermediate values of the optical proportional scale indicate intermediate health status.&#xD;
      This scale is based on the person's subjective assessments of his / her state of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the EQ-5D, it is possible to estimate the benefit enjoyed by the individual from&#xD;
      different health situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HAM-A scale was one of the first assessment scales developed to measure the severity of&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms and is still used up to now in both clinical and research environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale consists of 14 elements, which are determined by a series of symptoms, and measures&#xD;
      both mental (mental stimulation and psychological discomfort as well as physical anxiety&#xD;
      (physical anxiety disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each question is scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very serious), with a total score of 0&#xD;
      to 56. A score of less than 17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and&#xD;
      25-30 mild to severe.&#xD;
