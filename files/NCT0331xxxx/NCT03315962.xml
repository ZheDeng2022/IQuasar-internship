  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine if a multi-component implementation&#xD;
      intervention (SPIRIT) and additional leadership and management training that targets District&#xD;
      Health Officers (DHOs) can increase IPT initiation among HIV-infected persons, as compared to&#xD;
      country standard practices, in a cluster randomized trial in Uganda.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The failure to use isoniazid (INH) preventative therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected individuals in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the single biggest implementation gaps between evidence&#xD;
      and practice in today's response to the HIV epidemic. The proposed study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to improve IPT uptake in two regions of&#xD;
      Uganda. The study design is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where the unit of&#xD;
      randomization is clusters of districts in Uganda. The clusters consist of 5-7 districts and&#xD;
      the District Health Officer (DHO) and District TB and Leprosy Supervisor (DTLS) from each&#xD;
      district is invited to participate. The SPIRIT intervention is based on the PRECEDE framework&#xD;
      which outlines the importance of social networks, social influence, and behavior change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEARCH-IPT multi-component intervention includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A teaching collaborative which will be formed within the randomized clusters of district&#xD;
           DHOs and DTLSs to create a mini-collaborative, which will be led by an opinion leader&#xD;
           with HIV and TB expertise, to spread new scientific knowledge about IPT and the clinical&#xD;
           ability to rule out TB, and to facilitate discussion between DHOs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A &quot;toolkit&quot; of options to ease IPT implementation will support DHOs to scale up IPT&#xD;
           through the study of the comparative effectiveness of material contributions to their&#xD;
           day-to-day function of managing front line providers and clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A reporting collaborative comprised of the teaching collaborative groups, will define&#xD;
           targets as a group, and reconvening every 6 months for 3 years (with the additional&#xD;
           option of 36 months for a final report back), where each collaborative has an&#xD;
           opportunity to share progress and results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an enhanced business training &amp; 'training-of-trainers' curriculum will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the effect of enhanced business training among intervention group DHOs&#xD;
      from Phase 1 (Years 1-3 of trial follow-up) in the southwestern Uganda region on IPT&#xD;
      initiation during years 4-5 of trial follow-up (Phase 2).&#xD;
