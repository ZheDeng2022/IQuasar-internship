  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinically already tested and approved MySpine system is compared to the free-hand dorsal&#xD;
      instrumentation, which is the gold standard in spondylodesis surgery. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to investigate whether or not the pedicle screw can be inserted anatomically more&#xD;
      accurately by the MySpine system than by the conventional free-hand method using&#xD;
      intraoperative fluoroscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an indication for spondylodesis are included according to the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, randomization into the MySpine and&#xD;
      conventional group is performed. Patients remain blinded to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of a computed tomography, the surgeon plans the entry points, the screw size and&#xD;
      length, as well as the angle of the screws in two planes (sagittal and axial) on the&#xD;
      computer. In the MySpine group, a three-dimensional, digital reconstruction of the spine is&#xD;
      made using Medacta International SA software. On the basis of these planning files,&#xD;
      three-dimensional templates with guide channels (guides) are produced for each individual&#xD;
      vertebra. These guides can be applied dorsally to the bony anatomy and thus specify the entry&#xD;
      points as well as the direction of the screw. Also, replicas of the individual vertebra are&#xD;
      produced in the 3D printer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are operated in a prone position via a dorsal approach. After preparation of the&#xD;
      dorsal process, vertebral arches and vertebral joints as well as the transverse process, the&#xD;
      screws are implanted with one of the following methods depending on the randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Freehand (fluoroscopically controlled)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MySpine System&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, all patients undergo computed tomography of the operated area. On the basis&#xD;
      of this computed tomography the number of pedicle perforations as well as their extent should&#xD;
      be determined according to the simplified Laine classification. These results are to be&#xD;
      statistically evaluated with the question of whether there are significant differences&#xD;
      between the two techniques with respect to the absolute and individual number of pedicle&#xD;
      perforations, as well as their extent. It is also to be examined whether these results show a&#xD;
      dependence on the level of experience of the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the individual radiation exposure (cumulative irradiation time in seconds and&#xD;
      irradiation dose in cGy), the time for the dorsal instrumentation for each of the two systems&#xD;
      per surgeon is also to be measured and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the follow-up, the outcome is also recorded by means of pain registration, ODI score and&#xD;
      complication detection (infections, pedicle fractures, implant loosening, pseudoarthrosis,&#xD;
      re-operations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up assessments 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgrey are peformed&#xD;
      according to institutional standards.&#xD;
