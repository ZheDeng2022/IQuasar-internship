  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised three-arm study aims to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (INT-Integrated Neurocognitive Therapy for Schizophrenia Patients) in the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia patients in an inpatient setting. The intervention will be&#xD;
      compared with an active comparator (IPT- Integrated Psychological Therapy) and a control&#xD;
      condition. Overall the study will include 90 patients (30 in each arm). Each patient will&#xD;
      receive at least 16 sessions of the respective treatment. Baseline and follow up assessments&#xD;
      up to 12 months after the intervention will investigate the stability of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Psychotic disorders, and particularly schizophrenia, are severe psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
      characterized by psychotic symptoms (mainly hallucinations and delusions), disorganized&#xD;
      speech, thought and behavior, and negative symptoms like blunted affect. People who have&#xD;
      schizophrenia are chronically impaired. Schizophrenia is one of the first causes of&#xD;
      disability worldwide with enormous direct and indirect costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of antipsychotics revolutionized the treatment and care of schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients; remaining the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment. Although new antipsychotics&#xD;
      were introduced, they share the same mechanism of action (dopamine D2 antagonism). To date,&#xD;
      nearly one-third to half of the patients still do not or respond poorly to antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment; furthermore, some core symptoms of the disorder are not fully addressed by this&#xD;
      type of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel to pharmacological treatments, there has been a steady research in psychological&#xD;
      interventions for schizophrenia. Current interventions had a more biologic understanding of&#xD;
      the disorder and adopted a diathesis-stress model to explain symptoms and course,&#xD;
      incorporating adaptation and adjustment through learned and practiced coping strategies.&#xD;
      There are many psychological treatments for schizophrenia, although all are considered&#xD;
      roughly equivalent, empirical data shows slight differences in efficacy; in particular,&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) yields small to medium sized effects in addition to&#xD;
      psychopharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several available manualized psychological group interventions for patients with a&#xD;
      schizophrenic psychosis. One the is the &quot;Integrated Psychological Therapy for Schizophrenia&#xD;
      Patients (IPT)&quot;, it was developed and introduced into clinical practice almost 30 years ago.&#xD;
      It combines neurocognitive and social cognitive interventions with social skills and problem-&#xD;
      solving approaches, it has been extensively evaluated by several independent groups, in&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient settings as well, showing an overall improvement in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last decade, the cognitive section of IPT was further developed, with the&#xD;
      &quot;Integrated Neurocognitive Therapy for schizophrenia patients (INT)&quot; was the final result of&#xD;
      this process, with the peculiarity that it was designed to fit the needs of outpatients.&#xD;
      While IPT focuses predominantly on the domains of speed of processing, attention, reasoning,&#xD;
      and problem-solving as well as on emotion and social perception; INT in contrast targets all&#xD;
      11 neuro- and social-cognitive MATRICS-domains. Furthermore, INT uses computerized&#xD;
      neurocognitive exercises for restitution. Initial trials seem to confirm INT as a feasible&#xD;
      and efficient group therapy approach with the potential to improve functional outcome in&#xD;
      schizophrenia outpatients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, plan investigational trial to assess the efficacy and feasibility of INT&#xD;
      for patients with schizophrenia in an inpatient setting. Therefore, an 8-week, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, assessor-blind, three-parallel-arm trial is planned with patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      a schizophrenic psychosis. Following baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either IPT, INT or a control intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study interventions, i.e.: the experimental intervention, the psychological control&#xD;
      intervention, and the control condition will occur simultaneously twice a week to avoid&#xD;
      participants from involuntarily switch groups. Therapists of the psychological experimental&#xD;
      and control intervention, as well as trainers involved in the control condition, are not&#xD;
      involved in the recruitment, assessment, and assignment of participants of the study. Study&#xD;
      interventions will be held in group sessions with 6 to 8 participants each; we plan to&#xD;
      conduct five such batches till we reach our sample size of at least 30 participants in each&#xD;
      intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing psychological interventions should have some prerequisites and conditions&#xD;
      which make them suitable for the intervention; this, however, is not fully compatible with a&#xD;
      random allocation of participants. Through randomization there is the possibility that&#xD;
      participants are not able to cope with their assigned treatment; therefore in a pragmatic way&#xD;
      patients will be allowed to switch in another treatment arm. Accordingly after two weeks;&#xD;
      patients will be reassessed; reallocation will be followed according to predefined criteria&#xD;
      for excessive demands or under requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants which switch groups should complete the 8-week intervention in the second&#xD;
      assigned group. The assessment at week two will be considered their baseline, with subsequent&#xD;
      measures eight weeks later analog to those who did not switch treatment groups. For the final&#xD;
      analysis and to preserve randomization the data from those who did not switch treatment&#xD;
      groups will be analyzed: however data from the switching groups will be analyzed separately&#xD;
      in an ITT fashion.&#xD;
