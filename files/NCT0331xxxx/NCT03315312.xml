      Occlusal caries management in first permanent molars: a pragmatic randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      in child dental care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fissure sealants and fluoride&#xD;
      varnish in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial and evaluate whether some specific patient&#xD;
      groups benefit more from any particular treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high risk children (having a previous caries experience at 5 years of age) from 2009,&#xD;
      2010 and 2011 birth cohorts (6-, 7- and 8-year-olds) from three counties (Østfold, Oppland&#xD;
      and Hedmark) are selected. Children with at least two erupted first permanent molars in the&#xD;
      same jaw randomly receive resin-based sealant or a fluoride varnish (Duraphat) during a&#xD;
      routine dental examination. Children who already developed caries, had restorations or&#xD;
      fissure sealants placed in first molars were excluded from the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluoride varnish and resin-based fissure sealants are randomly applied on contra-lateral&#xD;
      teeth where each child serves as its own control. This study uses a natural clinical setting,&#xD;
      where clinicians use methods and procedures that are routinely applied in public dental&#xD;
      clinics. The study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics South&#xD;
      East (2016/2002/REK sør-øst C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations: Based on the assumption that 80% of the treated teeth do not get&#xD;
      caries and that 10% difference in caries development constitutes a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      difference, it is required to recruit 180 participants in the study for the split-mouth&#xD;
      design. Considering a potential maximum of annual 20% drop-out rate and a 3-years follow-up,&#xD;
      the study will need to recruit 400 participants in order to have at least 206 children at the&#xD;
      3 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments are provided by either dentists or dental hygienists during routine dental&#xD;
      examinations. Caregivers of eligible children are informed about the study, the participation&#xD;
      is voluntary and an informed written parental consent is obtained in accordance with the&#xD;
      directions of the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics. In this study, a clinician&#xD;
      selects a random treatment for the first tooth by choosing one of the two cards, while a&#xD;
      collateral tooth receives an alternative treatment. Subsequently, treatments provided and&#xD;
      materials used are recorded on a treatment registration form. During this study, clinicians&#xD;
      follow their conventional clinical procedures for applying sealants or fluoride varnish.&#xD;
      Information on patient's caries experience and quality of oral hygiene are recorded on&#xD;
      treatment registration form. Fluoride varnish is applied three times, at baseline, 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries on occlusal surfaces of first molars detected at later 24 and 36 months follow-ups&#xD;
      will be recorded in the follow-up registration form. The main study outcome is caries&#xD;
      occurrence on occlusal tooth surfaces.&#xD;
