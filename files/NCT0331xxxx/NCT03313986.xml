  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile curvature in adults is divided into two main categories the first is congenital penile&#xD;
      curvature with orthotopic meatus and the other is acquired curvature which its common causes&#xD;
      are Peyronie's disease (PD) and previous penile surgery as for hypospadias repair.The&#xD;
      congenital penile curvatures (CPC) which not associated with urethral malformation is a&#xD;
      relatively uncommon condition that may present in late adolescent or early adult life. The&#xD;
      incidence is estimated to be 0.6 % but the incidence of clinically significant CPC is much&#xD;
      lower, as the degree of curvature and sexual dysfunction varies widely Penile curvature may&#xD;
      lead to inability for sexual intercourse. These cases require treatment. Acquired penile&#xD;
      curvature its most common cause is Peyronie's disease. Peyronie's disease is a fibrotic&#xD;
      disorder of the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa that is clinically defined by the&#xD;
      presence of a palpable, inelastic tunical plaque. PD is relatively common and affects up to&#xD;
      20.3% of adult men to some degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is gold-standard for treatment of curvature in stable PD. Surgical therapy is&#xD;
      subdivided into three main procedures: (1) plication techniques (Penile shortening&#xD;
      procedures), (2) grafting procedures with partial plaque excision or incision followed by&#xD;
      defect closure with various grafts, and (3) correction of deviation with simultaneous penile&#xD;
      prosthesis implantation in patients with ED not responding to medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study results of different surgical techniques in management of penile curvature will&#xD;
      be compared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The type of surgery will be chosen according to the degree of curvature and penile length&#xD;
      after meticulous preoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A thorough history will be taken, with special stress on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sexual history, including concomitant ED and baseline erectile function as assessed&#xD;
           using validated questionnaires such as the International Index of Erectile Function&#xD;
           (IIEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Penile curvature ;( direction, degree, interfere with intercourse (hand assisted or&#xD;
           not), presence of pain, home (self) photograph during erection).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-morbidities like vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Special habits like tobacco use and drug intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of penile trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of previous penile surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Physical examination including&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of stretched penile length, girth measurement, and penile sensation to&#xD;
           touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direction and degree of penile curvature will be measured using the protractor through&#xD;
           examination of the pharmacologically erect penis by office test using intracavernosal&#xD;
           PGE1 (20 mg) and photograph taken during erection in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In cases of PD, the size, number, and position of the plaques will be assessed. •&#xD;
           Routine evaluation for fitness before surgery. Operative techniques All surgeries will&#xD;
           be performed under anaesthesia starting by a circumfericial degloving incision. After&#xD;
           lateral dissection and mobilization of the neurovascular bundle, an artificial erection&#xD;
           will be performed to assess the degree of deformity and the point of maximum curvature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plication On convex side of the shaft, Allis clamps are used on the greater curvature to&#xD;
      estimate the number and length of tissue needed for plications, nonabsorbable stitches are&#xD;
      placed into the tunica albuginea in pairs and adjusted as needed to achieve optimal&#xD;
      straightening. The artificial erection is then released and sutures tied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nesbit Technique On the convex side of the shaft, excision of horizontal ellipses of the&#xD;
      tunica albuginea on the greater curvature (with approximately 1 mm for each 10º of&#xD;
      curvature), Allis clamps are then applied until the desired straightening is achieved. These&#xD;
      ellipses are excised and closed transversely in a stepwise fashion until curvature is&#xD;
      completely corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Nesbit Technique On the convex side of the shaft consisted of a longitudinal&#xD;
      incision in the tunica with transverse closure (Heineke- Mikulicz principle), The length of&#xD;
      the incision is limited to about 1 cm to prevent excessive indentation of the penis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length-Preserving Techniques (Grafting Technique) On the concave border of the penile shaft&#xD;
      tunica lengthening procedures involve incising or excising the plaque, and adding graft&#xD;
      material to cover the defect, Excision can be avoided if the surgeon is able to perform&#xD;
      relaxing incisions on the plaque with added grafting material. The graft (usually 20% larger&#xD;
      than the defect) is then sutured to the tunica albuginea with separate running suture, The&#xD;
      types of graft used are autologous buccal mucosa or dermal graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will return to outpatient clinic after discharge by 1 month and 3 months to&#xD;
      evaluate for the postoperative results and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis will be done using SPSS 21.0 (statistical&#xD;
      package for the social sciences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Informed written consent will be obtained from all patients after&#xD;
      explanation of the operative details and possible postoperative complications.&#xD;
