  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal in this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive remediation program&#xD;
      that was designed specifically to address the concerns related to cognitive difficulties that&#xD;
      are often reported among women in the menopausal transition. This cognitive remediation&#xD;
      program has been created to provide our clients with an opportunity to learn more about the&#xD;
      relation between menopause and cognitive function, to learn new strategies to enhance&#xD;
      thinking skills (e.g., memory, attention) and to hear about lifestyle changes that are known&#xD;
      to have a beneficial effect on mental functioning.&#xD;
