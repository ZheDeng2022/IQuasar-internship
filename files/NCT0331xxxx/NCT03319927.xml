  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To reduce the risk of adverse health problems associated with chronic exposure to pesticides,&#xD;
      a randomized control study will evaluate a nurse-led integrated pest management (IPM)&#xD;
      intervention in 88 child care centers serving socio-economically and ethnically diverse&#xD;
      preschool-age children in four California counties. Positive changes in IPM knowledge,&#xD;
      policies, practices, pests, and pesticide exposure will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to reduce children's exposure to pesticides in child care centers&#xD;
      to improve their long-term health. A randomized-control trial in four northern California&#xD;
      counties will compare changes in pesticide exposure among child care centers assigned to an&#xD;
      IPM intervention versus an attention control intervention on physical activity. Eighty-eight&#xD;
      child care centers serving socio-economically and ethnically diverse preschool-age children&#xD;
      will be enrolled. This study will be modeled on a successful nurse-led child care health&#xD;
      consultation intervention comprised of an educational workshop, materials and tools, and&#xD;
      center-specific consultation over seven months. In addition, the study will include novel&#xD;
      methods of measuring pesticide concentrations in child care centers (dust) and to individual&#xD;
      children in the child care settings (silicone wristbands). The study aims are to determine if&#xD;
      a nurse-led IPM intervention (1) increases child care center staff's IPM knowledge, (2)&#xD;
      improves center's IPM policies and practices, (3) reduces pest problems (i.e., pests present,&#xD;
      pest residue), (4) increases director's self-efficacy, (5) reduces pesticide exposures in&#xD;
      child care center environments, and (6) reduces child-level pesticide exposures in the&#xD;
      intervention child care centers compared to the control centers.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized control study will include 88 child care centers in four CA counties and be conducted in 9-month cycles over five years. The counties will be matched and randomized to the intervention group (integrated pest management) or attention control group (physical activity). Each study cycle will include Recruitment, Baseline Assessments, Intervention, and Post-Intervention Assessments. Baseline Assessments are completed as director interviews, child care provider surveys, research assistant objective observations using standardized Checklists, review of written policies, child anthropometrics, center dust samples to measure pesticides, and silicone wristband personal samplers worn by 5 children per center for a 7-days. During the 7-month Intervention phase, CCHCs will conduct one workshop per center on the intervention topic (IPM or physical activity) and provide seven monthly consultations per center. The Post-Intervention stage will repeat all the baseline assessments.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention consists of an integrated pest management (IPM) educational workshop and consultation. The child care health consultants (CCHCs) conduct the educational workshop for child care center directors and providers on IPM policies and practices including the providers' practices and beliefs. The workshop includes IPM videos, IPM Toolkit, and IPM toolbox. The (CCHCs) meet with center directors to review the results of the Baseline observational Checklists and to identify center-specific intervention goals. The intervention also includes 7 monthly child care health consultation visits where the CCHC and director review the center's progress towards the intervention goals, discuss problems, and share resources.</description>
