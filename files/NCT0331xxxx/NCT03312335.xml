  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with multifactorial genesis.&#xD;
      Recent research suggests a numerical and functional deficit of regulatory T (Treg) cells as&#xD;
      an important contributing factor to the pathology seen in SLE. Treg cells play important&#xD;
      roles in dampening overt stimulation of effector cells, as seen in many autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
      As Treg cells are highly dependent on interleukin-2 (IL-2), application of low doses of IL-2&#xD;
      leads to markedly increased numbers and improved functionality of Treg cells in mice and&#xD;
      humans. Several clinical trials investigated the safety of low-dose IL-2 treatment in&#xD;
      different autoimmune diseases, including SLE. The trials conducted so far mainly focused on&#xD;
      an increase in Treg cells after IL-2 treatment, not evaluating in detail the effects on other&#xD;
      immune cells, presumably also playing important roles in the pathogenesis of SLE. For this&#xD;
      reason, the investigators of this trial aim to conduct a complete phenotyping of cellular and&#xD;
      soluble components in the blood of SLE patients treated with low-dose IL-2. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators want to offer this promising treatment to SLE patients in a controlled&#xD;
      framework of an investigator initiated clinical trial.&#xD;
