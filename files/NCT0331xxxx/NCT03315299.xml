  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide expanded access to ASP2215 for a single subject with&#xD;
      refractory FLT3-mutated AML without access to comparable or alternative therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This treatment protocol is being conducted in a single pediatric patient while phase 3&#xD;
      ASP2215 studies are ongoing in adult subjects with FLT3-mutated AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will enter the screening period up to 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will complete visits on cycle 1 days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 days 1, 15, and day 1&#xD;
      of each cycle thereafter until discontinued from the study for toxicity, disease progression,&#xD;
      or lack of continued benefit in the judgement of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of the&#xD;
      investigation product (ASP2215), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy,&#xD;
      whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow up.&#xD;
