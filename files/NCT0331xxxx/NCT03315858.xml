      Aim of the study is measurement of NFAT-RGE (IL-2 (interleukin-2), IFN-γ (interferon-gamma),&#xD;
      GM-CSF (granulocyte monocyte colony stimulating factor)) after tacrolimus (TAC) in de-novo&#xD;
      immunosuppressed patients after liver transplantation (LT), to test the hypothesis that in&#xD;
      de-novo TAC patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids after LT there is an&#xD;
      inverse correlation of NFAT-RGE and TAC peak levels at 1.5 hours after TAC intake.&#xD;

      The trial will be conducted as a prospective, longitudinal study. The study is a&#xD;
      single-centre study performed at the Medical University of Graz, Department of Surgery,&#xD;
      Division of Transplant Surgery and the Department of Blood Group Serology and Transfusion&#xD;
      Medicine, Medical University of Graz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients on the LT wailting list at the Division of Transplant Surgery, Medical&#xD;
      University of Graz are screened according to both inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study&#xD;
      period is 1 year. One NFAT-RGE baseline measurement is performed directly before LT;&#xD;
      NFAT-RGE-measurements after LT are performed at clearly defined timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. As a pilot trial this study comprises of 15 patients who will undergo LT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the hypothesis that in de-novo TAC patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
           (MMF) and steroids after LT there is an inverse correlation of NFAT-RGE and TAC peak&#xD;
           levels at 1.5 hours after TAC intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate both NFAT-RGE and TAC (trough and peak) levels with rejection episodes and&#xD;
           TAC side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NFAT-RGE is determined in 15 patients just before LT, and after LT after 1 day, 1 week, 2&#xD;
      weeks, and after 1, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Heparinized peripheral blood is stimulated with 1 ml of complete Roswell Park&#xD;
      Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium containing 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate&#xD;
      (PMA) and 5 mcg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St.Louis, MO, USA) for 3 hours at 37°C.&#xD;
      Following ex vivo immune activation, after red cell lysis with ACK buffer (0.15 M NH4CL, 1.0&#xD;
      mM KHCO3), leukocytes are lysed with 400 mcl of MagNA-Pure lysis buffer supplemented with an&#xD;
      additional 1% (W/v) of dithiothritol (RAS, Mannheim, Germany), and the sample is frozen at&#xD;
      -70°C. After thawing, mRNA is isolated with the RNA Blood mini Kit (Quiagen) device using the&#xD;
      mRNA standard protocol for cells. RNA is reverse transcribed using SuperScript III&#xD;
      First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, life technologies). The 3&#xD;
      NFAT-regulated genes (IFN-γ, IL-2, GM-CSF) were identified as suitable genes for this essay&#xD;
      from previous studies [18, 26]. Target mRNA sequences of IFN- γ, IL-2, GM-CSF and 3 reference&#xD;
      genes are amplified using commercially available PrimePCR ddPCR Gene Expression Probe Assays&#xD;
      (Biorad) by digital PCR (Biorad).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RGE after TAC intake is calculated as cpeak/c0x100, where c0 is the adjusted number of&#xD;
      transcripts at the TAC predose level and cpeak is the number of transcripts 1.5 (c1.5) hours&#xD;
      after drug intake.&#xD;
