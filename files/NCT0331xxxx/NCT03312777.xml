  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the analgesic effect of Omnitram and tramadol during concurrent&#xD;
      administration of paroxetine. Paroxetine administration is expected to diminish the analgesic&#xD;
      effect of tramadol, but not Omnitram. Each participant will receive paroxetine before and&#xD;
      during treatment with Omnitram, tramadol, and placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigating the steady-state oral&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and hypoalgesic effects of overencapsulated: 20 mg Omnitram (2x10 mg&#xD;
      tablets), 50 mg tramadol (1x50 mg Ultram tablet), and placebo in male and female subjects&#xD;
      made CYP2D6 deficient by paroxetine coadministration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty participants in normal health, 18 to 50 years of age, who meet the entry criteria, will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the three treatments in treatment segment 1. Each arm will ingest&#xD;
      three consecutive 20 mg daily doses of paroxetine. Twelve hours after the first paroxetine&#xD;
      dose, subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences to ingest a total of 9&#xD;
      doses of Omnitram, tramadol, or placebo (one dose every 6 hours). Immediately before the 9th&#xD;
      dose a blood sample will be collected to quantify plasma Omnitram, tramadol, and paroxetine.&#xD;
      After the 9th study drug dose, six blood samples will be collected (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0,&#xD;
      and 8.0 hours after the 9th dose is administered) to quantify the Omnitram and tramadol.&#xD;
      After the 9th dose, pain tolerance will be assessed with a cold pressor test (immersion of&#xD;
      hand in ice cold water). Participants will washout for 11-15 days after treatment 1 and&#xD;
      treatment 2. The study will analyze treatment side effects, the pharmacokinetics, and pain&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
