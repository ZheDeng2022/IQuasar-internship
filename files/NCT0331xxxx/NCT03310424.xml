  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is an important sexually transmitted infection. There has been an epidemic of&#xD;
      syphilis amongst men who have sex with men in the United Kingdom in the last decade. Early&#xD;
      infection with syphilis causes a genital ulcer followed, in the absence of treatment, by a&#xD;
      generalised illness often accompanied by rash. Studies on the pathogenesis of syphilis have&#xD;
      been limited because it is not possible to grow syphilis outside of the body. New approaches&#xD;
      using molecular tests allow the immune response of the patient to infection to be measured&#xD;
      directly from a swab of a genital ulcer or rash and/or a blood sample and also allow the&#xD;
      whole genetic sequence of the bacteria to be obtained from a swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will collect swabs from ulcers or rashes and a blood sample&#xD;
      from patients with syphilis and measure both the response of the patient immune system and&#xD;
      the genetic sequence of the bacteria. Patients will be enrolled at sexual health clinics in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom. Patients will receive standard medical care including standard treatment&#xD;
      for syphilis in line with national guidelines. Standard management already includes&#xD;
      collection of a swab and a blood sample. For this study an additional swab sample and an&#xD;
      additional 5ml of blood will be collected for use in this research project. By better&#xD;
      understanding host immune system responds to infection with syphilis the studies aims to gain&#xD;
      better insights in to the pathogenesis of this important sexually transmitted disease.&#xD;
