      In summary this trial will test whether this new surgical technique can be used to make&#xD;
      surgery safer and more effective whilst allowing improved quality of life for patients having&#xD;
      surgery for prostate cancer. If the technique is proven effective the investigators will use&#xD;
      the experience gained to promote its use throughout the NHS through training courses and&#xD;
      publication and dissemination of the resultant data. Staff from centres participating in this&#xD;
      trial will be fully trained in the NeuroSAFE technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient and public involvement afternoon was held for participants of the NeuroSAFE PROOF&#xD;
      feasibility study, family members, men with prostate cancer, and staff members at UCLH. The&#xD;
      event was supported by the charity Orchid Cancer appeal. The high levels of attendance was&#xD;
      demonstrative of the support within our patient group for the work of this trial. The trial&#xD;
      team listened to the comments made by participants and members of the public and have made&#xD;
      some changes to the design of our trial as a result of this feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is very common and results in the death of many men in the developed world.&#xD;
      Prostate cancer that has not spread outside the prostate can usually be cured by surgical&#xD;
      removal of the prostate gland (radical prostatectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radical Prostatectomy can be associated with urinary incontinence due to damage to the&#xD;
      involuntary sphincter and erectile dysfunction due to damage of the nerves that run within&#xD;
      the outer coverings of the prostate. Surgical sparing of these nerves to preserve quality of&#xD;
      life may risk leaving cancer cells behind often meaning that the patients need extra&#xD;
      treatment with radiotherapy. This trial is designed to evaluate a new method designed to&#xD;
      decrease the risk of compromising cancer control associated with sparing of the nerves as&#xD;
      well as evaluate effects on the need for radiotherapy after surgery if cancer is left behind.&#xD;
      The Investigators will also evaluate effects on the quality of life in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone RARP. The trial is needed now because the nature of prostate cancers treated&#xD;
      surgically is changing rapidly. The techniques developed in low risk cancer to spare the&#xD;
      nerves which run alongside the prostate, may not necessarily be safe when used on the more&#xD;
      aggressive cancers operated on nowadays and if they are adopted without adequate&#xD;
      investigation, the risk is that patients will be exposed to increased risk of cancer&#xD;
      recurrence and needing extra treatment with radiotherapy with consequent side effects and&#xD;
      extra cost to the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the outside of the prostate, within its outermost coverings, run the nerves thought to be&#xD;
      responsible for producing erections. Preservation of these nerves has also been linked to&#xD;
      more rapid reestablishment of urinary continence following surgical removal of the prostate.&#xD;
      Robotic technology has been developed which allows the prostate to be removed through very&#xD;
      small incisions. The surgeons view is magnified in 3D, which facilitates the peeling off of&#xD;
      the outer layers, containing the nerves (so called nerve sparing). With nerve sparing the&#xD;
      nerves controlling erections are left intact whilst the prostate itself, along with the&#xD;
      cancer within it, is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This increases the patient's chances of getting erections of sufficient quality for&#xD;
      penetrative sex. Data from several case series, including our own, suggest that the higher&#xD;
      the degree of nerve sparing performed, the more likely a patient is to be potent and&#xD;
      continent of urine. In our series, bilateral nerve sparing results in 85% of men being able&#xD;
      to get usable erections*, whereas only 45% of men will have useable erections* when only one&#xD;
      side is spared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve sparing has largely been developed and the effects have been evaluated in the USA where&#xD;
      prostate cancer is detected at an earlier stage because PSA screening is performed commonly.&#xD;
      In the UK, where PSA screening is not commonly carried out, tumours resected at surgery are&#xD;
      larger and more aggressive, often having spread through the capsule of the prostate. In&#xD;
      addition, the move away from surgery for small low-grade tumours in the UK means that the&#xD;
      prostate cancers treated by surgery are larger and more aggressive overall. This means that&#xD;
      the tumours are closer to the outer limit of the prostate because the more aggressive tumours&#xD;
      tend to work their way out through the outer capsule of the prostate. A nerve sparing&#xD;
      approach is associated with an increased risk that tumour will be left on the surface of the&#xD;
      resected specimen. This is referred to as a positive surgical margin (PSM). One of the&#xD;
      principles of (radical) cancer surgery is that cancerous tissue should be removed with a&#xD;
      covering of non-cancerous tissue to give the best chance of cure (a so called negative or&#xD;
      clear surgical margin). Positive surgical margins are associated with an increased chance of&#xD;
      recurrence following surgery and require further treatment, usually with radiotherapy, which&#xD;
      is expensive and engenders its own side effects. The investigators plan to evaluate the use&#xD;
      of a modified version of a frozen section technique called NeuroSAFE in promoting nerve&#xD;
      sparing without diminishing the oncological effects of surgery by generating PSMs. During&#xD;
      this frozen section technique, once the prostate is removed, the areas of prostate adjacent&#xD;
      to the spared nerves are sliced from the surgical specimen and rapidly frozen and stained so&#xD;
      that they can be examined carefully by a pathologist. If the pathologist identifies a&#xD;
      positive surgical margin, the spared nervous tissue on that side will be surgically resected&#xD;
      before the patient is woken up at the end of the operation. When this is done the cancer&#xD;
      behaves as if it had been resected with a negative surgical margin at the outset. Frozen&#xD;
      section analysis does not add much time to the surgical procedure, as once the prostate is&#xD;
      removed, the rest of the operation (joining the bladder to the urethra and removing pelvic&#xD;
      lymph nodes) can proceed whilst the frozen section analysis is performed. Patients enrolled&#xD;
      to the trial will be randomised between A) standard UK nerve sparing practice, wherein the&#xD;
      degree to which the nerves can be spared is determined by the operating surgeon based on&#xD;
      clinical examination, biopsy results and multi-parametric MRI and B) bilateral nerve sparing&#xD;
      with frozen section analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Trial team recently surveyed UK robotic prostatectomists and confirm that currently UK&#xD;
      surgeons predominately rely on MRI, biopsy and Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) findings to&#xD;
      determine whether they can spare nerves, but that there is little consistency in the means by&#xD;
      which a surgeon decides whether or not they can spare nerves in a particular case. Our survey&#xD;
      tells us that UK surgeons do not use frozen section to direct nerve sparing with only 5% of&#xD;
      UK prostatectomists ever having used it at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the potential outcomes of this research? This trial will provide a thorough&#xD;
      evaluation of a new technique designed to minimise the occurrence of PSM and exposure to&#xD;
      extra treatment or cancer recurrence. It will generate vital data regarding the cost/benefit&#xD;
      of using this procedure. The relationship between the degree and frequency of nerve sparing&#xD;
      on quality of life will be evaluated in terms of sexual potency and urinary continence in UK&#xD;
      patients undergoing RALP. The assessment of these functions will include patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
