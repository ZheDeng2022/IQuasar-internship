      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA is a structure in the body. It contains data about how the body develops and works.&#xD;
      Telomeres are found on the end of chromosomes in DNA. Some people with short telomeres or&#xD;
      other gene changes can develop diseases of the bone marrow, lung, and liver. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if low doses of the hormone drug danazol can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety and effect of low dose danazol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 3 and older with a telomere disease who have either very short telomeres and a&#xD;
      specific gene change. They must also show signs of aplastic anemia, lung, or liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung exam. They will breathe into an instrument that records the amount and rate of air&#xD;
           breathed in and out over a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6-minute walking test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal ultrasound and liver scan. These tests use sound waves to measure the fibrosis&#xD;
           in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small sample of the liver removed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy. The bone will be numbed and a small needle will take a sample of the&#xD;
           marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have hormone levels checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All child participants will see a pediatric endocrinologist. Children may need to have a hand&#xD;
      x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will monitor patients for 6 months before starting danazol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take danazol by mouth twice a day for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must return to the clinic at 6 months and 12 months while on danazol and 6&#xD;
      months after stopping it. They will have blood and urine tests, a lung exam, abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound, and liver scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Telomere disease is caused by accelerated telomere attrition and results in multi-organ&#xD;
      dysfunction. Telomeres are nucleotide repeats of non-coding DNA at the end of the chromosomes&#xD;
      which function as protective caps to prevent erosion of genomic DNA during cell division and&#xD;
      to protect chromosomes from recognition as single stranded DNA. Telomeric DNA is elongated by&#xD;
      the telomerase complex, which is comprised of a reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit&#xD;
      (encoded by TERT), an RNA template (encoded by TERC) and associated proteins. Telomerase&#xD;
      activity is crucial in maintaining telomere length in cells with a high proliferative&#xD;
      capacity, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and lymphocytes. Presentation of&#xD;
      telomeropathies can vary from severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and dyskeratosis congenital (DKC)&#xD;
      early in childhood, to pulmonary or hepatic fibrosis later in life. There is no standard of&#xD;
      care for the treatment of telomere disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable evidence suggests that sex hormones regulate telomerase. Calado et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that human lymphocytes and CD34+ hematopoietic cells up regulate both TERT gene&#xD;
      expression and telomerase enzymatic activity in response to androgens in vitro. A recent&#xD;
      observational cohort study demonstrated hematologic response in 14 of 16 pediatric patients&#xD;
      with DKC treated with androgens. In a prospective trial from our Branch, Townsley et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients with telomere diseases who were treated with the synthetic sex&#xD;
      hormone danazol showed telomere elongation, and hematologic response were seen in 79% of&#xD;
      patients after only three months of treatment. This study used the highest dose of danazol,&#xD;
      800 mg daily, and known adverse effects, such as elevated liver enzyme levels and muscle&#xD;
      cramps, occurred in 41% and 33% of patients, respectively. Overall the treatment was well&#xD;
      tolerated, but some patients did require dose reduction. After 27 patients were enrolled, the&#xD;
      study was halted early, because telomere attrition was reduced in all 12 patients who could&#xD;
      be evaluated for the primary endpoint. Because of the limited power, we were unable to draw&#xD;
      definitive conclusions regarding further clinical effect of danazol but stabilization or&#xD;
      improvement was observed in a few cases in other organ function, measured by DLCO for&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis and Fibroscan for cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now propose a phase II study designed to determine the efficacy of low dose danazol in&#xD;
      decreasing the rate of telomere attrition in subjects with a short age-adjusted telomere&#xD;
      length. The secondary aim is to determine the clinical effect of this therapy in conditions&#xD;
      that are related to short telomeres, to include cytopenia(s), pulmonary fibrosis, and/or&#xD;
      hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
