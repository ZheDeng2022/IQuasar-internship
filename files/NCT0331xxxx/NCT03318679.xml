  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is present in 50 percent of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients with&#xD;
      hyperglycemia have higher in hospital, 30 and 90 day mortality and morbidity. Sixty percent&#xD;
      of these patients have some form of diabetic syndrome, known or unknown. Remaining 40% of&#xD;
      patients are not diabetic. Contrary to logic patients with non diabetic hyperglycemia (NDH)&#xD;
      have statistically higher morbidity and mortality compared to the diabetic hyperglycemia (DH)&#xD;
      cohort. So far multiple treatment trials (THIS, GRASP, GIST-UK, SHINE ongoing) with differing&#xD;
      treatment goals have shown no clear benefit, however no obvious distinction was made along&#xD;
      the diabetic and non-diabetic hyperglycemic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hyperglycemia in the acute phase was the only culprit in worsening the injury, then there&#xD;
      should be no difference in the outcomes for DH and NDH. Existing data implies that the two&#xD;
      categories are two distinct physiological entities that are thus not amenable to same&#xD;
      treatment. Stating it simply NDH is not an insulin deficient state where as DH is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative possibility is that body and Neurons are accustomed to high sugars in diabetics&#xD;
      and thus can tolerate higher sugars better during ischemic stroke compared to non diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypothesis is that reducing blood sugars in NDH increases stroke volume and&#xD;
      thus consequently worsens outcome.&#xD;

      1.1 Background Hyperglycemia is present in 50 percent of patients with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Patients with hyperglycemia have higher in hospital, 30 and 90 day mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
      Sixty percent of these patients have some form of diabetic syndrome, known or unknown.&#xD;
      Remaining 40% of patients are not diabetic. Contrary to logic patients with non diabetic&#xD;
      hyperglycemia (NDH) have statistically higher morbidity and mortality compared to the&#xD;
      diabetic hyperglycemia (DH) cohort. So far multiple treatment trials (THIS, GRASP, GIST-UK,&#xD;
      SHINE ongoing) with different treatment goals have shown no clear benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If hyperglycemia in the acute phase was the only culprit in worsening the injury, then there&#xD;
      should be no difference in the outcomes for DH and NDH. Existing data implies that the two&#xD;
      categories are distinct physiological entities that are thus not amenable to same treatment.&#xD;
      Stating it simply NDH is not an insulin deficient state where as DH is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative possibility is that body and Neurons are accustomed to high sugars in diabetics&#xD;
      and thus can tolerate higher sugars better during ischemic stroke compared to non diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypothesis is that reducing blood sugars in NDH increases stroke volume and&#xD;
      thus consequently worsens outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Investigational Agent: No planned investigational agent is tested as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Pre-clinical Data Currently there is clear data that patients that present with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke have higher (two times) mortality at discharge and 90 day mark. Multiple&#xD;
      clinical studies so far have not revealed any clear benefit of treatment (GIST-UK). There do&#xD;
      seem to be two distinct groups when it comes to hyperglycemia at presentation of DM, HG in&#xD;
      association of Diabetes and without any history of Diabetes. The outcomes in the two groups&#xD;
      vary greatly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Clinical Data to Date Please see attached article with references.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits There is no drug or device or intervention that will be&#xD;
      tested in this study. This study involves collection of blood samples from the patients who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria. Our goal is to be able to see if there is any difference between&#xD;
      the two groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Assess difference in laboratory values between two groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in laboratory values between DH and NDH&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 General Design This is a exploratory study to assess the difference in the lab values in&#xD;
      two groups of patients. Patients that present to University of Minnesota Medical Center with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke and are hyperglycemic (Blood sugar of more than 130 mg/dl) will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. Pre-specified volume of blood will be collected for lab analysis.&#xD;
      This study does not involve testing of any procedure, drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step One - Identify patients that have Ischemic strokes and have hyperglycemia &gt;130 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Two:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Obtain Consent from patient or POA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Three:(Once consent obtained) - Collect first set of blood samples from patients with&#xD;
      the first blood draw between 0-8 hours from time of ER arrival. Second blood sample will be&#xD;
      collected in 9-16 hours and a 3rd one in 17-24 hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step Four:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - No further data will be collected from patient. Study end point is difference in laboratory&#xD;
      values between DH and NDH groups.&#xD;
