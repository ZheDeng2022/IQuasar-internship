      The objective of the this study was to examine the amount and duration of tea consumption in&#xD;
      relation to the risk of renal stone disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have investigated the association between tea consumption and renal stone&#xD;
      disease, but the results are still unclear. Besides, the impact of the duration of tea&#xD;
      consumption has not yet been investigated in the aforementioned studies. The present study&#xD;
      was conducted as a retrospective research to investigate the relationship between both tea&#xD;
      consumption amount and time and renal stone disease. Information on tea consumption was&#xD;
      obtained by four closed-ended questions in questionnaires, and the diagnosis of renal stones&#xD;
      was established on the results of abdominal sonography.&#xD;
