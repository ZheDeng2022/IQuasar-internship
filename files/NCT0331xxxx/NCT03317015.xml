      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess efficacy of Nasacort® (triamcinolone) nasal spray, 55 µg per dose, in&#xD;
           comparison with Flixonase® (fluticasone) nasal spray, 50 µg per dose, by reflective&#xD;
           total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) (24 h) after 28 days of treatment compared with&#xD;
           baseline (0 day of treatment) in adult patients suffering from PAR (perennial allergic&#xD;
           rhinitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety of Nasacort® (triamcinolone) nasal spray, in comparison with&#xD;
           Flixonase® (fluticasone) administered for 28 days by assessment of adverse events&#xD;
           reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate patient and physician satisfaction after 28 days of treatment by 5-point&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate improvement of quality of life during the study by mini Rhinoconjunctivitis&#xD;
           Quality of Life Questionnaire (miniRQLQ).&#xD;
