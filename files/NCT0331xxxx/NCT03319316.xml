  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2-arm open-label, randomized comparative phase II study in each of two&#xD;
      separate cohorts (non-squamous NSCLC and squamous NSCLC) according to histology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive four cycles of standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Upon&#xD;
      confirmation of response or tumor stabilization, patients will be registered and allocated&#xD;
      into two cohorts based on the tumor histology and each cohort will be randomized into two&#xD;
      arms. The experimental arm will receive combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab, the other&#xD;
      arm is according to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a maintenance approach with the&#xD;
      combination immunotherapy with durvalumab + tremelimumab improves progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) compared to standard of care in patients with advanced NSCLC. Each cohort is powered&#xD;
      separately based on PFS.&#xD;

                  EGFR-mutation, no known EML4-ALK translocation. When a patient with non-squamous&#xD;
                  NSCLC has a KRAS mutation, further testing for EGFR and EML4-ALK is not&#xD;
                  necessary. For squamous NSCLC, EGFR and EML4-ALK testing is not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Availability of adequate in quality and quantity archived tumor material for IHC&#xD;
                  PD-L1 testing; (Preferably 15 but 8 mandatory slides or block of tumor tissue&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patient with history of another primary malignancy are eligible in the following&#xD;
                  cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years&#xD;

                  of disease&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
                  test within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;

        Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of&#xD;
        becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,&#xD;
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been&#xD;
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if&#xD;
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight,&#xD;
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control&#xD;
             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and from&#xD;
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or 180 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination. A highly effective method of&#xD;
             birth control is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less&#xD;
             than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,&#xD;
             injectable, implantable)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Vasectomized partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexual abstinence (the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in&#xD;
             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment, from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab&#xD;

             therapy or pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
