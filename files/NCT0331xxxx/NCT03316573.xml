  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      aggressive lymphoma or a histiocyte or dendritic cell neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug is an antibody that targets a molecule called PD-1. PD-1 is used to turn down&#xD;
      the immune system. In general, this is used by the body to prevent the immune system from&#xD;
      being too active. However, several cancers appear to use this pathway to prevent the immune&#xD;
      system from attacking them. The theory behind this study is that by blocking PD-1, we may be&#xD;
      able to prevent the cancer from hiding from the immune system and allow the immune system to&#xD;
      attack the cancer more effectively. There is evidence that the type of lymphoma the&#xD;
      participant have may use PD-1 to escape the immune system.&#xD;
