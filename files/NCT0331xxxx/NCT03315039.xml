    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study that will determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of liposomal annamycin as a single&#xD;
      agent for the treatment of subjects with AML that is refractory to or relapsed after standard&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML by World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
             classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. AML that is refractory to or relapsed after standard induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥18 years at the time of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No chemotherapy, radiation, or major surgery within two weeks prior to first dose of&#xD;
             study drug and/or recovered from the toxic side effects of that therapy, unless&#xD;
             treatment is indicated due to progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No investigational therapy within four weeks of the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate laboratory results including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless due to Gilbert&#xD;
                  Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic&#xD;
                  transaminase (SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase &lt;3 times the ULN) unless due to&#xD;
                  organ involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adequate renal function (The Cockcroft-Gault equation will be used to estimate&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance. This equation is as follows: Creatinine clearance in ml/min&#xD;
                  = (140 - age) x body weight (kg)/72 x plasma creatinine (mg/dL); multiplied by&#xD;
                  0.85 for women. Using this equation, adequate renal function will be deemed to be&#xD;
                  a creatinine clearance of greater than 60 ml/minute.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Prior anthracycline cumulative dose below 551 mg/m2 or the daunorubicin equivalent&#xD;
             which is the recommended non-cardiotoxic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject can understand and sign the informed consent document, can communicate with&#xD;
             the investigator, and can understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All men and women must agree to practice effective contraception during the entire&#xD;
             study period and after discontinuing study drug, unless documentation of infertility&#xD;
             exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Sexually active, fertile women must use two effective forms of contraception&#xD;
                  (abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or double barrier device)&#xD;
                  from the time of informed consent and until at least 6 months after discontinuing&#xD;
                  study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Sexually active men and their sexual partners must use effective contraceptive&#xD;
                  methods from the time of subject informed consent and until at least 3 months&#xD;
                  after discontinuing study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects diagnosed with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concomitant therapy that includes other chemotherapy that is or may be active against&#xD;
             AML except for prophylaxis and/or treatment of opportunistic or other infection with&#xD;
             antibiotics, antifungals and/or antiviral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior mediastinal radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the subject at&#xD;
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive risk assessment for cardiovascular disease including prior anthracycline&#xD;
             cumulative dose more than 50% above recommended non-cardiotoxic levels, left&#xD;
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, valvular heart disease, or severe&#xD;
             hypertension, (see Table 1). Cardiac subjects with a New York Heart Association (NYHA)&#xD;
             classification of 3 or 4 will be excluded. (Cardiology consultation should be&#xD;
             requested if any question arises about cardiac function.) This also includes subjects&#xD;
             with baseline QT/QTc interval &gt;480 msec, a history of additional risk factors for TdP&#xD;
             (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) and using&#xD;
             concomitant medications that significantly prolong the QT/QTc interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically relevant serious co-morbid medical conditions including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, active infection, recent (less than or equal to six months) myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             unstable angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive pulmonary&#xD;
             disease, active CNS disease uncontrolled by standard of care, known positive status&#xD;
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or active hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant, lactating, or not using adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known allergy to anthracyclines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any evidence of mucositis/stomatitis or previous history of severe (≥Grade 3)&#xD;
             mucositis from prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Required use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP enzymes and transporters.&#xD;
