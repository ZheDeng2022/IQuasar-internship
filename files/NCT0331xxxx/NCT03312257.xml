      This study will test whether the combined treatment of 0.01% atropine and soft bifocal&#xD;
      contact lens wear produces slower myopia progression and axial elongation compared to soft&#xD;
      bifocal contact lenses alone in children ages 7 to 11 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both atropine and soft bifocal contact lenses have been shown to slow myopia progression, and&#xD;
      both can cause changes in choroidal thickness. But the relationship between these mechanisms&#xD;
      is unclear. The central hypothesis to be tested in the BAM Study is that atropine and soft&#xD;
      bifocal contact lenses each exert their anti-progression actions through a common pathway&#xD;
      that involves the choroid. If this is correct, then adding atropine treatment to soft bifocal&#xD;
      contact lens wear will lead to a more effective slowing of myopia progression than&#xD;
      prescribing soft bifocal contact lenses alone due to the additive effects in the common&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BAM Study is an ancillary study of an NIH sponsored multi-center, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, the Bifocal Lenses In Nearsighted Kids (BLINK) Study (NIH: U10EY023208; NCT:&#xD;
      NCT02255474). The BLINK Study compares myopia progression between subjects who wear single&#xD;
      vision contact lenses and those wearing soft bifocal contact lenses. The BAM Study enrolls an&#xD;
      additional 49 subjects that are age-matched with the participants who are wearing +2.50D add&#xD;
      soft bifocal contact lenses in the BLINK Study. The subjects in the BAM Study wear +2.50D add&#xD;
      soft bifocal contact lenses in combination with daily administration of one drop of 0.01%&#xD;
      atropine in each eye for three years. The rates of myopia progression and axial elongation&#xD;
      will be compared to the rates in participants who are receiving treatment with +2.50D add&#xD;
      soft bifocal contact lenses alone in the BLINK Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To test whether the combined treatment of 0.01%&#xD;
      atropine and soft bifocal contact lens wear produces slower myopia progression and axial&#xD;
      elongation compared to soft bifocal contact lenses alone over 3 years. Aim 2: To test whether&#xD;
      early changes in choroidal thickness can be used as predictors of long-term myopia&#xD;
      progression / axial elongation. The results of this study will have significant implications&#xD;
      for future studies to develop and test new therapeutic regimes that optimize the effect of&#xD;
      myopia control through combined pharmacological and optical interventions. The outcomes will&#xD;
      also aid in understanding the potential role of short-term changes of choroidal thickness in&#xD;
      long- term regulation of myopia progression and ocular growth.&#xD;
