      A-REPEAT (Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor -EGFR- rechallenge and plasma genotyping of&#xD;
      patients with advanced colorectal tumors) is a Greek, investigator-initiated, single arm&#xD;
      open-label phase II study of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in combination with chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Patients with a metastatic, histologically&#xD;
      proven colorectal carcinoma RAS wild type will be treated with a combination of panitumumab&#xD;
      and third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX,FOLFIRI or&#xD;
      irinotecan monotherapy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few clinical studies have evaluated the role of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients and there is no prospective clinical trial assessing the activity&#xD;
      of treatment rechallenge with panitumumab-based therapy after initial progression. This study&#xD;
      aims at exploring the concept of evolution and expansion of RAS wild type clones in order to&#xD;
      restore sensitivity of the tumor to prior anti-EGFR therapy after a time interval in which a&#xD;
      different, non-anti-EGFR second-line therapy is administered. Based on aforementioned data,&#xD;
      it is hypothesized that rescue through rechallenge with panitumumab-based third-line therapy&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy could be associated with further response and clinical benefit. A&#xD;
      significant component of the proposed prospective trial is exploratory translational: cell&#xD;
      free plasma and platelet-based genotyping for genetic mutations in different time points will&#xD;
      be undertaken in order to study the genetic composition of the metastatic tumour at&#xD;
      initiation of and at progression through, anti-EGFR rechallenge therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of overall response rate, of the&#xD;
      addition of panitumumab rechallenge to standard third-line irinotecan-based or&#xD;
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer initially&#xD;
      treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line&#xD;
      chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints include to identify, in the context of translational research, tumour&#xD;
      tissue and blood-based biomarkers with prognostic/predictive significance in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer treated with rechallenge panitumumab in combination with&#xD;
      standard third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, who were initially&#xD;
      treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line&#xD;
      chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agent.&#xD;
