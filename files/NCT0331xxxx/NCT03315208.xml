  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a preliminary trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of adding a transdiagnostic, emotion-focused group intervention&#xD;
      (the Unified Protocol, UP) to treatment as usual (TAU) in a comprehensive outpatient program&#xD;
      for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and emotional distress. Only&#xD;
      patients seeking services or engaged in care at an existing outpatient program at MGH (the&#xD;
      Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for participation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adults with substance use disorder (SUD) commonly experience co-occurring emotional&#xD;
      distress in the form of affective/emotional disorders (i.e. anxiety, depressive, and related&#xD;
      disorders) and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs). Based on the conceptualization&#xD;
      of emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic treatment target, the current study utilizes&#xD;
      the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) to target core&#xD;
      psychopathological processes related to emotion dysregulation that underlie SITBs and&#xD;
      emotional disorder pathology. Given its transdiagnostic format, the UP has the potential to&#xD;
      address comorbidity among the emotional disorders (and other functionally similar problems&#xD;
      such as SUDs) simultaneously and more comprehensively than single-diagnosis treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seeking services or currently engaged in care at an existing comprehensive&#xD;
      outpatient program for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders (the MGH&#xD;
      Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for this study. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 to receive either UP + TAU or TAU alone. The adjunctive UP intervention&#xD;
      consists of 16 twice-weekly group sessions (delivered over an 8-week period) designed to&#xD;
      deliver transdiagnostic, emotion-focused CBT strategies.&#xD;
