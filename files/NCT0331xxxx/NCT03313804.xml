  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head/neck&#xD;
      squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) patients who are already initiating an immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor (such as Nivolumab, Atezolizumab or Pembrolizumab) for disease treatment as per FDA&#xD;
      approved guidelines. In these patients we will deliver a short-course radiation to a single&#xD;
      systemic (non-CNS) site within 14 days of receiving the first dose of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors. This sequence allows radiation to release tumor antigens from immune inaccessible&#xD;
      areas such as necrotic tumor or low perfusion to provide a robust anti-tumor immune response&#xD;
      with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess six-month progression free survival (PFS) compared to&#xD;
      historical control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with front-line or relapsed NSCLC or relapsed HNSCC who are intended to receive&#xD;
      standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors without a contraindication to Stereotactic Body&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to a single cancer deposit greater than 1 cm (metastasis or primary&#xD;
      cancer) will be enrolled. Subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors and within 2 weeks of initiation, and will receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SBRT to target to achieve Biological Equivalent Dose (BED) &gt; 100 Gy OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30 Gy fractionated radiation therapy (RT) delivered as a 3 dimensional (3-D) dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lesion choice will be made by the treating radiation oncologist and will be directed to a&#xD;
      single malignant focus (non-CNS) that measures ≥ 1 cm. Essentially, the goals of both&#xD;
      techniques are the same but SBRT is reserved for lesions that are readily encompassed by a&#xD;
      single field with large RT fractions in which dose-limiting organs are within safe limits.&#xD;
