      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib and trifluridine and&#xD;
      tipiracil hydrochloride in treating patients with colon or rectal cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (advanced/metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Trametinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving trametinib and trifluridine&#xD;
      and tipiracil hydrochloride may prevent cancer cells from dividing and work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with colon and rectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of trametinib and&#xD;
      trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride (TAS-102) in patients with chemotherapy-resistant&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the safety of the combination of trametinib and TAS-102 across all investigated&#xD;
      dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe the clinical activity including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the combination in an expansion cohort using&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and 8-12 and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then bi-annually&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
