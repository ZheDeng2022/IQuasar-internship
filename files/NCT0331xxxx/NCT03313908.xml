  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It is the main cause of cancer deaths among&#xD;
      women. The incidence of non-palpable tumors is estimated at 60%. Their better prognosis and&#xD;
      their small size encourage the investigators for finding methods simpler and more efficient&#xD;
      to treat them by breast-conserving surgery with acceptable cosmetic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-operative detection of the tumor lesion is currently carried out by two methods: the&#xD;
      radioactive seed localization and guidewire technique. Each has its disadvantages: the&#xD;
      guidewire is uncomfortable for the patients (pain, hematomes..), whereas the radiocolloid&#xD;
      requires a specialized and complex organization around this radioactive product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a novel method of using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence has been described in&#xD;
      breast cancer and seems promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators evaluate the feasibility and performance of indocyanine green&#xD;
      fluorescence in non-palpable tumor detection in comparison with radioactive seed localization&#xD;
      (ROLL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are evaluate the feasibility of the location by the radiologist,&#xD;
      feasibility of detection by the surgeon, study of the product and the probe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study is prospectively conducted during six months of 2017-2018 in the department of&#xD;
      gynaecology of Montpellier .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes ten women. Patients will receive both techniques: indocyanine green&#xD;
      fluorescence (experimental technique) and radiocolloid (reference technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion will be during the preoperative consultation after checking the inclusion / non&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and signing a written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactive localization with technetium will be done on surgery eve like usual. Fluorescence&#xD;
      localization with ICG will be done in the operating room under general anesthesia by the&#xD;
      radiologist under ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By a probe (Euromedical instruments), surgeon identified and marked the site of the skin by&#xD;
      observing the area of the ICG fluorescence. Then, in the same way, the surgeon marked the&#xD;
      tumor by the radioactive probe detecting the radioactive signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An picture will be made of these two markers and it will be noted the distance between them.&#xD;
      Dissection and excision of the tumor using the radiocolloid probe (no modification of&#xD;
      surgical management). At the end of the surgical procedure, verification of no residual&#xD;
      radioactivity and no residual fluorescence. Again, surgeon identified and marked in the&#xD;
      excised sample the area of fluorescence and radioactive. The pathological examination of the&#xD;
      resected specimen will describe positions of mark compared tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data were recorded prospectively: demographics, medical history, localization&#xD;
      of tumor, surgery, pathology results.&#xD;
