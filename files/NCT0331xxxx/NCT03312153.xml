    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of Neem (azadirachta indica) and 2.5% sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite as root canal irrigants on the intensity of post-operative pain and the amount&#xD;
      of endotoxins in necrotic teeth.&#xD;

      According to the eligibility and exclusion criteria the patients will be selected and&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups. The operator N.S. will complete endodontic treatment of all&#xD;
      cases in two visits as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anaesthetizing the tooth using inferior alveolar nerve block followed by buccal&#xD;
           infiltration technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Isolation the tooth with a rubber dam and disinfect the tooth using sterile swabs&#xD;
           moistened with 30% H2O2 (v/v) for 30 seconds followed by 5.25% NaOCl for 30 seconds and&#xD;
           5% sodium thiosulphate for inactivation of the disinfecting agents .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Performing access cavity preparation in two stage :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The first stage: will be performed to allow removal of contamination which includes&#xD;
                carious lesions and restoration using high speed sterile round bur and diamond&#xD;
                stone.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. In second stage: before entering the pulp chamber, the access cavity will be&#xD;
                disinfected .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For endotoxins sampling, the first sample (S1):&#xD;
&#xD;
           N.S. will take the sample by introducing a sterile paper point (size #15) into the full&#xD;
           working length of the wider / largest canals or canals that show presence of the&#xD;
           exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. N.S. will place the sample in a sterile glass for further Enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
           assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the first sampling,Taking working length using electronic apex locator and then&#xD;
           will be confirmed radio-graphically .&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Performing the biomechanical preparation for the two groups in a crown-down technique&#xD;
           using ProTaper Next rotary system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Irrigation with 2mL of specified irrigation either 2.5% NaOCl or Neem irrigant will be&#xD;
           performed each time instrument is changed with 30-gauge side-vented needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. After complete mechanical preparation, the root canals will be flushed using 5mL of&#xD;
           sterile saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Before the second sampling (S2):&#xD;
&#xD;
           N.S. will irrigate the prepared root canal with 5 mL of 17% EDTA solution for 3 minutes&#xD;
           followed by a final rinse with 5 mL of a sterile saline solution to remove smear layer.&#xD;
           NS will seal the access cavity with temporary filling material.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Scheduling the second appointment 1 week after the first appointment;. NS will irrigate&#xD;
           the root canals with 5 mL of a sterile saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. N.S. will give the patients a pain diary to record the postoperative pain after 6,12,24&#xD;
           and 48h post-instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. in second appointment: After master cone fit radiograph and selection of the master&#xD;
           cone, all canals will be filled using cold lateral condensation technique with&#xD;
           resin-based sealer.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. N.S. will give the patients another pain diary to record the postoperative pain after 6,&#xD;
           12, 24 and 48 hours post-obturation.&#xD;
