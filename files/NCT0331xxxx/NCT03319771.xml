      The two primary study objectives involve examining the effects of treadmill walking exercise&#xD;
      training versus stretching-and-toning activities on the primary and secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: The first specific aim is to examine the effects of 3-months of treadmill&#xD;
      walking exercise training compared with an active control condition on learning and memory&#xD;
      outcomes in fully-ambulatory persons with MS who have impairment in learning new information.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that those who undergo treadmill walking exercise training will demonstrate&#xD;
      improvements in learning and memory relative to those who undergo stretching-and-toning&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: The second specific aim is to examine the effects of 3-months of treadmill&#xD;
      walking exercise training compared with an active control condition on hippocampal volume,&#xD;
      hippocampal resting-state functional connectivity, and cardiorespiratory fitness in those&#xD;
      persons with MS. We hypothesize that those who are randomly assigned to the treadmill walking&#xD;
      exercise condition will demonstrate increases in hippocampal volume and resting-state&#xD;
      functional connectivity (i.e., adaptive increases) and improved cardiorespiratory fitness&#xD;
      relative to those in the stretching-and-toning condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study involves a single-blind, Phase I randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the&#xD;
      effects of supervised treadmill walking exercise training on learning and memory, hippocampal&#xD;
      structure/function, and cardiorespiratory fitness outcomes in fully-ambulatory (i.e., EDSS ≤&#xD;
      4.0) persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have impairment in learning new information.&#xD;
      This study will compare the effects of 3 months of supervised, progressive (both intensity&#xD;
      and duration) chronic treadmill walking exercise (designed based on pilot work [Sandroff et&#xD;
      al., 2015; 2016a; 2016b] and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines) with&#xD;
      those of an active control condition (i.e., stretching-and-toning activities) on learning and&#xD;
      memory, hippocampal volume and resting-state functional connectivity, and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness. Learning and memory represents the primary outcome, whereas hippocampal volume and&#xD;
      resting-state functional connectivity and cardiorespiratory fitness represent the secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. Such an investigation will provide the first Class I evidence for the effects of&#xD;
      treadmill walking exercise training on those outcomes in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During baseline, participants will first complete a battery of neuropsychological tests,&#xD;
      followed by an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a motor-driven treadmill to measure&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, and will undergo a MRI scan. Those outcomes will be measured by&#xD;
      assessors who are blinded to condition. Participants will undertake several&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests addressing various aspects of learning and memory. These tests&#xD;
      include the California Verbal Learning Test-2 [Delis et al., 2000] and Selective Reminding&#xD;
      Task [Buschke &amp; Fuld, 1974] as measures of verbal learning and memory, and the Brief&#xD;
      Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised [Benedict, 1997] and 10/36 Spatial Recall Test [Rao et al.,&#xD;
      1984] as measures of visuospatial learning and memory. Cognitive processing speed will be&#xD;
      measured using the Symbol Digit Modalities Test [Smith, 1982], verbal fluency will be&#xD;
      measured using the Controlled Oral Word Association Test [Benton, 1994], and executive&#xD;
      control (i.e., inhibitory control) will be measured using a modified flanker task [Eriksen &amp;&#xD;
      Eriksen, 1974]. Cardiorespiratory fitness will be measured as peak oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2peak), using an incremental exercise test to exhaustion on a motor-driven treadmill and&#xD;
      an open-circuit spirometry system (ParvoMedics True One 2400, Sandy, UT) for analyzing&#xD;
      expired gases using a modified Balke protocol. This protocol is commonly used for measuring&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness in older adults [e.g. Colcombe et al., 2004] and persons with&#xD;
      chronic stroke [e.g., Macko et al., 1997] and further is consistent with the ACSM guidelines&#xD;
      for exercise testing of MS patients [ACSM, 2013]. Lastly, participants will undergo&#xD;
      structural and resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance images of the&#xD;
      hippocampus. The MR instrument that will be used is an FDA-approved Siemens 3 T clinical&#xD;
      imager. Following baseline testing, participants will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      exercise training or active control condition using concealment. Participants further will&#xD;
      blinded to condition (i.e., unaware that the treadmill walking exercise training condition&#xD;
      represents the experimental condition and the stretching-and-toning condition represents the&#xD;
      active control condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise training will include 3-months of supervised, progressive light, moderate, and&#xD;
      vigorous intensity treadmill walking exercise, and will be based on ACSM guidelines for&#xD;
      exercise prescription [ACSM, 2013]. We selected treadmill walking exercise as the aerobic&#xD;
      exercise modality based on pilot work that suggests that treadmill walking might exert larger&#xD;
      beneficial effects on cognition compared with stationary cycling [Sandroff et al., 2015], and&#xD;
      that such benefits occur for light, moderate, and vigorous intensity treadmill walking&#xD;
      exercise [Sandroff et al., 2016]. The exercise training itself will take place 3 times per&#xD;
      week over 3 months, led by trained exercise leaders, and will initially consist of 15 minutes&#xD;
      of light-to-moderate intensity treadmill walking exercise and eventually progress to 40&#xD;
      minutes of vigorous intensity exercise by month 3. The stretching-and-toning activities will&#xD;
      be included as a minimal exercise, active control condition. The control condition will be&#xD;
      delivered using the same frequency and duration of the treadmill walking exercise condition.&#xD;
      The stretching-and-toning activities will be based on a manual provided by the National&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Society, and stretching-and-toning activities will be progressively&#xD;
      included over the course of the 3-month study period. Participants will further be asked to&#xD;
      not undertake additional exercise (i.e., not join a gym and begin exercising) over the&#xD;
      duration of the study. The cognitive, cardiorespiratory fitness, and MRI outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed again following the 3-month study period by assessors who are blinded to condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed using mixed-factor ANOVA with time (pre- and post-) as a&#xD;
      within-subjects factor and condition (exercise or control) as a between-subjects factor on&#xD;
      learning and memory, hippocampal, and cardiorespiratory fitness outcomes (see Specific&#xD;
      Aims/Hypotheses 1 and 2 in the Primary Study Objectives and Study Hypothesis sections).&#xD;
      Effect sizes will be expressed as partial eta-squared (ηp2) and Cohen's d [Cohen, 1988].&#xD;
      Spearman's rho rank-order correlations (ρ) will be performed for the associations among&#xD;
      changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, hippocampal structure/function, and learning and memory&#xD;
      for those who underwent the treadmill walking exercise training condition (See Specific&#xD;
      Aims/Hypotheses 3 and 4 in the Secondary Study Objectives and Study Hypothesis sections). The&#xD;
      effect sizes from the interaction terms from the ANOVAs and correlations will serve as effect&#xD;
      sizes for the subsequent power analyses required for a subsequent Phase II RCT.&#xD;
