  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury is a frequent purpose for consultation in emergency services. Management of&#xD;
      brain injury is time and resource consuming, combining clinical monitoring and imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stage prior to the management of the victims of brain injury is stratification of the&#xD;
      severity, potential or proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe brain injury requires emergent brain CT-scan, ideally within one hour of the first&#xD;
      medical contact. Patients requiring this strategy present with focused neurological deficit,&#xD;
      Glasgow score &lt;15 to 2 hours after the trauma, suspicion of open fracture of the skull or&#xD;
      dish pan fracture, any signs of fracture of the skull base (hemotympanum, bilateral&#xD;
      peri-orbital ecchymosis), otorrhea or rhinorrhea of cerebrospinal fluid, more than one&#xD;
      episode of vomiting in adults, and posttraumatic convulsion. Patients benefiting from&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy are included in this category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Victims of brain injury that do not fall into this category are considered less critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By definition, mild traumatic brain injury :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a trauma of the cephalic extremity :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whose Glasgow score (30 min after the trauma or during the consultation) is 13-15,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  associated with one or more of the following: confusion; disorientation; loss of&#xD;
           consciousness of 30 min or less; post-traumatic amnesia of less than 24 hours; other&#xD;
           transient neurological abnormalities (focal signs, epileptic seizures, non-surgical&#xD;
           intracranial lesion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these patients, some are considered at risk of developing intracerebral lesions.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it should be noted that the prevalence of hemorrhagic complications is&#xD;
      radically different between patients with a Glasgow score of 13 and those with a score of 15.&#xD;
      Thus, the recommendations suggest a brain scan without injection of contrast media within 4&#xD;
      to 8 hours for patients with the following characteristics :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a retrograde amnesia of more than 30 minutes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a loss of consciousness or amnesia associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  either a risk mechanism (pedestrian overturned by a motor vehicle, ejection of a&#xD;
                vehicle, falling by more than one meter),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  or an age&gt; 65 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  or coagulation disorders, including the use of platelet aggregation therapy.&#xD;
                Patients who fall outside this definition are considered low risk of complication&#xD;
                and should not benefit of imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the scientific literature show that an early brain CT-scan allows identification of&#xD;
      post-traumatic lesions in this population. Nevertheless, organizational problems, including&#xD;
      the availability of the imaging, radiation, and disruption of surveillance related to patient&#xD;
      displacement, are limitations to this strategy. In contrast, the low cost-effectiveness of CT&#xD;
      scan is often advocated in patients with mild traumatic brain injury. For example, in the&#xD;
      Octopus study, 52 of 1316 patients who received CT scan after mild head trauma had an&#xD;
      intracerebral lesion. Among these patients, 39 (3%) had intracerebral lesion related to&#xD;
      trauma; for 13 (1%) patients, the link with the trauma was uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, the search of alternatives for a safer, more conservative, more efficient practice,&#xD;
      one of the objectives of which is to limit the undue use of cerebral scanning. Thus, many&#xD;
      teams have been interested in the use of biological variables to guide the decision to use&#xD;
      imagery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among candidate biomarkers, the S100B protein has been the subject of many evaluations which&#xD;
      allow it to be used in current practice. Indeed, the increase of the S100B protein carried&#xD;
      out within 3 hours following a mild head trauma makes it possible to identify the patients at&#xD;
      risk of intracerebral lesion and to target the indications of imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the registry is to describe the use, interpretation and performance of the&#xD;
      S100B protein in its use at bedside in emergency medicine.&#xD;
