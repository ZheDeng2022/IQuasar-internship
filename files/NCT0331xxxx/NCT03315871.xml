  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people with prostate cancer have a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This can&#xD;
      happen even after treatments like radiation and surgery. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
      drugs and close monitoring are one standard way to treat this group of people. Another way is&#xD;
      to monitor people and their PSA values over time. Researchers want to see if a combination of&#xD;
      new drugs can help these people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the combination treatment of PROSTVAC, CV301, and MSB0011359C (M7824) can induce an&#xD;
      anti-tumor attack in people with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with certain kinds of prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of tissue that was already taken will be tested. This will confirm the diagnosis,&#xD;
      stage, and disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have close monitoring with four monthly PSA checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get two study drugs as shots under the skin. They will get the third&#xD;
      drug in a vein. They will get the drugs over at least 7 months. Their vital signs will be&#xD;
      checked before they get the drugs and for up to 1 hour after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have frequent study visits. They will have physical exams, urine and blood&#xD;
      tests, and scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic about 4 weeks after they stop taking the study drugs.&#xD;
      They will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They may also have&#xD;
      long-term follow-up visits.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and surveillance are treatment options for prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients with biochemical progression after localized therapy (i.e., biochemically recurrent&#xD;
      [BCR] prostate cancer). The primary goal in these patients is to prevent morbidity from their&#xD;
      cancer that results from disease progression and metastatic disease on conventional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADT can lower the PSA in these patients, but because of its substantial side effect profile&#xD;
      and ambiguous long-term impact, it is generally deferred by most patients until there is a&#xD;
      rapid escalation in their PSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy presents an alternative option for these patients that is especially attractive&#xD;
      because it is not associated with substantial toxicity. Also, since immunotherapy can have&#xD;
      lasting effects after treatment due to a sustained activated immune response, patients will&#xD;
      not be required to take these treatments indefinitely to potentially benefit clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current and previous clinical trials have demonstrated that single agent immunotherapy can&#xD;
      impact PSA in patients in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this study is to determine if combination immunotherapy with immune-cell&#xD;
      mobilizing vaccines can initiate an immune response in the first 4 months that is then&#xD;
      augmented by an immune checkpoint inhibitor in the following 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to PSA responses (the primary metric in this population), safety, changes in&#xD;
      immune responses, and PSA kinetics will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Lead-In: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination immunotherapy in&#xD;
      participants with castration-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Recurrence: To determine if the combination immunotherapy can induce a 30%&#xD;
      decline in PSA in 28% of participants with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria (for biochemical recurrence):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with negative CT Scan and Tc-99m Bone Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a PSA over 0.8 ng/ml for participants following radical prostatectomy or&#xD;
      for participants following definitive radiation therapy: a rise in PSA of &gt;= 2 ng/mL above&#xD;
      the nadir&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a PSA doubling time of 5-15 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      No history of active autoimmune disease or history of organ compromising autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety lead-in cohort will evaluate 6 participants with castration resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-arm, non-randomized study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual goal is a total of 37 evaluable participants (6 in an initial safety cohort, 6&#xD;
      participants who received M7824 as part of the initial investigation and 25 homogenously&#xD;
      treated participants) to evaluate response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from an on-going study (NCT02649439) with nearly identical eligibility can serve&#xD;
      as a contemporary control for secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the safety lead-in, all participants will be enrolled and undergo a surveillance&#xD;
      period during which 4 consecutive monthly PSA values will be captured by the NIH labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surveillance period, participants will be treated with 2 vaccines concurrently,&#xD;
      Prostvac and CV301, during months 1-4. For months 5-7, MSB0011359C [an anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      (avelumab) with TGFB-Trap molecule] will be added to the regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective with amendment v7/29/2021, MSB0011359C will no longer be given as part of the&#xD;
      treatment for the Biochemical Recurrence cohort (Arms 2 and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for on-treatment and post-treatment PSA, immune and imaging&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
