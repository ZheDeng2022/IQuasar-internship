      The ReStOre trial is a multi-disciplinary intervention of exercise, diet and education for&#xD;
      patients who have completed treatment for oesophageal cancer. The intervention aims to&#xD;
      improve quality of life and functional performance following oesophageal cancer and assist&#xD;
      patients to return to normal activity during the early survivorship phase. The 12-week&#xD;
      intervention will involve structured exercise training, individual dietary advice and&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary education sessions addressing a range of survivorship needs.&#xD;

      The principal study proposed in this work will be composed of two phases. Phase I will&#xD;
      consist of a longitudinal analysis, tracking the progression of cachexia and associated&#xD;
      dysmetabolic state throughout treatment for oesophageal cancer (OC) and examining the impact&#xD;
      of this decline on measures of physical functioning. A total of 88 newly-diagnosed OC&#xD;
      patients will be recruited for Phase I. In Phase II, participants from Phase I will be&#xD;
      re-assessed and if deemed suitable, will be enrolled onto a multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme aimed at improving functional status. This rehabilitation programme&#xD;
      will take the form of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and will be based on the&#xD;
      well-established cardiac rehabilitation programme model. It is anticipated that approximately&#xD;
      50% of participants enrolled onto Phase I will be suitable for progression to Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome across both Phase I and Phase II is functional capacity.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes including inflammatory status, energy metabolism and nutritional status&#xD;
      will be measured as appropriate during the study. All outcomes are discussed in detail&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Longitudinal Study Examining the impact of progressive cachexia, dysmetabolism and&#xD;
      cancer treatment on functional capacity in OC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will be designed as a longitudinal analysis, commencing at the time of diagnosis,&#xD;
      tracking the progression of cachexia and associated dysmetabolic state, incorporating&#xD;
      inflammatory profiles, energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis) and gut&#xD;
      hormones, throughout treatment for OC and examining the impact of this decline on measures of&#xD;
      physical functioning. Assessments will be completed at diagnosis (T0), cycle 2 chemotherapy&#xD;
      (T1), cycle 3 chemotherapy (T2), pre-oesophagectomy (T3), post-oesophagectomy (T4), 4-weeks&#xD;
      post-surgery (T5) and six months post-surgery (T6). All assessments will be completed during&#xD;
      the same day as routine out-patient appointments thereby reducing the burden on participants.&#xD;
      Furthermore, blood samples will be taken during routine clinical sampling and CT scans will&#xD;
      be completed as part of routine medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Randomised Controlled Trial Can rehabilitation following curative treatment for OC&#xD;
      optimise health-related functional outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will examine the effect of a 12-week rehabilitation programme, incorporating a&#xD;
      walking intervention, individualised nutritional advice and education session, on functional&#xD;
      status following curative treatment for OC. Following completion of Phase I and medical&#xD;
      clearance to progress to Phase II, participants will be randomised 1:1 to either the&#xD;
      intervention group or a control group. The control group will not receive the intervention&#xD;
      however following completion of final assessments, participants will be offered an individual&#xD;
      exercise and dietary session with the research physiotherapist and dietitian. During the&#xD;
      intervention period, participants in the control group will continue to receive routine&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme will be a change in&#xD;
      functional capacity as measured by aerobic capacity. Secondary measures of functional&#xD;
      capacity will include a stair climbing test, hand grip and physical activity. Body&#xD;
      composition will also be measured by bio impedance analysis. The secondary outcomes that will&#xD;
      be assessed are nutritional status, dietary quality and healthy related quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL). Inflammatory profiles, measures of energy metabolism and gut hormones are unlikely to&#xD;
      be influenced by the proposed rehabilitative intervention and therefore will not be measured.&#xD;
      Assessments will be completed at, programme completion and three months post programme&#xD;
      completion. Assessments take place at the Welcome Trust-HRB Clinical Research Facility St.&#xD;
      James's Hospital. The rehabilitation programme will consist of three main components; 1.&#xD;
      Exercise session, 2. Dietary sessions and 3. Education sessions. The intervention outlined&#xD;
      below is devised based best evidence, pilot data and clinical expertise. The design final&#xD;
      design will be informed form the results of the feasibility study and from needs identified&#xD;
      in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Sessions The exercise component of the rehabilitation programme will take the form&#xD;
      of a 12 week supervised and home-based walking intervention. A walking intervention was&#xD;
      chosen as walking is the most common form of exercise completed by adults nationally and&#xD;
      worldwide, it is safe and feasible for deconditioned cohorts and represents a functionally&#xD;
      meaningful activity. The feasibility of implementing a similar programme in cancer survivors&#xD;
      has been previous established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group walking sessions will be supervised twice weekly during the first four weeks of the&#xD;
      programme to re-introduce exercise to participant's lives in a safe and structured manner. As&#xD;
      the programme progresses the frequency of supervised sessions will decrease to increase&#xD;
      participants independence with the protocol. In the absence of guidance on appropriate&#xD;
      exercise prescription in cancer cohorts, exercise intensity will be prescribed in accordance&#xD;
      with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for exercise in deconditioned&#xD;
      populations (28). Initially, activity will be prescribed at a light intensity and will&#xD;
      progress during the programme to a moderate aerobic intensity. The proposed starting&#xD;
      intensity is based on pilot data from the investigators institute suggesting that aerobic&#xD;
      fitness levels are either 'poor' or 'very poor' in the early post-treatment phase.&#xD;
      Participants will wear Polar Heart Rate monitors during all sessions to ensure compliance&#xD;
      with the exercise prescribed. The goal at programme completion will be participation in 30&#xD;
      minutes of moderate intensity activity five days per week, as per the ACSM physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition Sessions Nutrition sessions will be delivered during week 1, week 2 and then&#xD;
      fortnightly on a one to one basis. Weight and circumferential measures will be recorded at&#xD;
      each session and dietary intake will be assessed as described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The education delivered in the nutrition sessions will be individualised to participants&#xD;
      needs. There is limited knowledge of the specific nutritional needs of oesophageal cancer&#xD;
      survivors. Based on experience at this centre, the investigators anticipate that a&#xD;
      heterogeneous mix of dietary issues requiring intervention will present in this cohort. These&#xD;
      include persistent weight loss, anorexia, gastrointestinal disturbance and altered bowel&#xD;
      habit. In addition, participants may require specific dietary advice to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      other diseases e.g. cardio-protective dietary advice. Furthermore, the increase in physical&#xD;
      activity by participants throughout the intervention will require dietary monitoring and&#xD;
      advice to avoid inappropriate negative energy balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will assist in identifying specific nutritional issues facing&#xD;
      oesophageal cancer survivors and help inform content and delivery of the nutrition education&#xD;
      sessions. The target for participants is optimal dietary intake in line with the WCRF&#xD;
      guidelines for cancer survivors. Supporting literature detailing prescriptive dietary advice&#xD;
      will be developed and provided to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education Sessions Education sessions will be delivered weekly during weeks 1-4 and&#xD;
      fortnightly thereafter by a range of members of the multidisciplinary team. As per the&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation model, education sessions will talk place after the exercise session&#xD;
      and cool-down, to monitor participant recovery following exercise. Education topics covered&#xD;
      by the physiotherapist will include advice regarding physical activity guidelines,&#xD;
      discouraging sedentary behaviour and overcoming barriers to physical activity. The dietitian&#xD;
      will discuss dietary management of gastrointestinal symptoms and will also educate&#xD;
      participants on healthy eating for cancer survivors as per World Cancer Research Fund,&#xD;
      including practical advice and strategies to achieve dietary goals. Participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to highlight topics that may be of particular concern to them for discussion. As&#xD;
      per the cardiac rehabilitation model, such topics may be covered by members of the&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team including the surgeon, gastrointestinal nurse, occupational therapist&#xD;
      or social worker. Education sessions will take place at the Welcome Trust-HRB Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility St. James's Hospital.&#xD;
