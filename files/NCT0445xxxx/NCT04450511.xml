  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, Bladder Training (BT) and Magnetic stimulation (MS) are frequently used&#xD;
      together in the treatment of women with idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB). Up to our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no study evaluating the combined effect of magnetic stimulation and&#xD;
      bladder training in women with idiopathic OAB in the literature. Moreover, there is no&#xD;
      recommendation on conservative treatment combinations in the guidelines due to insufficient&#xD;
      data. At this stage, studies are needed to determine whether it will be effective to use MS&#xD;
      in combination with other conservative treatment options. In addition, in the light of our&#xD;
      clinical experience, we think that this issue is still open for research. In our study,&#xD;
      adding MS to BT in women with idiopathic OAB is thought to contribute additionally to the&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment with BT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is the first prospective randomized controlled trial that compares the efficacy of&#xD;
      BT and BT plus MS in women with idiopathic OAB. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of MS added to BT on incontinence-related QoL and clinical parameters in women with&#xD;
      idiopathic OAB.&#xD;

      This study is a prospectively randomized, controlled trial. The trial is held at&#xD;
      Urogynecological Rehabilitation Unit of University Hospital, Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department between September 2020 and November 2021. The local ethics&#xD;
      committee approve the study (approval no: 60116787-020/37878). Patients are informed about&#xD;
      the purpose and contents of the study and all women give written consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a random number generator, all patients which included the study were randomized&#xD;
      into two groups as follows: The Group 1 received BT program alone, the Group 2 received BT&#xD;
      plus MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Bladder Training (BT) - Control group All women were informed about BT for 30&#xD;
      minutes. Then it was given as a written brochure to be implemented as a home program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BT, consisting of four stages, did not contain any pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training&#xD;
      programs in two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: BT plus MS Patients are told to sit on the chair with a magnetic coil below the&#xD;
      chair. When a volume conductor is inserted by this magnetic ﬁeld, an eddy current ﬂow is&#xD;
      generated. This eddy current stimulates nerve or muscle of the pelvic ﬂoor. To apply MS, the&#xD;
      device was set to generate its maximum stimuli, with a stimulation pulse width of 200 μs and&#xD;
      a stimulation repetition cycle of 10 Hz in accordance with the literature (10,13-15). When&#xD;
      setting the device at each treatment session, patients were interviewed so that they received&#xD;
      stimuli at the maximum stimulation intensity (maximum tolerable stimulation intensity) (10).&#xD;
      MS was applied two days a week, 20 minutes a day, a total of 12 sessions for 6 weeks. MS&#xD;
      sessions were performed by other physician.&#xD;

    <description>BT, consisting of four stages, did not contain any PFM training programs in all groups. In these stages, including urgency suppression strategies, it was aimed to delay urination, to inhibit detrusor contraction and to prevent urgency; by squeezing the PFM several times in a row (women were encouraged to pause/stop their work, sit down if possible, relax the entire body and squeeze PFM repeatedly), breathing deeply, giving their attention to another job for a while and self-motivating (I can do it, I can check the urination, etc.).</description>
