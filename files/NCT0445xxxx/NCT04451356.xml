  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation (KT) represents the best treatment for patients with end-stage kidney&#xD;
      disease, being associated with improved outcomes and reduced mortality. Although the survival&#xD;
      benefit with KT is mostly attributable to reduction in cardiovascular (CV) disease, KT&#xD;
      recipients continue to remain at higher risk for CV-related morbidity and mortality when&#xD;
      compared with the general population. Additionally, CV events represent the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in KT recipients with a functioning allograft. KT recipients have high rates of&#xD;
      hospitalization for myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, dysrhythmias, stroke,&#xD;
      malignant hypertension, and cardiac arrest. Significant amounts of research have been aimed&#xD;
      at reducing event rates, primarily aimed at understanding prevalent risk factors, defining&#xD;
      outcomes, and application of guideline-based care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-KT milieu represents the confluence of several traditional and nontraditional CV&#xD;
      risk factors contributing to the significant CV risk in this population. CV disease remains&#xD;
      an understudied and undertreated source of morbidity and mortality in KT patients. Patients&#xD;
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are generally excluded from major cardiovascular outcome&#xD;
      trials, and this phenomenon of aversion to including patients with CKD in CV trials and&#xD;
      providing appropriate goal-directed medical and interventional therapies (renalism) extends&#xD;
      into KT .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate holistically the CV risk in a KT population. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare bioimpedance spectroscopy derived fluid status parameters&#xD;
      (overhydration, total body water, extracellular water and intracellular water) with clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, lung ultrasonography, pulse wave velocity, different biomarkers, and&#xD;
      echocardiographic characteristics and also to determine the impact of these parameters on&#xD;
      renal and CV outcomes in the same population.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a complete clinical and paraclinical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal data (age, sex, height);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, weight, body mass index);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication (including immunosupression);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney transplantation data (date of transplantation, type - living or cadaveric donor,&#xD;
           missmatch number, type of induction therapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dialysis vintage (before KT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, etc);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination (blood pressure, crackles, pedal edema etc);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal function evaluation (serum urea and creatinine, serum electrolytes - K, Na, Cl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nutrition status evaluation: serum protein, cholesterol, triglycerides;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammation evaluation: CRP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum glucose and uric acid;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoleucogram;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance spectroscopy analysis This analysis will be performed at baseline using the&#xD;
      portable whole-body multifrequency bioimpedance analysis device (BCM®Body Composition Monitor&#xD;
      - Fresenius Medical Care D GmbH). The technique involves attaching electrodes to the&#xD;
      patient's forearm and ipsilateral ankle, with the patient in a supine position. The BCM®&#xD;
      measures the body resistance and reactance to electrical currents of 50 discrete frequencies,&#xD;
      ranging between 5 and 1000 kHz. Based on a fluid model using these resistances, the&#xD;
      extracellular water (ECW), the intracellular water (ICW) and the total body water (TBW) are&#xD;
      calculated. These volumes are then used to determine the amount of fluid overload. All&#xD;
      calculations are automatically performed by the software of the BCM® device. Absolute fluid&#xD;
      overload (AFO) is is defined as the difference between the expected patient's ECW under&#xD;
      normal physiological conditions and the actual ECW, whereas the relative fluid overload (RFO)&#xD;
      is defined as the absolute fluid overload AFO to ECW ratio. Normohydration is defined when&#xD;
      AFO is between the 10th and the 90th percentile for healthy, age- and gender-matched&#xD;
      individuals from the reference population, i.e. between -1.1 to +1.1 L, while volumes below&#xD;
      and above this range defining underhydration and overhydration, respectively. In addition,&#xD;
      this analysis will provide the LTI and FTI for the included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography Echocardiographic evaluations will be made in each patient at baseline. All&#xD;
      echocardiographic measurements will be carried out according to the recommendations of the&#xD;
      American Society of Echocardiography by an observer unaware of the lung ultrasound and&#xD;
      bioimpedance results. Echocardiographic evaluation will provide information about cardiac&#xD;
      anatomy (e.g. volumes, geometry, mass) and function (e.g. left ventricular function and wall&#xD;
      motion, valvular function, right ventricular function, pulmonary artery pressure,&#xD;
      pericardium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasonography Examinations will be performed in the supine position. Scanning of the&#xD;
      anterior and lateral chest will be performed on both sides of the chest, from the second to&#xD;
      the fourth (on the right side to the fifth) intercostal spaces, at parasternal to&#xD;
      mid-axillary lines. B-lines will be recorded in each intercostal space and were defined as a&#xD;
      hyperechoic, coherent US bundle at narrow basis going from the transducer to the limit of the&#xD;
      screen. B-lines starting from the pleural line can be either localized or scattered to the&#xD;
      whole lung and be present as isolated or multiple artifacts. The sum of B-lines produces a&#xD;
      score reflecting the extent of lung water accumulation (0 being no detectable B-line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial stiffness Arterial stiffness assessment will be performed by applanation tonometry&#xD;
      (SphygmoCorTM; PWV Inc., Westmead, Sydney, Australia) with the patient being recumbent, 10&#xD;
      minutes before the measures were done. The carotid and femoral pulse will be acquired by&#xD;
      applanation tonometry sequentially, allowing a single operator to acquire the measurement.&#xD;
      The transit time from the R-wave of the simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram to the foot&#xD;
      of the carotid and femoral pulse is measured. The difference acquired electrocardiogram to&#xD;
      the foot of the carotid and femoral pulse is measured. The difference between these 2 transit&#xD;
      times is divided by distances measured from the body surface to estimate the arterial path&#xD;
      length in order to calculate carotid-femoral PWV. The SphygmoCor PWV has been established in&#xD;
      the literature as a reference for comparison due to the wealth of population data and healthy&#xD;
      population refence values. The investigators will determine two PWVs for every patient and&#xD;
      use the media for the statistical analysis. If the difference between these two measurements&#xD;
      will be higher than 0.5 m/s then another determination will be performed and the median will&#xD;
      be used for analysis.&#xD;
