  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the evidence supports hippocampal avoidance with whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT)&#xD;
      as the recommended treatment option in patients with good prognosis and multiple brain&#xD;
      metastases as it gives better neurocognitive preservation compared to historical whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy controls. There is however often poor tumour control with this technique due to&#xD;
      the low doses given. Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), a form of focused radiotherapy which is&#xD;
      given to patients who have a limited number of brain metastases, gives a higher radiation&#xD;
      dose to the metastases resulting in better target lesion control. With improvements in&#xD;
      radiation technology, advanced dose-painting techniques now allow a simultaneous integrate&#xD;
      boost (SIB) dose to lesions whilst minimising doses to the hippocampus to potentially improve&#xD;
      brain tumour control and preserve cognitive outcomes (HA-SIB-WBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators believe that the SIB in HA-SIB-WBRT (experimental) will result in better&#xD;
      functional and survival outcomes compared to HA-WBRT (control). Patients who are fit, have&#xD;
      multiple brain metastases (5-25 lesions) and reasonable life expectancy (&gt;6 months) will be&#xD;
      recruited from NCCS over 2 years. Patients will be followed up the over the following year&#xD;
      with imaging, toxicity data, quality of life, activities of daily living and cognitive&#xD;
      measurements at set time points. The results will be compared across the 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with brain metastases are living longer. Maintaining functional independence and&#xD;
      brain metastases control is thus increasingly important. Improved radiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      techniques could provide better control and survival outcomes whilst maintain QoL and&#xD;
      functional capacity.&#xD;
