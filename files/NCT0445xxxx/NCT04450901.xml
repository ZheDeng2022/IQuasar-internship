  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study of YBL-006,&#xD;
      in participants with Advanced Solid Tumors. This multicenter study will be conducted in&#xD;
      approximately 11-14 participants in the dose escalation phase, and approximately 39-76&#xD;
      participants in dose expansion phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study will consist of three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening (up to 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment (28-day, 14-day, or 21-day cycles)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up (up to 3 months) The treatment period will consist of 28-day cycles for the&#xD;
           dose escalation phase, and 14-day (Cohorts B1, B2 reserve, and B3) or 21-day (Cohort B2)&#xD;
           cycles for the dose expansion phase. Each cycle is comprised of two doses of IP&#xD;
           administered as an IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 (dose escalation phase) or one dose of&#xD;
           IP administered as an IV infusion on Day 1 (dose expansion phase). The treatment&#xD;
           duration will be of 1 year in patients who are responding to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An accelerated titration design will be utilized for the lowest dose cohort (0.5 mg/kg) in&#xD;
      the dose escalation part. Whereas the traditional 3 + 3 design will be utilized for the&#xD;
      higher dose cohorts until the proposed starting dose for the Expansion Cohort is determined&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to four tumor-specific expansion cohorts consisting of approximately 39 to 76 participants&#xD;
      will evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of YBL-006 at the proposed doses of YBL-006&quot;&#xD;

             standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have at least one measurable lesion based on RECIST Version 1.1. A previously&#xD;

             dose must have been stable with low-dose (same or less than 10 mg/day prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent) for at least two weeks preceding C1D1.&#xD;

             contraception. In general, the decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
             should be determined via discussions between the Investigator and the study&#xD;
             participant. WOCBP must agree to use a reliable form of contraceptive during the study&#xD;

                  against another standard treatment or by comparison to historical controls);&#xD;
                  participants who cannot receive other standard therapy that has been shown to&#xD;
                  prolonged survival due to medical issues will be eligible, if other eligibility&#xD;

             medications, except for participants with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of IP&#xD;
             (Note: Participants, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine during the study and&#xD;
             180 days after the last dose of IP). Vaccination with a killed vaccine is permitted at&#xD;
             any time with consultation with the Medical Monitor. Patients may receive vaccination&#xD;
             for SARS-CoV-2 (DNA or mRNA vaccine) at the discretion of the Investigator as soon as&#xD;
             they are eligible, and a vaccine is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known current drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Apparent active or latent tuberculosis infection (purified protein derivative [PPD]&#xD;
             test is not required) as indicated by any of the following: PPD recently converted to&#xD;
             positive; chest x-ray with definitive evidence of active infectious infiltrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Presence of any other condition that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive medications or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (doses 10 mg/day prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent). Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption)&#xD;
             may be continued if the participant is on a stable dose. Non-absorbed intra-articular&#xD;
             steroid injections will be permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Use of other investigational therapy within 28 days before IP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Non-study related minor surgical procedure (e.g. placement of a central venous access&#xD;
             port) ≤ 5 days, or major surgical procedure ≤ 21 days, prior to first dose of IP; in&#xD;
             all cases, the participant must be sufficiently recovered and stable before treatment&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Participant has clinically significant, uncontrolled, cardiovascular disease including&#xD;
             congestive heart failure Grade III or IV according to the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             (NYHA) classification; myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the previous 6&#xD;
             months, uncontrolled hypertension, or clinically significant, uncontrolled&#xD;
             arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias that may cause QT prolongation (e.g., Type II&#xD;
             second degree heart block or third degree heart block).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Participant has a QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 470 msec.&#xD;
             Participant has a history of prolonged QT syndrome or Torsades de pointes. Participant&#xD;
             has a familial history of prolonged QT syndrome.&#xD;
