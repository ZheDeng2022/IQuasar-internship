  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TRACK-MSA is an observational, non-interventional, longitudinal natural history study to&#xD;
      define changes in clinical, neurological, blood, CSF, and neuroimaging biomarkers in patients&#xD;
      with multiple system atrophy (MSA) comparing baseline to 6-month and 1-year assessments. The&#xD;
      study will enroll 50 patients with MSA-P or MSA-C at 2 or more participating sites.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRACK-MSA is designed to relate phenotypic characteristics of participants with MSA using&#xD;
      several modalities (i.e., clinical, quantitative motor, imaging, laboratory) in order to&#xD;
      relate phenotypic characteristics with data derived from the study of blood and CSF (&quot;wet&#xD;
      biomarkers&quot;) and imaging or wearables (&quot;dry biomarkers&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that the cohort enrolled in this study will, after study completion, be&#xD;
      recruited into the earliest multicenter biomarker-driven clinical trials of disease modifying&#xD;
      agents for MSA. As such, the data collected in the TRACK-MSA study could constitute a&#xD;
      valuable observational non-interventional arm of potential disease-modifying treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study will therefore be to determine the combination of measures that&#xD;
      most sensitively detects changes over the natural course of MSA, with a goal of validating&#xD;
      these measures for use in future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRACK-MSA will be a 1-year observational, longitudinal, non-interventional natural history&#xD;
      study of patients with MSA. The study will be carried out at least at 2 sites (NYU being the&#xD;
      primary site). All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-month and 1-year visits.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo clinical, neurological, quantitative motor, MRI assessments, in&#xD;
      addition to donating blood and CSF samples at some or all of the visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a given participant, the same investigator should carry out the clinical assessment&#xD;
      throughout the study where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the study will complete enrollment in 2 years since startup, and&#xD;
      complete all the follow-up evaluations within 3 years from startup.&#xD;

      Biomarker analysis will be focused on measuring the levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL)&#xD;
      in serum and/or plasma, which is one of the most promising blood biomarkers in MSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of CSF may include but is not limited to the following biomarkers: total alpha&#xD;
      synuclein, aggregated alpha synuclein Tau/phosphorylated Tau, neurofilament light chain,&#xD;
      neurofilament heavy chain, and catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, DOPAC, DHPG).&#xD;
