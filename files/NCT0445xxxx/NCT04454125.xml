  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot prospective intervention trial in children with asthma who will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either (A) Air Quality Index (AQI) education + an asthma action plan&#xD;
      (control) or (B) AQI education + an asthma action plan which contains AQI behavioral&#xD;
      recommendations + demonstrate ability to navigate to AirNow either online or on smartphone&#xD;
      app (intervention).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 3 million US children with asthma reported at least one attack in the prior year. Poorly&#xD;
      controlled asthma is a major cause of suffering, school absences, loss of caregiver&#xD;
      productivity, and healthcare costs (estimated as ~$80 billion/year). Over half of children on&#xD;
      controller medication are not well controlled, due to environmental exposures, non-adherence,&#xD;
      or true non-response to treatment. Outdoor air pollution is a known trigger of asthma.&#xD;
      Although sound health policies are the best long-term approaches to reduce the harmful&#xD;
      effects of air pollution, exposure avoidance is needed until &quot;clean air&quot; is ensured through&#xD;
      effective legislation. Despite this, healthcare providers infrequently provide pollution&#xD;
      exposure advice to children with asthma. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors&#xD;
      air pollution and reports a daily Air Quality Index (AQI) that is easy to use and available&#xD;
      in most metropolitan areas. Practical recommendations regarding outdoor activity can be based&#xD;
      on AQI levels. Despite this, AQI-based recommendations are rarely addressed in asthma action&#xD;
      plans (AAP). No pediatric study has assessed the addition of the AQI to AAP to reduce asthma&#xD;
      morbidity. This proposal seeks to recruit a pilot cohort of 40 children with asthma + 40&#xD;
      parent/guardian. Using this cohort, the investigators will test the hypotheses that (1) the&#xD;
      addition of the AQI to AAP will reduce asthma exacerbations and (2) the addition of the AQI&#xD;
      to AAP will improve asthma symptom control &amp; quality of life in children with asthma. The&#xD;
      inclusion of the AQI onto asthma action plans is novel in clinical asthma care; its wide&#xD;
      availability would make large-scale implementation feasible. The investigators expect this&#xD;
      low-cost and low-tech intervention will have a positive impact in reducing asthma morbidity.&#xD;
      Given that 1 out of every 12 children in the U.S. has asthma, this is relevant to health care&#xD;
      professionals, parents, and public health practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional, the investigators will collect nasal epithelial cells for use in future&#xD;
      genomic/epigenetic studies.&#xD;
