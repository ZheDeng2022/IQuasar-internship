      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) is a tumor. It grows from the retina in the eye. It can&#xD;
      threaten a person s vision. Trans-scleral cryotherapy is used to destroy the tumors and&#xD;
      minimize the long-term risks of vision loss. RH is a rare condition, often occurring in&#xD;
      people with von Hippel-Lindau disease. There are no clinical trials to study how well the&#xD;
      treatment works. Researchers want to study the medical records of people with RH who were&#xD;
      treated at the NIH eye clinic to learn more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze clinical data collected over a 20-year span to study consecutive cases of RH&#xD;
      managed with trans-scleral cryotherapy at the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who took part in NIH natural history protocols for which cryotherapy of RH was&#xD;
      performed as a standard care measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect and study data from participants medical charts. Participants will&#xD;
      not be contacted because no new data is needed. Researchers were granted a waiver of informed&#xD;
      consent for use of these medical records. To protect patient privacy, participants will be&#xD;
      assigned an ID number. Their data will be entered into a spreadsheet in a coded fashion. The&#xD;
      key to this code will be kept in a secure file. No patient identifying information will be&#xD;
      used in the analysis or the publication....&#xD;

      Study Description: This study is a retrospective review of medical records in the NIH eye&#xD;
      clinic. To our knowledge, there has been no report in the current era dedicated to a&#xD;
      description of trans-scleral cryotherapy for retinal hemangioblastomas despite its routine&#xD;
      use in this setting. This study aims to explore features and outcomes of these cases to&#xD;
      better inform best practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this study is to perform a retrospective analysis of consecutive&#xD;
      cases of retinal hemangioblastoma managed with trans-scleral cryotherapy at the NIH (single&#xD;
      center retrospective case series).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Consecutive cases involving participants in NIH natural history protocols&#xD;
      for which cryotherapy of retinal hemangioblastoma was performed as a standard care measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities conducting research: Analysis includes only NIH data and will&#xD;
      occur at the NEI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Six months.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Participants were enrolled in NEI and non-NEI natural history protocols, but in&#xD;
                  all cases, cryotherapy was administered as a standard care measure (not as an&#xD;
                  investigative treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients were identified by searching the NIH eye clinic EMR for all of those&#xD;
                  manifesting one or more retinal hemangioblastomas (with or without associated von&#xD;
                  Hippel-Lindau disease) treated with cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
