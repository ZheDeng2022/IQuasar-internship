  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Gamunex-C IVIG as&#xD;
      mono-therapy for HMGCoA reductase auto-antibody positive (HMGCR) necrotizing myopathy. The&#xD;
      trial will test the feasibility and initial efficacy of Gamunex-C IVIG mono-therapy in HMGCR&#xD;
      necrotizing myopathy.&#xD;

      This is a phase 2, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of&#xD;
      Gamunex-C IVIG as mono-therapy for HMGCR necrotizing myopathy. Up to 10 treatment-naïve&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and randomized to receive either Gamunex-C IVIG dosed at 2g/kg or&#xD;
      placebo at week 0 and week 4. The primary efficacy outcome is the percentage of patients at&#xD;
      week 8 with at least minimal improvement per the 2016 ACR/EULAR myositis clinical response&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
