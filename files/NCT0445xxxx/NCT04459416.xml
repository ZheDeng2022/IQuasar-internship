  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether acupuncture treatments can reduce the need&#xD;
      for opioid medication when managing pain caused by chemotherapy. The study will compare the&#xD;
      effects of adding acupuncture to usual pain management with those of usual pain management&#xD;
      alone, in reducing opioid use by relieving pain. Researchers also want to find out more about&#xD;
      the effects of acupuncture treatments on other symptoms caused by cancer treatments and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, two-arm randomized controlled trial. Randomization will be stratified by study site, primary cancer diagnosis (MM versus HD versus NHL) and transplantation setting (inpatient versus outpatient) to ensure these characteristics are comparably distributed between the two study arms.</intervention_model_description>

All symptoms are rated with reference to &quot;the last 24 hours&quot; on 0-10 numeric scales from &quot;not present&quot; to &quot;as bad as you can imagine.&quot; MDASIBMT Total Symptom Severity score will serve as the symptom burden primary endpoint.</description>
