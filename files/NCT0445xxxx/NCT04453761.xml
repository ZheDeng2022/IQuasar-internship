    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial design. It was conducted with a main&#xD;
      purpose of evaluating the effect of thiamine supplementation on serum lactate and&#xD;
      lactate-pyruvate ratio after surgery as direct indicators of tissue perfusion and indirect&#xD;
      markers of energy substrate availability for effective mitochondrial function and intubation&#xD;
      time as clinical outcome.&#xD;

      All patients who undergo open cardiac surgery for their congenital heart disease on the&#xD;
      research period will be recruited consecutively and evaluated according to the study&#xD;
      criteria. Parents or guardians were explained about the procedure. Agreement will be&#xD;
      concluded by signing the informed consent. Baseline data including age, nutritional status,&#xD;
      diagnosis, types of heart disease (cyanotic or acyanotic), restrictive or non restrictive&#xD;
      pulmonary blood flow heart disease, pre-surgical peripheral saturation, pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and any syndromes associated with heart disease will be recorded on the study&#xD;
      sheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised using block randomisation procedure with a block size of 4 on&#xD;
      treatment and control group. Included participants will be marked by specific randomisation&#xD;
      number by a research assistant physician who is not involved in patients' management. A&#xD;
      pharmacist will acquire and open a prepared envelope containing the randomisation number. The&#xD;
      patients, parents/guardians, research physicians, other physicians or paramedics involved in&#xD;
      patients' treatment will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo (Intravenous Normal Saline) and intravenous thiamine (2 mg/kg) will be administered&#xD;
      at induction time, 1 hours after surgery and once everyday for three days by pharmacist&#xD;
      according to randomization result. All subject are given oral T3 supplementation (1 mcg/kg)&#xD;
      every 6 hours by pharmacist as research protocol. Oral T3 supplementations are given every 6&#xD;
      hours, started from induction time until 11 doses (60 hours until the first dose). Drugs is&#xD;
      diluted with 2.5 cc aqua and administerednisterd using nasogastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be withdrawn from arterial line access for 2.5 cc in order to test thiamine,&#xD;
      lactate, and pyruvate concentration, as well as, measuring LDH and PDH activity. Thiamine&#xD;
      will be examined from blood plasma using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectometry.&#xD;
      Thiamine concentration below â‰¤ 7 nmol/L is considered low. PDH will be examined from&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) which will be isolated from fresh blood. PDH&#xD;
      activity will be tested after breaking cell membrane to initiate mitochondria lysis, this&#xD;
      process will be done by immunocapture and micro-plate based assay. Lactate and pyruvate&#xD;
      measurement will be tested using an enzymatic kit specific for lactate and pyruvate called&#xD;
      Sigma Aldrich reagent. Thiamine concentration, lactate concentration, pyruvate concentration,&#xD;
      LDH and PDH activity is going to be measured at 4 time; induction time, one hour, 24 hours,&#xD;
      72 hours after aortic clamp removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of blood gas analysis, blood glucose, central vein saturation and oxygen&#xD;
      extraction ratio will be performed at induction time, 1 hours, and 12 hours post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ functions evaluation was performed by serially measuring SGOT and SGPT (liver function)&#xD;
      as well as ureum and creatinine (renal function) on ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography evaluation will be done on the first, second and third day after surgery to&#xD;
      assess the patient's ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac volume and index, tricuspid&#xD;
      annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), left heart diastolic functions and SVRI&#xD;
      calculation. It will be done by 2 research cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical managements will be decided according to the paediatric ICU National&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita treatment protocols. Inotropic concentration will be&#xD;
      evaluated by inotropic and vasoactive-inotropic scoring every 6 hours in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      and every 12 hours after the second and third 24 hours. The amount of diuretics used will be&#xD;
      calculated 72 hours after ICU admission. Peritoneal dialysis and continuous veno-venous&#xD;
      hemofiltration (CVVH) is going to be assessed by means of the length of therapy, renal&#xD;
      function and fluid balance. Decision to extubate will be carried out by a physician&#xD;
      responsible according to the treatment protocols. Every reintubation is going to be recorded&#xD;
      as number and length of intubation. The length of ICU and hospital stay and mortality will be&#xD;
      evaluated in both study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative data such as Aristotle score, residual lesions presence, open thorax on ICU&#xD;
      admission, CPB duration, Aox duration and a number of procedures during CPB including&#xD;
      ultrafiltration, hypothermia and hemodilution is going to be recorded in the research sheets.&#xD;
      History of medication used which may interfere with the function of thyroid such as steroids,&#xD;
      dopamine and amiodarone will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be one physician who know the subject's allocation. This physician is not involve&#xD;
      in any kind of patients' treatment and act as the study supervisor to evaluate if any&#xD;
      suspicion on drug adverse reactions occurred. Drug adverse reaction is going to be monitored&#xD;
      by evaluating heart rhythm, heart rate, blood pressure and peripheral temperature for every 6&#xD;
      hours in the first 24 hours and every 12 hours in the second and third 24 hours of ICU&#xD;
      treatment. The criteria of drug adverse reaction are stated in the adverse effects form; they&#xD;
      are tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension and refractory hyperthermia. Any suspicion of the&#xD;
      presence of drug adverse effect is going to be recorded in the form and reported to the&#xD;
      supervising doctor for further analysis. Management on this reaction will be done by the ICU&#xD;
      treating doctor&#xD;
