  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 2 different vascular closure&#xD;
      device (VCD) strategies during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that the choice of one over the other VCD in patients undergoing&#xD;
      transfemoral TAVI may demonstrate relevant differences in the rate of peri-procedural&#xD;
      complications and effectiveness of vascular closure.&#xD;
