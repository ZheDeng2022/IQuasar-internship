  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complication represent asignificant source of morbidity and have&#xD;
      greater incidence and costs than cardiac complications alone .Atelectasis is the commonest&#xD;
      one. Aelectasis may develop in nearly up to 90% of patients after general anaesthesia&#xD;
      ,persist up to several days .Oxygen therapy is usually given in the postoperative period to&#xD;
      alleviate hypoxemia. However it's usually discontinued before discharge to the ward based on&#xD;
      clinical criteria such as patients being awake with normal vital signs and no respiratory&#xD;
      distress. Available literatures suggest that it's not valid . Pulse oximetry provide accurate&#xD;
      objective measurement of oxygenation,continuous and non invasive.Recently, Fernando etal&#xD;
      2017,used pulse oximetry after 5 minutes of oxygenation to detect postoperative atelectasis,&#xD;
      the cut point was 96%.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although it has been postulated that early hypoxemia lasts approximately two hours after a&#xD;
      surgical procedure, the first 20 minutes of the postoperative period seem to be most critical&#xD;
      . It is evident that the majority of transport times would fall well within this 20 minute&#xD;
      window , thus the potential for postoperative hypoxemia during the transport period does&#xD;
      exist. Canet, et al. (1989) found significant differences in oxygen saturation when&#xD;
      administering 35% oxygen to adults in the PACU after a 30 second transport while breathing&#xD;
      room air.The alveolar shunt induced by atelectasis is the main cause of oxygenation&#xD;
      impairment during postoperative period. Witting MD, Lueck CH reported the ability of pulse&#xD;
      oximetry at room air to detect hypoxemia based on 513 blood gas analysis. Coincidentially a&#xD;
      room air oxygen saturation value &lt;96% was selected a cut point of hypoxemia ( Po2 &lt;70 mmhg&#xD;
      )and moderate hypercapnia ( Pco2 &gt;50 mmhg ) . Jones and Jones descriped a digram showing&#xD;
      relationship between SPO2 and FiO2 and proved that SPO2 &lt; 96% correspond to shunt effect of&#xD;
      more than 10% and defines alveolar collapse . clark et al 2001determined time required for&#xD;
      partial pressure of arterial oxygen to reach equilibrium during mechanical ventilation after&#xD;
      a step change in fractional inspired oxygen, they reported that 5-10 minutes will be adequate&#xD;
      . Ferrando C 2017 reported The accuracy of postoperative, non-invasive Air-Test to diagnose&#xD;
      atelectasis in healthy patients after surgery They found that the air test diagnosed&#xD;
      postoperative atelectasis with sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 87% and area uder the&#xD;
      curve of 0.9 The presence of atelectasis was confirmed by CT scan in all patients with&#xD;
      positive air test and in 5 patients with negative air test .The Air-Test may represent an&#xD;
      accurate, simple, inexpensive and non-invasive method for diagnosing postoperative&#xD;
      atelectasis.Sonography is a simple, noninvasive, and radiation-free methodology which has&#xD;
      gained increasing usage in daily practice for detection of atelectasis. Sonography is a&#xD;
      radiation-free methodology which plays an important role in diagnosing pulmonary diseases&#xD;
      including obstructive and compressive atelectasis of different origins Furthermore, lung&#xD;
      ultrasound has shown reliable sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      anaesthesia-induced atelectasis . Telectasis after general anaesthesia is basal and&#xD;
      segmental. For this,we designed this trial as a pilot to detect the accuracy (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of Air-Test to detect atelectasis in a homogenous group (elderly patients&#xD;
      undergoing orthopedic surgery) using Roc testing.&#xD;

The Air-Test was then performed by removing the oxygen mask and leaving the patients breathing room air for 10 min while continuously monitoring SpO2 with a pulse oximeter finger probe. The Air-Test result was considered positive when the recorded SpO2 was ≤96%.</description>
