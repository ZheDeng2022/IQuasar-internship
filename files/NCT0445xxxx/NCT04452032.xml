  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-centric, one arm phase II study. The first phase of the study will consist of an&#xD;
      evaluation of the initial dental state of each subject based on a stomatological examination,&#xD;
      an orthopantomogram, two bitewing radiographs (right and left sides) and an evaluation of all&#xD;
      potential risks of caries and fractures. For all of subjects, a dental decalcification,&#xD;
      dental care and/or avulsion if necessary, and afterwards, a dental splint will be performed&#xD;
      before the start of RT treatment. Our previously developed predictive model for dental dose&#xD;
      in function of the localisation of tumour and suspect lymph nodes based on the stomatological&#xD;
      examination and on the pre-treatment imaging. An estimation of the intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT) teeth dose will be made and translated into a colour based form of the&#xD;
      pre-RT dental status. A contouring of the teeth will be performed and the planned dose for&#xD;
      each tooth of each subject will be recorded by a dose volume histogram (DVH) curve based on&#xD;
      the pre-treatment imaging. In the same way the mean dose and the V25 (the volume receiving 25&#xD;
      Gy) of the homo- and the heterolateral parotid gland will be calculated. Based on our&#xD;
      predictive model, every tooth which potentially will receive more than 40 Gy and for which&#xD;
      long term survival is compromised will be avulsed at least 2 weeks before the start of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After RT, the subject will have clinical follow-up with dental evaluation every 6 months for&#xD;
      36 months in order to identify possible dental events. At each consultation, a stomatological&#xD;
      examination will be performed as well as two bitewing radiographs. An orthopantomogram will&#xD;
      be done once a year. Furthermore, periapical X-rays will be performed if there is a dental&#xD;
      complain or to refine a lesion visible on orthopantomogram.&#xD;

    <description>Before radiotherapy, each subject undergoes a dental evaluation and if it is necessary, dental avulsions if their long-term survival is compromised (see in section 6.1.2) and if they are located in an area at risk to receive more than 40 Gy, so to develop osteoradionecrosis of the jaw. The avulsions should be performed as far as possible from the start of radiotherapy (RT) namely at least 2 weeks before irradiation to allow mucosal healing.</description>
