  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation was to examine the acute effects of consuming two different&#xD;
      fitness drink formulas on the physiological response at rest and to exercise in healthy men&#xD;
      and women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thermogenic fitness drinks containing ~200mg of caffeine have been reported to accelerate the&#xD;
      metabolism, increase energy, and consequently promote increased fat oxidation. However,&#xD;
      determination of the efficacy of lower caffeine concentrations may provide additional options&#xD;
      for individuals with preferences for reduced caffeine intake. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate different fitness drink formulas containing a total of 100mg and 140mg&#xD;
      of caffeine on the physiological response at rest and to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. All participants&#xD;
      completed three testing visits during which they consumed the placebo, the 100mg caffeine&#xD;
      formula, and the 140mg caffeine formula. Blood samples, blood pressure, heart rate, resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, and neurocognitive assessments were collected at&#xD;
      baseline and repeated 30, 60, and 90 minutes post-ingestion. Immediately following the last&#xD;
      cognitive assessment, a maximal graded exercise test with gas analysis was conducted on a&#xD;
      cycle ergometer to evaluate physical performance and maximal fat oxidation during exercise as&#xD;
      well as the physiological response prior to and following exercise.&#xD;
