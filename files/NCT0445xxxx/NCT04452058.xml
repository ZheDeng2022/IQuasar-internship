      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the combined radiomic model based on&#xD;
      radiomic features extracted from focus and perifocal area (5mm) can effectively improve&#xD;
      prediction performance of distinguishing precancerous lesions from early-stage lung&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, which could assist clinical decision making for surgery indication. Besides,&#xD;
      response and long term clinical benefit of immunotherapy of advanced NSCLC lung cancer&#xD;
      patients could also be predicted by this strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules is clinically significant regarding&#xD;
      optimal treatment selection and avoidance of unnecessary surgical procedures. Deferential&#xD;
      pathology results causes widely different prognosis after standard surgery among pulmonary&#xD;
      precancerous lesion, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) as well as adenocarcinoma in situ&#xD;
      (AIS), and early stage invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). The micro-invasion of pulmonary&#xD;
      perifocal interstitium is difficult to identify from AIS unless pathology immunohistochemical&#xD;
      study was implemented after operation，which may causes prolonged procedure time and&#xD;
      inappropriate surgical decision-making. Key feature-derived variables screened from CT scans&#xD;
      via statistics and machine learning algorithms, could form a radiomics signature for disease&#xD;
      diagnosis, tumor staging, therapy response adn patient prognosis. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      was to investigate whether the combined radiomic signature based on the focal and&#xD;
      perifocal（5mm）radiomic features can effectively improve predictive performance of&#xD;
      distinguishing precancerous lesions from early stage lung adenocarcinoma. Besides,&#xD;
      immunotherapy response is various among patients and no more than 20% of patients could&#xD;
      benefit from it. None reliable biomarker has been found yet expect Programmed death-ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1) expression, the only approved biomarker for immunotherapy. However recent reports&#xD;
      suggested that patients could benefit from immunotherapy regardless of PD-L1 positive or&#xD;
      negative. On the contrast, radiomics has show it advantages of non-invasiveness,&#xD;
      easy-acquired and no limitation of sampling. Therefore, we applied this strategy in&#xD;
      prediction for the immunotherapy response of advanced NSCLC lung cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which would prevent some non-benefit patient from the&#xD;
      adverse effect of ICIs.&#xD;
