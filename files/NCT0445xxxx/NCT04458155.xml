  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, diagnostic, cohort study within the standard care of acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. It compares the analytical performance of Siemens®&#xD;
      point-of-care high sensitive troponin I testing in venous, plasma and capillary sample types.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there is a good correlation between the Siemens® POC HS&#xD;
      cTnI assay results for the three sample types and that the bias between different POC sample&#xD;
      types reduces from ~10% to ≤ 5% when using heparinized transfer device for the capillary&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In September 2019, the validation study 1.0 started, in which the cTnI result of the Siemens&#xD;
      POC device on three sample types are compared. Interim analysis of the sample comparison was&#xD;
      performed by regression analysis using Passing and Bablock, and calculating the Pearson&#xD;
      correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Li-hep Plasma vs Li-hep venous blood show a very good correlation of 1.00-1.03 with an R&#xD;
      of &gt;0.99, so the results between these sample types can be used interchangeably. For the&#xD;
      capillary sample vs the Li-hep sample (both blood and plasma) the slope is 8-12% higher. With&#xD;
      a 8-12% higher response, the capillary test results may not be interchangeably used with the&#xD;
      other 2 sample types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is remarkable that capillary samples give a higher response, since it was anticipated that&#xD;
      the result may be slightly lower due to the possible dilution by interstitial fluid. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the presence of the Li-heparin anti-coagulant in the venous&#xD;
      draw lead to a slight reduction of the apparent cTnI concentration. By using a heparin coated&#xD;
      transfer device for the capillary samples instead of an uncoated transfer device, this&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to compare the analytical performance of Siemens® point-of-care high sensitive troponin I testing in different sample types by using the coefficient of variation.&#xD;
This comparison will comprise Siemens® POC capillary vs. Siemens® POC venipuncture and vs. Siemens® POC plasma (Sample comparison).&#xD;
The primary objective will be achieved by taking:&#xD;
Two capillary samples &gt; one sample with a heparin coated transfer device (drawn from a finger of the right hand) and the other one with a non-heparin coated transfer device. (drawn from a finger of the left hand)&#xD;
One extra venous blood sample &gt; for POC venous and POC plasma analysis.&#xD;
Trained clinical staff will collect the different samples. All samples will be collected once, at one time point with a maximum of 10 minutes in between.</description>
