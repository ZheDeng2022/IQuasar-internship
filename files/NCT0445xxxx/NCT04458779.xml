  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects 16.9 million individuals each year and is the second leading cause of death&#xD;
      worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacologic therapy, morbidity , mortality and rates of&#xD;
      hospitalization for stroke remain high. These data emphasize the importance of identifying&#xD;
      all treatable conditions that could aggravate stroke. One such condition is obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive and central sleep apnea, often&#xD;
      coexist with stroke. Compared to the general population, in whom OSA is the most common form&#xD;
      of this breathing disorder with recent prevalence estimates of 22% of male and 17% of female&#xD;
      , in the stroke population, the prevalence of OSA is much greater at 70% . Several randomized&#xD;
      controlledtrials on OSA patients with stroke in acute or sub-acute stage showed that treating&#xD;
      OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improved motor and functional outcomes,&#xD;
      accelerated neurological recovery.Apart from the benefits in better neurological outcomes,&#xD;
      secondary analyses of SAVE study suggested that CPAP treatment potentially help to reduce&#xD;
      recurrence of stroke. Nevertheless, we don't have evidence yet from randomized control&#xD;
      studies to prove CPAP treatment would reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular or&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events uses documented&#xD;
      mortality, morbidity or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or stroke&#xD;
      as clinical endpoints. Recently, several studies showed that enlarged left atrium (LA) can&#xD;
      serve as a predictor for recurrent stroke or cardiovascular events. On the other hand, a&#xD;
      growing body of studies demonstrated that CPAP treatment reduce size of LA in those with OSA.&#xD;
      Notably, all of these studies above are observational or retrospective in nature. To date,&#xD;
      there are no prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of&#xD;
      CPAP treatment of OSA on the change of size of LA. We therefore will undertake a randomized ,&#xD;
      controlled trial involving patients with stroke to test the primary hypothesis that treatment&#xD;
      of OSA with CPAP would reduce the size of LA.&#xD;
