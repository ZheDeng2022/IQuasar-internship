  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause for cancer related mortality in the western world&#xD;
      with a lifetime risk of 6%. Etiology is complex, while genetic background significantly&#xD;
      affects the risk. Around one third of all genetic disorders as well as most cases of Familial&#xD;
      Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and a large proportion of all sporadic CRC cases occur as a&#xD;
      result of premature nonsense mutations (creating a stop codon) in an individual's adenomatous&#xD;
      polyposis coli (APC) gene. Nonsense mutations are single-point alterations in the DNA that&#xD;
      prematurely halt the protein translation process, producing a shortened, nonfunctional&#xD;
      protein. In many of these cases, if the cell can be 'persuaded' to ignore the premature stop&#xD;
      codon signal, the resulting protein may be able to ameliorate or stop the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, members of the aminoglycoside family of antibiotics have been found to induce&#xD;
      ribosomal read-through of nonsense mutations, leading to expression of a full length,&#xD;
      functional protein. Investigators have recently shown that members of the aminoglycoside and&#xD;
      macrolide antibiotic families can induce read-through of the nonsense mutations in the APC&#xD;
      gene and lead to reduced oncogenic phenotypes in CRC cells and in different mice models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to determine the ability of the macrolide antibiotic-Azithromycin&#xD;
      to induce read-through of the nonsense mutations in the APC gene and to induce expression of&#xD;
      a full length, functional APC protein in patients suffering from FAP and to tests its effect&#xD;
      on adenoma number and size and on desmoid tumors in these patients. The future goal is to&#xD;
      maximize the effect of stop-codon suppressors on APC while minimizing side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will select FAP patients which carry APC nonsense mutations,&#xD;
      treat them with Azithromycin PO for 4-6 months and examine colonic and duodenal adenomas as&#xD;
      well as abdominal desmoid tumors, that will be documented before during and after treatment.&#xD;
      In parallel, investigators will test polyp, adenoma and desmoid tissue samples as well as&#xD;
      blood samples from these patients for changes in expression levels of the APC protein and&#xD;
      related oncogenic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suppression of nonsense mutations within the APC gene should be of benefit for patients&#xD;
      suffering from FAP, attenuated FAP or multiple adenomas and for patients with advanced or&#xD;
      diffuse CRC. Furthermore, given the rapid progress being made in the identification of&#xD;
      different nonsense mutations in human genes that lead to mostly non-curable disease, the&#xD;
      identification of clinically approved compounds that suppress nonsense mutations and that can&#xD;
      be administered long-term without significant side effects would open new venues in the&#xD;
      treatment of genetic human diseases that arise from pre-mature stop codons in important&#xD;
      coding sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate goal: establish the ability of Azithromycin to read-through APC nonsense mutation&#xD;
      in FAP patients. The read-through effect of Azithromycin will be clinically tested by&#xD;
      counting and measuring the number and size of both colonic and duodenal adenomas before and&#xD;
      over treatment and by measuring the size of known desmoid tumors. Samples of the adenomas and&#xD;
      desmoid tumors will be tested by western blot, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      for restoration of APC expression and changes in oncogenic markers. These experiments should&#xD;
      be conducted within 6 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the lowest dose of Azithromycin that can inhibit growth of colonic neoplasia&#xD;
           and CRC in patients expressing a truncated APC protein due to nonsense mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the ability of a panel of additional macrolide antibiotics to induce APC&#xD;
           nonsense mutation suppression using in-vitro methods. Investigators will focus on&#xD;
           macrolide antibiotics that are currently in clinical use and are administrated for long&#xD;
           terms. These objectives should take around 4 month and will be conducted in parallel.&#xD;
