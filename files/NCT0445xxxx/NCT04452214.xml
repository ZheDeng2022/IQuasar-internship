  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consider the safety and effectiveness of a study drug, CAN04, in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab, in the treatment of incurable or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial cancer, or malignant melanoma. The study&#xD;
      aims to establish a recommended dose of CAN04 in combination with the standard dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Both CAN04 and pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with metastatic or locally advanced, incurable non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;

             carcinoma (HNSCC), urothelial cancer, or malignant melanoma who have exhausted or&#xD;
             declined available standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects progressing on previous treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor targeting&#xD;
             thePD-1/PD-L1 pathway, alone or in combination with chemotherapy after previously&#xD;
             having achieved stable disease or better and stayed on such therapy for ≥12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary or metastatic lesion suitable for biopsy and willingness to undergo repeat&#xD;
             biopsies as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;

             surgery within 4 weeks before first dose of study drug or 5 half-lives, whichever is&#xD;
             shorter. Subjects should have recovered from previous treatment toxicity (except hair&#xD;
             loss and peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of uncontrolled brain metastasis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have previously experienced an immune-related adverse event (irAE) to&#xD;
             pembrolizumab, for which permanent discontinuation is required. Subjects without a&#xD;

          -  Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy (daily&#xD;
             prednisone equivalent doses &gt;10 mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV patients can be enrolled if the infection is adequately controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. Subjects on stable anticoagulant therapy are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
