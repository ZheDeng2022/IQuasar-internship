      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of the different formulations in all participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) and seroneutralization (SN) antibody&#xD;
           responses against hemagglutinin (H1, H3, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) antigens present in&#xD;
           the control vaccine in all groups at all timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe antigenic coverage in each group by assessing the HAI and SN antibody&#xD;
           responses against a panel of H3 antigens (not present in any of the vaccine&#xD;
           formulations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe SN antibody responses in each group against each of the H3 antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare H3 HAI and SN antibody responses for the groups with quadrivalent recombinant&#xD;
           influenza vaccine (RIV) formulations with H3 antigens to those of the quadrivalent RIV&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the HAI and SN antibody responses for the groups with quadrivalent RIV&#xD;
           formulation with adjuvant to the group without adjuvant.&#xD;
