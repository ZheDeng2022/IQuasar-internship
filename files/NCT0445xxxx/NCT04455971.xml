  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to use an observational design to examine whether the&#xD;
      practice of orgasmic meditation (OM) is associated with app-based measures of sleep quality.&#xD;
      A secondary purpose of this study is to examine whether the occurrence of physiological&#xD;
      orgasm during OM practice is associated with app-based measures of sleep quality. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the practice of OM will have a positive impact on sleep quality.&#xD;
