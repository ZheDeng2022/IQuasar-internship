  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are cornerstone treatment in secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.&#xD;
      Today, statin non-adherence (patients not taking their prescribed drug) remains a major&#xD;
      public health concern, leading to adverse outcomes in terms of morbidity, mortality and&#xD;
      healthcare costs. The principal reason for statin non-adherence and discontinuation is&#xD;
      statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Objective SAMS diagnostics do not exist. We aim to&#xD;
      unravel the pathophysiology of SAMS and develop diagnostic tools to differentiate real SAMS&#xD;
      from muscle symptoms not related to the statin, among coronary patients with self-perceived&#xD;
      SAMS. In this follow-up study we aims to determine the effect of 7 weeks open treatment with&#xD;
      atorvastatin 40 mg/day, followed by 7 weeks open treatment with no lipid lowering treatment,&#xD;
      on muscle symptom intensity in patients classified with confirmed statin-associated muscle&#xD;
      symptoms (SAMS) (i.e. statin-dependent muscle side-effects) and non-SAMS in the MUscle&#xD;
      Side-Effects of atorvastatin in coronary patients (MUSE) randomized double blinded cross-over&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed novel methods that will be used to measure atorvastatin metabolites and&#xD;
      drug effect biomarkers directly in skeletal muscle and blood . The diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      these biomarkers to differentiate real SAMS from non-SAMS will be evaluated. A new diagnostic&#xD;
      tool may potentially be implemented to assess SAMS in the individual patient and enable&#xD;
      personalized follow-up. It may also represent an important tool in the communication with&#xD;
      patients misattributing their muscle symptoms to statins. The long-term results may be better&#xD;
      quality of life and reduced morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.&#xD;
