    <textblock>
      Biliary leak is a common complication after partial liver resection in living donor liver&#xD;
      transplant. It debases the quality of the postoperative course and affects morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Detecting and localizing sites of biliary leak intraoperatively through bile&#xD;
      leakage testing is important as it helps in detection of bile leaking points on the cut&#xD;
      surface and decrease post-operative bile leak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will assess the efficacy and sensitivity of using White test in comparison&#xD;
      to conventional saline test in detecting intra operative bile leakage in liver donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The White test uses fat emulsion (SMOFLIPID), which is a lipid emulsion with a lipid content&#xD;
      of 0.2 grams/mL in 100 mL, 250 mL, and 500 Ml that is normally used for parenteral nutrition,&#xD;
      for localization of bile leakage. The use of fat emulsion in bile leakage tests does not&#xD;
      require special equipment, contaminate the wound, cause allergic reaction or damage the bile&#xD;
      duct and surrounding tissues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative bile leakage is one of the commonest causes of sepsis and liver failure after&#xD;
      liver resection in liver donor [ Yamashita YI et al, 2001 ] [ Langer D et al, 2011 ].Various&#xD;
      studies have showed that the incidence of postoperative bile leakage after liver resection&#xD;
      ranges from 3 to 27% [ Erdogan D et al, 2008 ] [ Ishii H et al, 2011 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timely detection and repair of intraoperative bile leakage is extremely important, but&#xD;
      small leakage points are often difficult to detect [ Liu Z et al, 2012 ]. There are different&#xD;
      methods for detecting and or preventing bile leakage after partial liver resection, including&#xD;
      bile leakage tests, which detect open bile duct stumps on the resection surface through&#xD;
      increasing fluid pressure within the duct [ Lo CM et al, 1998 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional intraoperative saline test, which involves injecting an isotonic sodium&#xD;
      chloride solution through the cystic duct, has been used for detection of leaking points from&#xD;
      the transected liver surface [ Ijichi M et al, 2000 ]. One of the main problems in using the&#xD;
      conventional bile leakage test is that the isotonic sodium chloride solution is a transparent&#xD;
      solution. Therefore, it is hard to detect the point of bile leakage. A previous randomized&#xD;
      study stated that there is no advantage to using the isotonic sodium chloride solution for&#xD;
      the bile leakage test during liver resection [ Ijichi M et al, 2000 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past decade, several bile leak tests have been proposed, with none gaining wide&#xD;
      acceptance. The intraductal injection of saline is a low-cost and reproducible technique, but&#xD;
      the transparent solution makes this technique inadequate for detecting small ducts. The&#xD;
      injection of dye solutions (e.g. methylene blue and indocyanine green) has been recommended.&#xD;
      However, these solutions need to be dense in order to allow the visualization of the leak&#xD;
      site. The related disadvantages of this approach include the following: 1) the indelible&#xD;
      coloration of the transection surface, which can mask additional small open ducts, 2) the&#xD;
      impossibility to wash out the staining and, consequently, 3) potential reduced sensitivity&#xD;
      for the detection of leak with repeated tests. Some centres have reported the saturation of&#xD;
      the cut surface of the liver with hydrogen peroxide to detect bile leaks, however this&#xD;
      practice comes with a potential risk of expansion air embolism via open hepatic veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The White test uses fat emulsion (SMOFLIPID), which is a lipid emulsion with a lipid content&#xD;
      of 0.2 grams/mL in 100 mL, 250 mL, and 500 Ml that is normally used for parenteral nutrition,&#xD;
      for localization of bile leakage (Morris-Stiff G et al., 2009). The use of fat emulsion in&#xD;
      bile leakage tests does not require special equipment, contaminate the wound, cause allergic&#xD;
      reaction or damage the bile duct and surrounding tissues. It can easily be repeated the&#xD;
      number of times necessary to detect and close all leakage points, can pinpoint even small&#xD;
      leaks and is inexpensive. This technique is easier to perform than fluorescent imaging, and&#xD;
      is more sensitive and reliable compared with saline bile leakage test used alone (Leelawat K&#xD;
      et al., 2012; Kaibori M et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, intraoperative application of the White test has been demonstrated to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative bile leakage [ Li J et al, 2009 ] [ Nadalin S et al, 2008 ]. In&#xD;
      this technique, bile leakage sites on the transected liver surface are noted by injecting a&#xD;
      fat emulsion solution through the cystic duct. The previous prospective observational studies&#xD;
      suggested that the fat emulsion solution used in the White test is easily recognized,&#xD;
      innocuous and harmeless to the tissues, and can be easily removed without misleading tissue&#xD;
      staining [ Li J et al, 2009 ] [ Nadalin S et al, 2008 ]. Therefore, this prospective study&#xD;
      will assess whether the White test is better than the conventional saline test for the&#xD;
      intraoperative detection of bile leakage and better prevention of post-operative bile leakage&#xD;
      in partial resection in living donor liver transplant.&#xD;
