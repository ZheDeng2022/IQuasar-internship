  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation commonly&#xD;
      results in right ventricular failure (RVF). Right ventricular dysfunction and failure after&#xD;
      LVAD implantation is known to increase morbidity and mortality and contribute to longer&#xD;
      post-implant hospital length of stay. Since RVF is difficult to predict and can have harmful&#xD;
      effects such as increased ICU stay, adverse outcomes, and mortality, it could be beneficial&#xD;
      to preemptively treat patients through preoperative or intraoperative percutaneous right&#xD;
      ventricular assist device (RVAD) placement to prevent RVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will include both a prospective interventional cohort and a retrospective control&#xD;
      cohort. The prospective interventional cohort will consist of patients undergoing LVAD&#xD;
      implantation at Massachusetts General Hospital. These patients will preemptively receive an&#xD;
      RVAD (either the ProtekDuo or Impella RP) surrounding LVAD implantation. The historical&#xD;
      control cohort will consist of retrospective data collection on patients who have undergone&#xD;
      LVAD implantation in the past. This group will be matched with the enrolled prospective&#xD;
      interventional patients. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      standard of care treatment versus percutaneous RVAD placement perioperatively to LVAD&#xD;
      implantation. The investigators hypothesize that the use of the RVAD will mitigate need for&#xD;
      inotropic support, reducing the vasoactive-inotrope score (VIS) by 50%, and will improve end&#xD;
      organ function in patients compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who consent to the study will undergo peri-operative placement of an RVAD, which&#xD;
      will be left in up to 72 hours postoperatively. The type of RVAD (Impella RP or ProtekDuo)&#xD;
      inserted will be determined by patient needs and venous access and will be up to the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating physician. 25 subjects will be enrolled in the prospective&#xD;
      interventional cohort and compared to 25 subjects in the matched retrospective control&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prior studies have shown that left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation commonly&#xD;
      results in right ventricular failure (RVF). Right ventricular dysfunction and failure after&#xD;
      LVAD implantation is known to increase morbidity and mortality and contribute to longer&#xD;
      post-implant hospital length of stay. More severe right ventricular failure is highly&#xD;
      correlated with poor prognosis and death post-LVAD implantation. In current practice,&#xD;
      patients who receive LVADs require right heart support, provided in the form of inotropes.&#xD;
      Vasoactive inotrope score (VIS) is a measure that quantifies the amount of right heart&#xD;
      support required post-operatively, including dopamine, dobutamine, milrinone, epinephrine,&#xD;
      norepinephrine, and vasopressin. It has been used in other studies as a surrogate marker for&#xD;
      hemodynamic cardiovascular derangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cases, right ventricular failure post-LVAD also requires mechanical circulatory&#xD;
      support during the perioperative period. Since RVF is difficult to predict and can have&#xD;
      harmful effects such as increased ICU stay, adverse outcomes, and mortality, it could be&#xD;
      beneficial to preemptively treat patients through preoperative or intraoperative percutaneous&#xD;
      right ventricular assist device (RVAD) placement to prevent RVF. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that preemptive use of percutaneous RVADs will mitigate the need for&#xD;
      inotropic support in LVAD patients, reducing associated adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will include both a prospective interventional cohort and a retrospective control&#xD;
      cohort. The prospective interventional cohort will consist of patients undergoing LVAD&#xD;
      implantation at Massachusetts General Hospital. These patients will receive an RVAD (either&#xD;
      the ProtekDuo or Impella RP) prior to or during LVAD implantation. The historical control&#xD;
      cohort will consist of retrospective data collection on patients who have undergone LVAD&#xD;
      implantation in the past. This group will be matched with the enrolled prospective&#xD;
      interventional patients. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      standard of care treatment versus preemptive percutaneous RVAD placement surrounding LVAD&#xD;
      implantation. The investigators hypothesize that the use of the RVAD will mitigate need for&#xD;
      inotropic support, reducing the vasoactive-inotrope score (VIS) by 50%, and will improve end&#xD;
      organ function in patients compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two types of percutaneous RVADs that will be used in the study: the Impella RP and&#xD;
      the ProtekDuo. These devices allow for early intervention in RVF without the need for&#xD;
      invasive surgical procedures requiring placement of durable RVADs via thoracotomy or&#xD;
      sternotomy. The Impella RP, manufactured by Abiomed, is a heart pump that delivers blood from&#xD;
      the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the pulmonary artery (PA). Its insertion is done&#xD;
      percutaneously via catheterization through the femoral vein. ProtekDuo, manufactured by&#xD;
      TandemLife, is another device placed percutaneously for right heart support via the right&#xD;
      internal jugular (RIJ) vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who consent to the study will undergo pre-operative or intra-operative placement of&#xD;
      an RVAD, which will be left in up to 72 hours postoperatively. The type of RVAD (Impella RP&#xD;
      or ProtekDuo) inserted will be determined by patient needs and venous access and will be up&#xD;
      to the discretion of the treating physician. 25 subjects will be enrolled in the prospective&#xD;
      interventional cohort and compared to 25 subjects in the matched retrospective control&#xD;
      cohort.&#xD;
