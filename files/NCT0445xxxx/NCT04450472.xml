      Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is prevalent in critical illness; it is associated with&#xD;
      poor outcomes. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between NTIS and short&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (SBS). The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, etiology, and&#xD;
      prognosis of NTIS and its correlation in clinical variables in adult patients with SBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), also known as euthyroid sick syndrome or low&#xD;
      triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome, is a condition characterized by decreased serum&#xD;
      concentrations of T3 and low or normal plasma concentrations of thyroxine (T4) without a&#xD;
      compensatory increase in the serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). However, such&#xD;
      typical changes differ from those in primary or secondary thyroid disorders. NTIS refers to&#xD;
      distortions in thyroid function without thyroid disease caused by various critical illnesses.&#xD;
      This condition has been described in different acute and chronic disease states over the past&#xD;
      30 years, including sepsis, starvation, trauma, burns, myocardial infarction, Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, enterocutaneous fistulas, chronic kidney disease, and major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short bowel syndrome (SBS), the most common form of intestinal failure, is a rare condition&#xD;
      resulting from the loss of portions of the intestine, typically because of extensive surgical&#xD;
      resection or loss of intestinal function. Patients with SBS often stuffer from intestinal&#xD;
      insufficiency or intestinal failure because they are unable to maintain fluid and nutrient&#xD;
      balances on a normal diet. Therefore, SBS can cause various metabolic and physiologic&#xD;
      disturbances, many of which are associated with growth, intestinal adaptation, and hormone&#xD;
      secretion. Many previous studies of SBS have evaluated growth hormone, glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1, glucagon-like peptide-2, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone, peptide YY, and&#xD;
      ghrelin. However, few studies have reported the association between SBS and the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and its balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was performed to evaluate the association of thyroid hormone disturbance&#xD;
      and SBS in adult patients. Because NTIS is the main type of thyroid hormone disturbance, we&#xD;
      further investigated the incidence, underlying mechanisms, and correlation with clinical&#xD;
      variables and prognosis of NTIS in adult patients with SBS.&#xD;
