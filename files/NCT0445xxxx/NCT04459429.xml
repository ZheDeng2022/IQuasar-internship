  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with nasal high flow therapy (NHF) is an increasingly popular method of respiratory&#xD;
      support in newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safe and effective use of NHF requires selection of an appropriate nasal prong-to-nares ratio&#xD;
      because leak can influence the delivered pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of using&#xD;
      different NHF cannula size on peripheral oxygen saturation in newborns with respiratory&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NHF will be applied at 8 L/min using the AIRVO 2 through smaller and larger Optiflow nasal&#xD;
      cannula. The study will have a randomized crossover design. The larger or smaller cannula&#xD;
      size will be applied as the first intervention during each experiment. During each&#xD;
      experiment, if the larger cannula is applied first, then the smaller cannula will be applied&#xD;
      second and if the smaller cannula is applied first, then the larger cannula will be applied&#xD;
      second. Each experiment will last for 1.5 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During baseline, supplemental oxygen will be added during NHF therapy to keep SpO2 in&#xD;
           normal ranges (90%-94%). When the SpO2 has stabilized then the level of supplemental&#xD;
           oxygen will be set for the entire experiment unless there is a significant change in&#xD;
           SpO2 as determined by the attending consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be three consecutive 30-min periods of recording during each experiment and&#xD;
           each experiment will last approximately 1.5 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilation will be assessed by Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (Respitrace) and&#xD;
           transcutaneous carbon dioxide and oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recordings will be made using ADInstruments Powerlab and Labchart software with video&#xD;
           recording of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations will be&#xD;
           performed as per standard neonatal practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher is an experienced neonatal consultant who will be directly observing the baby&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
