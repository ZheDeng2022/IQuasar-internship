  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Pakistan, breastfeeding is widely practiced. National data suggests that 94% of infants &lt;2&#xD;
      years of age receive breastmilk at some point. However, the introduction of complementary&#xD;
      foods often occurs early. At 3 months of age, it is suggested that only 54% of Pakistani&#xD;
      infants are exclusively breastfed. This declines with each month of age. Because the&#xD;
      production and release of breastmilk is influenced by the frequency and intensity of&#xD;
      suckling, early initiation of complementary feeding can reduce breastmilk output. Given that&#xD;
      complementary foods are introduced early within Pakistan, we hypothesize that breastmilk&#xD;
      composition will change between 1 and 3 months postpartum among those mother-infant pairs if&#xD;
      nutritive complementary foods are introduced early (i.e., before 6 months). In this study, we&#xD;
      aim to better understand how breastmilk composition changes over time among infants recruited&#xD;
      at 1 month of age who are exclusively breastfed or receive only non-nutritive feeds. This is&#xD;
      a substudy to the Matiari emPowerment and Preconception Supplementation (MaPPS) Trial&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03287882).&#xD;
