    <textblock>
      This study will test whether CVL-562 (PF-06412562), a dopamine 1 partial agonist novel&#xD;
      compound, affects working memory neural circuits in patients with early episode&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The overall aim is to establish neuroimaging biomarkers of the Dopamine&#xD;
      Receptor 1/Dopamine Receptor 5 Family (D1R/D5R) target engagement to accelerate development&#xD;
      of D1R/D5R agonists in humans to treat cognitive impairments that underlie functional&#xD;
      disability in schizophrenia, a key unaddressed clinical and public health concern.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study proposes to examine the effects of CVL-562 (PF-06412562), a dopamine-1 receptor&#xD;
      partial agonist, on the neural signal of brain regions involved in cognition in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      understand the neural circuit targets of this compound as it relates to improving cognition&#xD;
      in schizophrenia, using a spatial working memory task (sWM). The secondary objective will&#xD;
      quantify dose-related drug effects on sWM precision based on behavioral data collected during&#xD;
      scanning and examine effects on functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be psychiatrically stable with early course (psychotic symptom onset within&#xD;
      the past 5 years) schizophrenia spectrum disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder, or schizophreniform disorder) and will have working memory deficits (defined as&#xD;
      below average performance on the letter n-back task of the PennCNB battery). As part of the&#xD;
      study, they will receive oral administration of specified doses of CVL-562 (PF-06412562), in&#xD;
      a random order with repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing&#xD;
      during those visits. The most common side effects of this compound are nausea and headache.&#xD;
      This is a multi-site study that requires the efforts of 4 study sites in total (Columbia,&#xD;
      State University of New York Stony Brook, UPenn, and Yale).&#xD;

    <measure>Neural activity across brain regions during a spatial working memory (sWM) task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>Neural activity will be measured by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal that will be assessed during functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) sessions. During each fMRI session, subjects will participate in a sWM task that involves the ability to keep a spatial location in mind over a short period of time. The sWM task includes four conditions: 1) only sWM; 2) a motor response without sWM; 3) sWM with a distracter presented near the original memory location; and 4) sWM with a distractor presented far away from the original memory location. For each condition, BOLD signal will be assessed over 20 timepoints, each measuring for 0.8 seconds [total 16s]. Each subject will undergo 5 fMRI sessions, one at each dose.</description>

    <measure>Performance during spatial working memory (sWM) task</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>During each fMRI session, subjects will participate in a sWM task that involves the ability to keep a spatial location in mind over a short period of time. The sWM task includes four conditions: 1) only sWM; 2) a motor response without sWM; 3) sWM with a distracter presented near the original memory location; and 4) sWM with a distractor presented far away from the original memory location. Performance will be assessed with the average accuracy measured during this task for each task condition and each CVL-562 (PF-06412562) dose. Accuracy refers to the angular distance between a cued location and a participant's memory of the location. The range of accuracy is between 0-180 degrees. 0 degrees would indicate the best possible performance, and 180 degrees the worst performance. Each subject will undergo 5 fMRI sessions, each at a different dose of CVL-562 (PF-06412562).</description>

    <measure>Association between neural activity and task performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>Neural activity will be measured by blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal that will be assessed during fMRI, where subjects will participate in a spatial working memory (sWM) task. The sWM includes four conditions: 1) only sWM; 2) a motor response without sWM; 3) sWM with a distracter presented near the original memory location; and 4) sWM with a distractor presented far away from the original memory location. The performance of sWM at each trial of each condition will be used as the predictor variable, and the BOLD signal at the corresponding trial and condition will be used as the outcome variable. A trial refers to a single probing and measurement of sWM, and is repeatedly presented to get a number of sWM measurements. The performance of sWM from each trial will be regressed with the BOLD signal from that trial, and we will report the resulting beta weights at each condition and dose. Each subject will undergo 5 fMRI sessions, each at a different dose of CVL-562 (PF-06412562).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional connectivity across brain regions with the fronto-parietal network during sWM task</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional connectivity will be assessed during each fMRI session. Functional connectivity refers to the correlation between the time series of different brain regions collected during fMRI. During each fMRI session, subjects will participate in a sWM task that involves the ability to keep a spatial location in mind over a short period of time. The sWM task includes four conditions: 1) only sWM; 2) a motor response without sWM; 3) sWM with a distracter presented near the original memory location; and 4) sWM with a distractor presented far away from the original memory location. For each condition, the functional connectivity of the fronto-parietal network will be measured with the rest of the brain. The range of functional connectivity is between -4.95 and 4.95. -4.95 would indicate highly negative functional connectivity and 4.95 would indicate highly positive functional connectivity. Each subject will undergo 5 fMRI sessions, each at a different dose of CVL-562 (PF-06412562).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting state global brain functional connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD signal will be collected during the resting state aspect of the fMRI session, using a data-driven global brain connectivity (GBC) metric. GBC examines connectivity from a given voxel (or area) to all other voxels (or areas) simultaneously by computing average connectivity strength. The range of GBC is between -4.95 and 4.95. -4.95 would indicate highly negative broad functional connectivity in synchrony with the rest of the brain and 4.95 would indicate highly positive broad functional connectivity in synchrony with the rest of the brain. GBC will be obtained at each PF-06412562 dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of participants with change in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal during spatial working memory (sWM) task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>The dose-response in BOLD signal will be examined for each individual participant to see how many participants exhibit a change in BOLD signal overall. For each individual, binary outcome will be calculated based on a Dose by Condition by Time within subject analysis of BOLD signal. We will report the proportion of participants that exhibits a dose response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spatial similarity of resting state global brain functional connectivity with transcriptomic maps.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours for each fMRI session.</time_frame>
    <description>Transcriptomics maps will be derived from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), which provides gene expression data mapped to the cortical surface. The spatial similarity of resting state global brain functional connectivity (GBC) and gene expression patterns for the D1/D5 receptors will be assessed for each CVL-562 (PF-06412562) dose. The spatial similarity refers to correlation between GBC maps and the cortical gene expression maps. Each subject will undergo 5 fMRI sessions, each at a different dose of CVL-562 (PF-06412562).</description>
