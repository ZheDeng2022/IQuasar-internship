      Rationale Several experimental and clinical studies have shown how brain injury can cause&#xD;
      secondary lung injury. Lung injury could be due either to mechanical ventilation- often&#xD;
      necessary in brain injured patients- or to inflammatory response that follows primary acute&#xD;
      brain injury. The concept of 'Protective lung ventilation' has shown to reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) but seems also to have a beneficial effect on patients with healthy lungs and in the&#xD;
      perioperative settings. However, these recommendations often come into conflict with the&#xD;
      management of patients affected by acute brain injury, in which permissive hypercapnia and&#xD;
      increased intrathoracic pressure as consequence of protective ventilation strategies can be&#xD;
      dangerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is an international multi-center prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population This study will include all consecutive brain injured patients (traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (TBI) or cerebrovascular) intubated and ventilated in ICU and observed for a&#xD;
      7-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness Seen the observational design of the study, there is no patient burden.&#xD;
      Collection of data from ICU and hospital charts and/or (electronic) medical records systems&#xD;
      is of no risk to patients.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a frequently applied and often a&#xD;
      life-saving strategy in neurocritically ill patients. Paradoxically, ventilation itself has&#xD;
      the potential to cause further pulmonary and cerebral damage and can increase mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The so-called 'protective lung ventilation' strategies include the use of low tidal volume&#xD;
      (TV), positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and eventually recruitment maneuvers (RMs),&#xD;
      and are aimed to prevent lung damage and to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2]. In particular, low tidal volume seems to have&#xD;
      the greater importance [3-5], and guidelines strongly recommend its use in critically ill&#xD;
      patients with ARDS [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from one multicenter randomized controlled trial suggest that also ICU patients&#xD;
      without ARDS could benefit from 'protective lung ventilation strategies [7]. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of pulmonary complications and even increased&#xD;
      mortality in patients who received 'conventional ventilation' with traditionally sized or&#xD;
      higher tidal volumes compared to patients undergoing protective strategies [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present ventilation guidelines for patients with acute brain injury The fourth edition of the&#xD;
      Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury [10] suggests maintaining&#xD;
      normocapnia in this subset of patients and aiming for peripheral saturation of oxygen higher&#xD;
      than 90% to guarantee an adequate cerebral perfusion and avoid secondary brain damages due to&#xD;
      hypoxia or inappropriate cerebral vasodilatation [10]. However, BTF guidelines do not provide&#xD;
      any advice on ventilator settings or targets. There is still uncertainty regarding the use of&#xD;
      protective ventilation in neurologically ill patients. Brain injured patients have been&#xD;
      traditionally excluded from the major trials regarding mechanical ventilation and the use of&#xD;
      lung protective ventilator strategies because low tidal volumes, high PEEP and RMs can&#xD;
      increase carbon dioxide levels (CO2) and increase intrathoracic pressure, thus having&#xD;
      detrimental effects on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to determine the ventilation practice of consecutive intubated&#xD;
      and ventilated neuro-ICU patients in the first week from admission in intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with acute brain injury, protective ventilation strategies are not often&#xD;
           applied; in particular, tidal volumes are higher than those used in patients with no&#xD;
           brain injury. The adoption of protective ventilation in this group of patients might&#xD;
           result in a beneficial effect on outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilation practice, in particular tidal volume size, varies among patients with acute&#xD;
           brain injury and among different centers and different countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with acute brain injury outcomes can be dependent on ventilator setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      International multicenter prospective observational study of consecutive ventilated neuro-ICU&#xD;
      patients in the first week since admission to ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect data of consecutive patients with acute brain injury intubated and&#xD;
      ventilated, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the exploration of the ventilator settings in clinical&#xD;
      practice in braininjured patients. The hypotheses of the study are exploratory; hence a&#xD;
      sample size calculation has not been conducted. This international prospective observational&#xD;
      study aims to recruit&gt;3000 patients in coma after acute brain damage admitted to &gt;200&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Recruitment will last 12 weeks at each center, aiming to enroll&#xD;
      about 20 patients/center. To avoid any overrepresentation of some centers we ceil the data&#xD;
      collection to 30 patients/center. This number of enrolled patients and ICUs reflects an&#xD;
      adequate sample size to capture a range of variation in practice between ICUs. We aim to&#xD;
      include also low-middle income countries, in order to have a representation of the&#xD;
      variability worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up/Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be followed until ICU-discharge or death (whatever comes first), for&#xD;
      collection of patient demographics (on day of admission), and ventilation characteristics&#xD;
      (from start of ventilation till stop of ventilation). At 6 months, data on length of hospital&#xD;
      stay and outcome (Extended Glasgow Coma Scale) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-months mortality and neurological outcome (as for extended Glasgow Outcome Scale,&#xD;
           eGOS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital length of stay (in days), in hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (in days), ventilator free days (days) at&#xD;
           ICU discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in participating centers are screened on a daily basis. ICU-patients under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and with diagnosis of acute brain injury will be included. Demographic&#xD;
      data on screened patients regardless of meeting enrollment criteria will be recorded&#xD;
      (registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period will be flexible for participating centers and determined at a later&#xD;
      stage together with the study-coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Times points of data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data and baseline data, including severity scores (e.g. APACHE II- scores&#xD;
           and SAPS III) will be collected from clinical files on the day of start of mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventilation settings, gas exchange variables and vital parameters will be collected once&#xD;
           daily in the morning till the day when ventilation is stopped or till day 7, whichever&#xD;
           comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest radiography data from available chest X-rays (i.e., no extra chest X-rays are&#xD;
           obtained) in the first week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung echography data are collected from clinical files in the first week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predefined complications are recorded from medical chart (Appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At ICU discharge: mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (in days), ventilator&#xD;
           free days (days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 6-months: mortality and neurological outcome (as for extended Glasgow Outcome Scale,&#xD;
           eGOS), length of stay (in days), in hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion During a 3 months period, all admitted patients will be screened daily by a local&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics will be compared and described by appropriate statistics. Student's&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests will be used to compare continuous variables and chi-squared&#xD;
      tests will be used for categorical variables. Data will be expressed as means (SD), medians&#xD;
      (interquartile range) and proportions as appropriate. Comparisons between and within groups&#xD;
      will be performed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analyses for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of analysis The primary analysis will concern the determination of (variation of) the&#xD;
      ventilator settings in neurologically critically ill patients. Univariate analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to identify potential factors associated with outcomes including, but not limited&#xD;
      to, GOS, mortality, duration of ventilation, or hospital LOS. A multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression model will be used to identify independent risk factors. A stepwise approach will&#xD;
      be used to enter new terms into the model, with a limit of p &lt; 0.2 to enter the terms. Time&#xD;
      to event variables will be analyzed using Cox regression and visualized by Kaplan-Meier.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be conducted using R. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethical standards The PI and Steering Committee will ensure that this&#xD;
      study is conducted in full conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics committee Each NC/PI will notify the relevant ethics committee, in compliance with the&#xD;
      local legislation and rules. The national coordinators will facilitate this process. The&#xD;
      approval of the protocol (if required by local authorities) must be obtained before any&#xD;
      participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by&#xD;
      the SC before the changes are implemented to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of capacity and Delayed Consent Informed consent will be obtained from patients with no&#xD;
      lack of capacity. For patients not be able to provide informed consent at the time of&#xD;
      recruitment, the responsible clinical/research staff will act as Consulter and consent&#xD;
      eligible patients after discussion with the next- of-kin.If the patient has a Power of&#xD;
      Attorney or a Legal tutor or an, he/she will act as Consultee and will be asked to&#xD;
      consent/decline participation to the study on legal behalf of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients have Advance Decision Plan including participation in research studies the Plan&#xD;
      will be respected and recruitment pursued/abandoned accordingly. At follow-up, patients who&#xD;
      have regained capacity will be asked to provide Informed Consent and will be given the&#xD;
      possibility to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide Informed Consent for the acute data and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deny research participation and request destruction of acute data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact of the study The investigators expect to obtain data of &gt;3000 patients&#xD;
      admitted to ICU. These data will allow a detailed description of patient's characteristics,&#xD;
      management strategies resource use and correlation with clinical outcomes. In particular, the&#xD;
      study will provide insights in relation to clinical management, monitoring and treatment,&#xD;
      practice variation in neurointensive care units around the world, differences in the&#xD;
      ventilator management of brain injured patients and their potential association with outcome.&#xD;
