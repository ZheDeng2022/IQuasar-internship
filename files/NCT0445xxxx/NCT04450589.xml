  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the ALRV5XR multi-molecular targeting treatment regimen of a daily&#xD;
      shampoo, conditioner, topical serum and oral supplement is superior to placebo in promoting&#xD;
      hair growth as assessed by change in hair density and percentage of terminal hair regrowth&#xD;
      after ALRV5XR therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in male&#xD;
      subjects randomized to a 1:1 ratio of test article to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to use the study products on a daily basis for the duration of the&#xD;
      24-week study. Subjects will take one capsule twice daily (one in the morning and one in the&#xD;
      evening) and will be asked to use 3-7mL of the shampoo, 3-7mL of the conditioner, and 1mL of&#xD;
      the topical nutriment daily. Subjects will receive detailed instructions regarding the order&#xD;
      and duration of application of each product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the active arm will receive active capsules, shampoo, conditioner and topical&#xD;
      nutriment. Subjects on placebo will receive placebo capsules, shampoo, conditioner and&#xD;
      topical nutriment. All subjects will be instructed to take the capsules orally, one in the&#xD;
      morning and one in the evening, prior to consuming food. Shampoo and conditioner are to be&#xD;
      used once per day when washing the hair and nutriment applied at the end of the day prior to&#xD;
      bedtime. To facilitate this, subjects will receive a 3-month supply of each product&#xD;
      (supplement, shampoo, conditioner, and scalp nutriment). Subjects will continue the daily&#xD;
      regimen for 24 weeks, visiting the clinic at week 12 for an interim assessment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a multi-molecular targeting botanical treatment regimen&#xD;
      on parameters of hair growth, compared to placebo, in healthy male adults with androgenetic&#xD;
      alopecia, diffuse hair loss or self-reported thinning hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study group will include 23 subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned using computer&#xD;
      generated randomization scheme to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to use the study products on a daily basis for the duration of the&#xD;
      24-week study. Subjects will take one capsule twice daily (one in the morning and one in the&#xD;
      evening) and will be instructed to use 3-7mL of the shampoo, 3-7mL of the conditioner, and&#xD;
      1mL of the topical nutriment serum daily. Subjects will receive detailed instructions&#xD;
      regarding the order, and duration of application of each product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted at one (1) American (USA) clinical research site. The duration&#xD;
      of the study will be approximately 28 weeks (7 months), including the screening period. There&#xD;
      will be a screening period of up to 28 days for eligibility assessment, followed by a&#xD;
      baseline visit followed by a 24-week experimentation period for assessment of supplement&#xD;
      effects. There will be a total of seven visits, including a screening visit, over this&#xD;
      28-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as outlined in this protocol and in compliance with the&#xD;
      principles of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines on Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP) (E.6), and the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to initiating any study-related procedures, each subject must provide written informed&#xD;
      consent in accordance with Institutional Research Board (IRB) requirements and applicable&#xD;
      regulations. Any potential subject will be contacted by a designated member of the research&#xD;
      team at the study site. Potential subjects may complete a web-based pre-screening&#xD;
      questionnaire or may be interviewed. During the interview (or web-based questionnaire),&#xD;
      subjects will answer specific questions, in order to assess their eligibility. If they meet&#xD;
      pre-screening requirements, they will be invited to schedule a screening visit (Visit 1) with&#xD;
      a Study Coordinator no more than 30 days prior to the anticipated baseline visit (Visit 2).&#xD;
      In the event that subjects' screening period exceeds 30 days, the Investigator may repeat&#xD;
      blood work, biometrics and/or vital signs (as appropriate) to ensure that subjects remain&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Screening Visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit (Visit 1), up to 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2), the&#xD;
      overall details of the study and the procedures to be undertaken will be explained to the&#xD;
      subject. The following information will be recorded and procedures carried out:&#xD;

      Early Termination/Discontinuation Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may elect to independently withdraw from participation in the study at any time. At&#xD;
      a termination visit, subjects will be encouraged to undergo the procedures specified in the&#xD;
      final study visit. Reasons for early termination/ discontinuation may include the subject&#xD;
      developing any condition which contravenes the original criteria, or, at the discretion of&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator (PI), the subject is considered to be unsuitable to continue the&#xD;
      study. Individual subjects may have administration temporarily interrupted at the discretion&#xD;
      of the PI, e.g. for AEs that are subsequently resolved. Subjects MUST have permanent&#xD;
      discontinuation in the following situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject had a Grade 3 (severe) or an investigational product-related SAE as&#xD;
           determined by the PI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject withdraws consent or refuses further assessment during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in another clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject lost to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled Visits Any study participant who contacts the investigation site about possible&#xD;
      adverse events that are more than minor and/or that persist will be asked to visit the&#xD;
      research centre for an assessment as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Tests Blood will be collected at V1, V4 and V6 for analysis of safety parameters.&#xD;
      Anthropometrics and vital signs are being recorded at study visits number 1, 4, and 6 as&#xD;
      measures of safety. Additionally, safety will be assessed by means of reported AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules/Discontinuation The Investigator may withdraw any subject from this research&#xD;
      if circumstances arise that warrant doing so. If a subject is withdrawn from the study for&#xD;
      any reason, they will be asked to complete an early termination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permitted/Concomitant Medication(s) Subjects will be questioned about their medication&#xD;
      history. The details of any medication taken will be recorded in the case notes and&#xD;
      electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications&#xD;
      (including supplements) not known to affect study endpoints are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid medications will be permitted where dosage has been stable for 6 months prior to the&#xD;
      screening visit (V1) and subjects are not expected to have a dosage change during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited Medication(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications that are prohibited include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anabolic steroids in prior 6 months and during the clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5-alpha reductase inhibitors in prior 6 months and during the clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Products (including natural health products) and/or devices to promote scalp hair growth&#xD;
           (e.g. finasteride, minoxidil, etc.) in 30 days prior to baseline (V2) and during the&#xD;
           clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications that are known to potentially cause hair loss or affect growth as determined&#xD;
           by PI in 30 days prior to baseline (V2) and during the clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of coagulation inhibiting medications (including natural health products) during the&#xD;
           clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of blood pressure lowering medications during the clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs taken&#xD;
           for more than 2 consecutive weeks in the 3 months prior to baseline (V2) and during the&#xD;
           clinical study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Medication(s) As this study is investigating the effects of a product in a healthy&#xD;
      population, there are no rescue medications in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS NUMBER OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS It is estimated that up to&#xD;
      70 subjects will be screened, in order to identify 46 suitable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Subjects may withdraw from participation in a study at any time without&#xD;
      consequence. If a subject withdraws from the study, the PI will make a reasonable effort to&#xD;
      determine the reason for withdrawal from the study, which will be recorded on the eCRF, as&#xD;
      will any AEs experienced by the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal reasons (Subject-initiated): Participation in the study is optional, and a subject&#xD;
      can withdraw from the study at any time, without consequence or prejudice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical judgment of PI: A subject could also be withdrawn from the study if, in the opinion&#xD;
      of the PI, it is not in the subject's best interest to continue (e.g. AEs, need for&#xD;
      prohibited medication, illness, etc.). All serious AEs (SAEs) will result in withdrawal from&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol violation: If a subject fails to comply with the protocol they may be removed at the&#xD;
      discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for withdrawal will be documented as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      W.1 Subject requests withdrawal from the study. W.2 Subject withdraws consent. W.3 AE makes&#xD;
      the continuation of the subject in the study impossible or inadvisable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      W.4 Subject was incorrectly included in the study (discovered after enrollment not to have&#xD;
      met the protocol entrance criteria). W.5 Subject is not complying with required study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
