      This is a program evaluation that will evaluate the effectiveness of Mastering Diabetes, a&#xD;
      therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) program to control prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle change, focused on dietary change, physical activity, stress management and control&#xD;
      of unhealthy substances has been demonstrated effective in preventing the progression of&#xD;
      prediabetes, as well as reversal of diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;

      This will be a nonrandomized controlled study. Participants will self select to be a part of&#xD;
      this intervention. The control data will be aggregated matched data from participants in the&#xD;
      corporate wellness program at Memorial Health System, who choose not to participate in the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have already enrolled in the Memorial Health System (MHS) Corporate&#xD;
      Wellness Program, and have met the inclusion criteria. As part of the wellness program health&#xD;
      risk assessment, potential participants will be provided with a short summary of this program&#xD;
      as a potential activity for their participation, with a link leading to a landing page, which&#xD;
      will explain the study in more detail, and will include a link to the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, about a week after completion of the health risk assessment, if meeting&#xD;
      eligibility for this study, a reminder email will be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the potential participant is interested, they can click the link to move to the on line&#xD;
      consent. If they agree to the consent, they will be taken to an on line HIPAA release form,&#xD;
      which will also need an electronic agreement to be enrolled into the study signified by&#xD;
      typing in the participant's name and date of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once this is completed, an email with an enrollment code and link to Mastering Diabetes will&#xD;
      be sent the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mastering Diabetes Program Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Mastering Diabetes Program is based on the Mastering Diabetes Method, which is based on&#xD;
      almost 100 years of evidence based research demonstrating the effectiveness of a low-fat,&#xD;
      plant-based, whole-food diet to reverse insulin resistance. Members are provided with a&#xD;
      step-by-step online course that educates them how to transition to a low-fat, plant-based,&#xD;
      whole-food lifestyle and reduce the overwhelm associated with ineffective pharmaceutical&#xD;
      medication and ineffective dietary advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online course provides members with detailed information about the root cause of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, the effect of a high-fat diet on increasing insulin resistance, how to achieve&#xD;
      excellent blood glucose values in the short-term and in the long-term, what laboratory tests&#xD;
      to get to measure progress, an overview of oral diabetes medication and insulin, how to track&#xD;
      hour-by-hour decisions for excellent blood glucose control, how to lose weight permanently&#xD;
      using a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet, how to buy food, where to buy food, how to&#xD;
      prepare food easily, the benefits of intermittent fasting for improved insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      how to perform an intermittent fast for excellent results, how to adopt an exercise regimen,&#xD;
      how to control your blood glucose before, during, and after exercise, how to change your&#xD;
      breakfast, lunch, dinner, and also provides members with a collection of delicious and simple&#xD;
      recipes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program also provides members with direct access to expert coaches via an online&#xD;
      community containing thousands of others living with all forms of diabetes, including type 1&#xD;
      diabetes, type 1.5 diabetes, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. In&#xD;
      addition, members get access to live biweekly Q&amp;A videoconferences in which they can interact&#xD;
      with coaches and personalize their experience. The cost of full coaching program is $399 for&#xD;
      the first 3 months, then $99 per month thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, having enrolled in the wellness program, will already, as a part of that study,&#xD;
      have agreed to have data collected at baseline and yearly thereafter, including BMI, blood&#xD;
      pressure, resting pulse, lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c, health risk assessment survey,&#xD;
      absenteeism and health claims data at baseline and yearly thereafter. If not collected within&#xD;
      60 days, a new set of data will be collected to serve as baseline for this study. This is not&#xD;
      specific for this study, but is the case for any new program activity that a participant in&#xD;
      the corporate wellness study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically for this study the health risk assessment data collection (including lab&#xD;
      analysis) will also be repeated at 12 weeks. The lab work is accomplished at any MHS lab&#xD;
      facility, according to current medical system standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant health claims data will also be evaluated, beginning with the prior year's data,&#xD;
      if available from MHS Human Resources, being utilized as a baseline, and followed for the&#xD;
      subsequent years of the study.&#xD;
