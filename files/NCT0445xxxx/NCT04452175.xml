  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smokers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have high rates of morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      smoking-related diseases compared with the general population and current options for smoking&#xD;
      cessation in this vulnerable group are unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that most people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders continue smoking, it is&#xD;
      urgent to consider alternative and more efficient interventions to reduce or prevent their&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Switching to combustion-free technologies for nicotine delivery&#xD;
      (I.e. e-cigarettes) could be a pragmatic and much less harmful alternative to tobacco smoking&#xD;
      with the possibility of significant health gains. Emerging research is suggesting that ECs&#xD;
      may be useful for smoking cessation and relapse prevention in people with schizophrenia&#xD;
      spectrum disorders. In particular, a study conducted with JUUL e-cigarette with 5% nicotine&#xD;
      strength showed that this product had sufficient nicotine delivery and product appeal to&#xD;
      determine high success rates in heavy smokers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consideration of these preliminary findings, we hypothesized that switching smokers with a&#xD;
      schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis to JUUL e-cigarette with 5% nicotine strength could&#xD;
      result in higher success rates compared to JUUL e-cigarette with 1.7% nicotine strength.&#xD;
      Recent work indicates that nicotine PK of the JUUL e-cigarette with 5% nicotine strength (a&#xD;
      device that utilizes a nicotine salt formulation) approximates the nicotine delivery of&#xD;
      combustible cigarettes and that the 5% nicotine strength product is far more efficient in&#xD;
      delivering nicotine compared to the sister product with 1.7% nicotine strength. Both products&#xD;
      are identical in their appearance, making them suitable for a double-blind study design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, 12-months prospective trial, utilizing a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm&#xD;
      parallel, switching design to compare effectiveness, tolerability, acceptability, and pattern&#xD;
      of use between high (JUUL 5% nicotine) and low nicotine strength devices (JUUL 1.7% nicotine)&#xD;
      in adult smokers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The study will take place at 5&#xD;
      international sites: UK (London), Italy (Catania), Russia (Ufa and St. Petersburg) and&#xD;
      Ukraine (Kiev).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two devices have identical appearance and will be assigned in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
      Study products will be provided for a total of 6-months (intervention phase); the&#xD;
      intervention phase will be followed by a further 6-months observational period (follow-up&#xD;
      phase) during which no products will be dispensed to participants. Throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      phase and up to the final visit at 12-months, changes in smoking/vaping behavior and in their&#xD;
      pattern of use will be tracked under naturalistic condition and compared between study&#xD;
      groups. Any changes in symptom severity related to schizophrenia spectrum disorders within&#xD;
      and between both arms of the study will be monitored. The intervention phase of the study&#xD;
      will consist of a total of nine visits (including screening). The follow-up phase will&#xD;
      consist of three additional visits (two telephone contacts and one final face to face visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the main objectives of the study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify the proportion of continuous quitters among participants at 6-months in both&#xD;
           arms of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantify the proportion of continuous reducers among participants at 6-months in both&#xD;
           arms of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantify the proportion of continuous quitters among participants at 12-months in both&#xD;
           arms of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantify the proportion of continuous reducers among participants at 12-months in both&#xD;
           arms of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare continuous quit and reduction rates between study arms at 6- and 12-months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quantify adverse events throughout the whole duration of the interventional phase of the&#xD;
           study in both arms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Compare adverse events between study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives of the study will be to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure Subjective perceptions and experiences of the two nicotine strenghts by the&#xD;
           psychometrically validated modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire - mCEQ (at&#xD;
           6-months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare level of mCEQ between study arms (at 6-months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess pattern of products use among participants throughout the whole duration of the&#xD;
           study (both at intervention + follow-up phases) in both arms of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare pattern of product use between study arms (both at intervention + follow-up&#xD;
           phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare changes in symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia by Positive and&#xD;
           Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) within and between both arms of the study (both at 6-&#xD;
           and 12-months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compare changes in exercise tolerance by Chester Step Test within and between both arms&#xD;
           of the study (only at 6-months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Compare changes in weight/BMI within and between both arms of the study (both at 6- and&#xD;
           12-months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Quantify self-rated mental health (SRMH) throughout the whole duration of the study (by&#xD;
           means of a specifically designed APP) within and between both arms of the study (both at&#xD;
           6- and 12-months).&#xD;
