    <textblock>
      The only FDA approved treatment for acute kidney injury(AKI) for patients is Dialysis-also&#xD;
      known as renal replacement therapy(RRT). Continuous RRT(CRRT) is the preferred method in the&#xD;
      ICU. Patients receiving CRRT with AKI will be recruited to the study where blood and effluent&#xD;
      will be collect prior to CRRT initiation and Day 1,2,and 3 following. Metabolites will be&#xD;
      assessed to determine solute removal, and also to identify the time at which solute removal&#xD;
      has reached steady state. This will help determine the best duration of CRRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 30-50% of hospitalized patients admitted to the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU). Dialysis - also known as renal replacement therapy (RRT) - is the only FDA&#xD;
      approved treatment for AKI and continuous RRT (CRRT) is generally the preferred method of RRT&#xD;
      in the ICU. The in-hospital mortality of patients with AKI requiring dialysis in the ICU is&#xD;
      over 50% which is much greater than other serious illnesses.Unfortunately, the quality of&#xD;
      care delivered to patients with AKI receiving CRRT is poor due to practice variability and&#xD;
      lack of quality indicators to assess CRRT performance. Since one of the fundamental purposes&#xD;
      of CRRT is to remove the build-up of metabolites that accumulate during AKI, accurate methods&#xD;
      to assess solute clearance would be especially valuable. Indeed, development of methods to&#xD;
      assess solute clearance during CRRT has been identified as a research priority. Although&#xD;
      changes in plasma creatinine has been suggested as a potential quality indicator of solute&#xD;
      removal during CRRT, no study has assessed how reductions of plasma creatinine over time&#xD;
      compare to the reductions of other plasma metabolites. Thus, the duration of CRRT necessary&#xD;
      to achieve adequate solute removal is unknown - in fact, there is not yet even an agreed-upon&#xD;
      working definition of what adequate solute removal during CRRT should be. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a prospective, single center study of 112 CRRT patients to determine the&#xD;
      effect of CRRT duration on solute removal in order to identify the time at which solute&#xD;
      removal has reached steady state. To assess solute removal, 102 metabolites will be&#xD;
      determined in the plasma and effluent via untargeted ultra high pressure liquid&#xD;
      chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Metabolites will be assessed on&#xD;
      plasma collected immediately prior to CRRT initiation, and on plasma and effluent collected&#xD;
      on days 1, 2, and 3 post-CRRT initiation. Steady state is defined as the time point at which&#xD;
      a plasma metabolite is not significantly reduced during CRRT - as assessed over a 24 hour&#xD;
      time period. Based on preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that &gt;90% of&#xD;
      metabolites will reach steady state by day 2 of CRRT, and that &gt;95% of metabolites will reach&#xD;
      steady state by day 3 of CRRT.&#xD;
