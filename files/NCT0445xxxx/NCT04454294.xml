    <textblock>
      In this study, it was aimed to determine the effect of the use of milking and sucking methods&#xD;
      on bleeding amount, vital signs and oxygen saturation in children with chest and mediastinal&#xD;
      drains after cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient admitted to the post-operative Cardiovascular Surgery Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      primarily meets two nurses and is responsible for the arrangement of medical equipment,&#xD;
      monitoring, monitoring, maintaining, recording, and performing the necessary treatments. Then&#xD;
      the nurse positions the drain after checking the drain connections, checks the level of the&#xD;
      drain and records it in the nurse follow-up note. Then, the method to be used in maintaining&#xD;
      the drain opening is decided in cooperation with the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different methods are currently used in the unit. The first method; There is no&#xD;
      application in maintaining the drain opening, but if there are necessary medical indications&#xD;
      such as clot formation, blood accumulation in the drainage connections, lack of drainage,&#xD;
      this group is intervened by milking method. In our study, this group will be taken as a&#xD;
      control group, there will be a situation that requires intervention in the first 6 hours, and&#xD;
      if the milking method is used, it will be excluded from the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second method used to maintain the drain opening is the suction method. In this study,&#xD;
      this group will be taken as the first experimental group. The suction method is a continuous&#xD;
      use until the patient's drainage requirement and the physician's request is terminated by&#xD;
      ensuring that the pressure is between 5 and 15 kPa (kilopascals) or 10-20 cm H20 after the&#xD;
      appropriate negative pressure tracking system of the patient, who is accepted with intensive&#xD;
      care under water drainage system, is established. system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third method is milking. In our study, this group will be taken as the 2nd experimental&#xD;
      group. In the milking method, the process starts from the area close to the drain entry&#xD;
      point. The latex tube is folded into 12 cm long pieces and gripped with two hands. The nurse&#xD;
      repeats the process 3 times by compressing the parts gripped by the hand. This process is&#xD;
      then used at intervals every hour to repeat the distal part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the applications related to the method to be used are performed, the patient's vital&#xD;
      signs, Sp02 and bleeding amount are generally monitored every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the data for each group will be collected before and after the procedure for 6&#xD;
      hours after surgery, from the moment the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit.&#xD;

Informed consent forms will be signed by those who wish to take part in the research.&#xD;
The form in which individual characteristics are questioned will be filled.&#xD;
Hands will be washed, gloves will be worn.&#xD;
Before the procedure, body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and bleeding amount will be recorded.&#xD;
Drains will be kept parallel to the ground and upright.&#xD;
Drainage hoses will not be bent and in-bed position will be provided in accordance with gravity.&#xD;
It will be ensured that all connections between the chest tubes and drainage unit are tight and secure.&#xD;
Dressings of the chest and mediastinum drains will be fixed on the patient's skin, so as not to interfere with drainage.&#xD;
To prevent the tubes from coming out, they will be fixed to the patient bed.&#xD;
Vital signs, Sp02 and bleeding amount will be recorded every hour for 6 hours after surgery</description>

    <description>Common process steps&#xD;
Appropriate negative pressure monitoring system of the patient, who is admitted to the intensive care unit with underwater drainage system, will be established.&#xD;
The suction control room combined with the vacuum regulator will be filled with sterile distilled water up to the specified level (20 cm H2O).&#xD;
From the vacuum regulator, the drain or drains will be connected tightly and by preventing the crimping, from the aspirator receptor hoses.&#xD;
Suction will begin with a low level and gradually increase the suction until a slight bubble is noticed in the suction control room.&#xD;
Suction pressure will be maintained between 5 and 15 kPa (kilopascals) or 10-20 cm H20.&#xD;
The application will continue without interruption until the patient's drain need and the doctor's request is ended.&#xD;
During the application, the patient's vital signs, Sp02 and bleeding amount will be recorded every hour without using an additional manipulation method.</description>
