  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different protocols aimed at achieving haemostasis&#xD;
      (i.e. stop the bleeding) in patients undergoing heart procedures with access through the&#xD;
      wrist. Specifically, a haemostatic dressing that aids clotting at the level of the skin will&#xD;
      be used and compared with a normal absorbent dressing. Also, a shorter time of compression&#xD;
      required to stop the bleeding at the access site will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radial access for percutaneous cardiac procedures is the preferred method used by most&#xD;
      interventional cardiologists. This method has proven to have the least complications and a&#xD;
      much quicker patient's recovery time, compared to other access sites (e.g. femoral or&#xD;
      brachial). Following sheath removal, a dressing is applied on the skin at the access site.&#xD;
      Dressing currently in use include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional absorbent - an absorbent sterile adhesive dressing. This is our current,&#xD;
           standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Haemostatic - a sterile mineral-based absorbent dressing that aids clotting. It is not&#xD;
           currently used at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital (LHCH), but it is a licenced&#xD;
           product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radial compression device is placed over the dressing, and it applies the appropriate&#xD;
      amount of mechanical pressure to guarantee patent haemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients who are undergoing a cardiac procedure with intended radial&#xD;
      access, as part of their standard care. The aim of this study to look at new techniques to&#xD;
      reduce the time to successful and complete haemostasis. This may help to expedite patient&#xD;
      discharge (avoiding unplanned overnight stay), to reduce nursing times and to decrease the&#xD;
      rate of post-procedural, access site-related bleeding and ischemic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the cardiac procedure, participants will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one&#xD;
      of the following 3 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - conventional absorbent dressing and a compression device applied for 60 mins; Arm 2 -&#xD;
      conventional absorbent dressing with a compression device applied for 120 mins (the current&#xD;
      standard practice at LHCH); Arm 3 - haemostatic dressing and a compression device applied for&#xD;
      60 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a low-interventional, low-risk, pragmatic study comparing strategies that are&#xD;
      currently used in every-day clinical practice. The consent seeking process is proportionate&#xD;
      and adapted to the design of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be electronic and will be performed by medical and nursing staff as part&#xD;
      of their normal clinical practice. This will obviate the use of paper-based case record&#xD;
      forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will actively involve medical and nursing staff across the hospital, facilitating&#xD;
      multidisciplinary collaboration and integration of clinical research with everyday clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
