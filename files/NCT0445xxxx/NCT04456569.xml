  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for exploration of more definitive and cost effective non-arthroplasty treatments of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) has been demonstrated by the orthopedic and health economic research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolotherapy of neovessels associated with OA joints has been shown to be promising in&#xD;
      patients with knee OA. There is a need for level one evidence drawn from randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials to prove the safety, feasibility and efficacy of knee embolotherapy compared to&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized pilot study will assign 10 patients with mild-moderate OA to undergo&#xD;
      geniculate artery embolization plus standard of care (defined in this study as: physical&#xD;
      therapy and oral anti-inflammatory medications, with a maximum of 1 joint injection at the&#xD;
      time of enrollment) and 10 patients to receive only medical standard of care (also having had&#xD;
      a maximum of 1 joint injection prior to enrollment). The goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary estimates of safety and efficacy of embolotherapy to provide sustained&#xD;
      symptom control and modify disease progression in patients with mild to moderate knee OA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, two-arm, open label, pilot study to assess feasibility and safety&#xD;
      and obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of geniculate artery embolization in reducing&#xD;
      pain compared to a control group undergoing conservative presurgical management. The 20&#xD;
      patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 10 in 1:1 allocation. One group will&#xD;
      have embolization of the geniculate artery branches and standard of care while the other will&#xD;
      have only the standard care. Following the completion of the 10 participants in each arm, a&#xD;
      safety and data review will be undertaken (Visit 4 in the GAE group and Visit 2 of the SOC).&#xD;
      The data will be assessed regarding the trends between the groups as they relate to&#xD;
      KOOS/WOMAC pain scale, MRI / Xray evaluation of OA, and presence of inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS measures 5 patient-relevant dimensions, each scored separately:&#xD;
Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items).&#xD;
Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems). Dimension scores are calculated as the mean score of the included items divided by 4 and multiplied by 100. Range of subscale scores is 0-100 with higher scores indicating better function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Items are rated on a Likert scale of 0 (extreme) to 4 (none). Raw sub-scale scores are normalized to produce percentage scores in accordance with the KOOS by multiplying each score by 100/96. Total scores are a sum of the normalized sub-scales scores and range 0-100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>
