      This study aims to explore how the use of inhaled essential oils impacts the experience of a&#xD;
      laboring and postoperative surgical patient. It is expected that the aromatherapy&#xD;
      intervention will decrease levels of nausea, anxiety, and improve the perception of being&#xD;
      cared for in laboring mothers and patients recovering from surgery. By learning more about&#xD;
      aromatherapy, the investigators may be able to expand the aromatherapy intervention to more&#xD;
      patients in other Massachusetts General Hospital departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 laboring patients will be recruited on admission to the labor and delivery inpatient unit.&#xD;
      They will be invited to participate in this study by nurses caring for them.&#xD;

      Aromatherapy is a complementary integrative intervention that can be incorporated into&#xD;
      nursing care to optimize health. It is defined as the use of essential oils, obtained from&#xD;
      aromatic plants, for therapeutic properties. Most State Boards of Nursing recognize clinical&#xD;
      aromatherapy as part of holistic nursing. There are benefits of using aromatherapy for&#xD;
      nausea, comfort, wellbeing, perception of care and anxiety which are common symptoms&#xD;
      associated with hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients often report a myriad of symptoms and increasingly ask for alternative&#xD;
      ways to manage them. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative&#xD;
      Health (NCCIH), a national survey in the United States. Four national surveys report that a&#xD;
      third or more of US adults routinely use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)&#xD;
      therapies (e.g. chiropractic, massage, yoga, supplements, acupuncture) to treat their&#xD;
      principal medical conditions with total expenditures exceeding $34 billion in 2007. A global&#xD;
      shift in healthcare is moving toward wider acceptance of a philosophical value-guided health&#xD;
      approach that includes a whole-person/whole-system caring healing health perspective .&#xD;
      Complementary therapies have become more widely known and used in western healthcare. The&#xD;
      human consciousness shift toward wellness is allowing models and possibilities of inner&#xD;
      healing and emotional and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite widespread use and acceptance of complementary therapies in community settings, there&#xD;
      is some resistance to implementing such strategies in the acute care setting. There are no&#xD;
      reports of randomized clinical trials supporting such interventions in acute care settings.&#xD;
      Some evidence exists to support some complementary and integrative interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One intervention that is cost effective and non-invasive is aromatherapy. While research&#xD;
      indicates that the use of aromatherapy has been effective in managing nausea, anxiety, and&#xD;
      discomfort, there are limited rigorous studies supporting its use in the acute care setting.&#xD;
      More work is needed to understand if aromatherapy is a feasible intervention to implement in&#xD;
      the acute care setting. Further research is needed to explore which essential oils are most&#xD;
      effective for symptom management in patients in the acute care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients that commonly report anxiety, discomfort and nausea are postoperative&#xD;
      surgical patients and laboring obstetric patients. This study will explore the use of&#xD;
      aromatherapy as an intervention used by nurses to assist laboring obstetric patients and&#xD;
      postoperative elective surgical patients manage symptoms of nausea, anxiety, and discomfort.&#xD;
      Aromatherapy will serve as an adjunct and not as a replacement for standard routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many women, having a baby provides their first experience as a patient in a hospital&#xD;
      setting. Many women are hesitant to utilize pharmacological methods to decrease pain,&#xD;
      anxiety, and nausea associated with their labor experience due to fear of harming their baby.&#xD;
      As such, women increasingly turn to complementary therapies such as aromatherapy as a means&#xD;
      of retaining control over their childbirth experience. Odor has a direct pathway to the&#xD;
      limbic part of the brain, in particular to the amygdala that governs fear. Familiar smells&#xD;
      such as lavender may be calming and soothing at stressful times such as during childbirth.&#xD;
      Surgery is another stressful time for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the limited research on aromatherapy is two decades old. A British evaluative study&#xD;
      of 8,058 mothers delivering in a large teaching hospital between 1990 and 1998 indicated that&#xD;
      lavender aromatherapy relieved feelings of anxiety and fear (61%), pain (6%), improved&#xD;
      contractions (6%), reduced feelings of nausea and vomiting (14%) and improved general&#xD;
      well-being (7%). Lavender, frankincense and rose were found to relieve anxiety in labor.&#xD;
      There is some evidence that aromatherapy has been successfully used by midwives to reduce the&#xD;
      level of anxiety during the antepartum period. In a clinical randomized trial of 100 women in&#xD;
      labor, the level of anxiety of women in both the intervention (P=0.03) and control (P=0.003)&#xD;
      groups after the intervention was reduced after the intervention. Findings from these studies&#xD;
      also indicate that there were minimal to no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) continue to be a major cause of patient&#xD;
      dissatisfaction affecting hospitalized patients. Although conventional approaches can be very&#xD;
      effective in managing PONV, some patients are intolerant of drug side effects or decline use&#xD;
      the medications. There is some evidence that inhalation of lavender, ginger, peppermint and&#xD;
      other oils are alternative techniques that have been used successfully with postoperative&#xD;
      patients in helping to manage discomfort and nausea. It is suggested that aromatherapy can be&#xD;
      tried before conventional techniques in managing nausea and vomiting and used alongside it in&#xD;
      a complementary manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This quasi experimental mixed method study will utilize a convenience sample and a pre- and&#xD;
      post-study design study to determine the feasibility of implementing an aromatherapy&#xD;
      intervention on two acute care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes for this study include anxiety, nausea, perception of caring and well-being.&#xD;
      In addition, an open-ended qualitative inquiry will be used to further explore the experience&#xD;
      including potential positive and negative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on two acute care inpatient care areas: labor delivery unit with&#xD;
      healthy pregnant women and on a general adult surgical unit with persons having elective&#xD;
      surgery. Twenty patients will be recruited from the surgical unit and thirty from the&#xD;
      obstetrical unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Using inclusion/exclusion outlined criteria below, all patients meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be introduced to the aromatherapy intervention by the nurse research&#xD;
      assistant who is caring for them. Potential participants will be asked if they wish to enroll&#xD;
      in the study during their hospitalization. If they express interest, patients will be given&#xD;
      information regarding the investigation and the informed consent form to read. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI) will be notified. The nurse research assistant will answer any questions of&#xD;
      the potential participant and if the patient agrees to enroll in the study, the nurse&#xD;
      research assistant will obtain a written informed consent. Once enrolled, demographic&#xD;
      variables will be collected and the following measures will be obtained before the&#xD;
      aromatherapy intervention and immediately after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse and level of respirations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Watson Caritas Patient Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale (WEMWBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after the inhaled essential oil is administered, a different member of the study team&#xD;
      will ask the patient open-ended questions about their experience with aromatherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aromatherapy intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lavender inhaled essential oil will be used for perceived caring, wellbeing and reported&#xD;
           anxiety in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ginger essential oil will be used for patients who report nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A certified study clinician will administer the inhaled essential oil during labor or&#xD;
           during the postoperative recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on the labor and delivery inpatient unit (Blake 14) and post-operative surgical&#xD;
      inpatient unit (Ellison 7) will be offered aromatherapy as an alternative treatment for&#xD;
      nausea and anxiety in labor and during the post-operative surgical recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aromatherapy is an integrative, nonpharmacological intervention that will be explored as a&#xD;
      treatment of nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and comfort in labor and post-operative surgical&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission, the patient will be asked to list their allergies. If the patient has allergies&#xD;
      to study aromatherapy oils, then the patient will be excluded from the study. If the patient&#xD;
      appears to develop an allergic reaction or any other adverse reaction to an administered&#xD;
      essential oil, the use of aromatherapy in this patient will be discontinued immediately and&#xD;
      the patient will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on Labor &amp; Delivery and on Ellison 7 will be asked if they wish to participate&#xD;
      in this investigation. Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to provide informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
