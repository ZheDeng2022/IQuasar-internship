  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate PK,&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity between patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis receiving Humira and patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis&#xD;
      undergoing repeated switches between Humira and AVT02, followed by an optional safety&#xD;
      Extension Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVT02-GL-302 study is composed of 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LeadIn Period: Week 1-12 - OpenLabel Treatment Switching Module: Week 12-28 - DoubleBlind&#xD;
      Treatment Optional Extension Phase: Week 28-52 - OpenLabel Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lead-In Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successfully completing Screening activities, patients will be enrolled in the LeadIn&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the LeadIn Period, patients will receive Humira (initial dose of 80 mg [2 × 40 mg]&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously [SC], followed by 40 mg SC given every other week starting 1 week&#xD;
      after the initial dose). At Week 12, responsive patients (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index&#xD;
      [PASI] ≥ 75 [PASI75]) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either of the following&#xD;
      groups for participation in the Double-Blind Switching Module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Switching Module:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: patients undergo repeated switches (Sw) of AVT02 and Humira from Week 12 until Week&#xD;
      26:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sw1-AVT02 (40 mg every other week) for 4 weeks (2 injections), Sw2-Humira (40 mg every other&#xD;
      week) for 4 weeks (2 injections), Sw3-AVT02 (40 mg every other week) for 8 weeks (4&#xD;
      injections). Group 2: patients continue to receive Humira 40 mg every other week from Week 12&#xD;
      until Week 26 (8 injections) The last study treatment administration in the Double-Blind&#xD;
      Switching Module is at Week 26. The last study assessment is at Week 28 for both groups. The&#xD;
      end-of-study (EoS) visit for the interchangeability (IC) part of study is planned at Week 28&#xD;
      (ie, 2 weeks after the last study treatment administration, EoS IC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 28, after the EoS IC visit, responsive patients (PASI ≥ 50 [PASI50]) will be offered&#xD;
      to continue with the optional open-label Extension Phase (Weeks 28 to 52). AVT02 40 mg will&#xD;
      be administered every other week starting from Week 28 (after completing EoS IC assessments),&#xD;
      ending with the final study drug administration at Week 50. The EoS visit is planned for Week&#xD;
      52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study report (CSR) for the IC part of the study will include the data from the&#xD;
      OpenLabel Lead-In Period and Double-Blind Switching Module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extension Phase CSR will include the data from the additional 24-week Open-Label&#xD;
      Extension Phase (Weeks 28 to 52).&#xD;
