      Sub-project 1 Background:With the increasing number of shift workers required for social and&#xD;
      economic activities, increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases has been found in this group&#xD;
      of people. Although reasons for this include reduced physical activity owing to unfixed&#xD;
      working hours, lack of sleep or disturbances in the circadian rhythm may also be related to&#xD;
      the occurrences of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The mechanism may be due to sleep&#xD;
      deprivation induced activation of the hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal axis (HPA axis) that&#xD;
      affects blood glucose metabolism. The gut brain axis might adjust the HPA axis via the&#xD;
      bottom-up pathway through vagus nerve, the neuroendocrine system, or the immune system. It is&#xD;
      also possible that physiological or psychological stressors might influence intestinal&#xD;
      function through the top-down pathways. Associations between microbiota and many chronic&#xD;
      diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, or&#xD;
      mental diseases have been investigated in recent years. However, the application of using&#xD;
      probiotics in treating sleep disorders is still lacking. The main research hypothesis: Is it&#xD;
      possible to develop the relevant probiotic treatment model?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-project 2 Information technology (IT) is an industry related to productions of computers,&#xD;
      information processing, or telecommunications. Such industry highly relies on the knowledge&#xD;
      and solutions provided by professional IT specialists. Literature has described that the&#xD;
      subjective stress scores were higher in IT specialists that developed diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      and depression. Specific probiotics, also known as psychobiotics, may have the effects of&#xD;
      alleviating levels of stress and mood symptoms. Therefore this open-label designed, single&#xD;
      arm, baseline-controlled trial aiming to examine whether an 8-week intervention of a novel&#xD;
      psychobiotic Lactobacillus plantarum PS128TM (PS128TM), may improve self-perceived stress and&#xD;
      mood symptoms among high-stress IT specialists.&#xD;

      Sub-project 1 Materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Probiotics The probiotics used in this proposal are selected to be more related to mental&#xD;
      conditions. The PS128, which belongs to Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum.&#xD;
      Administration of probiotics for 4 weeks in animal experiments showed significant&#xD;
      improvements in depression and anxiety behaviors, and increased mobility in mice (Liu et al.,&#xD;
      2016). The concentration of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, which was reduced due to&#xD;
      depression, was also restored by feeding PS128 (Liu et al., 2016). PS23 belongs to&#xD;
      Lactobacillus paracasei group. In animal experiments, both live and heat-treated bacteria&#xD;
      have the effect of improving depression and anxiety behaviors. The strains used in this study&#xD;
      are food usable bacteria listed on the front of the Food and Drug Administration in Taiwan.&#xD;
      The products have been sold in Taiwan in 2015 and there have been no serious adverse&#xD;
      reactions. Relevant clinical studies have been reviewed by Institutional Review Boards in&#xD;
      multiple hospitals (including the National Taiwan University Children's Hospital, Kaohsiung&#xD;
      Kai-Syuan Psychiatric Hospital, Wanfang Hospital, Antai Hospital, and National Yangming&#xD;
      University). These probiotics and placebo will be provided by the Yifu Biomedical Company&#xD;
      Ltd. The probiotic powder contains no lactose and can be eaten by people with lactose&#xD;
      intolerance. The placebo capsule contains microcrystalline cellulose. Both PS128 and PS23&#xD;
      probiotic capsules contain 10 billion CFU (colony forming units) of PS128 or PS23. The PS23&#xD;
      heat-treated probiotic capsule contain 10 billion PS23 cells. These products should be stored&#xD;
      in the refrigerator and be protected from light. The probiotics and placebo used in the study&#xD;
      are all edible fungi or food supplements approved by the Food and Drug Administration. There&#xD;
      are no data on serious potential risks or side effects. Only a few gastric discomfort such as&#xD;
      bloating or diarrhea have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of adverse events and adverse reactions includes soft stools, flatulence, or&#xD;
      diarrhea will be used for safety and tolerability assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 2 assessments and blood draws (week 0 and 8+1 weeks) will be required during the&#xD;
      study period. Subjects will be invited to participate in the study (V0) and a questionnaire&#xD;
      will be assessed. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be assessed for baseline (V1),&#xD;
      and the app for working hours recording and Rhythm (mobile phone schedule) must be installed&#xD;
      to participants' mobile phones to record the working hours in the hospital. The once daily&#xD;
      test capsules will be consumed the next day after the evaluation for 8 weeks until week 8 +1&#xD;
      (V2). At V2, a second assessment will be performed. The time of the second assessment needs&#xD;
      to be the same as the first assessment. For example, the first assessment is for the day&#xD;
      shift, and the second assessment must be for the day shift. The number of days consumed by&#xD;
      each subject may be inconsistent, at least 28 days, and up to 35 days. Subjects are required&#xD;
      to provide a working schedule for the study period for the second assessment to allow the&#xD;
      investigator to match the assessment results for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigators will enroll 240 nursing, psychologists and social workers who are working&#xD;
           in the chronic and acute wards to participate. Participants will be evaluated in overall&#xD;
           physical and mental health, sleep disturbances. 60 electronic employees will also be&#xD;
           enrolled, participants will be evaluated in overall physical and mental health, sleep&#xD;
           disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood TAC, Cortisol and DHEAS will be examined before and after administration of&#xD;
           probiotics and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects will need to complete several self-test scales, including the Questionnaire&#xD;
           (PHQ-9), State-trait Active Inventory (form YA), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Buss&#xD;
           Perry Offensive Scale, Quality of Life and Satisfaction Survey, 10 cm Visual Analogue&#xD;
           Scale for Gastrointestinal Symptom and stress, Profile of Mood States (POMS) and&#xD;
           Computerized Selective Attention Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In this study, double blind design will be adopted for subproject one and open label&#xD;
           design will be adopted for subproject two. After consenting, participants will complete&#xD;
           the above baseline assessment. All participants will then be randomly assigned to&#xD;
           probiotic or placebo groups according to a computer-generated random number table. These&#xD;
           two groups will be administered with probiotics or placebo for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the sub-project 2, all the participants will complete the baseline assessment and&#xD;
      administered with probiotics for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Considerations Data will be entered and error-checked by the Project Coordinator&#xD;
           on IBM-compatible/Macintosh computers present both in the Psychological &amp; Behavioral&#xD;
           Science Research Laboratory in Mackay Memorial Hospital. The process of data entry,&#xD;
           including preparation of data harvesting forms, database fields, data entry, and&#xD;
           checking by editors will be supervised by the staff of the Psychological &amp; Behavioral&#xD;
           Science Research Laboratory, with extensive experience in both clinical trials and&#xD;
           longitudinal studies with large data sets. Once the data set is entered and checked,&#xD;
           analyses will be conducted using SPSS software. An &quot;intent to treat&quot; analysis examining&#xD;
           all patients randomized to the trial will be performed to preserve the effect of&#xD;
           randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Power determination for the test of null hypothesis The power analysis will be conducted&#xD;
           using the effect size from previous publications and the relevant studies of probiotics&#xD;
           intervention. A minimally significant difference in PSS or ISI changes between&#xD;
           treatments would be defined as a reduction of 20% or more in the score levels. Based on&#xD;
           a power of 80% and assuming a 30% dropout rate and an alpha level of 0.05, a sample of&#xD;
           500 participants (120 per group) will be required. All results will be analyzed using an&#xD;
           intent-to-treat analysisbased on treatment assignment, whether they complete treatment&#xD;
           or not. It will also conduct a per-protocol analysis based on 'treated' participants,&#xD;
           defined as those who received treatment and completed assessments at 0 and 8+1 weeks&#xD;
           after allocation. To test the adequacy of randomization, it will conduct between group&#xD;
           comparisons of baseline characteristics on all measures, using t tests for continuous&#xD;
           variables and chi-square tests for dichotomous variables. Two tailed P-values&lt;0.05 is&#xD;
           considered significant. All analyses will be performed with SPSS version 12.0. To define&#xD;
           better the link between changes in questionnaires and treatment response, changes in&#xD;
           assessment scores will be assessed within the following categories according to&#xD;
           treatment response as stated in previous literature: for PSS, ISI, STAI: 0% improvement;&#xD;
           &gt;0 to &lt;=10% improvement; &gt;10 to &lt;=20% improvement and &gt;20% improvement. Finally, to&#xD;
           ensure that the observed effect will not better explained by changes in medication&#xD;
           during follow-up or by antidepressant treatment, these two variables (changes in&#xD;
           medication yes/no and taking antidepressant yes/no) will also be added into the models&#xD;
           as covariates. The results of regression models will be presented as standardized&#xD;
           regression coefficients (b) with 95% confidence intervals that can be interpreted as&#xD;
           effect size. The threshold of significance was P=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be possible to improve the stress, sleep or gastrointestinal symptoms of high-pressure&#xD;
      nurses by supplementing probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the participating researchers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating assessors will be able to master the interview skills after the intensive&#xD;
      interviewer training, in particular, familiar with semi-structured psychiatric interview and&#xD;
      a package of self-report questionnaires. The laboratory researcher will be able to master the&#xD;
      laboratory skills of performing epigenetic analysis, which can also be helpful in extending&#xD;
      his research experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific expectations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will fill the research gap of shift work, metabolism, and probiotics in generally&#xD;
      healthy high stress nursing staff. The results will provide empirical evidence for Asian&#xD;
      scientists where there is still a lack of studies linked to changes before and after&#xD;
      protiotics intervention. The knowledge for probiotics towards health promotion is expected to&#xD;
      be increase and hope to lead to more personalized stratification for disease-risk models and&#xD;
      for targeting effective interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-project 2 Materials: Probiotics The probiotics used in this proposal are selected to be&#xD;
      more related to mental conditions. The PS128, which belongs to Lactobacillus plantarum subsp.&#xD;
      plantarum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IT specialists from a large IT company in Northern Taiwan were invited and first screened by&#xD;
      the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) 10 items version. Participants with a PSS-10 items score of&#xD;
      27 or higher were included in our study. Those currently under antibiotic or psychotropic&#xD;
      treatments, have cancer, or other chronic physical or mental diseases were excluded. Two&#xD;
      capsule that contained 300 mg of PS128TM powder, equivalent to 10 billion colony forming&#xD;
      units, were suggested to be taken daily by the included participants. Other self-report&#xD;
      measures included the Job Stress Scale, Visual Analogue Scale of Stress, the Insomnia&#xD;
      Severity Index, the State and Trait Anxiety Index, The Questionnaire for Emotional Trait and&#xD;
      State, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire, and the Gastrointestinal Severity Index. Objective measures included Saliva&#xD;
      levels of stress biomarkers include cortisol, α-amylase, Immunoglobulin A (IgA), lactoferrin,&#xD;
      and lysozymes, and Tests on Attentional Performance.&#xD;
