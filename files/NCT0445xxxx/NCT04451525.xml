      To collect real-world evidence allowing assessment of functional, imaging, and safety&#xD;
      outcomes of the SOFIA® Flow Plus 6F Aspiration Catheter when used with the direct aspiration&#xD;
      as first line treatment technique at the direction of the treating physician for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, observational, Real World Evidence (RWE)&#xD;
      post-market study. The primary objective of the SOFAST study is to determine the proportion&#xD;
      of subjects achieving successful revascularization (mTICI ≥ 2b) with the SOFIA® Flow Plus 6F&#xD;
      Aspiration Catheter when used in conjunction with the direct aspiration as first line&#xD;
      treatment technique for patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation based&#xD;
      on collection of real-world evidence data.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is ≥ 21 and ≤ 85 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a pre-morbid mRS ≤ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuroimaging (CT/CTA and/or MR/MRA collected at no more than 90 minutes prior to groin&#xD;
             puncture) demonstrates large vessel proximal occlusion (distal ICA through MCA&#xD;
             bifurcation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an NIHSS score ≥ 5 at time of intervention.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has vascular anatomy/tortuosity or other vascular disease preventing access to&#xD;
             the target occlusion or that will likely result in unstable access.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;

             geographical limitations, or a life expectancy of less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is enrolled in another device or drug study in which participation could&#xD;

          -  Imaging (CT or MR) exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presence of intracerebral hemorrhage as evidenced on initial imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Ischemic changes in the posterior circulation territories (including the&#xD;
                  vertebrobasilar and posterior cerebral arteries)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Significant mass effect with midline shift&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Evidence of intracranial tumor&#xD;
