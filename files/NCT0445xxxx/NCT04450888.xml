      Effects of Message framing and Time discounting on heath communication for Optimum&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease and Stroke Prevention（EMT-OCSP）is a pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, observer blinded, multicenter trial with four parallel groups. It&#xD;
      aims to determine if risk and intervention communication strategy（gain-framed versus&#xD;
      loss-frame, long-term context versus short-term context and the potential interaction）have&#xD;
      different effect on optimizing adherence to clinical preventive management （in the endpoint&#xD;
      of CVD risk reduction）for subjects with at least one moldable risk factor for CVD.&#xD;

      Scientific title Effects of Message framing and Time discounting on health communication for&#xD;
      Optimum Cardiovascular disease and Stroke Prevention(EMT-OCSP): a pragmatic randomised&#xD;
      controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator Li He&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period 2020-07-01-2022-01-21&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses and aims When communicating cardiovascular disease（CVD）risk to individuals,&#xD;
      different presentation of information carries its own connotations and biases. The one or the&#xD;
      other pattern of the presentation may affect individuals' decision making.This study aims to&#xD;
      determine if risk and intervention communication strategy（gain-framed versus loss-frame,&#xD;
      long-term context versus short-term context and the potential interaction）have different&#xD;
      effect on optimizing adherence to clinical preventive management （in the endpoint of CVD risk&#xD;
      reduction）for subjects with at least one moldable risk factor for CVD. We aim to provide&#xD;
      evidence for practitioners regarding messaging strategies that improve communication&#xD;
      effectiveness and further reduce the risk of CVD events in the population, as well as to&#xD;
      develop more effective communication strategies for groups of people with different&#xD;
      characteristics to maximise patient adherence to lifestyle modifications and medical&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Ten-year CVD risk, lifetime CVD risk and CVD-free life expectancy after 1&#xD;
      year according to the LIFE-CVD model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes CVD risk factors [blood pressure(BP) and serum cholesterol, low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL), non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides and fasting glucose&#xD;
      levels],lifestyle factors (physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use and eating habits),&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments for hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes, and anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      drug prescriptions after 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The EMT-OCSP trial is designed as a pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, observer blinded, multicenter trial with four parallel groups. Randomization will&#xD;
      be performed as block randomization with a 1:1:1:1 allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and sample size Subjects with at least one moldable risk factor for CVD. The&#xD;
      sample size calculations revealed that the enrolment of 15,000 participants would be&#xD;
      sufficient, allowing for a 20% drop-out rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period One year&#xD;
