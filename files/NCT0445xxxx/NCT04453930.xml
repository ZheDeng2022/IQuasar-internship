  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open label, single center, prospective study was designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Sequential Therapy of Camrelizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      against Programmed death 1 [PD-1] ) in combination with Chemotherapy（Irinotecan plus&#xD;
      Platinum）and with Apatinib (selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2)&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]) in chemotherapy-naive participants with SCLC. Participants&#xD;
      will receive Camrelizumab + Irinotecan + Platinum on 21-day cycles for 4-6 cycles in the&#xD;
      induction phase followed by maintenance with Camrelizumab + Apatinib until progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Treatment can be continued until persistent radiographic PD&#xD;
      or symptomatic deterioration.&#xD;
