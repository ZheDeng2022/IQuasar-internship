  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting for colonoscopy at one of the participating centers will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the present study after careful evaluation of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Before inclusion, all patients have to sign the written informed consent. All&#xD;
      participating patients will receive PLENVU, a well-known and approved bowel preparation&#xD;
      agent. Patients are randomly assigned in two groups. Patients in group 1 are informed in&#xD;
      traditional way on how to use the bowel preparation agent. This way includes discussion with&#xD;
      the physician and nurse on how to use the bowel preparation agent and a written&#xD;
      documentation, highlighting the individual steps again. Patients in group 2 will receive in&#xD;
      addition a QR-code referring to an App, available for free in all App stores, explaining to&#xD;
      the patient in detail when and how to use the bowel preparation agent. The patient is&#xD;
      receiving the same questionnaire (please see attached) in both groups and asked to bring the&#xD;
      filled form on the day of the examination. Endoscopy is performed in standard way and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the bowel preparation is specifically highlighted by the physician on the&#xD;
      documentation report. Finally, data is analyzed regarding effectiveness of the QR code&#xD;
      regarding patient satisfaction, acceptability and quality of the bowel preparation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient education is of paramount importance for high acceptance and an adequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation. Using the QR code directly referring to the App for bowel preparation with&#xD;
      PLENVU might accelerate the discussion between the medical doctor and the patient and might&#xD;
      also improve the acceptance rate of the patients for the bowel preparation finally leading to&#xD;
      a more enhanced and effective bowel-preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing screening or surveillance endoscopy will be prospectively included and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Group 1: App; Group 2: no-App Study end&#xD;
      points addressed below are prospectively assessed and evaluated for any significant changes.&#xD;
