      This prospective observational study aims to investigate the effects of midazolam sedation on&#xD;
      the diagnostic validity of lumbar medial branch blocks in patients diagnosed with lumbar&#xD;
      spondylosis without myelopathy. Patients typically receive two subsequent diagnostic blocks&#xD;
      prior RFTC, to ensure that the correct location has been targeted. When patients achieve at&#xD;
      least 80% pain relief after both diagnostic blocks, this is considered a positive result and&#xD;
      they can proceed to receive RFTC. If patients have positive diagnostic blocks but their RFTC&#xD;
      is not successful, this is considered a false positive diagnostic result. This study will&#xD;
      determine 1) if a higher number of sedated patients proceed to radiofrequency&#xD;
      thermocoagulation (RFTC) than non-sedated patients, and 2) if there are a higher number of&#xD;
      false positive results in sedated patients. The hypothesis is that the use of midazolam&#xD;
      sedation will increase the number of patients who perceive to have pain relief from their&#xD;
      diagnostic block results, resulting in more patients proceeding to RFTC, and that there will&#xD;
      be a higher number of false positive results in sedated patients. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is the number of sedated versus non-sedated patients that have positive block results. A&#xD;
      positive result will be calculated by having at least one NRS score that is at least 80%&#xD;
      lower than their baseline NRS score in the 8 hours following lumbar MBB. The secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be the number of false positive blocks in sedated versus non-sedated patients.&#xD;
      After patients achieve 80% relief after each of the two diagnostic lumbar medial branch&#xD;
      blocks and proceeds with lumbar RFTC, we will then collect NRS scores 24 hours after both&#xD;
      diagnostic Lumbar MBB, and 4 weeks and at 8 weeks after the lumbar RFTC. If a patient has not&#xD;
      received at least 50% reduction from their baseline NRS score by 8 weeks, this will be&#xD;
      considered a false positive. A 7-point Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score 8&#xD;
      hours after each Lumbar MBB will also be collected, and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the&#xD;
      lumbar RFTC, and any adverse effects patients experience. In addition, Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Index (ODI) will be collected at 4 and 8 weeks after lumbar RFTC. The results of this study&#xD;
      will help guide the use of sedation when performing diagnostic blocks on patients with lumbar&#xD;
      spondylosis, in order to reduce the number of false positive blocks.&#xD;
