  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to assess the impact of implementing a hemodynamic optimization&#xD;
      protocol, utilizing flow guided parameters that is provided by technology from Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences, for patients undergoing high risk cardiac surgery. Importantly, this project is&#xD;
      being targeted as a QI initiative because there is no evaluation of new technology or&#xD;
      procedures. All technologies and procedures are currently being used for patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. Rather this project is evaluating the implementation of a multi-dispclinary&#xD;
      developed protocol that seeks to remove variability in which providers are currently treating&#xD;
      patients hemodynamics during and acutely after cardiac surgery. Previous research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that implementation of hemodynamic management protocols improves perioperative&#xD;
      outcome in surgical patients. This project seeks to evaluate the impact of implementing this&#xD;
      protocol as the new clinical standard for high-risk cardiac surgery patients. Specifically,&#xD;
      this protocol would be a comprehensive hemodynamic management strategy that would-be&#xD;
      initiated in the operating room post-bypass and then continued for the first 12 hours in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (see figure below). To restate, all technologies and procedures are&#xD;
      currently being performed for these patients, however, there has not been a protocol guiding&#xD;
      how practionioners use this technology. The project is evaluating the impact of protocolized&#xD;
      treatment strategies. Importantly this protocol has been designed, reviewed and agreed by the&#xD;
      motivation of the physicians who are currently responsible for managing these patients&#xD;
      hemodynamics. Since this project does involve alterations in procedures or technologies we&#xD;
      are seeking to proceed as a quality improvement project. Additionally the protocol is one&#xD;
      that has been reviewed and agreed to provide the optimal management strategy for these&#xD;
      patients. This again is the overall focus of this project, to implement a hemodynamic&#xD;
      management protocol to improve outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;

        All adult high risk cardiac surgical patients undergoing procedures requiring&#xD;
        cardiopulmonary bypass. High risk was defined, a priori, as patients who are expected to&#xD;
        require an inotropic and/or vasoconstrictive agent for more than 12 hours post-CPB.&#xD;
