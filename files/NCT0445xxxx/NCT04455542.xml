  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that affects upper&#xD;
      and lower motor neurons. In animal model studies have shown that peripheral nerve&#xD;
      degeneration in ALS motor function decline, tip peripheral nerve degeneration is of great&#xD;
      significance for early progress of ALS may be, at the same time analysis showed that the&#xD;
      motor neuron involvement severity and the prognosis of patients with ALS show obvious&#xD;
      negative correlation, so finding biomarkers can reflect the motor neuron axonal degeneration&#xD;
      is of great significance. Neurofilaments is an intermediate fiber specifically expressed in&#xD;
      central and peripheral neurons and can serve as a biomarker for axonal injury, but there is&#xD;
      no evidence now that peripheral neurofilament levels have been associated with severity of&#xD;
      motor axonal involvement in ALS.&#xD;
