      JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary incontinence is highly prevalent among women who play high impact sports such as&#xD;
      running. that observed one of the possible reasons for this high prevalence is delayed&#xD;
      activation of the pelvic floor in relation to the abdominal muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of minimalist shoes during the race produces changes in muscle and joint biomechanics&#xD;
      and efficiency in the race. However, to date no studies evaluating the influence of footwear&#xD;
      in the musculature of the pelvic floor during the race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: Describe and compare the electromyographic activity of the muscles of the pelvic&#xD;
      floor and abdominal during the race with conventional shoes and minimalist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: cross-over study experimental, analytical and prospective. METHODOLOGY: conventional&#xD;
      and minimalist: 10 healthy young women, randomized into two groups to characterize the&#xD;
      electromyographic activity of the muscles of the pelvic floor prior and during the race at 9&#xD;
      km / h with the two types of slippers are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      an initial assessment in which it is confirmed that women meet the criteria for inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion will be made. the ability to run will be assessed a 10-minute treadmill at a speed&#xD;
      of 9-13 km / h as well as the ability to properly contract the muscles of the pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group will race with conventional shoes and then minimal, while the second group&#xD;
      will make the race with minimalist and after conventional shoes. Both groups have a washout&#xD;
      period of 10 minutes between both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG recording are collect with electromyographic sensors musculature of the pelvic floor (by&#xD;
      intravaginal probe germproof brand), abdominal (intern and oblique external oblique), erector&#xD;
      spinae and gluteal (by surface sensor) in relation to the cycle gear, barographic recorded&#xD;
      with sensors. The variables to be included in the electromyography for each muscle regarding&#xD;
      the gait cycle will be, activation start, duration, intensity and synergy with its&#xD;
      corresponding standard deviation.&#xD;
