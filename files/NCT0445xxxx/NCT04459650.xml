      Participants who enroll in this study will undergo the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) study&#xD;
      treatment. Participants will have a sample of blood collected and the platelets will be&#xD;
      separated and then injected into half of the participants' scalp every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the is the relative density in scalp hair at week 12compared to baseline (week 0) between treatment and observation sides of the scalp. The study investigator will use the 7-point GAS (-3 = greatly decreased, -2 = moderately decreased, -1 = slightly decreased, 0 = no change, +1 = slightly increased, +2 = moderately increased, and +3 = greatly increased) to evaluate relative differences in hair density.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive PRP obtained with PRP harvesting kits on one side of the scalp and no injections on the other side of the scalp (split-scalp technique). The entire half of the intended scalp will receive inter-follicular injections of PRP under aseptic conditions at the amount of 0.05-0.1 ml/cm2 in a retrograde fashion from deep to superficial, at every centimeter throughout the treated site. For study purposes, Study Day 0 is defined as the first day of injection. Subsequently the patient will continue therapy every 4 weeks for a total of 3 injections (12 weeks).</description>
