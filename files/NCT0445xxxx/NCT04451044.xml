&#xD;
          -  3. Following angiography, PCI is indicated in at least one coronary artery* on the&#xD;
             basis of one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Presenting with NSTE-ACS (unstable angina with ECG changes or cardiac&#xD;
                  enzyme-positive NSTEMI) with an identified culprit lesion with DS ≥50%;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. One or more angiographic stenoses present with ≥80% stenosis severity by visual&#xD;
                  estimation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. One or more angiographic stenoses present with ≥50% to &lt;80% stenosis severity by&#xD;
                  visual estimation and an abnormal non-invasive stress test in the distribution of&#xD;
                  the lesion(s) within the past 60 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. One or more angiographic stenoses are present with ≥50% to &lt;80% stenosis severity&#xD;
                  by visual estimation and a spot iFR measure ≤0.89 or FFR≤0.80 for borderline&#xD;
                  iFR..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4 Subject is willing to comply with all scheduled visits and tests and has provided&#xD;
             informed written consent&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  1. STEMI within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. PCI within the prior 12 months, or any PCI planned after the study procedure (other&#xD;
             than planned staged procedures of randomized vessels which are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3. Prior CABG anytime&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  4. Silent ischemia only (i.e. no cardiac symptoms related to coronary artery disease)&#xD;
             within the prior 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Documented prior iFR pullback performed in any coronary artery including during the&#xD;
             qualifying diagnostic angiogram&#xD;

          -  6. Any vessel with in-stent restenosis (ISR) requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7. Cardiogenic shock defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg for &gt;20 minutes not&#xD;
             responding to fluid resuscitation, or need for inotropic, pressor, or device-based&#xD;
             hemodynamic support&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  8. Presence of unstable ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  11. Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of a target vessel (exception: a CTO may be present&#xD;
             in a non-target vessel if it is supplying non-viable myocardium and there is no intent&#xD;
             to open the CTO during the index or later procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  12. Coronary anatomy not amenable to pressure wire manipulation due to extreme&#xD;

             that contains an ≥80% stenosis and is not intended for treatment with PCI (other than&#xD;
             a CTO supplying non-viable myocardium - see exclusion #11)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  18. Known non-cardiovascular comorbidity resulting in lifespan &lt;24 months&#xD;

          -  21. Any cardiac or non-cardiac surgical procedure planned within 12 months after&#xD;
             enrollment, or any procedure planned within 6 months after enrollment that would&#xD;
             necessitate discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  22. Known pregnancy or planning to become pregnant (women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
             must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  23. Participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not reached&#xD;
             its primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  24. Any condition such as dementia or substance abuse that may impair the patient's&#xD;
             ability to comply with all study procedures, including medication compliance and&#xD;
             follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  25. Patient is a member of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator, is unable to give Informed Consent for reasons of incapacity,&#xD;
             immaturity, adverse personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include&#xD;
             individuals with mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished&#xD;
             persons, persons in emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and&#xD;
             those permanently incapable of giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also&#xD;
             include university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees&#xD;
             of the Sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention.&#xD;
