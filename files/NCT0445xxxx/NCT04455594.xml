        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, age at least 18 years, no more than 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previously untreated, histologically documented NSCLC with completely or potentially&#xD;
             resectable IIIA-N2 nonsquamous NSCLC(according to Version 8 of AJCC staging). N2 is&#xD;
             defined as as radiologically and pathologically confirmed, nonbulky metastases to&#xD;
             single-station mediastinal lymph nodes (lymph nodes &lt; 2 cm in short axis) that are&#xD;
             expected to be completely resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Tumor tissue samples or blood samples are confirmed as EGFR sensitive mutations by&#xD;
             central laboratory tests (including Ex19del or L858R, both alone or with other EGFR&#xD;
             mutations). If the tumor tissue is accessible, the tumor tissue is recommended to be&#xD;
             submitted for examination. If tumor tissue is not accessible or patient cannot undergo&#xD;
             tissue biopsy, blood sample is also allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 with no&#xD;
             deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 1 lesion that has not previously been irradiated, that has not been chosen&#xD;
             for biopsy during the study screening period, and that can be accurately measured at&#xD;
             Baseline as &gt;= 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes, which must have&#xD;
             short axis &gt;= 15mm) with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             (MRI), whichever is suitable for accurately repeated measurements. If only one&#xD;
             measurable lesion exists, it is acceptable to be used (as a target lesion) as long as&#xD;
             it has not been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment scans are done at&#xD;
             least 14days afar the screening biopsy is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing potential must use a contraception method during the study&#xD;
             treatment and for at least 3 months after the treatment is completed; must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test prior to starting treatment or proved no risk of pregancy by&#xD;
             meeting one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Postmenopausal defined as age more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12&#xD;
                  months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more, following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments, and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  (FSH) levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, but not by tubal ligation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception (i.e., condoms) during&#xD;
             the study treatment and for at least 3 months after the treatment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Signed and dated informed consent form.&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the&#xD;
                  first dose of study drug.&#xD;

               6. Medications that are predominantly CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers or&#xD;
                  sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range within 7 days of&#xD;
                  the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any concurrent and/or other active malignancy that has required treatment within 2&#xD;
             years of first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
             for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment, with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia and Grade 2 prior platinum-therapy related neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with malignant pleural effusion. [only exception: pleural effusion on CT scan&#xD;

             pemetrexed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension or active bleeding diatheses, which, in the Investigator's opinion, makes&#xD;
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial OR which would jeopardize&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol such as active infection. Screening for chronic&#xD;
             conditions is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Refractory nausea, vomiting, or chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to&#xD;
             swallow the study drug, or previous significant bowel resection that would preclude&#xD;
             adequate absorption of Almonertinib.&#xD;

                  history of long QT syndrome, or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in&#xD;
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT&#xD;
                  interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;= 40%.&#xD;
