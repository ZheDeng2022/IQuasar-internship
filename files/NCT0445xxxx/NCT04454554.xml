  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEDIS Study is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter Italian study conducted in a&#xD;
      consecutive series of patients who refer to the Emergency Departments (either spontaneously&#xD;
      or sent by their attending physicians) for the recent (less than one months) development of&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of PE in the overall population&#xD;
      referring to the Emergency Departments without potential explanations for dyspnea&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PEDIS Study is an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter and no Profit Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      600 consecutive patients referring to the Emergency Departments of the participating centers&#xD;
      because they have developed one or more episodes of exertional dyspnea since less than one&#xD;
      month will be enrolled. All eligible patients will be interviewed and examined by trained&#xD;
      study physicians. The presence of already known potential explanations for the dyspnea will&#xD;
      be assessed. In addition, symptoms of the lower extremities will be elicited, as well as the&#xD;
      presence of risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence or absence of pulmonary embolism will be assessed with the use of a validated&#xD;
      algorithm based on pre-test clinical probability and D-dimer result. In patients in whom the&#xD;
      pre-test clinical probability is low and the D-dimer result is negative, no further testing&#xD;
      will be done, and PE will be considered excluded. In patients with high clinical probability,&#xD;
      positive D-dimer result, or both, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography will be&#xD;
      performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to evaluate Prevalence of PE in the overall population&#xD;
