  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of&#xD;
      the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) as a treatment for chronic refractory obesity. This study&#xD;
      will include 6 individuals with chronic refractory obesity, that have failed other treatments&#xD;
      including gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six (N = 6) subjects with chronic refractory obesity will receive bilateral DBS implants in&#xD;
      the LHA using the Boston Scientific Vercise Gevia DBS system. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of DBS of the LHA using the current-driven Boston Scientific device and&#xD;
      compare that to the safety data for our previous pilot using the voltage-driven DBS system&#xD;
      for the treatment of chronic refractory obesity. The primary efficacy objective is to&#xD;
      determine if DBS of the LHA can affect energy balance (i.e. energy intake and/or energy&#xD;
      expenditure) in these patients. Secondary outcomes include quality of life outcomes and&#xD;
      changes in feeding behaviors. Study participants will undergo a two-part DBS implantation&#xD;
      procedure for placement of DBS electrodes in the LHA. Following this procedure, subjects with&#xD;
      complete resting metabolic rate (RMR) testing to determine the optimal settings for the LHA&#xD;
      stimulation. If effective, DBS technology might offer severely obese adults (BMI of ≥50&#xD;
      kg/m2), who have failed traditional therapy, a non-destructive, adaptable, reversible&#xD;
      neurosurgical option for altering eating habits leading to sustained weight loss in the&#xD;
      long-term.&#xD;
