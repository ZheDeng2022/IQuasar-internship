  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intussusception remains a common cause of bowel obstruction in children and results in&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly treated. There is a paucity of&#xD;
      prospective studies regarding childhood intussusception. This study describes the seasonal&#xD;
      variation and management outcomes of childhood intussusception&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intussusception is the invagination of a segment of bowel into an adjacent segment resulting&#xD;
      into an intestinal obstruction. It is the most common acquired cause of intestinal&#xD;
      obstruction in children aged four months to two years with a peak of incidence between four&#xD;
      and nine months of age. Etiology of intussusception is reported to be idiopathic in about 90%&#xD;
      of cases and rarely is it associated with pathological lead points such as Meckel's&#xD;
      diverticulum, appendix, solid bowel lesions, intestinal polyp, and intestinal lymphoma. It is&#xD;
      an occlusive-strangulation type of intestinal obstruction, and all necessary measures should&#xD;
      be taken early to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid ischaemia and necrosis of&#xD;
      bowel. The term comes from two Latin words, intus, which means &quot;inside&quot; and suscipere, which&#xD;
      means &quot;to receive&quot;. It has been reported in neonates and adults . The ancient Greeks, treated&#xD;
      intestinal obstruction with enema or insufflations of air into the anus. Abdominal pain,&#xD;
      vomiting and blood in stools are the classic triad and are uncommon and seen in less than&#xD;
      one-third of the children affected. Cases often present with non-specific symptoms, including&#xD;
      vomiting, pain, irritability, decreased appetite and lethargy, and this may render diagnosis&#xD;
      of intussusception difficult. Abdominal ultrasound is considered the standard choice for its&#xD;
      diagnosis. Non-surgical management with Pneumatic reduction (PR) by air, hydrostatic&#xD;
      reduction by saline or contrast enema is the best procedure.Surgical management by&#xD;
      exploratory laparotomy with simple reduction while some cases may require a bowel resection&#xD;
      and reanastomosis for gangrenous bowel.&#xD;
