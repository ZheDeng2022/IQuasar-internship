  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This drug-drug interaction (DDI) study has been designed to investigate the effect of a&#xD;
      moderate CYP3A inducer efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of quizartinib and its major active&#xD;
      metabolite AC886.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quizartinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A. Therefore, co-administration of quizartinib&#xD;
      with CYP3A inducers may decrease quizartinib exposure. This study will assess the effect of a&#xD;
      moderate CYP3A inducer efavirenz on the single dose (60 mg) quizartinib pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      healthy participants.&#xD;
