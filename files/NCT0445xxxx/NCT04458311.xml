  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the side effects and safety of a combination of the&#xD;
      anti-IL23 targeting monoclonal antibody tildrakizumab in combination with abiraterone acetate&#xD;
      in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer and to determine the most&#xD;
      appropriate dose of this combination. In the Phase I part of this study small groups of&#xD;
      patients will be treated with increasing doses of tildrakizumab in combination with a fixed&#xD;
      dose of abiraterone acetate (500mg once daily). Once Phase I has been completed the&#xD;
      combination with the optimum safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile will be taken&#xD;
      forward to the Phase II part of the study. The Phase II part of the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      optimized dose/schedule identified in Phase I of the study in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be divided into 2 parts: Phase I and Phase II. The Phase I study will adopt a&#xD;
      Bayesian Continual Reassessment Method. Patients will receive single-agent abiraterone 500 mg&#xD;
      orally, once daily (continuous dosing) along with prednisolone at 5 mg BD for up to 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Upon confirmation of PSA progression, tildrakizumab IV will be started and given once every&#xD;
      4-weeks in combination with the fixed dose abiraterone (and prednisolone). The starting dose&#xD;
      of tildrakizumab will be 100mg with single dose escalations to 300mg and 600mg to determine&#xD;
      the RP2D to take forward to the Phase II study. Depending on the number of responses&#xD;
      observed, dose levels that are deemed tolerable may be expanded to up to a total of 10&#xD;
      patients who are evaluable for response&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II study will employ a two-stage Minimax design, recruiting up to 25 patients.&#xD;
      During the first stage 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2&#xD;
      cycles each. If there are one or more responses confirmed at least 4-weeks later an&#xD;
      additional 10 evaluable patients will be recruited. If 4 or more responses are seen in the 25&#xD;
      patients evaluable for response, the combination will be deemed successful, warranting&#xD;
      further evaluation in subsequent phases of testing. In the phase II study patients will start&#xD;
      taking 500mg abiraterone as an oral tablet once daily along with 5mg of prednisolone twice&#xD;
      daily on Day -28 for the first 4 weeks. Upon confirmation of PSA progression, the&#xD;
      tildrakizumab will be given as an intravenous infusion at the dose established in the Phase I&#xD;
      safety run in part of the study in combination with the abiraterone (and prednisolone)from&#xD;
      Cycle 1 Day 1 onwards.&#xD;

         24. Patients with female partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take&#xD;
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence effective from the first administration of&#xD;
             any of the study drugs throughout the trial and for six months afterwards. Men with&#xD;
             partners of child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner&#xD;
             uses an effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal&#xD;
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual&#xD;
             abstinence). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier&#xD;
             method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of&#xD;
             the foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NB. Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when&#xD;
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participants. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympathothermal, post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;

&#xD;
         26. Extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone marrow within 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Any other condition, which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Symptoms of COVID-19 and/or documented COVID-19 infection&#xD;
