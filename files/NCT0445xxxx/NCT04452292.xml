    <textblock>
      PRECISION-NEC is a single-center, open-label, pilot feasibility study of molecularly defined&#xD;
      subtypes of metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HG-NEC). The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and&#xD;
      that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will&#xD;
      potentially improve the outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade,&#xD;
      relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine&#xD;
      carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the&#xD;
      body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these&#xD;
      HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology,&#xD;
      specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma&#xD;
      (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment&#xD;
      is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that&#xD;
      small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and&#xD;
      are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015&#xD;
      World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along&#xD;
      with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that&#xD;
      LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are&#xD;
      characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive&#xD;
      necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron&#xD;
      specific enolase and synaptophysin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression.&#xD;
      Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry&#xD;
      reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383&#xD;
      patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The&#xD;
      prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is&#xD;
      similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis&#xD;
      for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and&#xD;
      validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have&#xD;
      been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on&#xD;
      pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into&#xD;
      two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like&#xD;
      (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas&#xD;
      (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence&#xD;
      of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on&#xD;
      clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal&#xD;
      treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent,&#xD;
      driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine&#xD;
      carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in&#xD;
      large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies&#xD;
      for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic&#xD;
      profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of&#xD;
      optimal treatments.&#xD;
