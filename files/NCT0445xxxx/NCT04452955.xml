  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 2, open-label, single dose level study of PRL3-zumab&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Screening Period (Day - 14 to Day -1), a Treatment Period during&#xD;
      which visits will occur every 2 weeks, an End of Treatment visit within 14 days of the&#xD;
      decision to discontinue treatment for any reason, and a Safety Follow-up visit at 14 ± 4 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study treatment. PRL3-zumab will be administered by intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion till patient meets any of the discontinuation criteria (progressive disease,&#xD;
      clinically or per RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent).&#xD;
      One cycle of treatment will be 4 weeks (2 infusions, 12 days ±2 days apart).&#xD;
