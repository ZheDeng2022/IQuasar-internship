  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A closed-loop insulin system, also referred to as the &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; (AP), is made up&#xD;
      of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitor, and an application communicating between&#xD;
      the two to adjust insulin administration based on glucose control. This is meant for the&#xD;
      treatment of type 1 diabetes. The McGill Artificial Pancreas (MAP) has been used previously&#xD;
      in type 1 diabetes with significant benefits. Though prior studies have shown significant&#xD;
      benefit with this system, some challenges still exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empagliflozin is used in type 2 diabetes; it allows for glucose to be removed through the&#xD;
      urine. Though its use is not approved in type 1 diabetes in North America, it (along with&#xD;
      similar drugs) has been used in studies as adjunctive therapy with insulin with benefits on&#xD;
      blood sugar control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our study is to see if a small dose of empagliflozin (2.5 mg and 5 mg) is&#xD;
      enough to help those who cannot achieve adequate glucose control on a closed-loop insulin&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses of the study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of empagliflozin 2.5 mg daily will increase time in range compared to placebo&#xD;
           for those on the closed-loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of empagliflozin 5 mg daily will increase time in range compared to placebo for&#xD;
           those on the closed-loop system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Some of the novel advances for type 1 diabetes treatment include continuous subcutaneous&#xD;
      insulin pump therapy (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). A step further is the&#xD;
      combination of both technologies, i.e. closed-loop insulin system, also referred to as the&#xD;
      &quot;artificial pancreas&quot; (AP), where insulin delivery is modified based on glucose readings from&#xD;
      CGM. Multiple studies have shown the benefit of closed-loop insulin systems on glycemic&#xD;
      control, with their strength being nocturnal euglycemia, while post-prandial hyperglycemia&#xD;
      remains a challenge due to decreased insulin absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel medication therapies previously used for type 2 diabetes are also under investigation&#xD;
      for type 1 diabetes. Sodium glucose-linked cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i's) increase&#xD;
      urinary glucose excretion and, in doing so, euglycemia. Their use is predominantly in type 2&#xD;
      diabetes for glucose control and for cardiovascular and renal protection, though various&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated improved glycemic control with SGLT2i use as adjunct to insulin&#xD;
      therapy in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The use of both closed-loop insulin therapy in&#xD;
      conjunction with SGLT2i therapy is thus a novel treatment for optimizing glycemic control in&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes, in particular those who do not yet reach target glucose levels despite being&#xD;
      on a closed-loop system. Our research group has previously studied the impact of a hybrid&#xD;
      closed-loop insulin system with empagliflozin 25 mg, which increased the time in target&#xD;
      glucose range of 3.9 to 10.0 from 70% to 84%. Notably, the EASE-3 (Empagliflozin as&#xD;
      Adjunctive to inSulin thErapy) trial had previously shown a beneficial glucose effect with&#xD;
      empagliflozin 2.5 mg without increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of low-dose empagliflozin (2.5 mg&#xD;
      and 5 mg) on glucose control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on a closed-loop insulin&#xD;
      pump system, who would not otherwise be within a percentage of time in range (TIR) by blood&#xD;
      glucose of 3.9 to 10 mmol/L of &gt; 70% on the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses of the study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The use of empagliflozin 2.5 mg daily will increase time in range compared to placebo&#xD;
           for those on the closed-loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of empagliflozin 5 mg daily will increase time in range compared to placebo for&#xD;
           those on the closed-loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will also be secondary hypotheses, based on quality of life measures, the effect of&#xD;
      both doses of empagliflozin on time spent in various ranges of blood glucose, average total&#xD;
      daily insulin dose, and average change in ketone levels. It is hypothesized that either dose&#xD;
      will increase the time spent in a favourable glucose range, with less time spent hypo- and&#xD;
      hyper-glycemic, with improved quality of life measures and lower total daily doses of insulin&#xD;
      without increase in ketone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a three-way, randomized, cross-over double-blinded outpatient trial to&#xD;
      compare the effect of glycemic control for adult participants with type 1 diabetes taking&#xD;
      placebo, empagliflozin 2.5 mg daily, and empagliflozin 5 mg daily while using a hybrid&#xD;
      closed-loop insulin system (i.e. the McGill Artificial Pancreas (MAP), used in over 20&#xD;
      studies thus far). Adult participants meeting inclusion criteria after baseline laboratory&#xD;
      investigations and training will use the MAP during a run-in period of 14 days to identify&#xD;
      those with TIR &lt; 70%. The chosen participants will have a randomized sequence of&#xD;
      interventions (placebo, empagliflozin 2.5 mg, or 5 mg), each intervention lasting 14 days,&#xD;
      with a washout period of 7 - 21 days in between. Optimization of MAP insulin parameters will&#xD;
      be adjusted on approximately Day 4 so that the last 10 days of CGM with each intervention&#xD;
      will be used for data analysis. During each intervention, ketone levels will be measured&#xD;
      daily. Questionnaires assessing quality of life will be filled out after each intervention.&#xD;
      There will be a visit at the end of the study to assess participant satisfaction. Data&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted to compare the differences in each intervention for each&#xD;
      participant of the following : CGM data of the last 10 days of each intervention, daily&#xD;
      ketone levels, total daily dose of insulin, and scores of quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
