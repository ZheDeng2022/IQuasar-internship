  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Asthma, the levels of exhaled FeNO is correlated to sputum eosinophils particularly in the&#xD;
      patient with poor controlled asthma or severe asthma. Moreover, the blood eosinophils had&#xD;
      been studied that are also correlated to sputum eosinophils in similar patients group.&#xD;
      According to well controlled asthma, althoug hin clinical practice guidelines recommend that&#xD;
      the stepping down therapy should be considered to those patients due to the risks or costs of&#xD;
      daily treatment, there is previous study has been shown that the airway hyperresponsiveness&#xD;
      and sputum eosinophilia are predictors of loss of control during dose reduction. And, these&#xD;
      tests are not readily available in primary care. However, there is limit number of clinical&#xD;
      study to study the correlation of biologic markers among the patients with well controlled&#xD;
      level before the stepping down management.&#xD;

      This is a single prospective trial. Enrollment will continue until 50 patients with well&#xD;
      controlled asthma have been entered into this trial and have completed blood tests and&#xD;
      spirometry. In this trial, the following parameters are to be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood eosinophils (absolute and relative) FeNO Pulmonary lung function test: FEV1, FVC, PF,&#xD;
      MMEF 25-75%, % reversibility&#xD;
