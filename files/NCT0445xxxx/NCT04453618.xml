  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: The objective of the food effect study (Part 1) is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profiles of SYHA1402 tablets under fed&#xD;
      and fasted conditions following the oral administration of SYHA1402.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the multiple doses study (Part 2) is to investigate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of SYHA1402 in healthy subjects following oral&#xD;
      administration of Multiple rising doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of pharmacokinetics (PK) following multiple oral&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
