    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation is a very long and difficult procedure accompanied by a number of&#xD;
      possible complications. In the vast majority of cases, the operation itself is performed&#xD;
      using the ECMO support, which can negatively affect blood clotting, especially the formation&#xD;
      of a platelet blood clot, i.e. primary hemostasis. Thus, the procedure may be accompanied by&#xD;
      considerable blood loss, which amount can subsequently negatively affect the postoperative&#xD;
      period. It can be assumed, that precise diagnosis of primary hemostasis disorders and&#xD;
      subsequent targeted therapy can reduce blood loss and improve outcome of the patient.&#xD;
      However, the role of primary hemostasis has not yet been sufficiently specified in this area.&#xD;
      Usually, coagulation functions during surgery, are at our department monitored by using ROTEM&#xD;
      tests (assesses clot strength), PFA 200 (assesses primary haemostasis under high shear stress&#xD;
      conditions and is very sensitive to vWF deficiency) and ROTEM / platelet (assesses primary&#xD;
      haemostasis under &quot;low shear stress&quot; conditions and is very susceptible to platelet&#xD;
      dysfunction). Targeted therapy by administering necessary clotting factors is used, if any&#xD;
      pathology in these tests is detected. However, it is not known, whether the targeted therapy&#xD;
      administered is effective enough in patients during the support of extracorporeal&#xD;
      circulation. In our monocentric, prospective, observational study, data from the tests&#xD;
      mentioned above will be analyzed, and their correlation with a laboratory examination of VWF&#xD;
      levels and activity will be monitored. Based on these data, we will try to determine whether&#xD;
      perioperative examination of primary hemostasis during lung transplantation (PFA examination,&#xD;
      Rotem / platelet-aggregometry and von Willebrand factor-vWF level) is of clinical&#xD;
      significance and whether the diagnosis of hemostasis disorder at this level and subsequent&#xD;
      targeted therapy may reduce perioperative blood loss.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ECMO is a type of extracorporeal circulation that has experienced a significant increase in&#xD;
      use in the last decade as a substitute for lung or heart functions in patients, both&#xD;
      perioperatively - especially extensive thoracic surgery procedures such as lung&#xD;
      transplantation, or in resuscitation care - in life-threatening conditions associated with&#xD;
      heart or lung failure. It uses the classical principle of extracorporeal circulation&#xD;
      technology to create continuous, non-pulsating blood flow and, at the same time, its&#xD;
      extracorporeal oxygenation. In its two basic configurations, it can only be used to provide&#xD;
      respiratory support (veno-venous configuration, VV ECMO), or also cardiac support&#xD;
      (veno-arterial configuration, VA ECMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact that ECMO circuit is an artificial system consisting of cannulas, blood pump&#xD;
      and oxygenator itself, the blood is exposed to a huge surface that is not covered by&#xD;
      endothelium, thus stimulates the activation of proinflammatory and procoagulant systems. This&#xD;
      exposure results in a prothrombotic condition that is associated with a high risk of&#xD;
      thrombotic complications. At the same time, however, with this continuous activation of the&#xD;
      coagulation cascade, platelets and coagulation factors are depleted, this may lead to an&#xD;
      increased risk of bleeding. Pathological shear stress may result in direct binding of VWF&#xD;
      (von Willebrand factor) and the platelet GPIIb / IIIa receptor, resulting in their activation&#xD;
      and thrombotic complications, however, the effect of non-physiological shear stress may also&#xD;
      lead to loss of GPIbÎ± and GPVI platelet receptors, which, in the opposite, causes a disorder&#xD;
      of their adhesion and aggregation to VWF and collagen and increases risk of bleeding. Another&#xD;
      important factor is loss and fragmentation of the large VWF multimers, a condition known as&#xD;
      acquired von Willebrand's syndrome, which causes platelet adhesion to be impaired and thus&#xD;
      contributes to bleeding complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of these situations, definitely, increase morbidity and mortality in patients, so it is&#xD;
      necessary to find an optimal and reliable options for the coagulation system functions&#xD;
      monitoration, based on which it is possible to immediately perform a targeted therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of several studies suggest, that increased platelet activation or decreased function&#xD;
      results in both thrombotic and bleeding complications in patients requiring extracorporeal&#xD;
      support, and these changes cannot be detected by tests, which are usually performed (ROTEM or&#xD;
      other common coagulation tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECMO causes an early disorder of primary hemostasis, which is detectable by point of care&#xD;
      (POC) testing methods PFA 200 and ROTEM / platelet, according to their results, targeted and&#xD;
      effective therapy can be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to find out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether ECMO implantation leads to an early failure of primary hemostasis, which can be&#xD;
           diagnosed by POC examination - PFA 200, Rotem / platelet-aggregometry and von Willebrand&#xD;
           factor levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether targeted therapy of primary hemostasis disorders (based on the results of POC&#xD;
           tests) leads to normalization of these tests results and cessation of bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the extent of correlation of POC tests of primary hemostasis and laboratory&#xD;
           examination of VWF function and quantity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to clarify the correlation between possible pathological values of these tests and&#xD;
           clinically significant bleeding in the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identification of the most reliable method for the assessment of primary hemostasis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group of patients will be represented by patients indicated for implantation of ECMO&#xD;
      support during the lung transplantation procedure. ROTEM, PFA 200 and ROTEM / platelet POCs&#xD;
      will be used for the perioperative detection of primary and secondary hemostasis disorders-&#xD;
      this is a standard approach in Motol University Hospital. In addition to these standard&#xD;
      tests, an analysis of the blood sample will also be performed in cooperation with the&#xD;
      Institute of hematology and blood transfusion. These tests are represented by quantification&#xD;
      of vFW (using quantification of vWF antigen), vFW function test - Ristocetin Cofactor Assay&#xD;
      (ex vivo examination of patient's blood plasma, which is depleted of platelets but contains&#xD;
      vWF) and Colagen Binding Assay (measures the ability of VWF, especially its large multimers,&#xD;
      to bind to collagen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. after induction into general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. shortly (15-60 minutes) after ECMO initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. shortly (10 minutes) after administration of aimed therapy (vWF or platelets)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. shortly after ECMO explantation (during admission to the ICU, approximatelly 60 minutes&#xD;
           after explantation) An informed consent will be signed with the patient prior to lung&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule: 1 year (i.e. 40 patients, on average, about 35 patients undergo lung&#xD;
      transplantation per year at our department).&#xD;
