  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, the field of public health has become increasingly interested in endocrine&#xD;
      disruptors, and their effects on humans. Indeed, various scientific studies have highlighted&#xD;
      an evolution in the frequency of pathologies due to these substances, affecting in particular&#xD;
      the reproductive organs. Many concerns are expressed about the impact of these substances,&#xD;
      present in the environment or in consumer products, on the hormonal system. Effects have been&#xD;
      observed in animals in experimental studies, but the question of extrapolating these results&#xD;
      to humans arises, especially for exposures at low doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In orthodontics, the composite is the material of choice mainly for bonding fasteners, then&#xD;
      bonding a compression wire. These composite materials contain many monomers. The polemics&#xD;
      launched on Bisphenol A and the questions of our patients on the nature and toxicity of&#xD;
      dental products oblige us to reflect on their harmfulness after their placement in the oral&#xD;
      cavity. Many questions arise today about dental composites and their participation in the&#xD;
      release of endocrine disruptors. Indeed, Bisphenol A is used in the manufacturing process of&#xD;
      the monomers of orthodontic composites, as precursors of Bis-GMA and Bis-DMA. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to search for the presence of BPA, TEGDMA, BisGMA, BisDMA and UDMA monomers,&#xD;
      and to carry out the samples and their analysis at different clinical times (at T0, after the&#xD;
      removal of orthodontic attachments, after the placement of the compression, one hour later,&#xD;
      one week later, one month later and 6 months later). Studies have been performed in vitro,&#xD;
      but very little in vivo. In addition, these studies are only carried out on release at the&#xD;
      time of installation, but few are interested in the continuation of the phenomenon over time&#xD;
      and the deterioration of the composite. Although the short-term toxicity of BPA is low, its&#xD;
      dangerousness lies in its potential endocrine disrupting effect and which can induce&#xD;
      long-term chronic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compounds such as TEGDMA, BisGMA, BisDMA and UDMA differ greatly in their volatility due to&#xD;
      their different chemical structures as well as in their stability in saliva; Many methods&#xD;
      have been developed to study each monomer individually or to study them simultaneously using&#xD;
      different analytical techniques to determine their presence and to quantify them after their&#xD;
      release from dental products. The analysis of the samples is carried out by liquid&#xD;
      chromatography (HPLC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For several years, we have been wondering about the potential deleterious effects of&#xD;
      bisphenol A (BPA) on our organism. Known as an endocrine disruptor, its action has been&#xD;
      demonstrated at different levels of the human body and by different mechanisms. Its endocrine&#xD;
      activity is due to its structure close to that of estradiol. Cytotoxicity is the property of&#xD;
      a chemical or biological agent to be toxic to cells, possibly destroying it. Bisphenol A&#xD;
      (BPA) has received increasing attention in recent years. It is used in the monomer&#xD;
      manufacturing process of composites customary in orthodontics, as a precursor of Bis-DMA and&#xD;
      Bis-GMA, but is not normally found in pure form in these composites. In the mouth, these&#xD;
      materials are subject to numerous degradation constraints, initial and long-term: thermal&#xD;
      variations, pH change, mechanical wear, enzymatic, bacterial and salivary attack. They are&#xD;
      therefore responsible for the possible release of BPA, found in many human biological fluids,&#xD;
      including saliva. The monomers present in the composite resins are released in 2 stages:&#xD;
      immediate release where the non-polymerized monomers are found in the saliva for a few hours&#xD;
      after the treatment, delayed release where the monomers can be released following the&#xD;
      treatment by the various mechanisms of wear and degradation of the composite. If the BPA is&#xD;
      mainly released in saliva within three hours after the establishment of the dental&#xD;
      restoration, the long-term release remains to be determined, which explains the patient's&#xD;
      follow-up time of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research is the quantification of the Bisphenol A monomer released&#xD;
      during the placement of a mandibular orthodontic compression in order to raise awareness&#xD;
      among professionals. The study relates to the analysis of patients followed in the dental&#xD;
      department at the Pitié Salpetrière hospital. The study briefing note will be presented to&#xD;
      patients during the visit. Non-opposition will be collected and notified in the patient's&#xD;
      medical file after a 15-day cooling-off period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The salivary samples will be collected at 5 defined times: before removal of the orthodontic&#xD;
      brackets (T0), after removal (T1), just after application of the compression (T2), then at&#xD;
      one hour (T3), one month (T4) and 6 months (T5), as part of the end of their orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment. Control samples will be taken from patients who do not have a composite&#xD;
      restoration in their mouth. The inclusion criteria are patients undergoing orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment (multi-attachment device) with planned debagging and requiring compression with&#xD;
      mandibular bonded wire from canine to canine and maxillary groove, without composite&#xD;
      restoration in the mouth, with good hygiene and not gingival inflammation. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are patients requiring maxillary bonded compression, with composite restoration in&#xD;
      the mouth, carious lesions, smokers, with chronic pathologies and / or drugs, with chronic&#xD;
      exposure to Bisphenol A (construction sites, service stations ... ). The composite cartridges&#xD;
      will be weighed before and after their use, to have the exact quantity of material placed in&#xD;
      the mouth. For laying the compression wire, the protocol will also be identical to the&#xD;
      bonding protocol in adhesive dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples are analyzed by liquid chromatography (HPLC) on the Bioprofiler platform&#xD;
      (Metabolism Platform) of the Functional and Adaptive Biology Unit - CNRS UMR 8251 at Paris&#xD;
      Diderot University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analytical method chosen for the identification and quantification of the compounds is&#xD;
      high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method allows the separation of the&#xD;
      constituents of a very complex mixture. The HPLC consists of two pumps which maintain a&#xD;
      mobile phase under pressure in a column (stationary phase). The sample is injected into the&#xD;
      circulation system of the mobile phase and passes into the column where the different&#xD;
      constituents are more or less retained. The nature of the mobile phase and of the column&#xD;
      allows separation according to the physicochemical properties of the constituents of a&#xD;
      mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developments and optimizations of extraction and dosage methods allowing the analysis of the&#xD;
      release of bisphenols by orthodontic materials in saliva samples were carried out on this&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
