    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of different routes of local anaesthesia&#xD;
      administration in laparoscopic procedures to reduce post-operative pain (intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      infusion of Ropivacaine 0.75%, port site injection of Ropivacaine 0.75% or a combination of&#xD;
      both techniques), through a randomized one-center double-blinded study.&#xD;

      Research Question What is the best route of Ropivacaine administration in laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedures in decreasing post-operative pain? Is it port site injection, intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      instillation of local anesthetics or is it a combination of both routes? Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that a combination of port site injection and intra-peritoneal instillation of local&#xD;
      anesthetics will be more effective in lowering pain the first 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Characteristics of the patient population Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elective gynecologic laparoscopy for benign conditions at Antwerp University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Successful laparoscopy without surgical or anesthetic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Female&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 18-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ASA( American Society of Anesthesia) I-II Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Hypersensitivity to anaesthetics of the amide-type (2) Obesity, BMI &gt; 35 (3) Patients&#xD;
      with chronic use of analgesics / chronic pain (4) Patients with an abnormal liver function&#xD;
      (5) Urgent surgical procedures (6) Pregnancy (this means we only include patients who use&#xD;
      contraceptives, are sterilized, have a negative dipstick testing or a negative serum testing&#xD;
      or patients who are postmenopausal) 4. Characteristics of the treatment We will be using&#xD;
      ropivacaine - naropin 7,5mg/ml, a local anaesthetic of the amide type. The administered dose&#xD;
      of this local anaesthetic will be 3mg/kg for each patient. Depending on the study group the&#xD;
      patient belongs to, this dose will be given in full by either local injection at the trocar&#xD;
      entry points or by intraperitoneal injection or it will be divided between both injection&#xD;
      sites, respectively 1mg at the trocar sites and 2mg intraperitoneal. The unequal dose&#xD;
      distribution is based on the surface area the local anaesthetic has to cover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Methodology Anaesthetic management will be standardized for each person. The anaesthetist&#xD;
      will insert an intravenous line and connect the patient to the monitor. We will be using&#xD;
      routine intraoperative monitoring devices such as an electrocardiograph, a pulse oximetry and&#xD;
      a non-invasive blood pressure monitor. The patient is preoxygenated with 100% O2 before&#xD;
      induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fentanyl 2μg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Propofol TCI marsh model 6μg/ml - titration based on effect&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rocuronium 0.5mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Propofol TCI Marsh model: 4μ/ml - (8-12mg/kg/u) - titration based on effect, blood pressure&#xD;
      and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesia intraoperatively:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketorolac 30mg at induction (if no contraindications; and &gt; 60kg; if the patient weight&#xD;
           is &lt; 60kg the dose will be lowered to 20mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracetamol 1g one half hour before the end of the surgery Different study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the successful gynaecologic laparoscopy, patients will receive the additional&#xD;
      pain management according to their randomly assigned study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A patients will receive 1) intra-abdominal instillation 0.75% Ropivacaine 2 mg /&#xD;
           kg in 200 ml of NaCl through the trocars and 2) Infiltration of the surgical wounds at&#xD;
           the trocar sites with 0.75% Ropivacaine 1 mg / kg in 20 ml of NaCl (Sodiumchloride)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B patients will receive infiltration of the surgical wounds at the trocar sites&#xD;
           with 0.75% Ropivacaine 3 mg / kg in 20 ml of NaCl.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C patients will receive intra-abdominal instillation 0.75% Ropivacaine 3 mg / kg&#xD;
           in 200 ml of NaCl through the trocars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suction and aspiration is avoided after instillation of local anaesthetic intra-abdominal in&#xD;
      group A and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medication will be prepared in the operating room right before use. This means that&#xD;
      neither the anaesthesiologist nor the surgeon, performing the surgery, are blinded. This&#xD;
      isn't a problem since it is already at the end of the procedure and they will not be the ones&#xD;
      following up on the patients for study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the procedure After surgery, the patients will be transferred to the recovery room. A&#xD;
      standard postoperative analgesic regimen will be used in all patients with Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS) &gt;= 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As long as the patient is in the hospital, she will receive paracetamol 1g every 6 hours,&#xD;
      preferably given orally. If, despite this regimen, the NRS score is higher than 3, they will&#xD;
      receive tramadol 100mg IV + alizapride 50 mg. There will be a re-evaluation after 30 minutes.&#xD;
      If the NRS is still higher than 3, an anaesthesiologist will be consulted and a subcutaneous&#xD;
      dose of morphine will be given. The dose will be 5 mg if the body weight of the patient is&#xD;
      less than 90 kg and the patient is less than 70 years old. In a patient heavier than 90 kg&#xD;
      and younger than 70 years, the dose will be 10mg morphine subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurses of the day hospital will complete the first page(s) of the patient's&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Later that day the patient will be discharged from the hospital if all the discharge criteria&#xD;
      are met according to standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When going home all patients receive a map with their questionnaire, a prescription for&#xD;
      paracetamol 1g if necessary, max 4 times a day, and a last reminder to not forget about the&#xD;
      questionnaire. In this study, we will focus about the first week postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Questionnaire In total 7 parameters will be questioned: abdominal pain, shoulder pain,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, itching, urinating and activity level. The questionnaire that will be given&#xD;
      to the patients consists of an introduction page and 5 identical questionnaires. Assessment&#xD;
      will take place at respectively 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 24 h and 1 w postoperatively. Abdominal pain&#xD;
      will be scored by the patients using the numeric rating scale. The patients will be asked to&#xD;
      rate the severity of pain via NRS ranging from no pain (score 0) to the worst possible pain&#xD;
      (score 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method is explained in the introduction page and is the method of choice to evaluate&#xD;
      pain in the recovery room. This means that all the patients will already be familiar with the&#xD;
      scoring system before going home. Intra-abdominal pain will be assessed during rest and&#xD;
      during an effort, for example coughing. In the postoperative period, the time to first&#xD;
      analgesic administration and total analgesic requirements (paracetamol, tramadol and&#xD;
      morphine) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the other parameters, our interests lie in the presence or absence of these elements so&#xD;
      we chose for a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individuals filling in the questionnaires, the patients or the nurses of the recovery&#xD;
      room will always be blinded to the study groups, as will the nurse contacting the patients&#xD;
      for the follow up. The research nurses will contact the patients through telephone 24 h after&#xD;
      surgery and again 1 week after surgery to get the answers of the questionnaires. They will be&#xD;
      unaware of the study group the patient was subdivided into. The responses will be recorded&#xD;
      and analysed by members of the research group. If the patients are not pain free after one&#xD;
      week, we will contact them again after one month. After that, they will be called once a&#xD;
      month until they are pain free or 6 months have passed. Postoperative pain lasting more than&#xD;
      one week could be and indicator for the onset of chronic pain. (13) However, this topic will&#xD;
      need additional research that, for the moment, is beyond the scope of our investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Statistics: Comparison of the categorical or ordinal variables will be performed using Chi&#xD;
      square or Fisher exact test and relative risk with 95 % confidence intervals as appropriate&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented in median values and will be compared using ANOVA.&#xD;
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be performed. P values of less than 0.05 will&#xD;
      be regarded statistically significant. All the calculations will be performed with the SPSS&#xD;
      11.0 statistical package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) (Dupont WD, Plummer WD,&#xD;
      http://www.spss.com). According to that the sample size should be at least 16 cases for each&#xD;
      group when we want the power of the study to be 80%.æ&#xD;
