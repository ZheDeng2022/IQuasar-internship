  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sacituzumab govitecan in&#xD;
      Chinese patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who received at least&#xD;
      two prior chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, single arm, multicenter study of sacituzumab govitecan in locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic TNBC patients who are refractory or relapsing after at least 2 prior&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy regimens for unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer, and these regimens will qualify regardless of triple-negative status at the time they&#xD;
      were given. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the ORR per RECIST v 1.1 by Independent&#xD;
      Review Committee (IRC) in all treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until progression requiring discontinuation of further treatment,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Tumor response and&#xD;
      progression will be assessed using RECIST v 1.1 and assessment by Investigator at the trial&#xD;
      center will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. An independent analysis&#xD;
      of response will also be performed by IRC, but this will not be used to make treatment&#xD;
      decisions. All patients will visit the Investigator at regular intervals for assessment of&#xD;
      safety parameters and AEs.&#xD;

             management.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Other concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the Investigator's&#xD;
