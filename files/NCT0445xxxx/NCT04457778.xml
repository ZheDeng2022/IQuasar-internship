      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), immunogenicity and (if observed) the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of M6223 as a single&#xD;
      agent (Part 1A) and of M6223 combined with bintrafusp alfa [Part 1B, for both the every 2&#xD;
      weeks (Q2W) regimen and the every 3 weeks (Q3W) regimen] in participants with metastatic or&#xD;
      locally advanced solid unresectable tumors.&#xD;
