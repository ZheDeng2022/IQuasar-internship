    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety of adjuvant hypofractionated whole pelvis&#xD;
      radiation therapy (WPRT) in endometrial cancer. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose per fraction (MTDF), defined by acceptable acute&#xD;
      clinician-reported GI and GU toxicity and patient-reported GI toxicity, of WPRT from among&#xD;
      the two study dose levels. Acute GI and GU toxicity will be assessed according to both the&#xD;
      NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, and Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcome-CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). Clinician-reported dose-limiting toxicity (C-DLT) is a binary&#xD;
      outcome (yes/no), defined as an acute grade 3 or higher GI or GU per CTCAE, occurring within&#xD;
      three months of completing WPRT. Patient-reported DLT (P-DLT) is a binary outcome, defined by&#xD;
      a GI toxicity with a score of ≥4 on the 5-point scale per PRO-CTCAE, occurring within three&#xD;
      months of completing WPRT. The MTDF is defined as the minimum of the dose with a C-DLT rate&#xD;
      closest to the clinician-reported target C-DLT rate of 20% and the dose with a P-DLT rate&#xD;
      closest to the patient-reported target P-DLT rate of 55%. Toxicity results of NRG-RTOG 1203-&#xD;
      A Randomized Phase III Study of Standard vs. IMRT Pelvic Radiation for Post-Operative&#xD;
      Treatment of Endometrial and Cervical Cancer- were used to define the acceptable percentage&#xD;
      of DLTs. The study will accrue participants in cohorts of size 3. The starting dose level&#xD;
      will be dose level 1 (41.25 Gy in 15 fx).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Dose allocation will be based upon a Bayesian continual reassessment method that incorporates patient-reported outcomes (PRO-CRM17), which uses separate models for the probability of C-DLT and the probability of P-DLT, as well as the accumulated C-DLT and P-DLT data at each dose level, to sequentially allocate each new patient cohort.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Toxicity profile will be determined by assessment of acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity during WPRT and 3 months post-radiation using CTCAE version 5.0 and Patient Reported Outcome-CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any acute ≥ grade 3 gastrointestinal or genitourinary per CTCAE or a score of ≥4 on the 5-point scale per PRO-CTCAE.</description>

    <description>Determination of the MTDF will rely on toxicity data, specifically combined gastrointestinal and genitourinary CTCAE data and gastrointestinal PRO-CTCAE data.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed stage I, II, or III endometrial cancer who&#xD;
             require pelvic radiation as determined by their treating radiation oncologist and/or&#xD;
             gynecologic oncologist. Patients may also be identified through the Gynecologic&#xD;
             Oncology Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The decision to include Stage I patients will&#xD;
             be based on risk factors for recurrence including tumor grade, extent of myometrial&#xD;
             invasion, presence of lymphovascular space invasion, and histology (endometrioid,&#xD;
             papillary serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma). Stage I patients may include those who&#xD;
             are ineligible for vaginal cuff brachytherapy due to patient anatomy or those who are&#xD;
             at higher risk for pelvic nodal recurrence and pelvic external beam radiotherapy is&#xD;
             preferred over vaginal cuff brachytherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have undergone total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy&#xD;
             with or without pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node dissection/sampling or sentinel&#xD;
             lymph node (SLN) dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an Inflammatory Bowel Disease diagnosis, regardless of disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with current, active disease involving periaortic node(s). This is based on&#xD;
             histologically positive para-aortic node(s) removed at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gross residual disease following surgical resection. Final pathologic&#xD;
             margins must be negative (no tumor on ink). This may also be determined clinically by&#xD;
             the gynecologic oncologist at time of surgery or post-operative imaging if applicable.&#xD;
             Post-operative imaging is not required at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have ever had pelvic radiotherapy prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients who have&#xD;
             received other investigational agents previously who are no longer receiving these&#xD;
             investigational agents may be eligible at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
