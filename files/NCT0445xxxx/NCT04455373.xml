      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular bypass surgery in children differs significantly from adults. It is a rarely&#xD;
      performed procedure in the setting of trauma and tumor surgery to facilitate limb salvage.&#xD;
      Beside the technical challenges to reconstruct the small and spastic vessels, bypass grafting&#xD;
      should not impede growth of the extremity. The primary aim of this study was to assess&#xD;
      long-term outcome after pediatric bypass grafting, in a single academic center, focusing on&#xD;
      potential effects on limb development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective cohort analyses we included all pediatric patients undergoing vascular&#xD;
      bypass grafting at the Medical University of Vienna between 2002-2017. All patients ≤ 18&#xD;
      years suffered a traumatic injury or underwent a tumor resection of the lower or upper limb,&#xD;
      respectively. The youngest female patient was 0.4 years, the youngest male patient was 3.5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

        This study represents a retrospective cohort analysis of pediatric patients who underwent&#xD;
        vascular bypass grafting by an experienced team of vascular surgeons at the Medical&#xD;
        University Vienna between 2002-2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All data regarding demographics, operative techniques and outcome were collected from the&#xD;
        in-hospital database registry in collaboration with the Department of Orthopedics and&#xD;
        Trauma-Surgery. All patients ≤ 18 years who suffered a traumatic injury or vascular surgery&#xD;
        due to a planned orthopedic extremity tumor resection were included in this study. 33&#xD;
        patients underwent vascular repair, a total of 15 patients fulfilling the criteria could be&#xD;
        identified.&#xD;
