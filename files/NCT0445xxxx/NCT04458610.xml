  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well zanubrutinib and rituximab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma for which the patient has not&#xD;
      received treatment in the past (previously untreated). Zanubrutinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Rituximab is a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      The study is being done to find out if zanubrutinib combined with rituximab can help control&#xD;
      previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of patients who have treatment-free remission 6 months after&#xD;
      discontinuation of zanubrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine clinical factors associated with a treatment-free remission of more than 6&#xD;
      months after discontinuation of zanubrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the treatment-free remission length. III. To evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      re-treatment with zanubrutinib plus rituximab in patients who relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FRONTLINE THERAPY: Patients receive zanubrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Patients also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) over 3-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of&#xD;
      cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 7, patients&#xD;
      with complete response (CR) continue zanubrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 for up to 6 additional&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 7,&#xD;
      patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) continue zanubrutinib PO BID on&#xD;
      days 1-28 and rituximab IV over 3-4 hours on day 1 for up to 6 additional cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 13, patients with CR&#xD;
      continue zanubrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 for up to 6 additional cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 13, patients with PR or SD&#xD;
      continue zanubrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 for up to 12 additional cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not have a PR after 24 cycles&#xD;
      either continue zanubrutinib if there is a clinical benefit, or pursue alternative therapy&#xD;
      per treating physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-TREATMENT FOR RELAPSED DISEASE: Patients with disease relapse and active disease that&#xD;
      requires salvage therapy may restart zanubrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 and rituximab IV over&#xD;
      3-4 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 7, patients continue&#xD;
      zanubrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 for up to 18 additional cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity and then discontinue if in CR. Beginning cycle 25,&#xD;
      patients with PR or SD may continue zanubrutinib PO BID on days 1-28 for up to 36 additional&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days, and then every 120&#xD;
      days for up to 5 years or until disease progression or start of a new treatment.&#xD;
