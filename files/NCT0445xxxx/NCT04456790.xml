      Questionnaire study exploring patients preference in bowel preparation timings for morning&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is often difficult to achieve optimal bowel cleansing for patients having morning&#xD;
      colonoscopies. One possible cause of this is the timing of the bowel preparation prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. A clean bowel will allow for a clear view of its inner lining which is important&#xD;
      for both accurate diagnosis and treatment. Abnormal changes may be tiny, so even the smallest&#xD;
      amount of faeces could potentially disguise polyps and cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, poor bowel cleansing can lead to the procedure being cancelled and repeated on&#xD;
      another occasion at a later date, adding to the burden on current resources. Poor bowel&#xD;
      preparation has also been shown to be a factor in more difficult and longer procedures,&#xD;
      increased patient discomfort, and a higher risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is more of an issue for patients having a colonoscopy in the morning. One cause of this&#xD;
      could be the timing of bowel preparation. Studies have shown that having a smaller window of&#xD;
      time between finishing bowel preparation and having a colonoscopy results in a much cleaner&#xD;
      bowel. The investigators are therefore considering the times patients are required to take&#xD;
      their bowel preparation in order to improve the bowel cleansing outcome for a morning&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated that a split dose (one evening dose and one early morning&#xD;
      dose) improves bowel cleansing compared to all doses taken the day prior to colonoscopy.&#xD;
      However, there has been no research to assess the efficacy of early morning bowel preparation&#xD;
      and its acceptability to patients. This information may lead to future studies and in order&#xD;
      to ensure the success of this further research it is important to understand any potential&#xD;
      barriers from patients to new timing regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, such information as highest education level, employment status, age and experience&#xD;
      of previous bowel preparation for colonoscopy for the patient population is captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from previous studies looking at potential barriers have shown that such issues as&#xD;
      having a simplified colonoscopy instruction sheet improved bowel preparation and lowered&#xD;
      cancellation rates and that patients with a history of colonoscopy are less likely to follow&#xD;
      bowel preparation instructions and therefore achieve adequate bowel cleansing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 300 participants will be approached; 150 participants who have previously had&#xD;
      bowel preparation for colonoscopy and 150 participants who have not, and are attending for a&#xD;
      flexi sigmoidoscopy and therefore may have to go on to have a colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These groups will be further split to half attending in the morning and half attending in the&#xD;
      afternoon, thus achieving a cross section of this patient group.&#xD;
