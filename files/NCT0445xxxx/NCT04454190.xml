      1. The purpose of this study is to obtain genetic data on a well-defined population of&#xD;
           patients with glaucoma that had accurate measurements of rates of structural and&#xD;
           functional change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators aim to recruit 5,000 patients for Phase I and 100 patients for Phase&#xD;
           II over a period of 2 years for obtaining blood samples which will be processed for&#xD;
           extraction of DNA and genotyping. Phase II also includes eye examination. Patients will&#xD;
           be selected from the Duke Glaucoma Registry (DGR) database and will be contacted by&#xD;
           phone, mail or email using a standardized script and procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis, based on patient-blind (no personal health information) data will take&#xD;
           place at Duke and Genentech. No protected health information (PHI) will leave Duke.&#xD;
           Standard statistical methods will be used to analyze the collected data and to develop&#xD;
           predictive statistical models for fast progression in glaucoma. Risks from participating&#xD;
           in the study are low and include loss of confidentiality and inherent issues related to&#xD;
           drawing blood.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain genetic data on a well-defined population of patients&#xD;
      with glaucoma that had accurate measurements of rates of structural and functional change&#xD;
      over time, develop a predictive model for fast progression in glaucoma, and then subsequently&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the predictive model in a prospective cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that incorporating genetic and clinical data will lead to a&#xD;
      powerful model to predict rates of change in the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease caused by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC)&#xD;
      loss associated with characteristic structural changes in the optic nerve and retinal nerve&#xD;
      fiber layer (RNFL). The neural insult can result in irreversible loss of vision and&#xD;
      disability. Detection of progression plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of&#xD;
      glaucoma. However, although most glaucoma patients will show some evidence of progression if&#xD;
      followed long enough, the rate of deterioration can be highly variable among them. While most&#xD;
      patients progress relatively slowly, others have aggressive disease with fast deterioration,&#xD;
      which can eventually result in disability unless appropriate interventions take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many risk factors have been shown to be associated with glaucoma progression, such as older&#xD;
      age, high intraocular pressure (IOP), thin corneas, presence of disc hemorrhage, among&#xD;
      others. However, previous attempts to develop models that can predict future rates of disease&#xD;
      progression have been limited. For example, a &quot;risk calculator&quot; for progressive glaucoma&#xD;
      developed by De Moraes et al had an R2 of only 13% to explain rates of disease progression.&#xD;
      Such limited predictive ability may be largely explained by different inherent susceptibility&#xD;
      of individual eyes to risk factors such as IOP. In fact, it is well-known that certain eyes&#xD;
      can develop rapid deterioration despite relatively low IOP levels and vice-versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of accurate model to predict risk of fast progression in glaucoma would&#xD;
      fulfill an extremely important unmet need by allowing tailoring treatment aggressiveness and&#xD;
      monitoring according to risk. In addition, it would lead to a tool that could be used to&#xD;
      identify patients that would most likely benefit from therapeutic interventions designed to&#xD;
      protect the optic nerve, i.e, neuroprotective. Use of predictive statistical models could&#xD;
      also lead to more effective clinical trials investigating new neuroprotective therapies, by&#xD;
      targeting patient populations at most need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve two phases. Phase I will include patients selected from the Duke&#xD;
      Glaucoma Registry (DGR), a database of electronic medical records developed by the Vision,&#xD;
      Imaging and Performance (VIP) Laboratory of Dr. Medeiros. The database consists of adults at&#xD;
      least 18 years of age with glaucoma or glaucoma suspect diagnoses who were evaluated at the&#xD;
      Duke Eye Center or its satellite clinics between 2009 and 2018. The Duke University&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study involving database set up and analysis of&#xD;
      progression under protocol PRO00103899 &quot;Evaluation of progression of eye diseases from a&#xD;
      large clinical population&quot;, with a waiver of informed consent due to the retrospective nature&#xD;
      of this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present protocol will be prepared to involve consenting and collection of genetic&#xD;
      material for developing a statistical model for predicting risk of fast progression in&#xD;
      glaucoma. In addition, Phase II of this study will involve prospective recruitment of&#xD;
      subjects for testing and validation of the predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database to be used in Phase I contains retrospective clinical information from baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up visits, including patient diagnostic and procedure codes, medical history,&#xD;
      photographs, and the results of all Spectralis Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (SD OCT) and standard automated perimetry (SAP), acquired with the Humphrey Field Analyzer.&#xD;
      SD OCT and SAP have been evaluated for quality and reliability. SD OCT images with quality&#xD;
      less than 15 dB were excluded and SAP tests with false-positive results greater than 15% or&#xD;
      fixation losses greater than 33% were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Collection of genetic material&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included if they had primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or suspicion of&#xD;
      glaucoma based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes at baseline. Selection&#xD;
      of subjects will be based on analysis of retrospective de-identified data collected as part&#xD;
      of PRO00103899 &quot;Evaluation of progression of eye diseases from a large clinical population&quot;,&#xD;
      PI Dr Felipe Medeiros. The database contains longitudinal data from subjects that have been&#xD;
      evaluated at the Duke Eye Center and satellites. Classification of eyes as fast versus slow&#xD;
      progressors will be based on historical OCT and SAP data available in the database.&#xD;
      Preliminary analysis has identified 15,394 subjects in the database that have longitudinal SD&#xD;
      OCT and SAP. Of these, 33% have been identified with at least fast progression by SD OCT and&#xD;
      15% by SAP, according to the definitions provided in the Table below. Tests performed after&#xD;
      any diagnosis of retinal detachment, retinal or malignant choroidal tumors, non-glaucomatous&#xD;
      disorders of the optical nerve and visual pathways, and venous or arterial retinal occlusion&#xD;
      according to ICD codes are excluded. In addition, tests performed after treatment with&#xD;
      pan-photocoagulation, according to Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, are excluded&#xD;
      from analysis of rates of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using existing data on SD OCT RNFL thickness and SAP, eyes will be classified as slow,&#xD;
      moderate, fast and catastrophic progressors The categorization of rates of progression will&#xD;
      be useful for the purpose of patient recruitment for collection of genetic material, so that&#xD;
      a target balance of subjects progressing at slow x fast rates can be achieved. However, the&#xD;
      actual quantitative rate of progression will be available for analysis of the relationship&#xD;
      with genetic markers as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of note, due to the nature of the structure and function relationship, these tests may&#xD;
      identify different patients as fast progressors, but both are clinically relevant. Slow&#xD;
      progressors will have slow progression on both tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of genetic material&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I of this proposal aims at recruiting 5,000 patients over a period of 2 years for&#xD;
      obtaining blood samples which will be processed for extraction of DNA and genotyping.&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from the DGR database and will be contacted by phone, mail or email&#xD;
      using a standardized script and procedure. Patients will be invited for a single visit for&#xD;
      blood collection. 10 ml of blood will be collected using standard procedures. The samples&#xD;
      will be de-identified and receive a masked identification (ID) which will correspond to the&#xD;
      existing masked ID in the DGR database. 2 ml will be sent to Genentech using frozen samples&#xD;
      for genotyping using the Illumina Global Screening Array (GSA) kit. The remaining will be&#xD;
      processed and stored at the Duke Eye Center. These samples may be maintained indefinitely or&#xD;
      until they are exhausted. These samples will not be available for diagnostic or therapeutic&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic test is for research purposes only. The research tests are not being used as&#xD;
      diagnostic tests for any disease or illness. Subjects will receive no results from this study&#xD;
      unless they indicate a risk of treatable serious illness, such as those described in the&#xD;
      American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics report for release of incidental findings.&#xD;
      Incidental Findings will be confirmed by an approved lab before providing to a subject or&#xD;
      his/her physician. The investigators will contact the IRB when an incidental finding has been&#xD;
      made that appears to be clinically actionable, and in particular, if it relates to a serious&#xD;
      or life-threatening condition, to discuss the specific circumstances and how best to proceed.&#xD;
      With the subject's permission, the blood sample may be shared anonymously with other&#xD;
      investigators for research purposes. Such research will be strictly anonymous. The study will&#xD;
      follow The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) and PHI will be maintained in a&#xD;
      confidential, secure location at Duke University Health System (DUHS), accessible only by&#xD;
      authorized members of the study team, and will not be disclosed to third parties, except as&#xD;
      described above, or required by law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of Predictive Statistical Model&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of the predictive model for fast progression will be performed in&#xD;
      collaboration with Genentech. Genentech will be responsible for genotyping the samples. Data&#xD;
      to be transferred to Genentech will include SD OCT images and visual field data, as well as&#xD;
      general clinical data such as gender, race, age at time of testing (capped as &gt;90 if older&#xD;
      than 90), intraocular pressures over time, axial length, central corneal thickness, results&#xD;
      of ophthalmic exam over time, ICD and CPT codes. All data will be De-identified before&#xD;
      leaving Duke in accordance with the Safe Harbor Method. No PHI will be transmitted. Data will&#xD;
      be transmitted to Genentech using Duke Box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genentech will provide the PI with all results of genotyping in a suitable format. In&#xD;
      addition, Genentech will provide the PI with the ability to obtain predictions using the&#xD;
      developed predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Prospective Validation of Predictive Model&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase II, new subjects will be prospectively recruited from Dr. Medeiros' clinic at Duke&#xD;
      Eye Center for testing of the predictive model to identify fast progression. Baseline data on&#xD;
      clinical variables and genotyping will be collected from these subjects and the relevant&#xD;
      variables will be entered into the predictive model to obtain predictions. Patients will then&#xD;
      be prospectively followed with cluster-based intensive structural and functional testing at&#xD;
      Dr. Medeiros' lab. Testing will include SD OCT imaging of the optic nerve head, macula and&#xD;
      retinal nerve fiber layer, as well as visual field testing with the Swedish Testing Algorithm&#xD;
      (SITA) 24-2. Subjects will undergo 3 clusters of testing at baseline, 6 months and 1 year,&#xD;
      with each cluster consisting of 5 repeated tests acquired within an interval of 2 to 3 weeks.&#xD;
      The predictions from the model will then be compared to the actual prospective observations&#xD;
      of progression to assess their efficacy. A sample size of 200 eyes of 100 subjects will be&#xD;
      used for Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
