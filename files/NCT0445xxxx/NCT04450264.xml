  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New York City (NYC) is home to a large and diverse immigrant population. Many of these groups&#xD;
      face significant barriers to preventive health care, including lack of insurance, poor health&#xD;
      care access and language difficulties. Most African immigrant women are likely to live below&#xD;
      the poverty line and have low health literacy, are less likely to have health insurance and&#xD;
      visit a doctor, particularly for primary/preventive care. Without access to primary care,&#xD;
      many preventive services, such as breast cancer screenings go unattended. The barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to breast cancer screening for other minority groups from underserved&#xD;
      populations, such as African Americans and Latina women have been studied. Less is known&#xD;
      about these for African immigrant women and how to most effectively engage their&#xD;
      participation in regular screening. Data of over 2,000 African-born immigrants living in NYC&#xD;
      show that 77% report not having health insurance; 75% do not have a primary care physician;&#xD;
      and 57% have less than a high school education. As for cancer screening, when corrected for&#xD;
      age, 44% have never had a mammogram. Through the study team's unique collaboration with the&#xD;
      African Services Committee and the African Advisory Council of the Bronx, two&#xD;
      non-governmental community-based service organizations, the study team is poised to have a&#xD;
      significant impact on these immigrant women, who have emigrated from more than 20 countries&#xD;
      in Africa. This is a population with great need for increased breast cancer knowledge, access&#xD;
      to breast cancer screening, and basic medical care. The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a&#xD;
      framework for addressing cultural health barriers by positing that making a decision to&#xD;
      engage in a health behavior is determined by weighing perceived threats versus benefits. The&#xD;
      long term goal of the proposed project is to conduct a randomized clinical trial that tests&#xD;
      the adapted intervention to increase breast cancer screening rates for African-born&#xD;
      immigrants. In the short term, the study team plans to pursue the following specific aims:&#xD;
      (1) Identify barriers and facilitators to breast cancer screening among African-born&#xD;
      immigrants and (2) Culturally adapt and pilot test the Witness Project breast cancer&#xD;
      education program for African-born women. Thus, the study team will culturally adapt an&#xD;
      effective, innovative intervention to address this significant health disparity in&#xD;
      African-born immigrant communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Aim 1 is to collect formative data via a mixed methods approach and use those&#xD;
      results to culturally adapt the Witness Project for African immigrant populations. Cultural&#xD;
      adaptation will follow the stage model outlined by Barrera et al.48 The model includes five&#xD;
      stages: 1) information gathering to determine which intervention components to modify; 2)&#xD;
      preliminary adaptation design that integrates information from stage 1 to inform preliminary&#xD;
      modification of the original intervention; 3) preliminary adaptation tests to pilot the&#xD;
      intervention for feasibility and acceptability, 4) adaptation refinement with decisions&#xD;
      informed a leadership team/advisory board; and 5) cultural adaptation trial to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention in changing health outcomes. As this is the first step in&#xD;
      this line of research, the proposed study will only follow stages 1-4. The Witness Project&#xD;
      has three main components that will be culturally adapted: 1) educational presentation&#xD;
      addressing myths, barriers and values related to breast cancer and mammography, 2) culturally&#xD;
      matched, peer led narrative about breast cancer experience, 3) experiential education about&#xD;
      breast anatomy and self-examination. The quantitative surveys will be conducted first. The&#xD;
      results will inform the refinement of the focus group guide and in-depth interview questions.&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment for Focus Groups, Interviews and Surveys. There is a tremendous&#xD;
      diversity of African nations and languages; focusing research on individual African nations&#xD;
      and/or native languages is not feasible within the proposed study. Given that French and&#xD;
      English are the most prevalent non-native languages spoken by African immigrants in New York&#xD;
      City, the study team has chosen to focus on targeting individuals who speak these languages&#xD;
      as a first step in this line of research. All participants will be recruited from African&#xD;
      immigrant communities in NYC. Based on the prior experience of the study team's community&#xD;
      partners, the majority of the populations that they serve are from Senegal, Mali, Ivory&#xD;
      Coast, and Burkina Faso. In anticipation of wide variations in cultural values, barriers and&#xD;
      benefits, the study team will thus use a maximum variation sampling approach to allow&#xD;
      discovery of central themes, core elements and/or shared dimensions that cut across a diverse&#xD;
      sample of participants. The study team has a well-established collaborative relationship with&#xD;
      gatekeepers in the African immigrant community and have successfully recruited African-born&#xD;
      persons into prior studies49 and therefore anticipate successful recruitment for this&#xD;
      proposed research. Participants will be recruited for in-depth interviews, focus groups, and&#xD;
      surveys through IRB approved flyers at community sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Surveys: The study team will conduct surveys (N=50) to assess predictors of&#xD;
      breast cancer screening among African immigrant women. The survey will be conducted by a&#xD;
      bilingual RA and take about 15-30 minutes to Focus Groups: The study team will ask the&#xD;
      community partners to assist the team with identifying potential participants for the focus&#xD;
      groups. The goal of the focus groups is to gather rich, qualitative data from African&#xD;
      immigrant stakeholders and gatekeepers about the breast cancer screening needs of women&#xD;
      within their communities. The study team will deliver informational presentations about the&#xD;
      focus groups and the proposed study at events and meetings held by the community partners.&#xD;
      The study team will conduct one focus group with gatekeepers and stakeholders (in English)&#xD;
      and the other two focus groups will be conducted with African immigrant women (in French and&#xD;
      English). The focus groups will take 75-90 minutes to complete and will be conducted by a&#xD;
      bilingual RA. In-depth Interviews: An RA will approach potential participants and explain the&#xD;
      purpose of the study, verify eligibility and obtain informed consent. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to discuss their beliefs about barriers and facilitators patients may face as they&#xD;
      consider breast cancer screening. The duration of the in-depth interview and focus group will&#xD;
      be approximately one hour including the interview and completion of a demographic&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Iterative Program Development: After the completion of the interviews and&#xD;
      focus groups in Aim 1, a 3Ã—3 table of themes categorized using the PEN-3 model 25 will be&#xD;
      produced for each of the three components of the Witness Project: 1) addressing myths,&#xD;
      barriers and values, 2) culturally relevant breast cancer narrative, 3) experiential breast&#xD;
      education. Themes will be categorized in the following domains: cultural empowerment and&#xD;
      relationships and expectations. These themes will inform how the intervention components for&#xD;
      the educational narrative program should be adapted for an African immigrant audience.&#xD;
      Cultural barriers identified will also be addressed in the culturally relevant narrative by&#xD;
      providing examples and suggestions for coping with these perceived risks. The study team will&#xD;
      invite participants (N=20) to give feedback on the first iteration of the educational program&#xD;
      components, procedures and feasibility and acceptability of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations, Sites and Recruitment for Programs: Over the past 20 years, US African&#xD;
      immigration has increased ~750% with a high concentration settling in NYC.60,61 Experienced&#xD;
      outreach coordinators, assisted by the consultants, will recruit local community,&#xD;
      faith-based, and other social organizations to host breast cancer educational programs as the&#xD;
      study team has successfully done for previous studies. 24,20 Research staff will focus on&#xD;
      sites that include African-born immigrant women 40 years of age and older. A program will be&#xD;
      scheduled by the coordinator and individuals at the community sites will be approached to&#xD;
      participate in a breast cancer educational program. The study team will emphasize the goal of&#xD;
      the programs such that the study team will over recruit those eligible for breast cancer&#xD;
      screening. The study team will conduct a total of eight programs in English (N=4) and French&#xD;
      (N=4). Based on prior experience, the study team anticipates that about 15 participants will&#xD;
      attend each program and of those attendees, 50% will be eligible for breast cancer screening&#xD;
      (N=8). Thus, the study team will recruit a total of 64 eligible women at each program. When&#xD;
      recruiting program sites, the RA will emphasize the language in which the program will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducting Educational Intervention Programs: Trained staff will conduct the educational&#xD;
      programs. Trained staff will enroll and collect data from English- and French- speaking&#xD;
      African-born immigrants working with the consultants. Information and resources about breast&#xD;
      cancer, and primary care clinical services will be available to all participants, including&#xD;
      the mobile mammography van operated by the institution. The study team will inform both&#xD;
      insured and uninsured participants about the Cancer Services Program and local clinical&#xD;
      service resources for those without primary care physicians as well as questions to guide&#xD;
      them about asking clinicians about breast cancer screenings when they have medical&#xD;
      appointments. The program will take approximately 60 minutes to complete. The program will&#xD;
      also use a culturally matched peer approach to educate and model successful experiences with&#xD;
      mammography screening.&#xD;
