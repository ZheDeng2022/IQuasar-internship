      Study Design This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized clinical study in patients&#xD;
      presenting thoracic aortic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a baseline assessment, the implantation procedure will be performed according to&#xD;
      the Instructions for Use and local routine practice. A follow-up visit will be performed 30&#xD;
      days, 6, 12,24 and 36 months after the implantation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will perform assessments of the implantation procedure and device system and&#xD;
      document adverse events (AE) and device deficiencies. Resources utilization and unit costs&#xD;
      will be collected at index procedure and during follow-up. HRQoL is going to be investigated&#xD;
      in this prospective study using the generic questionnaire EQ5D 5 levels, comparing pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, performance and&#xD;
      resource utilization associated with the use of GORE® TAG® Conformable Thoracic Stent Graft&#xD;
      with ACTIVE CONTROL systems in humans having thoracic aortic pathologies. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated considering mortality and morbidity variables (mainly focused on device related&#xD;
      complications). Efficacy will be evaluated according to the variables related to the&#xD;
      technical and clinical successes. In addition, resource utilization and associated costs will&#xD;
      be collected prospectively with the objective to analyze differences in resource utilization&#xD;
      between outcome groups, landing zone groups, disease severity groups, adverse event groups&#xD;
      and case-mix groups. We will calculate the average marginal costs increase for complications&#xD;
      when they occurred during TEVAR or surgical revascularization (e.g., paralysis, stroke, nerve&#xD;
      injury, lymph damages, myocardial infarction, major bleeding event, respiratory&#xD;
      complication). Resource utilization analysis is not going to be limited to the index&#xD;
      procedure but will continue during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Elective and Urgent Thoracic aorta pathologies such as aneurysms,&#xD;
      pseudoaneurysms, dissections, blunt thoracic aorta injury, penetrating ulcers and intramural&#xD;
      hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned number of patients: A total of 200 patients. Approx. 20 study centers in 2 European&#xD;
      countries (15 in Italy and 5 in Spain) . A subgroup of 8centers will be selected for the&#xD;
      micro-costing analysis (7 in Italy and one in Barcelona) Expected Time to Complete&#xD;
      Enrollment: end of 2021 (18 months).&#xD;

      Detailed Description: 1. Introduction 1.1. Disease1 A thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and&#xD;
      pseudoaneurysm Type B aortic dissection (TBAD) Intramural hematoma (IMH). IMH may be a&#xD;
      precursor to both classic AD and penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) 1.3. Study Device Description GORE® TAG® Conformable&#xD;
      Thoracic Stent Graft with ACTIVE CONTROL System is a device designed for the endovascular&#xD;
      repair of TAAs, BTAIs, and TBADs of the thoracic aorta. The controlled deployment is designed&#xD;
      to optimize accuracy, angulation, and apposition. Its conformability with enhanced control&#xD;
      allows for optimized wall apposition even in the complex aortic anatomy 2. Study Objectives&#xD;
      2.1. Primary Objective(s) The primary objective of CONFORTA Clinical study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy of the GORE® TAG® Conformable Thoracic Stent Graft for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with Thoracic Aortic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Secondary Objective(s) 2.2.1. Health Economic Data healthcare organizations must&#xD;
      identify and address waste in healthcare and reduce the total cost of care. The secondary&#xD;
      objective of this trial is focusing on patient-based costing (PBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide patient care cost a micro-costing analysis (a cost estimation method that involves&#xD;
      the direct enumeration and costing out of every input consumed in the treatment of a&#xD;
      particular patient) will be conducted together with an assessment of patient QoL alongside&#xD;
      the study data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2. Quality of Life data This health status information is collected before and after a&#xD;
      procedure and provides an indication of the outcomes or quality of care delivered to the&#xD;
      patient. Among different PROMs, the preference-based measure, such as the EQ-5D and Health&#xD;
      Utilities Index, describes patients' responses to questions not to provide a score 3. Study&#xD;
      Design 3.1. Description of Study Design This study is a prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
      non-randomized single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the GORE TAG&#xD;

      descending Thoracic Aortic pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers from Italy and Spain will be invited to participate to the study. A minimum of 20&#xD;

&#xD;
      7.3.4. Resource utilization information will be included in the CRF in combination with&#xD;
      dedicated OR CRF 8. Risk Assessment The warnings and precautions when using the&#xD;
      investigational device are described in detail in the Instructions for Use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1. Risk-to-Benefit Rationale Risks are inherent to the endovascular repair of the thoracic&#xD;
      aorta. Benefits are related to the repair of the pathological entity. Risk / benefit should&#xD;
      be assessed by the physician in charge, explained to the patient and accepted, by signed&#xD;
      informed consent, by the patient or other legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Adverse Events (AE) and Safety Monitoring 9.1. Anticipated AE Anticipated AE are&#xD;
      complications that are known to be associated with thoracic aortic pathologies which are&#xD;
      planned to undergo TEVAR with a stent-graft. See Section 8, Risk Assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (USADE) Serious adverse device effect which&#xD;
      by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version&#xD;
      of the risk analysis report. NOTE: Anticipated: an effect which by its nature, incidence,&#xD;
      severity or outcome has been previously identified in the risk analysis report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Statistical Analysis 10.1. Study Hypotheses The used thoracic endograft device, C-TAG&#xD;
      active control, has high safety and effectiveness, in terms of very low rates of&#xD;
      device-related complications, high accuracy on deployment and solution of the underlying&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2. Sample Size Assumptions A cohort of a minimum of 200 cases is enough to prove our&#xD;
      hypothesis according to previous clinical reports with similar devices. Technical&#xD;
      improvements will be easily assessed by experienced operators with large expertise with&#xD;
      similar devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3. Sample Size Determination That is a case series study. 200 cases are comparable with&#xD;
      similar series already published in the literature with other similar devices for similar&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4. Data Analysis 10.4.1. Timing of Analyses An interim clinical analysis can be considered&#xD;
      when the sample will reach 50% of the final goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4.2. Analysis Populations Consecutive patients with thoracic aorta pathology according to&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously described. The investigators will replace&#xD;
      missing or removed cases in order to have the goal population included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4.3. Statistical Analysis of Primary Endpoint(s) Quantitative parameters will be described&#xD;
      using the following summary descriptive statistics: number of non-missing values, mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, and minimum and maximum values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4.4. Statistical Analysis of Secondary Endpoint(s) The rate of MAEs will be assessed at 1&#xD;
      year and following time points and will be derived as: all-cause death, bowel ischemia,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, and secondary&#xD;
      endovascular procedure as defined in section 9, stroke, and procedural blood loss ≥1,000mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Cost and QoL analysis 11.1. Micro-costing analysis Micro-costing analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to assess cost associated to each patient enrolled in the trial from the beginning&#xD;
      of the hospitalization to the study follow-up in the perspective of the provider that need to&#xD;
      consider budget constraints.&#xD;
