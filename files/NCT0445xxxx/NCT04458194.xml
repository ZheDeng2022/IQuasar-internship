  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II randomized controlled trial examines the preliminary efficacy of our&#xD;
      standardized four-week YOCAS©® program (Yoga for Cancer Survivors) on insomnia and sleep&#xD;
      quality in cancer survivors and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia can be described as excessive daytime napping, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty&#xD;
      staying asleep, or waking up earlier than desired. The majority of patients with cancer&#xD;
      experience some form of sleep disturbance. Caregivers who provide significant physical,&#xD;
      emotional, and psychosocial care for patients with cancer also experience sleep disturbance.&#xD;
      Yoga is safe, feasible, and effective for improving insomnia and sleep quality in cancer&#xD;
      survivors. However, whether both cancer survivors and their caregivers can both improve their&#xD;
      insomnia and sleep quality by participating in partnered yoga intervention is not known.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effects of partnered YOCAS, non-partnered YOCAS interventions, and standard&#xD;
      care on changes in insomnia measured via Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) among cancer survivors&#xD;
      and caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effects of partnered YOCAS, non-partnered YOCAS interventions, and standard&#xD;
      care on changes in sleep quality measured via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among&#xD;
      cancer survivors and caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Cancer survivor-caregiver dyads are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Standard Care: Cancer survivor-caregiver dyads receive their standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Partnered YOCAS: Cancer survivor-caregiver dyads participate in 8 virtual Zoom YOCAS&#xD;
      sessions (75 minutes/session, 2 times a week for 4 weeks) together&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Non-partnered YOCAS: Cancer survivors participate in 8 virtual Zoom YOCAS sessions&#xD;
      (75 minutes/session, 2 times a week for 4 weeks) alone; caregivers do not receive Zoom YOCAS&#xD;
      sessions&#xD;

    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a validated measure of insomnia. A 5-point Likert scale of 7 questions is used to rate each item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating higher severity of insomnia. A linear mixed effects ANCOVA will be used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in mean change among cancer survivors in the Partnered YOCAS vs. Non-partnered YOCAS</description>
