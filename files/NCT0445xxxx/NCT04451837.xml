  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current anti-diabetic treatment fails to stop the progressive course of the disease. Recent&#xD;
      studies have revealed a surprisingly high variability in the diabetic phenotype. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that anti-diabetic treatment should ideally target the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of each individual patient. The investigators will therefore test whether the&#xD;
      effect of two approved anti-diabetic drugs differs between individuals at different ends of&#xD;
      the pathophysiological spectrum: 1) patients with poor insulin secretion, here termed SIDD&#xD;
      and 2) patients with high insulin resistance, here termed SIRD. The study may open up a new&#xD;
      avenue for more precise treatment of diabetic patients that would be of immediate clinical&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a clinical phase II study that will be randomized and open-label with fixed&#xD;
      stratification variables (SIDD and SIRD) to analyze if the response to anti-diabetic drugs&#xD;
      differs between patients with distinct pathophysiology, as captured by SIDD and SIRD. The&#xD;
      compounds used are semaglutide and dapagliflozin, which will be randomized to patients of&#xD;
      each subgroup using a parallel group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clusters (SIDD and SIRD) will be used as a practical tool to distinguish individuals who&#xD;
      are at different ends of the pathophysiological spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 200 patients from the ANDIS registry with HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol&#xD;
      on metformin monotherapy. Half of them will have SIDD and half will have SIRD&#xD;
      characteristics. The patients will be randomized (open-label) to receive semaglutide or&#xD;
      dapagliflozin for six months in addition to metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit participants on metformin monotherapy with stable dose for the&#xD;
      last three months. Metformin dose at inclusion (as prescribed by their regular physician) is&#xD;
      maintained throughout the study; the investigatorswill correct for metformin dose in the&#xD;
      analyses. Patients randomized to add semaglutide will receive injection training at the study&#xD;
      site and inject 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly during the first four weeks, followed by&#xD;
      0.5 mg weekly for the subsequent four weeks and finally 1.0 mg weekly throughout the study.&#xD;
      Those randomized to dapagliflozin will receive 10 mg orally once daily in addition to&#xD;
      metformin. The participants will attend a screening visit followed by three study visits at&#xD;
      0, 3, 6 months. At the first and last study visit they will undergo an OGTT. HbA1c will be&#xD;
      measured at all study visits.&#xD;
