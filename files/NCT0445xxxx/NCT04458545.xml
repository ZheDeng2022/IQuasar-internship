    <textblock>
      Currently, abuse of prescription opioid analgesics and heroin is a serious problem in the&#xD;
      U.S. Although several medications, including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, are&#xD;
      available and effective in treating opioid use disorder (OUD), long-term relapse rates remain&#xD;
      high. The current study is designed to examine a new approach to treating OUD, namely use of&#xD;
      a vaccine targeted against oxycodone [Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH], one of the most commonly abused&#xD;
      prescription opioids. The vaccination approach to treating substance use disorders relies on&#xD;
      the ability of the vaccine to produce antibodies that bind the target drug in blood and&#xD;
      reduce its ability to enter the brain. The long-term goal of this research will be to develop&#xD;
      a combined vaccine against oxycodone and heroin. However, in this trial the Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH&#xD;
      vaccine will be studied separately. This is a multi-site study, being conducted at the New&#xD;
      York State Psychiatric Institute and the Clinilabs clinical research unit (CRU) in Eatontown,&#xD;
      New Jersey. The current study proposes to evaluate safety (Aim 1), degree of antibody&#xD;
      production (Aim 2), and efficacy (i.e., ability to reduced drug liking following opioid&#xD;
      administration) (Aim 3). The oxycodone vaccine (Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH) will be tested in&#xD;
      participants with OUD (target # completers = 45 across two study sites). This study will&#xD;
      provide a great deal of information about the safety and potential effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH vaccine in reducing the abuse of opioids.&#xD;

      Overview: The proposed study is designed as a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial of an oxycodone&#xD;
      vaccine (Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH Conjugate Vaccine, Adsorbed). Healthy adults, aged 18 to 59 years,&#xD;
      who meet DSM-5 criteria for OUD but are not seeking treatment for their drug use, and are&#xD;
      physically dependent on opioids will be recruited. This study will employ a between-groups,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design (two active vaccine doses, 1 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization will occur at Weeks 0, 3, 6 and 18. The Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH vaccine adsorbed to&#xD;
      aluminum adjuvant (Alhydrogel®) or aluminum adjuvant as placebo, will be injected&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid muscle. Each subject completing the study will&#xD;
      participate for 43 weeks including: One Screening Phase (Weeks -6 to -2), two Inpatient&#xD;
      Phases (Weeks -2-8 and 18-20), two Outpatient Phases (Weeks 8-18, 20-21), and a Follow Up&#xD;
      Phase (Week 21, 23, 30, 34, 38, and 42 (1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 4-month, 5-month, and&#xD;
      6-month follow up). Subjects will be immunized during Weeks 0, 3, 6 and 18 with either&#xD;
      Oxy(Gly)4-sKLH (either 100 μg or 400 μg dose; different dose levels will be administered by&#xD;
      varying the volume of the 400 μg/mL formulation) adsorbed on aluminum adjuvant or aluminum&#xD;
      alone as placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase (Weeks -6 thru -2): Eligibility for admission into the study will be based on&#xD;
      a psychiatric evaluation, physical examination, blood and urine testing, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      drug history assessment, urine drug testing, and ascertainment of physical dependence on&#xD;
      opioids via naloxone challenge and/or objective confirmation of opioid withdrawal&#xD;
      signs/symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient Phases (Weeks -1-8 &amp; 18-19) Opioid Maintenance and Testing Sessions: During the&#xD;
      inpatient phases participants will be maintained on oral morphine 120 mg/day. During testing&#xD;
      sessions, intranasal oxycodone (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/70kg) will be administered during each&#xD;
      inpatient phase to assess the ability of the vaccine to reduce positive subjective ratings&#xD;
      (e.g., Drug Liking, High, etc.). Intranasal heroin (100 mg/70 kg) and lactose powder&#xD;
      (placebo) will be used as positive and negative controls, respectively. In addition to&#xD;
      assessing subjective effects, vital signs and other physiological measures are collected&#xD;
      throughout the testing period (4.5 hours). The order ofthe different doses will be randomized&#xD;
      and one dose of either oxycodone, heroin, or placebo will be given each day on 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days. During testing sessions a physician or nurse practitioner will be on the floor for the&#xD;
      first hour after IN dosing, and on-call throughout the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient Phases (Weeks 9-17, 20-21): Participants will return to the laboratory weekly&#xD;
      during the outpatient phases in order to assess titer levels, maintain good contact and to&#xD;
      assess drug use, adverse events, and concomitant medication use. Blood tests (hematology,&#xD;
      chemistry) and urinalysis will be performed repeatedly throughout the study: just prior to&#xD;
      each inpatient phase and during the follow up visits at the end of the study (Weeks 8, 12,&#xD;
      17, 21, 23, and 30). In addition, the following assessments will be completed weekly&#xD;
      throughout the study: Physical exam, 12-lead ECG, body weight, vital signs, and standard&#xD;
      assessments of depression and suicidal thoughts/behaviors, along with cognitive functioning.&#xD;
      The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and clinical interviews will be used to&#xD;
      provide ongoing assessments of this risk throughout the inpatient and outpatient phases of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge (Week 19) and Follow-Up (Weeks 21, 23, 30, 34, 38, and 42): During the last week of&#xD;
      the study and/or prior to each inpatient discharge, participants will receive counseling&#xD;
      about different treatment options for opioid use disorder. For those participants requesting&#xD;
      treatment, appropriate arrangements will be made.&#xD;
