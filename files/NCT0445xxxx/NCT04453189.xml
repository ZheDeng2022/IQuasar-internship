  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple-dose administration&#xD;
      of lansoprazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-64417184 in healthy adult&#xD;
      participants; and to evaluate the effect of time-separated, multiple-dose administration of&#xD;
      famotidine on the single-dose PK of JNJ-64417184 in healthy adult participants (optional).&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product.</description>
