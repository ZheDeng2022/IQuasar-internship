    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to ascertain the effects of hiatal hernia repair and fundoplication on&#xD;
      the distensibility of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) as measured by FLIP&#xD;
      topography/impedance planimetry. The investigators also aim to assess for any correlation&#xD;
      between values of EGJ distensibility and GERD related quality of life (QOL) and dysphagia&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred for antireflux surgery and/or hiatal hernia repair will be considered for&#xD;
      enrollment. Standard preoperative evaluation will include esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to&#xD;
      assess for intraluminal pathology including esophagitis, columnar lined esophagus suggestive&#xD;
      of Barrett's esophagus, intraluminal masses, and to measure hernia size. Patients will also&#xD;
      undergo preoperative high resolution esophageal manometry testing with impedance as&#xD;
      clinically indicated to evaluate esophageal motility as assessed by standardized Chicago&#xD;
      Classification V3. Manometry will occasionally be avoided in patients with paraesophageal&#xD;
      hernias without substantial dysphagia or those not amenable to manometry, with appropriate&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal radiology imaging (UGI), who will be having partial fundoplications.&#xD;
      UGI is also a routine preoperative evaluation. Furthermore, pH testing for evaluation of acid&#xD;
      reflux will be performed in patients without LA grade C or D esophagitis, paraesophageal&#xD;
      hernia, or pathologic confirmation of Barrett's esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients appropriate for enrollment will be consented in the office setting. Preoperative&#xD;
      baseline evaluations of symptom severity will be assessed via the GERD-HRQL survey and Mayo&#xD;
      Dysphagia Questionnaire. Surgery will be scheduled and patients will undergo intraoperative&#xD;
      impedance planimetry with EndoFLIP obtaining measurements of the cross-sectional area,&#xD;
      balloon pressure, minimum diameter, compliance, length of high pressure segment, and&#xD;
      distensibility index of the EGJ using an 8cm EndoFLIP balloon. Sequential assessments will be&#xD;
      performed to 30ml and 40ml for up to a minute for each volume of distension. An initial&#xD;
      baseline measurement will be obtained after establishment of pneumoperitoneum. A second&#xD;
      measurement will occur following hiatal dissection and mobilization but prior to crural&#xD;
      closure. Two additional measurements will be obtained after hiatal closure and after&#xD;
      fundoplication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons will be blinded to EndoFLIP results for half of the cases, with the first 25 cases&#xD;
      blinded and the second 25 cases with the surgeons unblinded. There will be interim analysis&#xD;
      between the two groups' surgeries. During blinded cases no adjustment will be made to the&#xD;
      surgical procedure based on EndoFLIP results, as the operating surgeon will not be informed&#xD;
      of the measured values. After the first 25 cases, the surgeons will be unblinded and be able&#xD;
      to determine goal impedance planimetry values based on patient postoperative symptom scores.&#xD;
      In the following 25 unblinded cases, the surgeon will be able to augment the surgical intent&#xD;
      based on EndoFLIP measurements, such as adding or removing hiatal sutures or repeating the&#xD;
      fundoplication. Patients will be blinded to the type of procedure (i.e. surgeon blinded or&#xD;
      unblinded). The EndoFLIP catheters and generator will be provided by Medtronic, at no cost to&#xD;
      the patient. Medtronic will also cover the fees associated with the EndoFLIP procedure (CPT&#xD;
      91040 is used).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative clinical care will proceed as per standard protocol for foregut surgery, with 1&#xD;
      additional office visit. Reports of postoperative symptomatology and QOL will be performed,&#xD;
      via GERD-HRQL and Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire during follow up clinic appointments at 2&#xD;
      weeks and 6 weeks postoperative, and with additional long-term follow-up of at 6 months.&#xD;
      Long-term follow-up will again assess for QOL symptoms via GERD-HRQL and the Mayo Dysphagia&#xD;
      Questionnaire. The 6 month follow-up visit is not typical practice and the patients cost for&#xD;
      this visit will be covered by Medtronic. Per standard clinical care, recurrence of symptoms&#xD;
      or dysphagia at any point may lead to additional postoperative testing, including UGI, EGD,&#xD;
      pH testing, esophageal manometry, CT scan, or EndoFLIP. Postoperative GERD-HRQL and Mayo&#xD;
      Dysphagia score results will be compared to intraoperative EndoFLIP measurements in interim&#xD;
      and final analysis.&#xD;
