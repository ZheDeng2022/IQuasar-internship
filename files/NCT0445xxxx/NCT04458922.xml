    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      chondrosarcoma or clear cell sarcoma that is newly diagnosed, cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable), or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rates (ORR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 of atezolizumab in adult (&gt;= 18 years) patients with clear&#xD;
      cell sarcoma (CCS) and chondrosarcoma (CS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine duration of response (DOR) using RECIST v 1.1 and/or change in clinical symptoms&#xD;
      (time frame: baseline until disease progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of&#xD;
      another anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or study termination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measure progression-free survival (PFS) time (time frame: baseline until disease&#xD;
      progression, death, loss to follow-up, initiation of another anti-cancer treatment,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or study termination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the number of activated CD8+ T cells infiltrating the tumor before and after&#xD;
      atezolizumab treatment, and correlate treatment-induced changes with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare RECIST v 1.1 versus (vs) immune RECIST (iRECIST) in patients with CCS and CS on&#xD;
      atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Examine changes in PD-1/PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment before and after&#xD;
      atezolizumab treatment, and correlate treatment-induced changes with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate potential associations between atezolizumab activity and tumor genomic&#xD;
      alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 90 days.&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because atezolizumab is an investigational&#xD;
             agent with the unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
