      Visit 1 -Screening: Subjects will be screened to the study at the screening visit, PAC-QOL&#xD;
      questionnaire will be completed and subject will have a run-in time for a period of 2-3&#xD;
      weeks, assuring 14 consecutive days of eDiary with an average of &lt; 3 SBM per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Baseline: After the run-in period, the subjects will return and eligibility will be&#xD;
      re-assessed. Subjects will be randomized to either Vibrant or Vibrant placebo for a treatment&#xD;
      period of 8 weeks. Subjects, in both arms, will have their first administration of Vibrant&#xD;
      capsule / Vibrant placebo on site at the day of baseline visit and will be instructed on&#xD;
      their treatment administration at home and will be requested to ingest the capsules at a&#xD;
      specific time of the day. At baseline, subjects will also be trained on how to use the base&#xD;
      unit at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to complete a simple subject eDiary each day throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study (including the run-in period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eDiary will include questions on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily BM, SBM, CSBM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change of their diet, if applicable (NOTE: the protocol will not ask/require the&#xD;
           subjects to change anything in his/her diet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in sympotms as: brisol stool consistancy, straining, bloating, and the other&#xD;
           questions in the eDiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AE (including diarhrea)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 2 weeks of treatment will be considered as a subjects' training period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 -after 4 weeks of treatment - an on site visit will take place to evaluate subject's&#xD;
      safety and treatment efficacy and additional capsule dispencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 Final visit -after another 4 weeks of treatment - an on site visit will take place to&#xD;
      evaluate subject's safety and treatment efficacy and collect the base unites and remaning&#xD;
      capsules. PAC-QOL, Ease of use and TSQM questionnaires will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the entire study period, data reporting will be done on an electronic Case Report Form&#xD;
      (eCRF) and an eDiary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement to relieve their&#xD;
      constipation, during the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive phone calls at least once a week and subject compliance will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the 8 weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be authorized to use rescue medication after 3 consecutive days without a bowel&#xD;
      movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about time of activation of the capsules will be automatically registered and&#xD;
      transmitted by the base unit for Vibrant capsules&#xD;
