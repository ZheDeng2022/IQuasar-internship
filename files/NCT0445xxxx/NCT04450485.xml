  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, due to the demands to improve life and health conditions of osteoarthritis&#xD;
      patients, more effective surgical treatment methods are needed to obtain satisfactory results&#xD;
      when performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Fast-track surgical protocols are evidence&#xD;
      based multidisciplinary approaches targeted on multimodal patient care and primarily focused&#xD;
      on enhancing rapid functional recovery of the patients. These protocols recommend use of&#xD;
      minimal invasive approaches for TKA patients to enhance rapid recovery. Although studies in&#xD;
      the literature has been reported similar results in medial para-patellar approach (MPP) and&#xD;
      minimal invasive approaches in long terms, better surgical outcomes in short term in favor of&#xD;
      minimal invasive approaches also encouraged fast-track protocol builders to prefer minimal&#xD;
      invasive approaches. However, this recommendation is not evidence based and there is no study&#xD;
      comparing surgical outcomes between minimal invasive approaches and MPP approach in terms of&#xD;
      pain, length of hospital stays and functional recovery in fast-track TKA patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      we aimed to compare the effects of mini mid-vastus (MMV) and MPP approaches on postoperative&#xD;
      clinical results (pain, quality of life, functional outcome, and length of hospital stay) in&#xD;
      fast-track TKA patients, and to decide whether any additional achievements are obtained with&#xD;
      MMV approach in this patient group.&#xD;

      Nowadays, due to the demands to improve life and health conditions of OA patients, more&#xD;
      effective surgical treatment methods are needed to obtain satisfactory results when&#xD;
      performing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Fast-track surgical protocols are evidence based&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approaches targeted on multimodal patient care and primarily focused on&#xD;
      enhancing rapid functional recovery of the patients. These protocols include patient&#xD;
      education to cope with anxiety and stress of surgery, nutritional planning and avoidance of&#xD;
      long hours of fasting, preemptive analgesia, avoidance of tourniquet use, rational antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis, local infiltration anesthesia, and early physical therapy modalities. The&#xD;
      ultimate aims of assembling these surgical protocols are to decrease mortality and morbidity,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, and eventually hospital costs while obtaining maximum patient&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical approaches when performing TKA operations includes standard medial parapatellar&#xD;
      (MPP) approach and minimal invasive approaches such as mini midvastus (MMV) and subvastus&#xD;
      (SV) approaches. Possible advantages of not performing quadriceps tendon splitting in MV&#xD;
      surgical approach (such as less pain, earlier functional recovery, enhanced quadriceps muscle&#xD;
      strength, and better ROM) convinced surgeons to prefer minimal invasive approaches to MPP&#xD;
      approach when performing rapid recovery protocols in TKA patients. In addition, better&#xD;
      surgical outcomes with traditional protocols in short term reports in favor of minimal&#xD;
      invasive approaches also encouraged fast-track protocol builders to prefer minimal invasive&#xD;
      approaches. However, these recommendations are not evidence based and, to our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is no study comparing surgical outcomes between minimal invasive approaches and MPP&#xD;
      approach in terms of pain, length of hospital stay and functional recovery in fast-track TKA&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of MMV and MPP approaches on&#xD;
      postoperative clinical results (pain, quality of life, functional outcome, and length of&#xD;
      hospital stay) in fast-track TKA patients, and to decide whether any additional achievements&#xD;
      are obtained with MMV approach in this patient group. Our secondary outcome measures were&#xD;
      length of operation time, blood loss and postoperative component alignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and demographic variables of the participants were recorded and patients were&#xD;
      evaluated preoperatively, at postoperative fourth and twelfth week by a blinded observer.&#xD;
      Knee range of motion was assessed with digital goniometer (HALO Medical Devices, Australia);&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle strength was measured (unit=newton(N)) with hand-held dynamometer&#xD;
      (Commander Muscle Tester, J Tech, USA); The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was used to&#xD;
      determine patient-reported activity limitations; 30-sec chair-stand test and stair-climb test&#xD;
      were performed for performance-based activity limitations; Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used for&#xD;
      quality of life evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alignment analysis Long leg radiographs of the patients were evaluated preoperatively and&#xD;
      postoperatively by using a digital orthopedic templating software-Materialise OrthoView&#xD;
      (OrthoView version 7, Materialise HQ, Technologielaan 15 3001 Leuven, Belgium).&#xD;
      Hip-knee-ankle angles (HKA), femorotibial angles, lateral proximal femoral angles (LPFA),&#xD;
      lateral distal femoral angles (LDFA), medial proximal tibial angles (MPTA), lateral distal&#xD;
      tibial angles (LDTA), tibial posterior slope angles were all measured and recorded by a&#xD;
      blinded observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative patient education classes All the patients were received preoperative&#xD;
      informative classes about TKA procedure, nutritional and nursing support, physical therapy&#xD;
      and rehabilitation applications. Booklets concerning all these classes were also handed out&#xD;
      to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia Protocol Excluding diabetics, all the patients were received oral carbohydrate&#xD;
      (%12.5 carbohydrate liquid solution-Fantomalt, Nutricia) loading on the night before the&#xD;
      operation (between 19:00 and 23:00) and 2 hours before the operation. Solid foods were&#xD;
      allowed up to 6 hours before the operation and liquids allowed up to 2 hours preoperatively.&#xD;
      Early oral feeding was started at 4 to 6 hours postoperatively for all patients. Intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam 1-2 mg and fentanyl 50-100 μg were applied to all patients 30-45 minutes&#xD;
      preoperatively. Except 12 patients, all patients received spinal anesthesia. Seven patients&#xD;
      due to previous lumber fusion and 5 patients due to personal preference were received general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique All the operations were performed by the same surgeon using the same brand&#xD;
      and type of prosthesis. MPP and MMV approaches were performed as described in the literature.&#xD;
      All the patients received posterior stabilized fixed bearing TKA (NexGen Legacy® Posterior&#xD;
      Stabilized Knee-Fixed Bearing, Zimmer-Biomet Inc., Warsaw, Indiana 46580, ABD), and high&#xD;
      viscosity polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement (Oliga-G21 srl-Vias. Pertini, 8-41039&#xD;
      San Posidonia (MO)-Italy). All the operations were performed without using tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local infiltration anesthesia (LIA) (20 cc bupivacaine hydrochloride, 1 gr fentanyl, 1 gr&#xD;
      cefazolin sodium, 0.3 ml epinephrine, and dilute volume of physiologic serum (%0,9 NaCl) to&#xD;
      50 cc) to posterior capsule just before the application of permanent implants, and to&#xD;
      anterior capsule, prepatellar fat pad and peri ligamentous nociceptive receptors following&#xD;
      consolidation of bone cement was injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One gram of tranexamic acid was injected intravenously (iv) at least 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      incision, 1 gr diluted to 30 cc by physiologic serum (%0,9 NaCl) was given intraarticularly&#xD;
      following the closure of the wound, and another 1 gr was infused 2 hours after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative and postoperative analgesia protocol For preemptive analgesia, paracetamol 500&#xD;
      mg tablets were prescribed 3 times 2 tablets per day beginning from 3 days before the&#xD;
      operation. One gram of iv infusion of paracetamol was given just after the operation in&#xD;
      postoperative care unit and continued as 3 times 1gr iv infusion. First line rescue analgesic&#xD;
      was intramuscular 75 mg diclofenac sodium and second line analgesic was iv 100 mg tramadol&#xD;
      hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic and thrombosis prophylaxis protocol One gr of cefazolin sodium iv was applied 30&#xD;
      minutes before the incision as antibiotic prophylaxis. Low molecular weight&#xD;
      heparin-enoxaparin sodium 4000 iu/0.8 ml/day was used subcutaneously as thromboembolic&#xD;
      prophylaxis starting at the 6-8 hours postoperatively and continued for 20 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation protocol and discharge criteria The patients were mobilized at the 4th hour&#xD;
      following surgery and standard physiotherapy program was scheduled during hospitalization&#xD;
      (cold-pack -once in every 2 hours for 15 minutes, ankle pump exercises, quadriceps isometric&#xD;
      exercises, active assisted heel slide exercises in bed and knee flexion exercises in sitting&#xD;
      position/3 sets×10 repeats). The patients were evaluated regularly every two hours during&#xD;
      postoperative period and those fulfilling discharge criteria were released from the hospital&#xD;
      and length of hospital stay was recorded for every patient. The standard discharge criteria&#xD;
      were as follows: VAS score at rest &lt;3, VAS score during mobilization &lt;5, able to get dressed&#xD;
      independently, able to get in and out of bed, able to sit and rise from a chair/toilet seat,&#xD;
      independence in personal care, mobilization with walker/crutches, able to walk &gt;70 meters&#xD;
      without risk of fall with walking aid, no incision problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discharged patients were instructed for a standard home-based exercise program. Patients&#xD;
      were also asked to visit the ward at a biweekly interval for the update of the exercise&#xD;
      program for the first 8 weeks. 15-40 minutes of walking exercises were also prescribed for 5&#xD;
      days/week between 9th and 12th weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Priori power analysis concerning quadriceps muscle strength showed that&#xD;
      at an effect size of d=0.7, 52 patients are needed (26 patients for each group) to obtain 80&#xD;
      % power (1-beta=0.80) with 95 % confidence interval (alpha=0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data was analyzed using SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for&#xD;
      Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) package program. Continuous variables were&#xD;
      given as mean ± standard deviation, median (minimum and maximum) and categorical variable&#xD;
      values were presented as absolute numbers and percentages. The conformity of continuous&#xD;
      variables with normal distribution was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Independent&#xD;
      Samples t-test for parametric test assumptions and Mann-Whitney U Test for non-parametric&#xD;
      test assumptions were used for comparison of the groups. One-way repeated-measure ANOVA was&#xD;
      used to compare the normally distributed data from the parameters repeatedly measured in the&#xD;
      inner-group analysis, and Friedman analysis of variance was performed for the remaining data&#xD;
      set. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
