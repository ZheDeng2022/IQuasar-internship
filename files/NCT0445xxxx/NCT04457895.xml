  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As much as 50% of patients treated with hormonotherapy (HT) for breast cancer (BC) suffer&#xD;
      from osteoarticular pain during treatment. Secondary effects have become a real issue because&#xD;
      of their consequences on the patients' quality of life, but also on treatment efficacy and&#xD;
      survival when they induce dose reduction or premature withdrawal of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional medicines (acupuncture, hypnosis, yoga) have become more and more popular these&#xD;
      last years. 48 to 80% of patients with BC eventually choose them. A review comparing efficacy&#xD;
      of various therapies to decrease osteoarticular pain concludes to a highest efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatments, paracetamol and yoga.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It thus appears innovative to complete this care with a patient educational project (PEP) in&#xD;
      postural yoga instructed by a trained physical therapist, which will enable patients to&#xD;
      practice yoga postures at home by themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a pilot study &quot;SKYPE&quot; with 24 algic patients treated with HT&#xD;
      after BC, whose results are very promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose in the continuity of the pilot study a multicenter randomized&#xD;
      controlled study comparing the efficacy of SKYPE care on pain reduction, an educative care&#xD;
      combining physical therapy and yoga, to a control group in patients treated with HT for a BC&#xD;
      with osteoarticular and/or musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in order to examine whether yoga interventions may influence inflammation&#xD;
      through their effects on the level of a wide range of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      (30), the investigators will Change in circulating cytokines' level between baseline level&#xD;
      (T0) and post-treatment level (T2) in both groups will be analyzed and if so correlation will&#xD;
      be established.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous initiatives have started in France, often associative. It is essential to evaluate&#xD;
      in a rigorous manner, these therapies before making them part of the patient's care pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yoga has shown a real benefit in terms of pain reduction in patients with BC treated with HT.&#xD;
      These osteoarticular pains are the secondary effect on which a physical therapeutic care can&#xD;
      have a real benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It thus appears innovative to complete this care with a therapeutic education program (TEP)&#xD;
      in postural yoga which will enable patients to practice yoga postures at home by themselves.&#xD;
      Yoga allows a large adaptation to pains expressed by each patient. It will favor the&#xD;
      development of the feeling of control that they have in particular on their pain.&#xD;
      participants will so improve the self-efficacy, the quality of life, and will reduce their&#xD;
      fatigue and their pain. The patients involved have already lived major body transformations&#xD;
      because of the disease and treatments. Yoga will help them put their lives together again,&#xD;
      both physically and psychologically, and reclaim their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown the short-term effects of yoga practice on anxiety, stress, pain and&#xD;
      quality of life. Few rare studies have suggested that patients could add yoga practice at&#xD;
      home to the supervised sessions, but these studies lacked therapeutic patient education. To&#xD;
      date, to our knowledge, no data on the effect of the realization of yoga postures at home on&#xD;
      increase of the patients' self-competency feeling are available in France. Also, the&#xD;
      long-term effects of such programs need to be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM) has set-up 8 years ago yoga sessions for women with&#xD;
      breast cancer, together with an association located in Montpellier.&#xD;
