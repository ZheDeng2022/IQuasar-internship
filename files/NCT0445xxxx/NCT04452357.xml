  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard chemoradiation, followed by surgery are standard treatment plan for patients&#xD;
      suffering from pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Due to damage to the surrounding healthy tissue&#xD;
      caused by standard radiation, this study uses a new type of radiation plan- pulsed low-dose&#xD;
      rate (PLDR) radiation , in combination with chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, given weekly&#xD;
      along with the radiation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation, combined with radiosensitizing chemotherapies, is often used preoperatively for&#xD;
      borderline resectable cases with the intent of facilitating a curative surgical intervention.&#xD;
      This includes providing margin adjacent to un-resectable vessels and sterilizing regional&#xD;
      lymph nodes. Unfortunately, due to the radiosensitivity of adjacent small bowel and stomach,&#xD;
      the total dose of radiation used is modest due to the risk of toxicities associated with&#xD;
      higher doses. Pulsed low-dose-rate (PLDR) radiation improves the safety of radiation through&#xD;
      breaking it up into small pulses. This increases the repair of DNA damage in normal tissues&#xD;
      while remaining effective in cancer cells. Multiple prior studies have shown PLDR to be safe&#xD;
      in the setting of re-irradiation, where additional radiation with conventional techniques is&#xD;
      associated with severe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLDR radiation will be given in 2 doses to 6 patients at each dose level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose level 1: 56 Gy- given over 6 weeks Dose level 2: 66 Gy- given over 7 weeks Standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine, will be administered once a week for the duration of&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment will be followed by standard surgery to remove the cancer after consultation&#xD;
      with a surgeon.&#xD;
