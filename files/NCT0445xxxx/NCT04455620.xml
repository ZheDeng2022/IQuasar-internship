  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter Phase I/IIa dose escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) trial of BNT151 with expansion cohorts in various solid tumor&#xD;
      indications. The trial consists of Part 1, Part 2A and Part 2B with adaptive design elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1) of this clinical trial will enroll patients with&#xD;
      various solid tumors that are metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable for whom there is no&#xD;
      available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, or patients who are not&#xD;
      candidates for such available therapy. During combination dose escalation (Part 2A), patients&#xD;
      of different specific solid tumors (one cohort per indication) will be enrolled and treated&#xD;
      with a combination of BNT151 and the respective standard of care (SoC) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2B is the expansion phase where a predefined number of patients in each indication&#xD;
      cohort will be treated with the confirmed recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of BNT151 in&#xD;
      combination with respective SoC.&#xD;
