  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the participation of COPD patients to a workshop on&#xD;
      advance directives increases the number of patients who write them.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Disease is a common disease and should be the third leading cause of&#xD;
      death in 2020. Patient hospitalized for an exacerbation of their COPD have a median survival&#xD;
      of 2 years and 50% risk of being rehospitalized within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD patients may have symptoms that impair their life quality significantly and sometimes&#xD;
      more than patients with cancer. This is particularly the case for dyspnea, which is&#xD;
      frequently present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, Investigators propose the setting up of health workshop on advance directives.&#xD;
      This workshop is for sever or very severe COPD patients during their hospital stay in the&#xD;
      post-acute care and pulmonary rehabilitation service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this unit, investigators welcome patient from all the region of Ile de France for a&#xD;
      hospital stay of approximately 6 weeks. A first workshop will take place during the third&#xD;
      week of their care to inform them about COPD, exacerbations, prognostic and advance&#xD;
      directives. Then, a personal interview with patients who have participated to this workshop&#xD;
      will take place to collect their advance directives and their degree of satisfaction about&#xD;
      this process.&#xD;
