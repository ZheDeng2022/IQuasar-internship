      The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a single training session in&#xD;
      communication skills at improving patients' perceptions of physiotherapy consultations.&#xD;

      Population: Physiotherapists Detail: Physiotherapists (n=30) who work at 'Clalit' institute's&#xD;
      (public health management organization in Israel) at four physiotherapy clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A single session of training in consultation-based communication skills Detail:&#xD;
      a 3-hour communication skill workshop, followed by a month-long period to assimilate and&#xD;
      implement the new set of skills, with supervision available by phone from the trainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: No training Detail: The control group receives no extra training. Outcome: New&#xD;
      patients' perception of consultations Detail: The Primary Outcome Measure is the&#xD;
      Consultation-Based Reassurance Questionnaire (CRQ) The CRQ measures patients' perceptions of&#xD;
      consultation. It consists of four subscales, each with three items: data-gathering,&#xD;
      relationship-building, generic reassurance, and cognitive reassurance. The investigators are&#xD;
      assessing change between two-time points (before and after the intervention). And also, the&#xD;
      difference between study groups. This is collected twice: at baseline, and at follow up, from&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Question: therapy Detail: The study tests whether a single training sessions can&#xD;
      improve communication in consultations with physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Study: RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detail: Stage 1: Pre-randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapists (n=30) will hand out a Consultation-Based Reassurance Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CRQ) in a sealed envelope to each eligible patient (age 18+) they receive for the first&#xD;
      consultation in two weeks period. The patient will complete the questionnaire in private,&#xD;
      post consultation, and place it in a closed box. The physiotherapist will recruit a minimum&#xD;
      of five patients each (n&gt;150).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures are: age, gender, pain area, chronicity, pain severity, disability,&#xD;
      satisfaction from the consultation and the Consultation-Based Reassurance Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process for randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, participating physiotherapists will be matched for gender, seniority, and quality of&#xD;
      reassurance in every clinic. They will then be allocated into one of the two arms at random&#xD;
      (1:1), according to a computer random number list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3: Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, both the intervention and control groups will again hand out the&#xD;
      questionnaires (age, gender, pain area, chronicity, pain severity, disability, satisfaction&#xD;
      from the consultation and the CRQ) to new eligible patients that arrive for the first&#xD;
      consultation. The physiotherapist will recruit a minimum of ten patients each (total sample&#xD;
      therefore n&gt; 300, minimum number per arm=150).&#xD;
&#xD;
      sample size The sample size was calculated with G*Power 3.1.9.4 using the t-test family to&#xD;
      detect the difference between two independent means (two groups). The input parameters were&#xD;
      as follows: for a two-tailed test, assuming a medium effect size of 0.5, α=0.05, and β=0.95,&#xD;
      the total sample size recommended was 210 participants. One hundred five participants in each&#xD;
      study group (intervention and control).&#xD;
