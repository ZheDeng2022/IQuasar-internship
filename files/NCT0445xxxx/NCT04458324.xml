  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past ten years, the Cardiovascular Research Laboratory at Spaulding has refined a&#xD;
      unique form of exercise for those with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Functional Electrical&#xD;
      Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg&#xD;
      exercise, resulting in the benefits of large muscle mass exercise. However, despite the&#xD;
      potential for enhancing aerobic capacity by training the denervated leg skeletal muscle via&#xD;
      hybrid FES exercise, the inability to increase ventilation beyond limits set by high level&#xD;
      SCI restricts aerobic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will investigate two potential methods of improving ventilation in those&#xD;
      with high-level SCI through a double-blind randomized trial. One method is non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV), which is an external breathing support machine. The second method is the&#xD;
      use of Buspar, a drug, which has been used to treat respiratory dysfunction after SCI in rats&#xD;
      and some human case reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will engage in a 6-month FES row training program while receiving&#xD;
      either NIV or shamNIV and Buspar or placebo, and under study tests to evaluate&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary health and fitness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular aerobic exercise with sufficient intensity can improve overall health, however daily&#xD;
      energy expenditure is low in those with SCI, especially in those with high level lesions. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed Functional Electrical Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) that&#xD;
      couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, increasing the active muscle&#xD;
      and resulting in benefits of large muscle mass exercise. Despite the potential for enhancing&#xD;
      aerobic capacity, those with high level lesions (T3 and above) have a remaining obstacle to&#xD;
      attaining higher work capacities: a level of pulmonary muscle denervation. The investigators&#xD;
      preliminary work suggests this limits the aerobic capacity that can be achieved with FESRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External ventilatory support could improve the ability to exercise train and hence enhance&#xD;
      the adaptations to chronic exercise in high level SCI. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) during&#xD;
      exercise training has been shown to improve gains in exercise capacity in those with&#xD;
      similarly restrictive breathing. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the use of NIV&#xD;
      during FESRT will reduce ventilatory limits to exercise, leading to increased aerobic&#xD;
      capacity in high level SCI. In addition, pharmacologic treatments may augment respiratory&#xD;
      control and improve exercise ventilatory responses. Buspirone can reverse respiratory&#xD;
      abnormalities consequent to SCI in rats, and humans case reports suggest successful Buspirone&#xD;
      treatment of respiratory dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators propose a double-blind 2x2 trial of 6 months of FESRT with NIV&#xD;
      or Sham and Buspirone or Placebo in individuals with acute, high-level SCI. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that both NIV and Buspirone will improve ventilatory exercise responses and that&#xD;
      combined treatment will have the greatest effect. This will result in greater improvements in&#xD;
      aerobic capacity and concomitant increases in pulmonary function and reductions in&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk. This work proposes two approaches to overcome ventilatory limitations&#xD;
      to exercise in high level SCI and allow for greater improvements in cardiopulmonary capacity&#xD;
      - one that overcomes mechanical limitations of paralyzed pulmonary musculature and one that&#xD;
      treats loss of serotonergic respiratory control, both of which may contribute to blunted&#xD;
      ventilatory responses. The ultimate purpose of this research is to optimize exercise for a&#xD;
      population that both needs and seeks the broad range of benefits that exercise can confer.&#xD;
