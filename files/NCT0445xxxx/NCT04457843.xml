  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up tp now, disease activity of COPD patients in their home environment has usually been&#xD;
      recorded by questionnaires (e.g. COPD assessment test). Digital multifactorial measurements,&#xD;
      via the &quot;mobile COPD Status test&quot; app, offer a new way of displaying disease activity.&#xD;
      However, there is no independent study that has examined whether digitally collected&#xD;
      parameters correlate with the common used measurement instruments for COPD patients (both in&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal course).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the correlation between the mobile COPD&#xD;
      Status test (mCST App, KAIA Health) and a conventional collected clinical data set of routine&#xD;
      measurements as well as the subjective symptoms and activity perception of COPD patients in&#xD;
      their home environment, with and without exacerbation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 130 COPD patients will be included prospectively in this multicenter trial during an&#xD;
      inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program at the Schoen Klinik Berchtesgadener Land, Schönau&#xD;
      am Koenigssee, (Germany) or during a stay (inpatient or outpatient) at the Klinikum Nuremberg&#xD;
      (Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the study is divided into two parts - study part I, within the duration of the&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program/ hospital stay and study part II, in the home environment&#xD;
      (24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (day 0, in the clinic) + Visit 2* (day 14+/-5, in the clinic/outpatient)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study participant is given a smartphone. Under the guidance of study personnel, data&#xD;
      collection of the following parameters is carried out via KAIA mCST App):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  four standardized questions regarding coughing frequency, expectoration, chest tightness&#xD;
           and shortness of breath during exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyspnea at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath sounds via microphone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inspiration/expiration length via microphone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate via smartphone measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical performance via the sit-to-stand test (1min) with counting the repetitions and&#xD;
           checking the correct execution via smartphone camera&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gait analysis (2x 10 steps walking) via acceleration sensors of the smartphone or via&#xD;
           motion tracking by camera during defined gait measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mCST app takes about 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, clinical routine data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body plethysmography &amp; blood gases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  health related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-minute walk distance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-minute-sit to stand test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study part II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 to 26 (week 3 to 26, in participants home environment) From study visit 3 on,&#xD;
      participants are observed weekly in their home environment for a total of 24 weeks. No&#xD;
      further clinic visits take place. Disease activity is measured weekly as patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes using the mCST app (for details see description of visit 1/2, part 1). In addition&#xD;
      to the weekly mCST app, patients are invited to fill out daily a symptom diary before going&#xD;
      to bed. The symptom diary contains the EXACT questionnaire and an activity questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Visit 2 is optional&#xD;
