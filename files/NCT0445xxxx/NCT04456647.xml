  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) treatment in patients with incurable cancer is understudied and the&#xD;
      level of evidence for clinical meaningful effects is weak. The ESPEN guidelines give few&#xD;
      specific recommendations regarding which patients with incurable cancer that should be&#xD;
      offered PN treatment. According to the Norwegian prescription database, the use of parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition has more than doubled in the period 2004-2015. These numbers do not separate&#xD;
      between diagnoses and medical conditions, so the current use of medical nutrition in cancer&#xD;
      patients in Norway is not known. The decision to initiate parenteral nutrition is taken at&#xD;
      hospitals, whereupon the patient returns home to their respective municipalities and receives&#xD;
      follow-up by the home care service. There are often uncertainties about the duration of&#xD;
      treatment, as patients' clinical condition can change rapidly. One major challenge health&#xD;
      care professionals face is to decide when to end medical nutrition therapy. Patients and&#xD;
      relatives may experience fear that discontinuation of medical nutrition accelerates death,&#xD;
      while health care professionals often experience that nutrition in many cases does not help&#xD;
      and inflicts negatively on patients' condition. This makes communication concerning end of&#xD;
      nutritional treatment between health care professionals at several health care levels,&#xD;
      patients and their relatives challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for a stronger evidence base considering the effect of medical nutrition in&#xD;
      patients with incurable cancer. To be able to study the effect of PN treatment, more studies&#xD;
      on clinical practice of PN treatment to patients with incurable cancer is needed. Aspects&#xD;
      like indication for use, dosage and duration of PN treatment is poorly described in the&#xD;
      available literature. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe indications for use of PN,&#xD;
      duration of treatment, reasons for discontinuation, method of administration, possible&#xD;
      benefits and complications as well as survival.&#xD;

        This retrospective medical record review includes adult patients with incurable cancer who&#xD;
        received parenteral nutrition treatment in palliative care in the time period, January 2011&#xD;
        to December 2017. Only patients who were deceased at point of data abstraction are&#xD;
        included.&#xD;
