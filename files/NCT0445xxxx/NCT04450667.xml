      Study of the impact of preoperative oral rehydration on the incidence of spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia-induced hypotension for scheduled cesarean section.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      What is already known ? Arterial hypotension is one of the most common complications&#xD;
      following spinal anesthesia (60%). Several measures have been studied to prevent this&#xD;
      hypotension, such as intravenous vascular filling (preloading, coloading), using different&#xD;
      filling fluids (colloids vs crystalloids), preventive administration of vasopressors,&#xD;
      reduction of doses and volumes administered in spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study has evaluated the impact of oral rehydration on hypotension after spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigatord wish to demonstrate that an oral rehydration 2 hours before surgery,&#xD;
      reduces by 50% the incidence of hypotension and / or the use of vasopressors, after spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decrease in the incidence of hypotension and / or use of vasopressor agents by 50% in the&#xD;
      &quot;rehydration&quot; group compared to the &quot;fasting&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced incidence of nausea / vomiting side effects, effect on umbilical pH, APGAR score,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional clinical study. Monocentric, single-blind, randomized, single-blind,&#xD;
      controlled trial with 2 groups of 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ≥ 18 years old Scheduled for a scheduled cesarean, under spinal anesthesia Signature&#xD;
      of informed consent Single pregnancy of ≥ 36 weeks 150 cm &lt;height &lt;180 cm 50 kg &lt;weight &lt;100&#xD;
      kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's refusal Contraindication to spinal anesthesia Allergy to a product used for&#xD;
      anesthesia Age &lt; 18 Known or pregnancy-related hypertension Gestational diabetes with insulin&#xD;
      or pre-existing diabetes with insulin Total language barrier without possibility of&#xD;
      translation ASA ≥ 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to show that oral rehydration 2 hours before the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia reduces the incidence of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that the oral intake of 400 ml of clear liquids (in the form of a&#xD;
      standardized carbohydrate solution, NutriciaPreop®) would reduce the hypovolemia related to&#xD;
      the preoperative fasting period, and thus reduce the risk of hypotension following the&#xD;
      installation of the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decrease the incidence of maternal hypotension and / or the use of vasoactive agents in the&#xD;
      &quot;rehydration&quot; group by 50%. The blood pressure will be measured by pneumatic cuff, on the&#xD;
      arm, once per minute from the entrance to the operating room until the umbilical cord is&#xD;
      clamped, then once every 5 minutes until the end of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the incidence and severity of nausea / vomiting, umbilical pH, APGAR score, patient&#xD;
      comfort (using a visual analog scale graduated from 1 to 10, as well as a satisfaction score&#xD;
      of 1 at 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective interventional, single-blind, unicentric, randomized controlled study&#xD;
      comprising 2 arms of 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An &quot;oral rehydration&quot; arm in which patients will receive 400ml NutriciaPreop to drink 2 hours&#xD;
      before anesthesia, and an &quot;fasting&quot; arm in which patients will be fasting since midnight the&#xD;
      day before the intervention. As part of the study, the NutriciaPreop solution is provided&#xD;
      free to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study Including 1 patient per working day, the study will last 6 months. We&#xD;
      are considering to set the duration of the study at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods After recruitment at the anesthesia consultation and signing of the&#xD;
      consent, the randomization is carried out by a member of the medical team not involved in the&#xD;
      planned cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is done by a sealed, opaque envelope containing the group and the instructions&#xD;
      which will be sent to the midwives of the patient's hospital unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Rehydration&quot; arm: 2 boxes of 200 ml Nutricia PreOp to drink 2 hours before anesthesia&#xD;
      &quot;Fasting&quot; arm: patient fasting since midnight the day before the intervention Identical&#xD;
      premedication in the 2 groups: metoclopramide 10mg + ranitidine 50 mg in 50 ml of 0.9% NaCl&#xD;
      IV, as well as 30 ml of sodium citrate per os, on call in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be equipped with 18G venous catheters with obturators to avoid receiving any&#xD;
      maintenance fluid before anesthesia (except premedication) Upon arrival in the operating&#xD;
      room, the team performs the usual safety checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient monitoring with ECG scope, PNI cuff, Sp02 The anesthesiologist performs the&#xD;
      standardized spinal anesthesia: 2.2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% + 0.5 ml of sufentanil&#xD;
      concentration 5 micrograms / ml + 100 microgram of morphine (0.1 ml), for a total volume of&#xD;
      2.8 ml, injected in 30-60 seconds, after reflux of CSF into the L3 / L4 space, previously&#xD;
      identified by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the injection, the anesthesiologist's assistant loads the venous catheter&#xD;
      with a coloading of 10 ml / kg (ideal weight) of a Hartmann solution (crystalloid balance&#xD;
      containing lactate), then maintenance of 1 ml / kg / h until the umbilical cord is clamped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the spinal anesthesia, the patient is placed in a seated position, legs hanging. After&#xD;
      this has been done, patient is placed in supine position, except for those with a body mass&#xD;
      index greater than 35 kG / m2, which are placed in the &quot;beach chair&quot; position. Patients with&#xD;
      a BMI≥35 are installed on a &quot;troop elevation pillow&quot;. In all cases a tilt of 10 ° to the left&#xD;
      will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurement per minute on the cuff. Sensory motor block is tested at 5 and 10&#xD;
      min with cold test (ether) and Pricktest. Finally, the surgeon tests before cutting with a&#xD;
      pair of pliers, on the incision area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension is defined by a fall of at least 20% in systolic BP compared to the reference&#xD;
      systolic BP and / or the need to use a vasoactive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correction of any decrease in systolic BP by boli of 6 micrograms of Noradrenaline in IVD.&#xD;
      Possibility of using another vasoactive drug depending on the clinical situation (choice of&#xD;
      responsible anesthesiologist) The analysis will be performed until the umbilical cord is&#xD;
      clamped, then, the anesthesiologist wiil follow the standard cesarean management protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The umbilical pH as well as the APGAR score of the newborn will be noted. The patient's&#xD;
      nausea / vomiting episodes will also be scored and graded on a scale of 0 to 3 with 0 = no&#xD;
      nausea-vomiting, 1: moderate nausea not requiring treatment, 2: moderate nausea responding to&#xD;
      treatment, 3: nausea not responding to treatment or vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A digital scale for assessing patient satisfaction and well-being will be used once&#xD;
      preoperatively, after signing the consent, and once postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bloc randomization by bloc of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our incidence of 60% of hypotension, a power analysis shows that 42 patients will be&#xD;
      needed in each group in order de detect a 50% decrease in the incidence of hypotension; with&#xD;
      a power of 80% and alpha fixed at 0.05. 8 patients will be added to each group to compensate&#xD;
      for possible dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be done as &quot;intention to treat&quot;. Incidence of hypotension will be analyzed by a&#xD;
      Chi-square test and the confidence interval will be reported. Secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      analysed by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for discontinuous variable and t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney-U test for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A P value &lt; 0.05 will be considered as significant.&#xD;
