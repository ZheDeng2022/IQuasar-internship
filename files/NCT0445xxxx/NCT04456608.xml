      This study will investigate differences in platelet aggregation under basal and&#xD;
      aspirin-treated conditions in American Indian and Alaska Native people who have extreme&#xD;
      levels (low and high) of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs, EPA and DHA) in red&#xD;
      blood cell membranes. The study will also determine whether or not platelet aggregation under&#xD;
      the different conditions is modified by CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1, and ACTN1 gene&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: In this aim, the investigators will test the hypothesis that n-3 PUFAs modify&#xD;
      aspirin anti-platelet response, by measuring and comparing three different indicators of&#xD;
      aspirin response in individuals with extremely high and low RBC n-3 PUFA levels, under a&#xD;
      basal state and after 1-week of once a day aspirin treatment. The three indicators are: 1)&#xD;
      platelet TXB2 and 20-HETE concentrations; 2) platelet aggregation ex vivo (in response to&#xD;
      external stimuli); and 3) aspirin covalent adduct of COX-1. The investigators will also test&#xD;
      whether or not common variants in the CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1 and ACTN1 genes are&#xD;
      associated with basal and aspirin-induced changes in platelet aggregation and, in an&#xD;
      exploratory analysis, modify the effects of n-3 PUFAs on aspirin response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Population: Investigators from the University of Montana, Southcentral&#xD;
      Foundation and Oregon Health &amp; Science University will recruit a total of 150 individuals (50&#xD;
      at each site) to participate in the study. At each performance site, the participants&#xD;
      recruited will represent 25 individuals with high and 25 individuals with low RBC n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      concentrations. After providing written consent, each study participant will be screened for&#xD;
      medical history and clinical lab testing to ensure good health and good liver, kidney and&#xD;
      blood test parameters. If found to be eligible, each participant will provide 12-hour fasted&#xD;
      (overnight) blood samples for isolation of plasma, platelets, lymphocytes, and red blood&#xD;
      cells. A separate blood sample will be collected into a citrate treated tube for platelet&#xD;
      aggregation testing using the PFA-100 platform. Isolated blood fractions will be stored at&#xD;
      -80Â°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline sampling, each participant will be given six doses of aspirin (80 mg/day for 6&#xD;
      days) and instructed to take one dose daily at approximately 9 am. On the day after the last&#xD;
      aspirin dose, the participant will provide blood samples for repeated platelet aggregation&#xD;
      testing, platelet lipid analysis and measurement of aspirin covalent adduct to COX-1, and a&#xD;
      spot urine sample to confirm aspirin consumption by testing for salicylate. For 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to platelet aggregation testing, study participants will be asked to avoid foods that&#xD;
      could lead to spurious test results (eg, chocolate, tea, coffee, cola, red wine, beer,&#xD;
      tomato, grapes, grape juice, orange and cranberry juices, as well as traditional wild foods&#xD;
      that include berries, plant roots, plant greens etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical Methods: Whole blood, point of care, platelet aggregation testing will be&#xD;
      performed using the automated PFA-100 instrument. Performance by research personnel will be&#xD;
      compared head-head to clinical testing services at each site, as a quality control measure.&#xD;
      In each test setting, the investigators will obtain results in duplicate for both&#xD;
      collagen/epinephrine and collagen/ADP cartridges. The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      platelet TXB2, 20-HETE and AA concentrations, by LC-MS/MS. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will develop and employ a method to quantify theaspirin covalent adduct of COX-1 in isolated&#xD;
      platelets from study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: For each study population, and subgroups with extreme RBC n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      phenotypes, the investigators will use linear regression models with robust standard errors&#xD;
      to identify significant differences in the mean absolute platelet aggregation test results&#xD;
      under basal and aspirin-treated conditions (primary outcome), as well as the&#xD;
      post-treatment-to-baseline change in platelet aggregation. Heterogeneity between pairs of&#xD;
      extreme phenotypes subgroups will be accounted for by including sex, age, BMI and platelet&#xD;
      count as covariates in the regression model. Sample size calculation for each performance&#xD;
      site (n = 25 per n-3 PUFA subgroup) was based on having power of at least 0.8 for detecting a&#xD;
      difference in mean platelet aggregation between the two extreme (0-10 and 90-100 percentiles)&#xD;
      n-3 PUFA subgroups under basal conditions, at a significance level of 0.05. As a secondary&#xD;
      level of analysis, for each subgroup of the extreme RBC n-3 PUFA phenotypes, the&#xD;
      investigators will also compare mean platelet TXB2 and 20-HETE concentrations under basal and&#xD;
      aspirin-treated conditions, as well as the post-treatment-to-baseline change. Finally, a&#xD;
      third level of analysis will involve testing each study population for a difference in the&#xD;
      extent of aspirin adduct to COX-1 between groups with extreme RBC n-3 PUFA phenotypes. The&#xD;
      investigators will test for associations between platelet aggregation test results and&#xD;
      biochemical measures of platelet activation, each study population separately and in&#xD;
      aggregate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use linear regression models to test for an association between common&#xD;
      CYP4A11,CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1 and ACTN1 genotypes and the mean absolute platelet aggregation&#xD;
      test results under basal and aspirin-treated conditions, as well as the&#xD;
      post-treatment-to-baseline change in platelet aggregation. In an exploratory analysis, the&#xD;
      investigators will apply Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models to the combined pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment dataset to test for associations with n-3 PUFAs group and drug effects, as&#xD;
      well as to identify any modifications of those effects by CYP4A11, CYP4F2, CYP4F11, PEAR1 and&#xD;
      ACTN1 variation by including and testing for significant interaction effects in the models.&#xD;
      The investigators will include random effects in the LME to account for potential&#xD;
      heterogeneity in each of the populations.&#xD;
