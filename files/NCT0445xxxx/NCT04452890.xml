    <textblock>
      The choice of the best surgical technique for urethral stricture repair depends on the&#xD;
      stricture length. Estimating the length of urethral strictures is therefore of utmost&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different clinical studies have proven that SUG has a higher sensitivity to evaluate the&#xD;
      length of urethral strictures compared to RUG or VCUG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of using SUG as single pre-operative&#xD;
      assessment tool in patients with suspicion of anterior urethral strictures. In this way, use&#xD;
      of RUG and/or VCUG could be omitted in the pre-operative work-up of patients with anterior&#xD;
      urethral strictures, thereby avoiding significant radiation load of patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urethral stricture disease (USD) is a medical condition in which a narrowing of the urethral&#xD;
      lumen occurs due to pathological fibrosis and cicatrix formation of the urethral mucosa and&#xD;
      surrounding spongious tissue (spongiofibrosis). Urethral strictures may occur at any location&#xD;
      from the bladder neck to the external urethral meatus and are categorized based on their&#xD;
      localisation in anterior strictures (including the urethral meatus, penile urethra and bulbar&#xD;
      urethra) and posterior strictures (including the prostatic urethra and membranous urethra).&#xD;
      USD is a disease of all ages but the prevalence increases with increasing age since the&#xD;
      cumulative risk of having had urethral instrumentation equally increases. All processes that&#xD;
      cause urethral trauma may provoke USD. The majority of strictures nowadays is idiopathic or&#xD;
      caused by iatrogenic trauma of the urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological narrowing of the urethral lumen can lead to a wide variety of symptoms which&#xD;
      ask for specific diagnostic investigations, in which imaging of the urethra plays a central&#xD;
      role. Retrograde urethrography (RUG) and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) are considered to&#xD;
      be the gold standard diagnostic investigation techniques for diagnosis of USD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both techniques, contrast is instilled in the urethra through the urethral meatus and&#xD;
      radiographic imaging is used to visualize the urethra. RUG and VCUG offer the possibility to&#xD;
      visualize the urethra completely and to evaluate the number, length and location of urethral&#xD;
      strictures. On the other hand, these techniques have some crucial disadvantages. First and&#xD;
      foremost, the radiation load of the genitopelvic region in often young patients is inevitable&#xD;
      in RUG and VCUG. Secondly, it is impossible to evaluate the degree of spongiofibrosis with&#xD;
      radiographic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1988, McAnnich, et al. were the first to describe sonourethrography (SUG) for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of anterior urethral strictures in males. In this technique, a Foley catheter is&#xD;
      inserted in the urethral meatus and a physiological solution is instilled in the urethra&#xD;
      while a linear 7,5 MHz ultrasound probe is placed sagitally over the course of the urethra.&#xD;
      SUG is not only able to evaluate the length and localization of a US, but it also enables the&#xD;
      investigator to evaluate the grade of spongiofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different strudies have shown that SUG has a higher sensitivity for the measurement of&#xD;
      urethral stricture length compared to classical radiographic imaging such as RUG or VCUG.&#xD;
      Since the choice of the most adequate surgical technique depends on the length of the&#xD;
      urethral stricture, correct estimation of the urethral stricture length is of the utmost&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the use of sonourethrography as&#xD;
      single diagnostic tool in the pre-operative diagnostic work-up of males with suspicion of&#xD;
      anterior urethral strictures. In this way, classic radiographic imaging such as RUG and VCUG&#xD;
      could be omitted in these patients, saving them from a significant radiation load.&#xD;
