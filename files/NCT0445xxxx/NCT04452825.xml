  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if a new psychotherapy intervention called Cancer and Aging:&#xD;
      Reflections for Elders (CARE) can effectively treat depression and distress in older cancer&#xD;
      patients. CARE is a 5-session intervention that takes place over the phone. This study will&#xD;
      compare CARE with the Social Work and Supportive Counseling (SWSC) intervention, which also&#xD;
      takes place over the phone. SWSC is a standard psychotherapeutic intervention that has been&#xD;
      shown to be a supportive and effective form of treatment for distress for patients with&#xD;
      cancer. The researchers will look at which intervention is more effective in treating&#xD;
      depression and distress in participants.&#xD;

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This 14-item scale, which has been well tested in cancer populations including elderly patients with cancer, has depression and anxiety subscales of seven items each. It is considered particularly useful for patients with chronic disease because of the absence of somatic items that often confound the determination of psychiatric problems among the medically ill.</description>

    <description>Session content and timing was developed and confirmed in our qualitative work (Expert Panel) and the CARE pilot study. Five sessions (45-60 minutes each) will be delivered over an 8-week period (+4 weeks). Following these sessions, four brief booster sessions (20-30 minutes each) will be delivered at a rate of approximately one per month to extend the interventions to 6 months (+3 months).</description>
