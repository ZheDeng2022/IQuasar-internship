  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II randomised, multicentre, prospective, open label clinical trial. The trial&#xD;
      aims to recruit patients who test positive for COVID-19 who have mild symptoms and therefore&#xD;
      can treat their symptoms in the community. Patients who test positive for COVID-19 at&#xD;
      hospital may also be able to participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is a highly&#xD;
      contagious disease with a high and unpredictable morbidity and mortality, for which there is&#xD;
      currently no specific treatment. Progression from a mild fatigue, fever and cough, to severe&#xD;
      respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation may occur 1 to 2 weeks into the disease.&#xD;
      This provides a window of opportunity in which patients in the early phase of the disease&#xD;
      could be treated with a disease-modifying agent, to halt disease progression, prevent&#xD;
      hospital admissions with respiratory failure and prevent death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camostat is a serine protease inhibitor in clinical use in Japan since 1985 to treat patients&#xD;
      with chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and has an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile. Camostat has been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into epithelial cells in vitro.&#xD;
      A trial of this repurposed drug for treatment of COVID-19 in humans is urgently required to&#xD;
      assess its impact on disease progression to respiratory failure and whether it can reduce&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will recruit up to 100 patients. Patients will be randomised into a treatment arm&#xD;
      (camostat tablets) or control arm (best supportive care). Community patients will be called&#xD;
      daily at home for 14 days by the clinical trial team to collect symptoms and record the&#xD;
      general well-being of the patient. For those patients recruited from hospital, visits will&#xD;
      continue in hospital, where feasible, until discharge when home visits will be able to&#xD;
      continue. The primary aim of this trial is to further assess the safety and toxicity profile&#xD;
      of camostat to support integration into a Phase III trial. Secondary aims are to determine if&#xD;
      camostat can reduce the clinical progression of COVID-19 and therefore the need for hospital&#xD;
      admission and supplemental oxygen as well as include collection of patient reported health&#xD;
      status, severity of symptoms and biological markers of the virus and confirm PK profile for&#xD;
      the active metabolite of camostat. As the understanding of COVID-19 develops and improves,&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria may be adapted to support the trial outcomes. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited through various settings which may include primary care 'COVID-19 hub' clinics,&#xD;
      COVID-19 community-based testing centres, identification through other hospital departments,&#xD;
      NHS digital, Test and Trace (or equivalent) or other clinical environments.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient may not enter the trial if ANY of the following apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant electrolyte disturbance (e.g. hyperkalaemia, potassium &gt; site specific&#xD;
             upper limit of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alkaline&#xD;
             Phosphatase (ALP) &gt; 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would not make the patient a good&#xD;
             candidate for the clinical trial or would prevent adequate compliance with trial&#xD;
             therapy e.g. mild cognitive impairment (unable to follow instructions for&#xD;
             self-assessment readings as assessed by the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients on long term supplementary oxygen requirement (patients for whom hospital&#xD;
             admission would not be considered e.g. care plan in the community is in place, are not&#xD;
             excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known hypersensitivity to camostat&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Platelet count &lt;100 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Co-enrolment with a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP)&#xD;
             will not be permitted. Co-enrolment with a clinical investigation of a Medical Device&#xD;
             or a non-interventional clinical study will be considered on a study-by-study basis&#xD;
             and in discussion with the relevant Chief Investigators and Sponsors and industrial&#xD;
             collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Co-enrolment involving non-interventional research (including questionnaire or tissue&#xD;
             only studies) will be allowed provided this is not expected to affect the outcomes of&#xD;
             both studies or place undue burden upon participants and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients who are able to become pregnant (or are already pregnant or&#xD;
             lactating). However, those patients who are of child bearing potential and have a&#xD;
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree to use two forms of&#xD;
             contraception (one effective form plus a barrier method [oral, injected or implanted&#xD;
             hormonal contraception and condom; intra-uterine device and condom; diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicidal gel and condom]) or agree to sexual abstinence*, effective from the first&#xD;
             administration of camostat, throughout the trial and for 28 days afterwards are&#xD;
             considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (*Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this&#xD;
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take&#xD;
             measures not to father children by using a barrier method of contraception [condom&#xD;
             plus spermicide] or to sexual abstinence* effective from the first administration of&#xD;
             camostat, throughout the trial and for 28 days afterwards. Men with partners of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must also be willing to ensure that their partner uses an&#xD;
             effective method of contraception for the same duration for example, hormonal&#xD;
             contraception, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicidal gel or sexual&#xD;
             abstinence). Men with pregnant or lactating partners must be advised to use barrier&#xD;
             method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure of&#xD;
             the foetus or neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (*Abstinence is only considered to be an acceptable method of contraception when this&#xD;
             is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Significant cardiovascular disease (as assessed via the participant's medical record&#xD;
             and history) as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. History of congestive heart failure requiring therapy (New York Heart Association&#xD;
                  [NYHA] III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction up to 6 months prior&#xD;
                  to trial entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Presence of severe valvular heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Presence of a ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
