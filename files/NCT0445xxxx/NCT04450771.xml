  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining the efficacy and mechanism of family therapy compared to usual care&#xD;
      for children between the ages of 6 and 12 who are diagnosed with Avoidant/Restrictive Food&#xD;
      Intake Disorder. Preliminary data suggest that family therapy is superior to usual care and&#xD;
      that improvement in parental self-efficacy related to feeding their children is the mechanism&#xD;
      of treatment. In addition, this study will attempt to identify specific patient groups who&#xD;
      respond to family therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects aged 6 years to 12 years, 11 months old with DSM 5 ARFID, and weight equal&#xD;
      to or between 75 to 88% EBW who are medically stable for outpatient treatment and their&#xD;
      families will be recruited through Stanford University, pediatricians, mental health experts,&#xD;
      clinics treating EDs, and local parents' groups. Those eligible for the program will be&#xD;
      invited to read and sign informed consent forms and complete the baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomized to FBT-ARFID with medical management for 14 sessions&#xD;
      provided over 4 months or manualized Non-Specific Care (NSC) with medical management for 4&#xD;
      months. NSC will consist of 14 sessions over 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 5 major assessment time points: Baseline, 1 month, 2 months, End Of Treatment&#xD;
      (4 months), and 6-month post-treatment Follow-Up. Both the child and the parent will complete&#xD;
      measures at these time points. In addition, parents will complete short survey assessments&#xD;
      after each of the 14 treatment sessions.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>FBT-ARFID is a manualized treatment based on the model of FBT that employs the same interventions as standard FBT for AN and BN: externalization, agnosticism, parental empowerment, a behavioral focus on changing eating behavior. Early sessions focus on inciting parents to make changes and include a family meal that allows therapists to observe &amp; consult directly to mealtime behaviors. FBT-ARFID for children 12 and under is manualized and consists of 2 phases. The first phase is focused on parents taking charge &amp; changing the eating behaviors of their child that are maintaining ARFID. The second phase focuses on the child taking up in an age-appropriate way managing their eating consistent with the changes the parents have employed in phase 1. Fourteen 1-hour sessions will be conducted approximately weekly over 4 months. Throughout medical monitoring and weekly dietary consultation are available to the family.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Manualized Non-Specific Usual Care for ARFID(NSC)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>A manualized non-specific psycho-educational and motivational enhancement approach that is based on a supportive non-directive psychotherapy model that has been used in other RCTs with eating disorders as a comparison. NSC consists of sessions with the child alone and 5 parent-only meetings. Sessions are 1-hour. NSC matches FBT-ARFID for time and therapist attention. The focus of the NSC intervention is psychoeducation about health &amp; social impacts of restrictive eating and supporting parent &amp; child exploration of motivation to change eating patterns &amp; choices they make about changes to eating. The therapist does not initiate behavioral or cognitive interventions. Feelings about eating and making changes are explored in both the child and parent sessions. Medical and dietary advice are provided weekly.</description>
