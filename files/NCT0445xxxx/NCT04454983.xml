      This study was designed to compare patient acceptance, comfort, and preference between two&#xD;
      meibomian gland clearing devices (Lipiflow vs, iLux). Primary Objective was to compare&#xD;
      patient comfort as assessed by Likert-style scale questionnaire following each bilateral&#xD;
      procedure. Secondary Objective was to compare overall experience and treatment preference as&#xD;
      assessed by Likert-style questionnaire following each bilateral procedure. Both devices are&#xD;
      exempt from IDE regulations [21 CFR 812.2(c)].&#xD;

      Introduction Meibomian gland disease (MGD) is increasingly recognized as a primary cause or&#xD;
      contributor to tear instability and dry eye disease. Effective management of this disorder&#xD;
      often requires meibomian gland expression and clearance. A variety of devices which apply&#xD;
      pressure, heat or a combination of both to the glands have been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two such devices that apply heat and pressure simultaneously are commercially available.&#xD;
      LipiFlow (JNJ Vision Care) is an automated computer-controlled device that uses vectored&#xD;
      thermal (hydraulic) pulsation applied by an activator device placed on the eye between the&#xD;
      globe and the eyelids to achieve gland clearance. The iLux System (Alcon) is an operator&#xD;
      controlled assisted manual device which applies heat generated by infrared LEDs and&#xD;
      expression through cam driven mechanical pressure applied to the lids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device Descriptions LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lipiflow Thermal Pulsation System is a commercially available device used in the&#xD;
      treatment of MGD. It is cleared to be marketed by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration. The LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation System is intended for the application of&#xD;
      localized heat and pressure therapy in adult patients with chronic cystic conditions of the&#xD;
      eyelids, including meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), also known as evaporative dry eye or&#xD;
      lipid deficiency dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LipiFlow Console provides the user interface and control elements of the system,&#xD;
      including all software, algorithms and control elements. The Activator, a single-use sterile&#xD;
      device, delivers automated therapeutic energies to each meibomian gland. Its contoured design&#xD;
      vaults the cornea and protects the eye allowing a maximum therapeutic temperature of 43&#xD;
      degrees Celsius to reach glands from the inner eyelid, without damaging the eyelid or&#xD;
      delicate structures of the globe. Insulation protects the cornea from exceeding a safe 39.5&#xD;
      degrees Celsius, while a pressure feedback loop sends pulsed sequences to expel blockages.&#xD;
      Force equalization protects the globe from pressure transmission by focusing energy only on&#xD;
      the eyelid. Delivered through the LipiFlow Activator, Vectored Thermal Pulse™ (VTP)&#xD;
      technology applies a combination of heat and pressure to the inner eyelid to safely remove&#xD;
      gland obstructions and stagnant gland content. Vectored heat and adaptive force equalization&#xD;
      target the pulse, heat, and pressure on the meibomian glands to maximize effectiveness.&#xD;
      Therapeutic motion provides proximal-to-distal peristalsis to clear gland contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iLux System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iLux™ System is a medical device commercially available for use by Eye Care Professionals&#xD;
      (ECP) to apply localized heat and pressure therapy to a patient's eyelids. It is cleared to&#xD;
      be marketed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The system consists of a&#xD;
      handheld instrument coupled to a single-use, sterile disposable component that is positioned&#xD;
      to bridge the eyelid. The iLux device allows an ECP to view the eyelid margin through a&#xD;
      magnifier, then warm the eyelid tissue to a range of 40 to 42˚C, and then apply force-limited&#xD;
      compression to the eyelid in order to express melted meibum from obstructed glands. The iLux&#xD;
      System is indicated for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in adult&#xD;
      patients with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including meibomian gland dysfunction&#xD;
      (MGD), also known as evaporative dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iLux Instrument is a handheld, electronic instrument used together with the iLux&#xD;
      disposable to apply heating and pressure to the eyelid. The Instrument includes electronic&#xD;
      circuits that read sensors in the Inner and Outer Eyelid Pads to measure temperatures&#xD;
      representative of inner and outer eyelid temperature, respectively. Warming is accomplished&#xD;
      using light energy emitted from LEDs in the Instrument. The LEDs are located behind a clear&#xD;
      window on the open end of the Shroud. Two wavelengths of light are used: lime-green (568 nm)&#xD;
      and near-infrared (850 nm). A mechanism in the Instrument allows the operator to apply&#xD;
      pressure to the eyelid by controlling the movement of the Outer Pad using finger pressure&#xD;
      applied to the Compression Control button. The force applied to the Compression Control is&#xD;
      measured by a sensor in this mechanism. A graphic Screen displays information for operating&#xD;
      the Instrument during a treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose / Objectives This study is designed to compare patient acceptance, comfort, and&#xD;
      preference between two meibomian gland clearing devices. Both devices are exempt from IDE&#xD;
      regulations [21 CFR 812.2(c)]. Primary Objective is to compare patient comfort as assessed by&#xD;
      Likert-style scale questionnaire following each bilateral procedure. Secondary Objective is&#xD;
      to compare overall experience and treatment preference as assessed by Likert-style&#xD;
      questionnaire following each bilateral procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &quot;Comparison Between iLux™ and LipiFlow® in the Treatment of Meibomian Gland&#xD;
      Dysfunction&quot; listed on ClincalTrials.gov looked at a 4-week efficacy comparison between the&#xD;
      two treatment devices. Pain and discomfort data were collected regarding the two procedures&#xD;
      but was not analyzed for significance due to no pre-trial hypothesis. The raw data shows&#xD;
      lower pain and discomfort scores immediately following the procedure for the Lipiflow as&#xD;
      compared to iLux with similar pre-treatment and one-day post post-treatment scores (Thornhill&#xD;
      2019). There is currently no published research on the patient acceptance, comfort, and&#xD;
      preference comparing any meibomian gland emptying devices.&#xD;
