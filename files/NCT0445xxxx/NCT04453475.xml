    <textblock>
      As a result of the pandemic, hygiene and distancing rules must be followed in Health care/&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinics to ensure the safety of patients and staff. This has led to extensive&#xD;
      changes in the therapy processes, including a reduction in group sizes and maintaining&#xD;
      distances within the groups, resulting in a reduction in the range of therapies available to&#xD;
      individuals, since the number of employees remains unchanged and cannot be increased at will&#xD;
      and in the short term due to the lack of qualified staff. In order for the&#xD;
      treatment/rehabilitation goals to be achieved nonetheless, new forms of implementation of&#xD;
      therapy programs must be developed in addition to organizational adjustments. Digitalization&#xD;
      can be a significant support in this respect. The majority of patients in psychosomatic&#xD;
      rehabilitation possess smartphones, meaning that the necessary infrastructure for the&#xD;
      utilization of digital offers is available and can be used to the greatest possible extent.&#xD;
      The use of digital measures within the therapeutic services supports the independence of the&#xD;
      patients, as they can use the digital offers independently and flexibly in their own time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How should Health care/rehabilitation services be designed in light of the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      pandemic and which services have the potential to buffer future crises: What general&#xD;
      recommendations can be derived for the design of such services for routine care? What are&#xD;
      support measures to encourage social participation and return to work?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a crisis with massive effects on health and&#xD;
      rehabilitation care. This crisis is not a short-term event but will also has longer-term&#xD;
      effects on health care service/rehabilitation. Necessary adjustments due to hygiene and&#xD;
      distance regulations include, for example, the reduction of group sizes and alternatives to&#xD;
      conventional service provision (= digital services, McNeary et al., 2020). How such offers&#xD;
      are perceived and accepted by patients and staff is crucial for the effect on the care.&#xD;
      Systematic research into the pandemic from the patient and employee perspective, its&#xD;
      consequences for procedures in rehabilitation clinics and for the implementation of the&#xD;
      necessary therapies is required in a timely manner in order to better understand and mitigate&#xD;
      the effects of the pandemic and to ensure the effectiveness of rehabilitation. This is the&#xD;
      aim of this project with a focus on digital services and their subjective usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the integration of such offers can mean that a therapist is not present during&#xD;
      the entire therapy, but that rehabilitants first learn the basics of a topic in self-study.&#xD;
      This is based on the principle of the &quot;Flipped Classroom&quot;. (Rehab) Patients as well as&#xD;
      employees of the clinics are involved in the piloting of the survey instruments and the final&#xD;
      choice of outcome criteria as well as the derivation of possible applications (guidelines,&#xD;
      recommendations for rehabilitants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the pandemic is negatively associated with equal participation of vulnerable&#xD;
      groups (e.g. persons with physical or psychological handicaps). In the case of medical&#xD;
      rehabilitation patients, particular occupational problems make equal participation and social&#xD;
      cohesion more difficult: problems such as long-term limited productivity or the threat of&#xD;
      exclusion from the labor market (pension for reduced earning capacity), negative employment&#xD;
      forecasts and experiences of previously limited social participation are in turn further&#xD;
      exacerbated by demographic change and the consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic. These&#xD;
      restrictions are also reflected in the increased experience of loneliness. To date, however,&#xD;
      there is a lack of a systematic understanding of these circular, dynamic processes and&#xD;
      low-threshold, effective approaches to action, effective approaches to action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be empirically investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How are digital services evaluated regarding feasibility, acceptance and subjective&#xD;
           usefulness in light of the current situation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Which characteristics of rehabilitants are related to the acceptance and subjective&#xD;
           usefulness of digital offers?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For which patients of rehabilitation is there a need for support in the use of digital&#xD;
           services to achieve rehabilitation goals?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are there differences in perceived usefulness between services?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How do people in the welfare state and labor market with disabilities and impairments&#xD;
           (rehabilitants) perceive the consequences of the Covid 19 pandemic and the&#xD;
           transformation processes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How effective are support measures with regard to communication for rehabilitants in&#xD;
           supporting equal participation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. How should support for equal participation be designed in the long term: What What are&#xD;
           the consequences for labor market and social policy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology uses a natural variation design within the Dr. Becker Clinical Group in order&#xD;
      to investigate the issues at the highest possible scientific level and to achieve reliable&#xD;
      results. The interventions consist of an online depression session as a &quot;flipped classroom&quot;&#xD;
      and/or an online lecture with socio-medical content, and/ or a tobacco cessation lecture,&#xD;
      which are combined in such a way that the differential effects can be evaluated. For this&#xD;
      purpose, a control group is included that does not participate in these interventions (but&#xD;
      receives the standard rehabilitation treatment programm). Furthermore, all groups voluntarily&#xD;
      receive patient training before rehabilitation with the content of setting &quot;treatment goals&quot;&#xD;
      as well as an invitation to pre- and post-surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey methods are online surveys (before the treatment=pre (T1); end of treatment=post&#xD;
      (T2); end of treatment=post 12 weeks (T3)) by means of UniPark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main target variables are reported behavior and well-being (stress/burden of COVID-19&#xD;
      disease or probability of disease, limitations, quality of life, anxiety or depression;&#xD;
      pre-post comparison) as well as subjective need (pre) and benefit (post) of the digital&#xD;
      services. Further primary target variables are concentrated on social participation,&#xD;
      workability and return to work. The theoretical foundation for the selection of target&#xD;
      variables and constructs is the Carry-Over Action Model. The sample includes all&#xD;
      rehabilitands who undergo a psychosomatic rehabilitation in the hospitals. The planned sample&#xD;
      size of the rehabilitants is N = 2,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility is given by the use of an existing care system with cover letters from the&#xD;
      patients before the treatment. Possible disturbance variables such as affinity towards&#xD;
      technology (which could lead to a lower participation rate among participants with little&#xD;
      affinity towards technology) are controlled for and taken into account in the evaluation.&#xD;
      Gender and diversity are considered as covariates or moderators in the statistical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data of the participants will be treated in accordance with the data security regulations&#xD;
      (DSGVO), good scientific practice and the ethical requirements. Furthermore, all patients are&#xD;
      informed about the project, ethics and data protection in a generally understandable way by a&#xD;
      cover letter from their clinic before the treatment. All project staff are obliged to comply&#xD;
      with the ethics guidelines and to maintain confidentiality. The pre- and post-data of the&#xD;
      patients are combined by means of a personal code, which does not allow any conclusion about&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will show which digital implementation forms of therapy offers are&#xD;
      feasible in terms of benefit and acceptance and can thus contribute to the further&#xD;
      development of health care services and medical rehabilitation. This will create the&#xD;
      necessary evidence base to include digital offers in the classification of therapeutic&#xD;
      services and the therapy standards based on them and thus to establish them in routine care.&#xD;
      Furthermore, a guideline for the future integration of these services into the health care&#xD;
      services/rehabilitation process will be developed. Due to the standardized combination of&#xD;
      analogue and digital therapy parts, therapy goals can be achieved more efficiently on the&#xD;
      basis of the validated pedagogical concepts used and with the involvement of fewer human&#xD;
      resources. This is not only relevant during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but also with regard to&#xD;
      the relevant shortage of qualified personnel. Furthermore, the research basis for digital&#xD;
      measures to support social support for social participation will be created. With these&#xD;
      findings, similar measures on other groups, for example, persons with disabilities or&#xD;
      limitations, can be researched.&#xD;
