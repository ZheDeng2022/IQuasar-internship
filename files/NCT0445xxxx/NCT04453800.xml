    <textblock>
      The limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection has prevented all clinical trials&#xD;
      using NMDA receptor antagonists in subjects with ischemic stroke from showing efficacy. In&#xD;
      animal models of ischemic stroke, antioxidants showed a longer neuroprotective time window&#xD;
      than NMDA receptor antagonists, and also showed therapeutic potential in clinical trials in&#xD;
      subjects with ischemic stroke. Sophadil showed good neuroprotective effects against NMDA and&#xD;
      free-radical mediated cell death, NR2B-selectivity, moderate NMDA receptor antagonism, and&#xD;
      effective cellular osmotic antioxidant activity even at nanoscale molarity. Non-clinical and&#xD;
      phase I human clinical studies have shown that Sofadil is helpful in treating ischemic stroke&#xD;
      subjects with better efficacy and therapeutic time windows. So we designed the clinical trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sofadil injection in the treatment of acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke&#xD;
