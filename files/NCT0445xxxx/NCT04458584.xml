  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for three widely held fundamental tenets&#xD;
      about surgical intervention for thumb basal joint arthritis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction and metacarpal stabilization is associated&#xD;
           with superior functional outcomes and strength,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preservation of the arthroplasty space correlates with functional outcomes, pain relief,&#xD;
           and restoration of strength after basal joint arthroplasty, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mitigation of metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) hyperextension optimizes postoperative&#xD;
           strength after basal joint arthroplasty, regardless of surgical technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that thumb basal joint arthroplasty with metacarpal stabilization, by&#xD;
      either ligament reconstruction (I) or suture suspension (II), provides greater improvement in&#xD;
      grip and pinch strength, and better hand function, than might be achieved following provision&#xD;
      of pain relief alone by simple trapeziectomy (III). Preservation of the arthroplasty space&#xD;
      will correlate positively, and MCPJ hyperextension will correlate negatively, with improved&#xD;
      thumb function and lateral pinch strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims (within 3 procedure cohorts):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare pre-operative pinch and grip strength as well as patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
           (PROs) for pain in patients before and after lidocaine injection of the&#xD;
           trapeziometacarpal joint, prior to thumb basal joint arthroplasty;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function at 3 and 6&#xD;
           months after thumb basal joint arthroplasty with pre-operative values before and after&#xD;
           lidocaine injection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate preservation of dynamic arthroplasty space as measured on a stress radiograph&#xD;
           with postoperative improvement in pinch and grip strength, and PROs for pain and&#xD;
           function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlate dynamic MCP joint position and laxity with change in strength and&#xD;
           patient-reported pain and function to define optimal MCPJ position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims (between 3 procedure cohorts):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare change in pre- and post-operative pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and&#xD;
           function between patients having basal joint arthroplasty with and without specific&#xD;
           metacarpal stabilization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare preservation of the dynamic arthroplasty space and improvement in strength and&#xD;
           patient-reported pain and function between arthroplasty groups; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare changes in pinch and grip strength and PROs for pain and function with dynamic&#xD;
           MCPJ position between arthroplasty groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare postoperative neuritis and complications between surgical groups.&#xD;

      Study Procedures: Upon obtaining informed consent and within 4 weeks of the planned date of&#xD;
      surgery, each site coordinator will collect baseline clinical and demographic information, a&#xD;
      visual analogue score (VAS), the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System&#xD;
      (PROMIS-10) Global Health Survey, the short form Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand&#xD;
      (QuickDASH) questionnaire and grip and then pinch measurements from the participant. On the&#xD;
      same day, and immediately following collection of baseline clinical data in the clinic, the&#xD;
      surgeon will anesthetize the trapeziometacarpal joint. Adequacy of the injection and&#xD;
      resulting anesthesia of the joint will be assessed by repeat of the VAS score. Following 15&#xD;
      minutes set time for the local anesthetic, the VAS diagram will again be completed by the&#xD;
      patient followed by recording of repeat grip and then pinch measurements. Each patient will&#xD;
      then undergo one of three pre-specified procedures; trapeziectomy with ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction-tendon interposition (LRTI) arthroplasty with flexor carpi radialis tendon;&#xD;
      trapeziectomy with suture suspensionplasty; or arthroscopic trapeziectomy with temporary&#xD;
      K-wire fixation. Patient follow-up visits are otherwise scheduled according to the surgeon's&#xD;
      routine and by clinical indication only. The patient will follow the routine postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol and hand therapy program of the operating surgeon. Protective&#xD;
      splinting and exercise programs are to be utilized per surgeon protocol and&#xD;
      preference.Postoperative study assessment will occur at three and six months after operation,&#xD;
      The 3 and 6 month evaluation will include PROMIS-10 and QuickDASH surveys, completion of the&#xD;
      VAS pain diagram, and recording of grip, key, and pulp to pulp pinch strengths. Additionally,&#xD;
      specific notation of paresthesias, dysaesthesias, or sensitivity of the incision will be made&#xD;
      by the surgeon or hand therapist at the 3 and 6 month assessments.&#xD;

    <description>Power grip using a Jamar (Jackson, MO) dynamometer, followed by lateral (key) and pulp-to-pulp pinch, will be recorded (in kilograms) with a pinch meter, taking the greater strength of three successive attempts at each position with a 15 second rest between each attempt. The dynamic position of the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint will be recorded with a small goniometer during lateral pinch testing.</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative baseline, both before and after basal joint lidocaine injection, and then 3 months and 6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The standard VAS diagram is a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 indicates No Pain (smiling face), and 10 indicates Worst possible, unbearable, excruciating pain (crying face).</description>

    <description>The short form QuickDASH questionnaire will be completed as a reflection of patient-reported specific upper extremity function. Absolute improvement in QuickDASH score will be compared within groups longitudinally and between groups at each time point. QuickDASH scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months and 6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-10 Global Health measures five domains: physical function, fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and social health. Items are rated on a five-point scale. A higher score indicates better health.</description>

    <description>The static and dynamic arthroplasty space will be comparatively assessed on immediate postop and sequential radiographs taken upon removal of plaster immobilization and K-wire fixation at 1 month, and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Three and six month radiographs will be taken in Roberts anteroposterior (AP) and true lateral projections during lateral key pinch. The absolute arthroplasty space height, and its change over time following operation and plaster removal, will be correlated with improvement in strength.</description>
