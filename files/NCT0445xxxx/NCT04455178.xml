      1. Study name: The comparison between spironolactone and indapamide monotherapy or in&#xD;
           combination with amlodipine to reduce thr risk of heart failure (SIRRHF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medicine: spironolactone (20mg/tablet), indapamide (1.5mg/tablet) and amlodipine&#xD;
           (5mg/tablet).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rationale: Our hypothesis of the present trial is that spironolactone is superior to&#xD;
           indapamide in cardiovascular prevention in hypertensive patients, with the possible&#xD;
           addition of amlodipine. Before a clinical outcome trial is considered, the present&#xD;
           feasibility trial is designed to compare the efficacy of antihypertensive regimens based&#xD;
           on these two drugs on blood pressure and several measurements of organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective: To evaluate the effects of spironolactone (either with or without&#xD;
           amlodipine), in comparison with indapamide (either with or without amlodipine), on the&#xD;
           extent of blood pressure reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study design: Multi-center (five sites), prospective, randomized, open-label,&#xD;
           blinded-end point study with active treatment arm (study duration - 12 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: Men and Women aged over 45 years (n=200) meeting the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization and treatment: After stratification by centers, eligible patients will be&#xD;
           randomly divided into two groups, taking spironolactone (20mg tablet) once a day or&#xD;
           indapamide (1.5mg tablet) once a day. Spironolactone may be up-titrated to 40mg daily&#xD;
           and indapamide may be up-titrated to 3mg daily at 4-week or 8-week visit. At 8-week&#xD;
           visit, if needed, we will add amlodipine at 5 or 10 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up: 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size: a total of 200 patients should be enrolled in the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Timeline: After obtaining the approval of Ethics Committee of Ruijin Hospital in June&#xD;
           2020, recruitment will start. Patients enrollment will be performed between June 2020 to&#xD;
           November 2020. All patients should be followed up before July 2021.&#xD;
