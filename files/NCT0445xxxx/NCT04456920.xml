  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 1500 breast biopsies (1000 microbiopsies and 500 macrobiopsies) are&#xD;
      performed in the radiologic department of the Montpellier Cancer Institute (ICM). This exam,&#xD;
      which is relatively easy for the radiologist, can however lead to major anxiety for patients.&#xD;
      Indeed, previous studies show that about 50% of women undergoing a breast biopsy have&#xD;
      significant anxiety affects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety associated with the risks of biopsy, potential breast cancer diagnosis and/or lack of&#xD;
      routine sedation procedures increase patient concerns. Distress prior to biopsy is associated&#xD;
      with greater pain and discomfort during the procedure. The psychological distress that&#xD;
      persists after the biopsy is related to a worse psychological management of side effects of&#xD;
      the biopsy breast (e.g., sensitivity, skin irritation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limiting apprehension, worry and anxiety induced by the uncertainty linked to the biopsy&#xD;
      results and the biopsy-related pain should be an integral part of the medical care through&#xD;
      the patient follow-up during, after and until the diagnosis is announced. In light of these&#xD;
      challenges, new alternative methods are emerging to enhance patient knowledge, develop&#xD;
      procedural skills, improve confidence and mitigate procedural anxiety. However, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, few methods have been developed during this period of 'waiting-time'. Currently,&#xD;
      only care instructions and a consultation to announce the results (about 10 days after the&#xD;
      procedure) are proposed to patients at the end of biopsy. Patients are also encouraged to&#xD;
      call if they suspect complications such as infection or bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators propose to integrate a pain management after biopsy via&#xD;
      e-health system through the patient's medical care. Radiologist/patient communication could&#xD;
      have an impact on patients' anxiety and health-related issues, given the challenging nature&#xD;
      of discussions around need for breast biopsy and potential implications of the results.&#xD;
      Indeed, paying attention and focusing on symptoms as patients experience them improves their&#xD;
      empowerment and their adjustment to the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based systems that can provide electronic-Patient reported Outcomes (e-PRO) have been&#xD;
      shown to prompt clinicians to intensify symptom management, to improve symptom control and to&#xD;
      enhance patient-clinician communication patient satisfaction, as well as well-being. In&#xD;
      addition, it is known that improved communication between patients and medical staff to less&#xD;
      anxiety after a biopsy and that anxiety is related to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken as a whole, these elements encourage the integration of e-health and e-PRO for the&#xD;
      management of pain and anxiety in patients undergoing a biopsy. The benefits of e-PRO are&#xD;
      still being discussed in terms of quality of life (Qol) and psychological distress. The&#xD;
      investigator propose to integrate two types of e-health intervention: 1/e-PRO collected by&#xD;
      connected objects (smartphone or tablet) as they were used in previous studies, and 2/ e-PRO&#xD;
      collected by a phone consultation, which values human communication between the medical staff&#xD;
      and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of significant pain, the collection of e-PRO by any of these e-health interventions&#xD;
      will generate an alert and a reactive and responsive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fine, the purpose of this research is to improve the medical organization and care of&#xD;
      post-biopsy patients by proposing an innovative connected patient technology, regardless of&#xD;
      their remoteness from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social inequalities will be reduced by lending a tablet to patients who do not have such a&#xD;
      device with a 4G key.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to compare the benefit of intervention by e-health (phone&#xD;
      consultation with a professional or connected objects (smartphone or tablet)) with the&#xD;
      standard follow up of the pain intensity of patients 4 days (D4) after un breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Monocentric, prospective, open-labeled, randomized controlled trial. A total&#xD;
      of 192 patients (64 patients in group control vs 64 patients in experimental group 1 (PRO&#xD;
      gathered via a phone consultation) and 64 patients in experimental group 2 (e-PRO&#xD;
      self-completed via connected objects (tablet/phone) will be required including 10% of&#xD;
      lost-to-follow-up patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period would be 8 months&#xD;
