  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have documented impaired cognitive function in patients with COPD. The possible&#xD;
      reasons for this and correlation to the severity of the disease are not well described. This&#xD;
      explorative study examines the cognitive skills of COPD patients, quantified by their ability&#xD;
      to drive a vehicle and other cognitive test. Furthermore, we want to study the cognitive&#xD;
      skills in COPD patients before and after they are diagnosed with and treated for obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnoea (OSA). The overall hypothesis is that chronic lung patients´ cognitive skills&#xD;
      correlate with the severity of their disease. We expect that their ability to drive a vehicle&#xD;
      drops in relation to the severity of the disease and to comorbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 COPD patients recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Respiratory&#xD;
      Diseases at Vejle Hospital. Approximately 2600 COPD patients are treated in Vejle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study a driving simulator is being used. The subjects are placed in front of a&#xD;
      computer monitor which simulates a horizon on the middle of the screen, and a road that&#xD;
      appears in the bottom half of the screen. The subjects are encouraged to keep the virtual&#xD;
      vehicle on the road, using a steering wheel in front of them. Simultaneous, they are required&#xD;
      to keep focus on both sides of the screen where a line of numbers is frequently changing.&#xD;
      Every time the number 2 occurs, the subjects must press a button on the steering wheel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects´ overall ability to control the driving simulator is being expressed by the&#xD;
      standard deviation (sd) of distance of the car´s centre to the centre of the road and the&#xD;
      number of off-road events. Relevant cognitive measurements, such as reaction speed and&#xD;
      ability to split attention, are quantified by the reaction speed to the occurrence of the&#xD;
      number 2. The reason for this is that the software of the simulator measures the mean&#xD;
      reaction time from the number have occurred until the correct button is pressed, and the&#xD;
      number of nil-responses, where the number 2 is not detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participating subject will receive a 5 minutes testing period of the simulator followed&#xD;
      by 30 minutes of applicable driving time.The other tests will be performed/collected just&#xD;
      after the driving test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the driving simulator and tests (see sections below) following are obtained: 1) Lung&#xD;
      function (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC), 2) Arterial blood sample including PaO2, PaCO2 and&#xD;
      carbonmonooxidhemoglobin (HbCO) (1.5 ml), 3) Smoking status and number of pack years, 4)&#xD;
      Status of oxygen therapy, 5) Number of COPD exacerbations in the last year, 6) Comorbidities&#xD;
      such as diabetes, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, kidney insufficiency, 7)&#xD;
      Medicine, 8) Height and weight, 9) Level of education, 10) Degree of dyspnoea Medical&#xD;
      research Council breathlessness scale (MRC-scale) and 11) Global initiative for chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification of airflow limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples will be analysed immediately after they are taken, and as a consequence no&#xD;
      biobank will be established. The information will be gathered from the journals and from&#xD;
      patient interview in connection with the trial. The information will be used in the&#xD;
      assessment of possible reasons to COPD patients´ expected reduced cognitive skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NOX T3TM (see section below) will be delivered in connection with the trial. If the&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed with OSA they will shortly after receive standard treatment in the&#xD;
      public Sleep Clinic at Vejle Hospital, if the patients accept. After 2-3 month of treatment,&#xD;
      the patients will repeat all the tests and blood samples, except the cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To exclude that an improvement of skills is not due to the patients having learned how to&#xD;
      improve the test, we will establish a control group. The control group must consist of COPD&#xD;
      patients without OSA who must perform a retest like the patients with OSA.&#xD;

    <description>For this study a driving simulator is being used which is an internationally approved method. Besides the driving simulator following tests are done: COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a clock drawing test and a continuous reaction time test (CRT). A CardioRespiratory Monitor (CRM), NOX T3TM, is used to measure if the patients have moderate to severe OSA. Furthermore, following tests are done: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).</description>
