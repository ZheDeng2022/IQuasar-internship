  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an prospective, interventional, non-randomized multicenter phase II study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Cabozantinib as a second-line therapy (after one&#xD;
      prior systemic therapy) in patients with intermediate to advanced HCC (BCLC B/C) and&#xD;
      concomitant impaired liver function CP score B7-8. Subjects who meet all study eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will receive Cabozantinib 40 mg daily orally. Subjects will receive Cabozantinib as&#xD;
      long as they continue to experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator or&#xD;
      until there is unacceptable toxicity or the need for subsequent systemic anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment or liver directed local anti-cancer therapy. Treatment may continue in this fashion&#xD;
      after radiographic progression as long as the Investigator believes that the subject is still&#xD;
      receiving clinical benefit from Cabozantinib and that the potential benefit of continuing&#xD;
      Cabozantinib outweighs potential risk. In addition, all subjects will be treated with best&#xD;
      supportive care. This excludes systemic anti-cancer therapy and liver-directed local&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;

             beginning at informed consent, for the duration of study participation and for at&#xD;
             least 4 months after last dose of the study drug. Because oral contraceptives might&#xD;
             possibly not be considered as &quot;effective methods of contraception&quot; during the&#xD;
             treatment with Cabozantinib, they should be used together with another method, such as&#xD;
             a barrier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Currently receiving any other investigational agent or received an investigational&#xD;
             agent within 30 days (or within 5 times the half-life of this agent or its relevant&#xD;
