      This will be a randomized comparison of continuous local anesthetic infusion with patient&#xD;
      controlled boluses (PCA) to automated boluses with PCA for continuous popliteal sciatic nerve&#xD;
      blocks. The goal will be to determine the relationship between method of local anesthetic&#xD;
      administration (continuous with PCA initiated at discharge vs. intermittent dosing with PCA&#xD;
      with a 5-hour delay) for continuous peripheral nerve block and the resulting pain control and&#xD;
      duration of analgesia.&#xD;

      Specific Aim: To determine the relationship between method of local anesthetic administration&#xD;
      (continuous with PCA vs. intermittent dosing with PCA) for continuous peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      and the resulting pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that, compared with a traditional fixed, continuous&#xD;
      basal infusion initiated prior to discharge, perineural local anesthetic administered with&#xD;
      variable automated boluses at a lower dose and a 5-hour delay following discharge will (1)&#xD;
      provide at least noninferior analgesia during the period that both techniques are&#xD;
      functioning; and, (2) will result in a longer overall duration of administration [dual&#xD;
      primary end points].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: Patients 18 years and older undergoing painful foot and/or ankle surgery will be&#xD;
      offered enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block placement: The nerve block site will be cleaned with chlorhexidine gluconate and&#xD;
      isopropyl alcohol (ChloraPrep One-Step, Medi-Flex Hospital Products, Inc., Overland Park, KS,&#xD;
      USA), and a clear, sterile, fenestrated drape applied. The ultrasound probe will be readied&#xD;
      for use and placed to visualize the short-axis (cross-section) of the target nerve. A skin&#xD;
      wheal will be raised at the catheter-placement needle's anticipated point of entry. An 8.9&#xD;
      cm, 17-gauge, insulated needle (FlexTip, Arrow International, Reading, PA, USA) will be used&#xD;
      to place all perineural catheters. The catheter-placement 17G needle will be inserted through&#xD;
      the skin wheal, advanced in-plane beneath the US transducer and directed toward the target&#xD;
      nerve. Normal saline (1-2 mL) will be administered via the needle to open the space around&#xD;
      the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flexible non-stimulating perineural catheter (FlexTip, Arrow International, Reading, PA,&#xD;
      USA) will be inserted 2-3 cm past the needle tip. After catheter insertion, Ropivacaine 0.5%&#xD;
      (20 mL) will be administered via the catheter under ultrasound visualization. Sensation in&#xD;
      the tibial and peroneal nerve distributions will be checked for anesthetic effect up to 15&#xD;
      minutes following initial local anesthetic bolus. A &quot;successful&quot; regional block will be&#xD;
      defined as sensory- and motor-block onset in all expected nerve distributions within the 15&#xD;
      minutes following the local anesthetic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial local anesthetic bolus may provide complete surgical anesthesia for the&#xD;
      procedure. Patients who desire a general anesthetic or experience a partial block that is not&#xD;
      adequate for surgical anesthesia will receive a general anesthetic. Additional boluses of&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.5% and epinephrine may be given, if needed, via the perineural catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: (1) automated&#xD;
      regular boluses (ARB) with a 5-hour delay or (2) continuous infusion initiated at discharge&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio using computer generated lists sealed in opaque envelopes not opened until&#xD;
      after the nerve has been identified and deemed appropriate for catheter placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Procedures: Following completion of the procedure in the operating room, an&#xD;
      infusion pump (Infutronix, Natick, Massachusetts) with a 500 mL ropivacaine 0.2% reservoir&#xD;
      will be attached to the patient's perineural catheter. For patients in the continuous&#xD;
      infusion group, the pump will provide a 6 mL/h basal infusion and a 4 mL patient-controlled&#xD;
      bolus with a 30-minute lockout (standard at UCSD). For patients in the automated intermittent&#xD;
      bolus group, the pump will provide an automatic 8 mL bolus once every 2 hours and have a 4 mL&#xD;
      patient-controlled bolus with a 30 minute lockout. In addition, for those in the automated&#xD;
      intermittent bolus group, the infusion pump will be set in a &quot;pause&quot; mode that delays&#xD;
      initiation of the automated bolus doses by 5 hours (this can be over-ridden by patients if&#xD;
      they would like to initiate their perineural infusion earlier than 5 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Data will be gathered from the patients' electronic medical record, by&#xD;
      telephone follow-up, and from the infusion pumps memory. Subjects will be contacted via phone&#xD;
      for the six days following surgery to collect information regarding surgical pain (Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale of 0 to 10, with &quot;0&quot; being no pain and &quot;10&quot; being the worst pain ever&#xD;
      experienced), analgesic use, number of sleep disturbances due to pain, and satisfaction with&#xD;
      pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: This study will be powered for two primary end points: (1) the average NRS&#xD;
      queried on postoperative day 1; and (2) the duration of treatment from when the infusion pump&#xD;
      was initially turned on until the local anesthetic reservoir was exhausted. The dual&#xD;
      hypotheses will be tested with a serial testing strategy, such that Hypothesis 2 will not be&#xD;
      formally tested unless the conclusion of Hypothesis 1 is at least &quot;noninferiority&quot;.&#xD;
      Noninferiority will be assessed by comparing the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      for the difference on the NRS (range: 0 to 10) to a pre-specified noninferiority margin of&#xD;
      1.7 NRS units. This will provide evidence that the analgesia provided by the novel automated&#xD;
      boluses is no worse than 1.7 NRS units compared to Continuous Basal infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of the randomized groups will be summarized with means, standard&#xD;
      deviations, and quartiles. Balance between groups will be assessed. Specifically,&#xD;
      standardized differences will be calculated using Cohen's d whereby the difference in means&#xD;
      or proportions is divided by the pooled standard deviation estimates. Any key variables (age,&#xD;
      sex, height, weight, and BMI) with an absolute standardized difference &gt;0.47 (with&#xD;
      1.96×√(2/n)=0.47) will be noted and included in a linear regression model to obtain an&#xD;
      estimate of the treatment group differences adjusted for the imbalanced covariate(s). If&#xD;
      residuals from the linear regression indicate violations of key assumptions (i.e.&#xD;
      homoscedasticity or Guassian distribution), data transformations and/or alternative&#xD;
      generalized linear models will be applied as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will also be analyzed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, or linear models (or&#xD;
      generalized linear models) as appropriate with covariates for any imbalanced covariates. No&#xD;
      multiplicity adjustments will be applied for these analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate: Power is simulated based on the distribution of pain measured with the&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) observed in previous studies. Specifically, the investigators&#xD;
      simulate NRS scores from a discrete distribution. This results in an expected interquartile&#xD;
      range 1 to 4, and a median of 3 NRS units. 1000 trials were simulated in which the two&#xD;
      groups, n=35 per group, were assumed to follow the same discrete distribution, submitted each&#xD;
      trial to a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and derived 95% confidence intervals. Out of the 1000&#xD;
      trials, 792 (79.2%) correctly resulted in a conclusion of non-inferiority; suggesting that&#xD;
      the probability that the trial correctly concludes non-inferiority is about 80% when the&#xD;
      groups follow exactly equivalent distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the test for Hypothesis 1 concludes noninferiority (scenario A, B, or C in Figure 1), the&#xD;
      investigators will test for a difference in overall duration of administration again using&#xD;
      the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power is approximated by a two-sample t-test calculation. Assuming a standard deviation of&#xD;
      SD=37 hours (corresponding to an interquartile range of 50 to 100 hours), the investigators&#xD;
      expect that a sample size of n=35 provides 80% power to detect a mean group difference of 25&#xD;
      hours with a two-sided alpha of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total enrollment: 70 subjects plus 30 for misplaced catheters or subjects otherwise unable to&#xD;
      be randomized; and subjects who withdraw. This allows for a possible total of 100 subjects.&#xD;
