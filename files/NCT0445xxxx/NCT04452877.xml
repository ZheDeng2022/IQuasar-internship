    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dabrafenib in combination&#xD;
      with trametinib in Chinese patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic Non-Small&#xD;
      Cell Lung Cancer. The general study design has been discussed and agreed with Chinese Health&#xD;
      Authority and is applying a similar design used for global pivotal phase II study&#xD;
      (BRF113928).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, multicenter phase II study evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in Chinese subjects with BRAF V600E&#xD;
      mutation positive AJCC v8 stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with stage IV BRAF V600E mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer confirmed by local&#xD;
      qualified assay (approved by China health authorities) will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Central confirmation testing for BRAF V600E will be performed. This study will enroll&#xD;
      subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for metastatic disease&#xD;
           (i.e. dabrafenib/trametinib will be the 1st line treatment for metastatic disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. who have relapsed or progressed on at least one prior platinum based chemotherapy prior&#xD;
           to enrollment but cannot have received more than 3 prior systemic therapies for&#xD;
           metastatic disease (i.e. dabrafenib/trametinib will be no less than second line&#xD;
           treatment for metastatic disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must not have been previously exposed to a BRAF or MEK inhibitor. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive the recommended dose of both drugs (dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg&#xD;
      once daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the study is Overall Response Rate, as determined by central&#xD;
      independent review, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 20 Chinese patients over 18 years old will be enrolled in this study and will&#xD;
      receive dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg once daily) combination therapy&#xD;
      until disease progression by RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, start of a new antineoplastic&#xD;
      therapy, pregnancy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, physician's decision, death, or&#xD;
      if study is terminated by the sponsor. Doses of study treatment may be modified and/or&#xD;
      interrupted for management of toxicities associated with study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment beyond disease progression per RECIST is allowed if protocol specific criteria are&#xD;
      met. The tumor assessments will be performed every 6 weeks until Week 36, and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter until disease progression, death, lost of follow-up, or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
      Survival and new anti-cancer therapy follow-up will continue until study completion.&#xD;
