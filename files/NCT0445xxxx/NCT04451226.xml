  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause with hot flashes. Menopause, a normal part of aging, is&#xD;
      the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's daily life. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to find out how safe it is for these women to take fezolinetant long&#xD;
      term (up to 52 weeks). To do that, the study will look at the number and severity of the&#xD;
      &quot;adverse events.&quot; Those are the side effects that study participants have while they are in&#xD;
      the study. The study treatment is fezolinetant (1 tablet of fezolinetant) once a day. The&#xD;
      study participants will take study treatment for 52 weeks. At weeks 2 and 4 and then once a&#xD;
      month, the study participants will go the hospital or clinic for a check-up. They will be&#xD;
      asked about medications, side effects and how they feel. Other checks will include physical&#xD;
      exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature and blood pressure). Blood and urine will be&#xD;
      collected for laboratory tests. At some study visits, study participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires that are about their quality of life. Study participants who still have their&#xD;
      uterus will have 2 more tests done at the first and last study visits. One of the 2 tests is&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy. This test involves removing a small amount of tissue from the inside&#xD;
      lining of the uterus. The tissue is then checked under a microscope. The other test is&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound. It uses sound waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis.&#xD;
      The sound waves are transmitted by a probe (transducer), which is placed inside the vagina.&#xD;
      Study participants may have a screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit.&#xD;
      A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study&#xD;
      participants who did not have this test done in the last 12 months will have it done at the&#xD;
      first study visit. They will have it done at the last study visit if they are due for their&#xD;
      screening mammogram and their own doctor agrees. The last check-up at the hospital or clinic&#xD;
      will be 3 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
