      Chronic ocular neuropathic pain may be misdiagnosed as dry eye disease. Our study aims to&#xD;
      identify a population with previous monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms and differentiate&#xD;
      neuropathic from dry eye pain using topical corneal naloxone hydrochloride.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a ubiquitous and debilitating ocular condition that affects tens of millions in&#xD;
      the United States (DEWS, 2007). However, there is increasing evidence that the symptoms of&#xD;
      dry eye overlap with the distinct condition of ocular neuropathic pain, and that many&#xD;
      patients given a dry eye diagnosis are mislabeled (Galor, 2017). These shared symptoms&#xD;
      include but are not limited to: hypoesthesia, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. According to the&#xD;
      2017 DEWS II (Dry Eye Workshop) pain and sensation report by the Tear Film and Ocular Surface&#xD;
      Society, neuropathic pain can manifest itself in the eye and may present similarly to dry&#xD;
      eye, but should not be classified as such (Belmonte, 2017). Our study aims to further&#xD;
      characterize this distinction by translating the rodent model of latent sensitization to the&#xD;
      human eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Latent sensitization is a model of chronic pain that reproduces both its episodic nature and&#xD;
      its sensitivity to stress. It can be induced by an array of insults and follows a&#xD;
      characteristic time course in which a hyperalgesic pain phase is followed by pain remission&#xD;
      phase. Of clinical relevance, administration of mu-opioid antagonists (i.e. naloxone) during&#xD;
      the remission phase reinstates animal pain behavior and physiologic reflexes to peak levels&#xD;
      seen in the hyperalgesia phase (Marvizon, 2015). This phenomenon suggests that the animals&#xD;
      are in a state of latent sensitization that can be unmasked by blocking the activity of the&#xD;
      opioid signaling pathway through compounds like naloxone hydrochloride. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      undulating course of chronic pain syndromes can be mimicked by introducing environmental and&#xD;
      physical stressors that trigger and exacerbate pain states (Marvizon, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathic pain is a common cause of chronic pain. It is defined by the International&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Pain as pain that arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or&#xD;
      disease affecting the somatosensory system. In contrast, nociceptive pain is produced by the&#xD;
      normal function of nociceptors. Hence, neuropathic lesions do not necessarily involve the&#xD;
      nociceptive pathway; instead, they can involve other somatosensory pathways including&#xD;
      tactile, mechanical, and thermal pathways. These lesions manifest allodynia-a central pain&#xD;
      sensation following a normally non-painful stimuli and a clinical hallmark of neuropathic&#xD;
      pain. In the eye, allodynia may manifest as non-specific dry-eye-like-symptoms to stimuli&#xD;
      including wind, temperature change, and humidity (Galor, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperalgesia is a heightened pain sensation to a normally painful stimulus and is another&#xD;
      hallmark of neuropathic pain. Importantly, hyperalgesia is a symptom of both neuropathic and&#xD;
      nociceptive pain, however the pathophysiologies are distinct. Neuropathic hyperalgesia is a&#xD;
      sustained phenomenon that arises from neuronal remodeling and sensitization of nociceptive&#xD;
      peripheral and/or central nerves. In distinction, nociceptive hyperalgesia arises from&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokine mediators that sensitize nociceptors and resolves after the conclusion&#xD;
      of inflammation. Given all of this, it can be difficult to clinically differentiate the two&#xD;
      forms of hyperalgesia; similarly, it can be difficult to differentiate between neuropathic&#xD;
      and nociceptive pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our murine model (Cho, 2019), we study latent sensitization of the eye after injuring the&#xD;
      cornea with an alkali solution. We find that pain behavior (quantified by the number of eye&#xD;
      wipes in thirty seconds after the topical administration of 2M NaCl to the corneal surface)&#xD;
      peaks at day 10 post injury and returns to baseline by day 14 post injury (figure 3.1; next&#xD;
      page). Topical administration of naloxone (100uM, one drop), reinstated peak pain behavior 16&#xD;
      weeks after initial corneal surface injury (figure 3.2; next page).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that our patient population with monocular trauma and dry eye symptoms mirrors&#xD;
      our murine model. The monocular trauma represents the initial corneal surface injury, and the&#xD;
      dry eye symptoms represent the breakthrough pain. It is important to note that in other&#xD;
      models of latent sensitization, peak pain responses can be reinstated by stressors other than&#xD;
      opioid antagonism. Specifically, novel environment stressors and forced swims reproduce peak&#xD;
      pain behavior experienced in the hyperalgesic phase. In a similar way, our patient population&#xD;
      endorses exacerbation of dry eye symptoms in the setting of stress, sleep, and environmental&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to differentiate dry eye disease from ocular neuropathic pain by testing the&#xD;
      latent sensitization model in the human eye. Given that there is good data to suggest chronic&#xD;
      pain states, including our ocular model, can be masked by upregulation of the mu-opioid&#xD;
      receptor signaling pathway, we hypothesize that our naloxone hydrochloride drop will induce a&#xD;
      hyperalgesic response to hypertonic saline in a population with dry eye diagnosis and&#xD;
      monocular trauma. We believe a topical naloxone ophthalmic drop is a potentially easy, cheap,&#xD;
      and safe diagnostic tool for ocular neuropathic pain.&#xD;
