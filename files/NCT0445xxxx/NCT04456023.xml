  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CTL019 in&#xD;
      Chinese adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease assessments will be performed at screening, after bridging, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      after tisagenlecleucel infusion, and every 6 months in the second year, and annually up to 60&#xD;
      months after infusion. Efficacy will be assessed until progression; safety will be assessed&#xD;
      throughout the study. A long term follow-up up to 15 years after CTL019 infusion will&#xD;
      continue under a separate protocol (CCTL019A2205B)(NCT02445222).&#xD;
