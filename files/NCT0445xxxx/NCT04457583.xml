      Introduction: Studies have shown the influence of exercise on sleep architecture and&#xD;
      efficiency, although its protocols, procedures, effects and mechanisms of action have not&#xD;
      been clearly explained and documented in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea&#xD;
      syndrome (OSAHS), which is thought to be the main sleep disorder due to its high prevalence&#xD;
      and clinical, social and cognitive consequences. Objective: To evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in OSAHS, by analyzing their influence on the quality of&#xD;
      sleep, inspiratory muscle strength and polysomnography parameters. Patients and Methods:&#xD;
      Controlled and randomized clinical trial involving 75 patients with OSAHS diagnosed by&#xD;
      polysomnography. Measurements of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) will be performed.&#xD;
      Pittsburgh scale Epworth, Sleepiness Scale, Short Form-36, and Berlin / Stanford&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used for assessment of sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, health&#xD;
      related quality of life quality of health, and the evaluation of snoring. Patients of the&#xD;
      intervention group will undergo IMT with an initial load of 40% of MIP. The intervention will&#xD;
      be performed daily for 12 weeks employing the exercise inspiratory device (POWERbreathe, HaB&#xD;
      Ltd, UK). The main end point will be the effect of the training program on the index of&#xD;
      apnea/hypopnea (IAH) assessed by polysomnography. Secondary end points will include effects&#xD;
      of the training program on: the quality of sleep, inspiratory muscle strength, the health&#xD;
      related QOL. Expected Results: if the hypothesis is confirmed, there will be improvements on&#xD;
      the apnea / hypopnea index, on the quality of sleep and on the health related QOL.&#xD;

      MATERIAL AND METHODS Study population Studied population will be derived from the Hospital&#xD;
      Naval Marcilio Dias (HNMD), the sample consisting of active military personnel, reserve&#xD;
      personnel and members of the naval family who seek the otorhinolaryngology service of the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed about the objectives and methods of the present study and, in&#xD;
      order to participate in the study, will be consulted to give their written consent for&#xD;
      inclusion, according to the Informed Consent Term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Study will be conducted through a prospective, controlled, randomized, and&#xD;
      masked clinical trial for the participants and the investigator who will perform the data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Characterization Reference Population It will consist of patients in medical care at&#xD;
      the otorhinolaryngology clinic of Naval Hospital Marcílio Dias (HNMS), referred for&#xD;
      polysomnography with a view to diagnosing OSAHS, obeying inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      All patients referred will be receiving the standard treatment for OSAHS, which consists of&#xD;
      the nocturnal use of CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stratified random probabilistic sample will consist of 2 (two) groups, control (sham) and&#xD;
      intervention. Participants will be consecutively allocated in the intervention or control&#xD;
      group by order of entry into the study and by level of severity of OSAHS to ensure fairness&#xD;
      between groups regarding OSAHS severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size was estimated through calculations to be able to evaluate&#xD;
      differences of the order of 20% between the groups, with a power of 80% and an alpha error of&#xD;
      5%, with a quantitative of 35 patients per group, totaling 70 (Seventy) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of groups and IMT protocol All patients will receive standard medical&#xD;
      treatment, which usually includes use of nocturnal CPAP. The intervention group will receive&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle training, through 30 respiratory cycles in the POWERbreathe classic, with&#xD;
      an initial load of 40% of PImax, once a day, during the 7 days of the week, for 02 weeks. An&#xD;
      increase of 01 level in the resistance of the POWERbreathe classic, equivalent to an increase&#xD;
      of 10 cmH2O, will be carried out at the beginning of the third, fourth and fifth weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the sixth to twelfth week, the resistance will not be increased further, remaining at&#xD;
      the value of the last adjustment. The sham control group will be submitted to exercises with&#xD;
      the same apparatus, but without load. The IMT program will begin with a (01) supervised care,&#xD;
      in which the research protocol will be presented to the patient, explaining the steps of the&#xD;
      research, when supervised orientation of the IMT will be performed and awareness about the&#xD;
      importance of adherence to the treatment. If the patient persists, before starting the&#xD;
      research protocol, the patient will be heard and given the pertinent guidelines until all&#xD;
      their doubts are resolved so that they can be selected for the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial stage of the protocol, the patient will receive guidance containing&#xD;
      information to assist in the correct implementation of the MRI and a record sheet of daily&#xD;
      MRI achievement, allowing uniformity and documentation of its achievement, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of every 04 weeks, patients will attend the HNMD physical therapy service for&#xD;
      follow-up and clinical reassessment. At the end of 12 weeks, they will attend the last&#xD;
      clinical and polysomnographic evaluation. Throughout the period the patients in the study&#xD;
      will be performing IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To promote adherence to research, patients will receive guidance on how the equipment works,&#xD;
      how it is used, frequency and duration of exercise; As well as follow-up through scheduled&#xD;
      appointments. Phone calls will be made bi-weekly to certify that protocols, motivational&#xD;
      messages, follow-up phone calls and confirmation of appointments marked for protocol&#xD;
      reassessment are still in progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental Methods of Measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography With polysomnography, it will be possible to know the stages of sleep, the&#xD;
      total number of apneas and hypopneas, the type of apnea, the total number of micro-awakenings&#xD;
      and the level of oxygen desaturation during sleep that, when above 4% , demonstrates&#xD;
      important impairment during REM sleep, making patients susceptible to clinical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of inspiratory muscle strength (MIP) By vacuometry In order to measure MIP, the&#xD;
      MVD 300 digital manovacuometer (Globalmed, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil), with a scale of 300&#xD;
      cmH2O, an scale increment of 1 cmH2O, and a scheduled time interval registering of at least 1&#xD;
      second will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the test, the patient will assume the seated position and use a nasal clip. The MIP&#xD;
      will be measured from the residual volume (RV) until total lung capacity (CPT) is reached and&#xD;
      three MIP measures will be performed, with a 1-min rest interval. The highest MIP values will&#xD;
      be recorded. The values used as reference of normality, according to sex and age, will be&#xD;
      those proposed by Neder et al (1999). After the examination, each patient's data will be&#xD;
      digitally stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By POWERbreathe K-5 This electronic device aims to evaluate initial inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength (S. Index) and its changes along training. Connected to a computer, it will allow&#xD;
      graphic analysis of the measurement and data storage (LOMAX e MCCONNELL, 2009). The technical&#xD;
      procedures to perform the measurement are the same adopted for vacuometry. There is no&#xD;
      difference in the posture adopted, the inspiratory effort, the number of measurements&#xD;
      performed, and the criteria of selection and acceptance of the best value. The use of this&#xD;
      equipment will help patients to become familiarized with the inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      strategy that will be employed as the intervention since it is very similar to the&#xD;
      POWERbreathe classic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale (PSQI) The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale (PSQI) is a sleep&#xD;
      quality questionnaire that analyzes multiple sleep-related variables during the previous&#xD;
      month. Respondents answer 19 items about themselves, of which 18 are used to calculate the&#xD;
      score. Five additional items are completed by a bed partner or roommate, but are not used to&#xD;
      calculate the score (Buysse et al., 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PSQI measures seven components, which evaluate subjective sleep quality (C1), sleep&#xD;
      latency (C2), sleep duration (C3), habitual sleep efficiency (C4), sleep disturbances (C5),&#xD;
      sleeping pills use (C6) and daytime dysfunction (C7). Scores of the subscales range from 0 to&#xD;
      3 and are summed to get a total score, which can range from 0 to 21. Total score greater than&#xD;
      five suggests a significant sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berlin Snoring Questionnaire The questionnaire is composed of nine closed questions and&#xD;
      divided into three categories (NETZER et al., 1999). Category one (01) is composed of five&#xD;
      questions and is considered positive when two or more questions get a positive answer.&#xD;
      Category two (02) is composed of three questions and is considered positive when two or more&#xD;
      questions are answered positively. Category three (03) is considered positive if the&#xD;
      individual has associated SAH or BMI ≥ 30 kg / m².&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is classified as no risk for OSAHS when the result does not present any positive category&#xD;
      or low risk when presenting a single positive category and high risk for obstructive apnea&#xD;
      when two or more categories are positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was advocated based on the&#xD;
      observations related to the occurrence of daytime hypersomnia (HSD), through a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the probability of falling asleep in eight&#xD;
      situations involving daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall score ranges from 0 to 24, with scores above 10 suggesting the diagnosis of HSD&#xD;
      (JOHNS, 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Form Questionnaire - 36 (SF-36) The &quot;Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health&#xD;
      Survey&quot; (SF-36) is a generic questionnaire that assesses quality of life aspects that are&#xD;
      directly related to the health of the individual. The questionnaire consists of 36 questions&#xD;
      that assess the perception of the disease from the point of view of the patient. He evaluates&#xD;
      eight dimensions of health: functional capacity, physical appearance, pain, general health,&#xD;
      vitality, social aspects, emotional aspects and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focusing on the impact of the disease on the quality of life, without focus on disease or&#xD;
      clinical signs, becomes the great differential of this instrument. The SF-36 can be applied&#xD;
      in several ways: patient-filled, performed by an interviewer, and even in telephone&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36 is a practical instrument, easy to apply, has good reliability and validity, and can be&#xD;
      used in our population (SOÁREZ PC, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data analysis will be performed by a blind investigator for the identity&#xD;
      of the groups. The results will be expressed as mean and standard deviation for the&#xD;
      continuous variables with Gaussian distribution, and median and internal quartiles, as an&#xD;
      alternative. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies. Differences between&#xD;
      groups will be assessed by the t student test for paired samples or by their non-parametric&#xD;
      equivalent; between frequencies, by the chi-square test. Association between variables will&#xD;
      be analyzed by linear regression. Values of P &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical program SPSS, version 18.0&#xD;
      (Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
