  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate methods to modify blood pressure in humans and&#xD;
      measure the effectiveness of such methods. A secondary outcome is to evaluate the performance&#xD;
      of an investigational continuous non-invasive blood pressure (cNIBP) device created by&#xD;
      Sensifree. The tests will per performed in non-hospitalized subjects under varied controlled&#xD;
      conditions that include resting blood pressure and non-pharmacologically induced blood&#xD;
      pressure changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On a first visit a screening procedure to verify inclusion / exclusion criteria are met will&#xD;
      be conducted. On the primary procedure visit, data collection will begin with the subjects&#xD;
      having the investigational device, ECG sensors, and 1 or more pulse oximetry sensors placed&#xD;
      on them for data collection and to monitor their safety for the duration of the study. A&#xD;
      physician will place an arterial line in the radial artery. The Sensifree cNIBP system will&#xD;
      be calibrated with an oscillometric and/or auscultatory blood pressure cuff measurement taken&#xD;
      on the arm opposite the arterial line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of blood pressure changes will be induced, including various combinations of&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
