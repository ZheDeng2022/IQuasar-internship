  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there are many publications concerning the benefit of the interventions of the&#xD;
      self-help movements and peer health mediators in psychiatry, no studies have described the&#xD;
      intervention specific to patients with expertise in addictology (EP), nor evaluated their&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is twofold: identify and define the fields of intervention of EPs&#xD;
      adapted to the specific needs of addictology patients. And validate, through a pilot study,&#xD;
      the intermediate effectiveness of EP intervention. This EP intervention will be built on the&#xD;
      areas of expertise defined in the first step. Intermediate effectiveness will be measured by&#xD;
      patients' ability to manage their addiction. The first part of the study will consist of a&#xD;
      preliminary qualitative patient-centered study to clarify patients' needs and expectations&#xD;
      regarding the content of the EPs' intervention into a one addictology service of the&#xD;
      university hospital of Bichat, Paris, France. This will make it possible to translate these&#xD;
      needs into fields of expertise to address during the EPs' intervention and will result in the&#xD;
      creation of a hetero-questionnaire. The second part of the study will consist of a&#xD;
      before-and-after comparative study on inpatients who are their own controls based on the&#xD;
      hetero-questionnaire constructed through the qualitative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will identify the main EP's intervention fields in addictology in which EP are&#xD;
      more relevant to patients. Thus, their inpatient interventions can be validated and improved,&#xD;
      and better carried by addiction professionals.&#xD;

      1. Targeted population : Major individuals hospitalized in the Department of Addictology&#xD;
           and Psychiatry at Bichat Hospital. All participants sign a hospitalization contract upon&#xD;
           arrival in which they undertake, among other things, to meet with the EP, within the&#xD;
           framework of a system set up in the hospitalization unit since 2015. In order to be able&#xD;
           to study the different factors influencing the intervention mechanism, it is decided to&#xD;
           take the broadest possible selection criteria in order to remain representative of the&#xD;
           heterogeneity of the target population. This is why the investigators have chosen to&#xD;
           include all hospitalized patients in the service who agree to meet with an EP, at all&#xD;
           socio-economic levels, for withdrawal from any substance regardless of the severity of&#xD;
           the addictive disorder, regardless of the previous course of care with or without&#xD;
           anxiety and depression symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inclusion criteria : Adults, hospitalized during the period of inclusion of the study in&#xD;
           the addictology department at the Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris, for&#xD;
           withdrawal. Substance use disorder, diagnosed according to the criteria of the DSM-5,&#xD;
           i.e. at least 2 diagnostic criteria. Patients who have received information about the&#xD;
           research and signed the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non inclusion criteria : Severe cognitive disorders, i.e. MoCA test &lt; 11, Severe&#xD;
           psychiatric disorders assessed using the MINI test (acute psychotic episode, manic or&#xD;
           hypomanic episode, severe depression), No understanding of French, Patient under&#xD;
           guardianship or curatorship, Patient refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study conduct : STEP 1: Preliminary qualitative study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  among the first eligible patients in the study to specify the content of EP's&#xD;
                intervention, adapted to the inpatient's needs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individual face-to-face interview, conducted by the principal investigator (PI) ,&#xD;
                according to the methodology socio-anthropological interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The interview will be conducted during the patient's hospitalization, whether the&#xD;
                patient has already met with the EP or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of participants expected is not decided, the PI waiting for the saturation&#xD;
                of information as it happens as the interviews progressed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A semi-structured interview grid will be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The interviews will be recorded and transcribed in the form of verbatim and then&#xD;
                analyzed according to the content analysis technique&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This analysis will be supervised by a socio- anthropologist from the research team&#xD;
                of Robert Debré&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The needs of patients will be produced by this analysis, and will be translated&#xD;
                into fields of skills to be addressed during the EP's intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  End of the study for these first participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           STEP 2: Before and after comparative study on inpatients being their own witnesses. This&#xD;
           is a study feasibility pilot&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligible participants will be patients meeting the criteria for judgment and not&#xD;
                having not participated in the first part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  They will be presented with the study and the collection of the consent at the&#xD;
                beginning of hospitalization, before the EP's intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After agreement of participation, the initial socio-economic participants'&#xD;
                characteristics will be collected on the variable collection notebook&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Completion of the first competency assessment hetero-questionnaire before the EP's&#xD;
                intervention (main criterion judgment evaluation). This questionnaire will have&#xD;
                been constructed based on patient needs expressed in Part 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  EP's Intervention, with patients hospitalized for withdrawal. These are weekly&#xD;
                individual interviews, in room, proposed by the EPs to inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The second hetero-questionnaire will be proposed to the same patient during his&#xD;
                hospitalization, within 48 hours of the EP's intervention (main criterion judgment&#xD;
                evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A follow-up (by telephone or in person) will be carried out at 1 month and then 3&#xD;
                months to estimate the number of patients who have consumed during the&#xD;
                hospitalization (frequency, quantity, duration)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  End of the study for a patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Inclusion : For the qualitative study, the investigators estimate that the data are&#xD;
           saturated between 10 and 20 patients. For the quantitative study, the investigators&#xD;
           estimate that there are 10 new patients per month. The investigators hope to include at&#xD;
           least half of the target population, meaning 50 participants over the 10 months of the&#xD;
           study. In total, for the entire study, an estimate of 70 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistics analysis : The statistical analysis will be performed using SAS v9.3®. The&#xD;
           quantitative variables will be presented as median, interquartile and missing data. The&#xD;
           qualitative variables will be presented in terms of frequency, percentage and number of&#xD;
           missing data. The initial characteristics of the patients will be presented. The&#xD;
           indicators qualitative and quantitative acceptability will also be presented. The median&#xD;
           of the results of the competency questionnaires between D0 and H48 will be compared&#xD;
           between the group before and after by a Wilcoxon test (no hypothesis on the distribution&#xD;
           of this variable). A multivariate analysis will be conducted to identify all the factors&#xD;
           influencing the variation in questionnaire responses. This will allow the influence of&#xD;
           patient profiles on outcomes to be taken into account.&#xD;
