  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Despite the availability of effective treatment to reach symptom control, nearly&#xD;
      half of the asthma patients remain inadequately controlled. There is a need for timely and&#xD;
      appropriate treatment of patients with uncontrolled asthma. Improving asthma control could be&#xD;
      achieved by a better identification of causes followed by remediating modifiable factors in&#xD;
      primary care or referral to secondary care. However, major gaps in evidence-based asthma&#xD;
      practice exist in primary care. So far, there is a lack of knowledge on the prevalence of&#xD;
      inadequate asthma and associated characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to determine the proportion of primary care patients with&#xD;
      inadequate asthma control, as assessed during a regular control consultation with the general&#xD;
      practice nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a non-interventional prospective observational study, taking place in a&#xD;
      real-world primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients diagnosed with asthma, who attend a pre-planned primary care&#xD;
      asthma review, are eligible to participate. A limited number of in- and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be adopted, to make sure the research population closely resembles the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with&#xD;
      inadequate asthma control. Inadequate asthma control will be defined as an exacerbation in&#xD;
      the past 4 weeks and/or an ACQ6 (i.e., Asthma Control Questionnaire) score &gt;0.75.&#xD;

        Primary care patients with a current asthma diagnosis, who are scheduled to have in-person&#xD;
        asthma review consultations with a primary care nurse, will be recruited from primary care&#xD;
        practices located in the northern part of the Netherlands. The population includes men and&#xD;
        women ≥18 years of age with clinically diagnosed asthma. The diagnosis of asthma is allowed&#xD;
        to be a clinical diagnosis rendered by a doctor, without the requirement to conduct&#xD;
        additional confirmatory testing. Furthermore, a limited number of in- and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria will be adopted, to make sure the research population closely resembles the real&#xD;
        world.&#xD;
