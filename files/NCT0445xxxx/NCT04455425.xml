  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is classically described as a sexually transmitted disease. As this source of&#xD;
      contagious has been described long ago -mainly though by observation- when children presents&#xD;
      with acquired syphilis, child abuse is always considered and must be ruled out by specialists&#xD;
      in a careful evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, muco-cutaneous lesions can be a contagious source for congenital syphilis; therefore&#xD;
      the possibility of non-sexual transmission through intimate contact with infected people&#xD;
      through humid lesions (such as in kisses, breastfeeding, food-handling) or contaminated&#xD;
      fomites (towels, bed sheets, underwear, cups, pacifiers, cutlery) could be considered.&#xD;
      Experts worldwide have observed this non-sexual transmission, as described in many reports in&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study retrospectively patients from a cohort with non-sexual&#xD;
      transmission. The diagnosis criteria used for acquired syphilis were as follows: age under 18&#xD;
      years with treponemic and nontreponemic positive tests, secondary-syphilis suspicious lesions&#xD;
      and negative maternal syphilis serology. Nonsexual contagious was defined as contacts without&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial indicators of sexual abuse according to current guides. In this&#xD;
      cohort, in every case a psychosocial evaluation was completed with a written report in order&#xD;
      to evaluate sexual contact probability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teamo will describe these patients clinical and laboratory findings, family and close&#xD;
      acquaintances serologies and probable source of contagious.&#xD;
