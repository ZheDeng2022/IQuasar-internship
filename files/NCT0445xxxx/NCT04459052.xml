    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study will be to further our understanding of how N Acetyl Cysteine&#xD;
      (NAC) can help to support dopaminergic function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We&#xD;
      plan to use pre and post Positron emission tomography magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI)&#xD;
      with [F-18] Fluorodopa (FDOPA) to measure dopamine function, serum measures of NAC&#xD;
      concentrations, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure inflammatory and oxidative&#xD;
      stress markers, and neurological measures to assess clinical symptoms, in patients with PD&#xD;
      who are given oral capsules plus IV infusions of NAC in addition to standard of care for PD&#xD;
      for 6 months in an open label cross over design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two arms in this crossover design study. The first arm of this study&#xD;
      will receive intravenous and oral NAC, which is a strong antioxidant that increases brain&#xD;
      glutathione, which may be beneficial in PD. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally&#xD;
      occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement and also is&#xD;
      available as an injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen&#xD;
      overdose. Laboratory studies have displayed some benefits to use of NAC, such as its&#xD;
      potential to counteract intracellular damage that leads to dopaminergic neuron death. It also&#xD;
      has the potential to reduce markers of oxidative damage, protect against dopamine cell death&#xD;
      from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) toxicity, and to increase&#xD;
      glutathione in blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in PD patients.&#xD;
      The second arm will be a waitlist control receiving standard PD care. It should be noted that&#xD;
      both arms will receive standard of care treatment for PD which will be augmented with NAC. A&#xD;
      key component of this study is to evaluate the effects of NAC on dopamine, using PET imaging&#xD;
      with FDOPA. Specifically, we will plan to study changes in dopamine levels before and after&#xD;
      receiving approximately nutritional support with NAC.. This will allow us to evaluate whether&#xD;
      NAC helps to support dopamine function. FDOPA PET imaging will be conducted at baseline and&#xD;
      then after the nutritional support or standard of care for the waitlist arm. Then the&#xD;
      waitlist group will receive NAC and the arm that received NAC initially will be crossed over&#xD;
      to a standard of care group. FDOPA imaging will be conducted at the end of that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluation of the dopamine function, [F-18] Fluorodopa (FDOPA), dose (5-10 millicurie&#xD;
      (mCi), Â± 20%) will be injected intravenously into an antecubital vein. Subjects will be&#xD;
      premedicated with 200 mg of carbidopa orally approximately one hour prior to injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDOPA has been available for over 30 years but has not been previously approved for&#xD;
      commercial use by the FDA..We will be obtaining the FDOPA from the University of Pennsylvania&#xD;
      cyclotron that has produced FDOPA for many Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) It&#xD;
      will also be beneficial to assess whether there are specific changes in levels of different&#xD;
      molecules that are related to energy consumption and oxidative stress. Proton MR spectroscopy&#xD;
      (1H-MRS) has been previously performed in Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonian syndromes&#xD;
      to evaluate in vivo concentrations of basal ganglia and cerebral cortex metabolites such as&#xD;
      N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr). We plan to include MRS as an&#xD;
      additional biomarker to evaluate the potential effects of the nutritional supplements and/or&#xD;
      NAC on oxidative stress and cerebral activity in PD patients.&#xD;
