  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time restricted feeding (TRF) has been emerging as a potential weight loss strategy that&#xD;
      avoids major dietary changes but achieves strong effects. It also improves insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity through increased human growth hormone. This effect helps to improve the root&#xD;
      cause of weight gain and has additional benefits for women with PCOS.&#xD;
