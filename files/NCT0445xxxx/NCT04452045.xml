  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will acquire preliminary data on the feasibility and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      innovative and scalable strategy for improving access to effective sleep health care for&#xD;
      preschool-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The investigators will develop&#xD;
      and test an on-line delivery adaptation of the existing behavioral sleep interventions for&#xD;
      preschool aged children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Access to effective treatments for sleep disorders is a persistent challenge. This is due to&#xD;
      the lack of trained clinicians as well as caregiver resources to seek out and utilize such&#xD;
      critical services. The SweetDreams intervention will solve this problem with on-line delivery&#xD;
      of educational materials and treatment strategies for an evidence-based intervention. It will&#xD;
      be readily available to caregivers at any time and through multiple outlets such a computer,&#xD;
      tablet, and telephone, modes of delivery favored by and effective for parents of children in&#xD;
      this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This adaptation will address key challenges to sleep health care for children with ASD: (1)&#xD;
      Learning differences of children with ASD by incorporating intervention principles from the&#xD;
      TEACHH model; (2) Overcome the challenge of treatment access due to the limited number of&#xD;
      qualified providers by developing didactic videos for online and mobile device delivery&#xD;
      (referred to as SweetDreams); and, (3) Responding to the NIH emphasis on developing &quot;more&#xD;
      effective interventionsâ€¦by targeting interventions to the identified needs of community&#xD;
      members,&quot; SweetDreams will use a dynamic process involving extensive collaboration with&#xD;
      children, parents, developmental pediatricians, and other experts on youth with ASD.&#xD;
