  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the one-way drug-drug interaction potential of&#xD;
      quizartinib on dabigatran etexilate in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential intestinal inhibitory effect of quizartinib on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a Pgp substrate dabigatran etexilate in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this clinical study is that quizartinib, as a P-gp inhibitor, may increase&#xD;
      the systemic exposure (measured by area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] and maximum&#xD;
      concentration [Cmax]) of P-gp substrates that may be sensitive to intestinal P-gp inhibition.&#xD;
