  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to describe the administration practices of the&#xD;
      antalgic Ketamine in French CLCC (Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer) in terms of indication&#xD;
      (neuropathic sequelae pains, morphine additional effect or morphine withdrawal, intensity,&#xD;
      localisation…) and administration protocol (route, posology, duration, administration&#xD;
      sequence, premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate in the context of cancer, the analgesic efficacy,&#xD;
      the tolerance profile (biological and clinical toxicities) and the quality of life, including&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the described parameters will be evaluated as safety and efficacy predictive&#xD;
      factors of the Ketamine in oncology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 382,000 new cancers have been diagnosed in France in 2018. Regular progresses in their&#xD;
      management have improved the overall survival of patients, sometimes with sequelae that may&#xD;
      be particularly painful. Thus for 20 to 45% of patients treated for breast cancer, pain&#xD;
      persists 5 years later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If remission is a regularly reached target, cancer was also the cause of 157,000 deaths in&#xD;
      2018 in France, preceded by months or years of progression of a chronic disease that&#xD;
      regularly causes pain. Pain during cancer (chronic cancer pain for CIM-11) remains a frequent&#xD;
      symptom, and its prevalence has slightly changed during the last 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the European EPIC study, carried out in 2006, 76% of the cancer patients (and 62% of&#xD;
      French patients) presented moderate to severe pains linked to cancer, daily for more than&#xD;
      half of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even when identified, chronic cancer pain is still under-treated in 25 to 60% of cases&#xD;
      worldwide, including in the most developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When well-managed, pain's management now allows the relief of almost 80% of patients. Pain's&#xD;
      management is based in particular on a precise and adapted use of the different opioids&#xD;
      through different routes of administration (oral, transdermal, trans-mucosal, parenteral,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neuropathic component of pain exists in almost a third of cases and may require specific&#xD;
      treatments when opioids are insufficient. In all cases, the treatment is integrated into a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary management, in connection with the ongoing oncological treatments, the&#xD;
      loco-regional treatments available (radiotherapy, interventional radiology, etc.) and with an&#xD;
      adapted psychosocial management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) indicated as a high dose&#xD;
      anesthetic. It is used in the context of peri-operative pain for its anti-hyperalgesic&#xD;
      properties. These properties have led to its use also in palliative care (outside the&#xD;
      marketing authorization [AMM]) to treat hyperalgesia linked to the use of high-doses of&#xD;
      opioids, as well as depression. For non-cancer pains, ketamine is widely used by centres and&#xD;
      consultations specialized in refractory chronic pain management in different pains not&#xD;
      relieved by standard treatments: neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, etc., or even in opioids&#xD;
      weaning aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bibliographic data are not homogeneous and of low quality. Despite the weakness of the&#xD;
      available data, ketamine is widely used in France in chronic pain in situation of therapeutic&#xD;
      impasse. The protocols used vary according to the prescribers and services practices: venous&#xD;
      route in general, sometimes subcutaneous or even oral; doses varying from 30 to 200 mg / day,&#xD;
      infusion duration varying from a few hours to several days, discontinuous administration by&#xD;
      cycle or continuous administration, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge is too limited in oncology to have a consensus on the use of ketamine :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Often retrospective studies with heterogeneous treatment protocols;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studied populations also heterogeneous, with insufficiently documented indications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff not able to answer adequately the questions raised. This situation largely&#xD;
           explains the heterogeneity of the Ketamine practices of use in oncology&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to draw up an inventory of the ketamine use by the French CLCCs pain teams&#xD;
      and to identify the profile of patients in whom i) the treatment is ineffective and must be&#xD;
      avoided regarding toxicities ii) the potential efficacy required further investigations.&#xD;
      Built on a methodology close to the OKAPI study, the KETACANCER study will enable to compare&#xD;
      indirectly the results of the two studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, it is proposed to conduct the KETACANCER prospective study in a precise&#xD;
      population defined a priori, and corresponding to the following indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathic sequelae pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional effect of morphine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morphine weaning.&#xD;

        This is a prospective, multicentre study, considered as &quot; non-RIPH (Recherche n'Impliquant&#xD;
        pas la Personne Humaine &quot;. Indeed, the patient's participation in the study and the&#xD;
        completion of the various questionnaires has no impact on patient's safety and is not&#xD;
        likely to change his/her management. The treatment will be conducted according to the&#xD;
        standard practices of each participating site (continuous or discontinuous protocol,&#xD;
        dosage, rhythm of administration, monitoring, etc.). The questionnaires and scales used in&#xD;
        this study are part of the recommended tools for monitoring this population.&#xD;
