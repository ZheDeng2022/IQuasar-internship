  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is excessive fat build-up in the liver with insulin&#xD;
      resistance due to causes other than alcohol use.The obesity epidemic is closely associated&#xD;
      with the rising prevalence and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Currently, the&#xD;
      only treatment modality for patients with fatty liver disease is weight loss and exercise&#xD;
      which is challenging for most patients. Therefore, a huge need exists for an alternative&#xD;
      approach to reducing alanine transaminase (ALT) &amp; aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels for&#xD;
      these patients. Low level laser light therapy (LLLT) offers a simple, non-invasive, safe,&#xD;
      effective and side-effect free alternative to achieving this goal, through LLLT's proven&#xD;
      ability to effect weight loss, body circumference reduction and lipid profile modification&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common disorder and refers to a group of&#xD;
      conditions where there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver of people who drink little&#xD;
      or no alcohol. The most common form of NAFLD is a non serious condition called fatty liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD is part of the metabolic syndrome characterized by diabetes, or pre-diabetes (insulin&#xD;
      resistance), being overweight or obese, elevated blood lipids such as cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglycerides, as well as high blood pressure. A few studies have suggested that weight loss&#xD;
      may be associated with regression of fat within the liver. Therefore, the most important&#xD;
      recommendations for people with fatty liver are to lose weight if they are overweight or&#xD;
      obese, increase their physical activity, follow a balanced diet and unnecessary medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated low-level laser therapy (LLLT) or light-emitting diode&#xD;
      (LED) therapy and have made advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms LLLT&#xD;
      in biological systems. Few studies explain the effect of low level laser therapy on liver&#xD;
      enzymes and non alcoholic fatty liver risk factors (as obesity).So, our goal was to perform a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of the LLLT on lipid profile, body&#xD;
      weight and liver enzymes&#xD;
