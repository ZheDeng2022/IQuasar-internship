  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation aims to generate clinical data to support the use of Multispectral&#xD;
      Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) in clinical practice, its inclusion in diagnostic guidelines&#xD;
      and to support its reimbursement, specifically to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further validate the application with respect to including ulcerative colitis patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prepare a study protocol for large-scale clinical validation study in inflammatory bowel&#xD;
           disease (IBD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Successfully execute the clinical validation study&#xD;

      The clinical investigation, EUPHORIA, will pave the way to establish Multispectral&#xD;
      Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) technology for the non-invasive assessment of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation in patients. EUPHORIA will enable commercialization of the technology by&#xD;
      finalizing technical improvements that will increase diagnostic outcome beyond what has been&#xD;
      shown in a first feasibility study, will improve usability, prepare CE marking for the new&#xD;
      device and validate clinical results in a large clinical investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition, posing significant burden to&#xD;
      patients and health care systems. Patients suffer from a relapsing course of intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation, and to date, there is no satisfying noninvasive diagnostic modality for&#xD;
      monitoring disease activity. In a recent clinical study conducted by University Hospital&#xD;
      Erlangen, MSOT, a technology developed by iThera Medical (ITM), has proven to be superior in&#xD;
      diagnostic performance to other procedures.&#xD;

    <description>Assess performance of other non-invasive diagnostic modalities in order to allow for comparison to MSOT performance. Diagnostic accuracy of each of the various non-invasive tests (CRP, fCal, US, MRI) with respect to the endoscopy (reference test) and histology will be calculated using standard techniques for diagnostic studies. This includes cross tabulation of the index test results by the results of the reference standard, as well as plots of their distribution and ROC curves. Area under the Curve (AUC) estimates and conﬁdence intervals (DeLong) will be calculated. Score conﬁdence intervals (Wilson) will be calculated for proportions such as sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and predictive values at the predeﬁned thresholds.</description>

AUC will be estimated for all non-invasive tests with a 95% conﬁdence interval (DeLong) both from the derivation cohort and from the pooled cohorts (derivation + validation) for increased precision. Cohen's κ will be used as a measure of overall agreement. Results will be presented in three-way tables, comparing the new test (MSOT), the non-reference standard (non-invasive modalities), and the reference standard (endoscopy).</description>
