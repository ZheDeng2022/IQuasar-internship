  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-finding study is intended to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of INCB000928 administered as monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with ruxolitinib in participants with MF who are transfusion-dependent or&#xD;
      presenting with symptomatic anemia. This study will consist of 2 parts: dose escalation and&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;

             defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Anemia: An Hgb value &lt; 10 g/dL demonstrated during screening recorded on 3&#xD;
                  separate occasions with at least 7 days between measurements (Note: RBC&#xD;
                  transfusion must be at least 2 weeks before the Hgb measurement during&#xD;
                  screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Transfusion-dependent: Participant has received at least 4 units of RBC&#xD;
                  transfusions during the 28 days immediately preceding Cycle 1 Day 1 OR has&#xD;
                  received an average of at least 4 units of RBC transfusions in the 8 weeks&#xD;
                  immediately preceding Cycle 1 Day 1, for an Hgb level of &lt; 8.5 g/dL, in the&#xD;
                  absence of bleeding or treatment-induced anemia. In addition, the most recent&#xD;
                  transfusion episode must have occurred in the 28 days before Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;

             IWG-MRT criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone any prior allogenic or autologous stem cell transplantation or a candidate&#xD;
             for such transplantation.&#xD;

             biological therapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, antibody or hypomethylating&#xD;
             agent to treat the participant's disease, with the exception of ruxolitinib for TGB&#xD;
             only, within 5 half-lives or 28 days (whichever is shorter) before the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
