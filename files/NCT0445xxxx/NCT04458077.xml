      The primary aim of the Discover Learning Project (Discover) is to test an intervention for&#xD;
      Very Young Adolescents (VYAs) to promote positive, gender norm transformative, social&#xD;
      emotional and identity learning (SEIL). A secondary aim is to better identify effective&#xD;
      components of Discover that are scalable requiring the lowest resources to implement&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project builds on research from transdisciplinary developmental science that indicates&#xD;
      that this period, which the investigators will call early adolescence (ages 10-14), is a&#xD;
      period of dynamic maturational changes. These include the onset of pubertal development,&#xD;
      which begins a period of rapid physical growth (including extensive brain development) and&#xD;
      sexual maturation, as well as changes in cognitive, social, emotional, psychological, and&#xD;
      behavioral processes. An emerging body of evidence supports the idea that this dynamic period&#xD;
      of maturation is a sensitive period for social, emotional and motivational learning-in ways&#xD;
      that can have enduring effects on a broad range of developmental trajectories including&#xD;
      sexual and reproductive health, mental health, gender-based violence, education retention and&#xD;
      attainment, and social development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A foundational element of this research focuses on the social-emotional re-orientation of the&#xD;
      developing brain at the onset of puberty, which appears to create natural affinities for&#xD;
      discovery learning particularly in the social domain. In contrast to didactic learning&#xD;
      models, discovery learning is a process through which learners engage in self-motivated&#xD;
      inquiry, supported by teachers/facilitators, information and materials, in order to&#xD;
      &quot;discover&quot; the intended content (Hammer, 1997). Key elements to creating sustainable&#xD;
      discovery learning include: a) engaging motivation and natural curiosity and b) providing&#xD;
      social scaffolding that includes a balance of monitoring/support while also promoting&#xD;
      youth-driven discoveries (individually and in small groups). From a developmental science&#xD;
      perspective, the beginning of puberty is associated with two important maturational changes&#xD;
      that impact learning opportunities: 1) a general increase in the tendency to explore,&#xD;
      discover, and to seek novelty/excitement; and 2) a particularly strong increase in natural&#xD;
      curiosity to explore and understand one's larger social world, including social roles, social&#xD;
      hierarchies, and an increased sensitivity to issues of social acceptance, admiration, and&#xD;
      learning to establish key aspects of individual identity (Crone &amp; Dahl, 2012). A core element&#xD;
      to this early identity development is understanding oneself as a sexual and gendered&#xD;
      individual in relation to those around her or him; accordingly, early learning experiences&#xD;
      during this developmental window are fundamentally shaping the development of these&#xD;
      identities in ways that have profound implications for all areas of health-especially sexual&#xD;
      and reproductive health and vulnerability to gender-based exploitation and disadvantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this project is to develop and test the Discover Learning intervention&#xD;
      with a goal of promoting positive, gender norm transformative, social-emotional learning&#xD;
      during this crucial early window of opportunity. This work builds on developmentally informed&#xD;
      principles that emphasize the importance of orchestrating a sensitive balance between&#xD;
      promoting autonomy and providing adult engagement in ways that scaffold the discovery&#xD;
      learning experience (Alifieri et al., 2011). The primary content (learning about&#xD;
      interpersonal relationships and concepts of Social-Emotional Identity Learning) and method&#xD;
      (introducing positive socially scaffolded exploration of the use of digital technology for&#xD;
      youth-driven learning) have been chosen to strategically leverage this window of opportunity&#xD;
      occurring during this sensitive period of learning. The approach is designed to help youth&#xD;
      develop agency, become empowered, and to explore healthy pathways to finding meaning and&#xD;
      purpose in their lives. To our knowledge, this is the first use of an integrative&#xD;
      developmental science approach to leverage unique learning opportunities in early adolescence&#xD;
      to impact broad improvements in health and education.&#xD;
