  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testosterone is the principal androgen produced by the male testes. Hypogonadism is the&#xD;
      result of inadequate production of testosterone by the Leydig cells of the testes and is&#xD;
      reflected by total serum concentrations of testosterone of &lt; 300 ng/dL, with discernible&#xD;
      diurnal pattern. The etiology of hypogonadism may be primary or secondary. The treatment of&#xD;
      males with primary, and in some cases, secondary Hypogonadism includes administration of&#xD;
      testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testim® and Fortesta® are topical gels that when applied daily help to increase the total&#xD;
      testosterone levels in the blood through skin absorption. Aveed® is an injectable form of&#xD;
      testosterone treatment and participants randomized to this treatment arm will receive 3&#xD;
      injections over the course of 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect on blood pressure of approved testosterone&#xD;
      products (Testim®, Fortesta®, and Aveed®) after 16 weeks of therapy using 24-hour Ambulatory&#xD;
      blood pressure (ABPM) to reveal shifts in BP levels.&#xD;
