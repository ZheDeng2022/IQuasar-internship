  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical study is to compare two different approaches during dental implant&#xD;
      applications. One group of patients in the study received flapless approach which is&#xD;
      performed without surgical reflection of soft tissues (gums) during implant surgery. In the&#xD;
      control group of the study, patients received conventional flap approach in which flap&#xD;
      reflections performed on soft tissues (gums) of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery patients were monitored for marginal bone loss around implants and&#xD;
      discomfort after the surgery for 3 months. And received data statistically analyzed to&#xD;
      compare the different surgical procedures.&#xD;

      Filling the Case Report Form for each registered patient and signed by the responsible&#xD;
      investigator or an authorized representative of the study staff. This also applies to records&#xD;
      for patients who could not complete the study (even if a case report form was prepared, even&#xD;
      during screening prior to randomization). If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason&#xD;
      for this is recorded in the Case report form. If a patient withdraws from the study because&#xD;
      of a limiting adverse event, all necessary efforts will be made to clearly document the&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All forms must be filled with a typewriter or an indelible ink pen and must be readable.&#xD;
      Errors can be crossed out, but errors cannot be deleted; the correction is entered and the&#xD;
      change is initialed and dated by the investigator or his authorized representative. The&#xD;
      researcher should ensure the accuracy, completeness and legibility of the data reported to&#xD;
      the sponsor in the case report forms and all required reports and that it was processed on&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher is responsible for the accuracy of the data transferred on the forms and will&#xD;
      sign these forms in the sense of showing their compatibility with the recorded data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the power analysis made with G * Power3.1 (Franz Faul, UniversitätKiel,&#xD;
      Germany) software program, it has been determined that the sampling number consisting of 20&#xD;
      people with 0.8 effect size and α = 0.05 significance level generates more than 80% power. it&#xD;
      was deemed appropriate to include a total of 24 people in the study. Karim M. Ahmed A, Salah&#xD;
      Abd Elfatah B, Mohamed Abd El-Mageed Katamish's ''Crestal bone loss of standard implant&#xD;
      versus platform switch implant design using minimal invasive technique'' article is used as a&#xD;
      reference for marginal bone loss data calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sufficient amount of bone were included in the study after bone sounding and x&#xD;
      rays were evaluated after local anesthesia before surgery. By an unbiased researcher, the&#xD;
      patients were recruited to the groups using the envelope method; control group (with flap&#xD;
      raised) or test group (without flap raised) were assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 patients complying with these criteria were included in the study and a total&#xD;
      of 37 implants were applied to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant applications of the patients in the control group were performed by lifting the flap.&#xD;
      The implants of the patients included in the test group were applied without lifting the&#xD;
      flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each implant in the study marginal bone loss were evaluated; Digital bite-wing x-rays&#xD;
      taken with a standard technique were used.Bite-wing x-rays taken were standardized with bite&#xD;
      blocks on the film holder prepared individually for each patient. From each implant site; two&#xD;
      x-rays were taken first immediately after implant surgery and the second three months later,&#xD;
      just before the uncovering session of the implants. Digital bite-wing x-rays were transferred&#xD;
      to RadiAnt Dicom Viewer program and measurements were made on them. Implant diameter values&#xD;
      which is known in the images are accepted as reference.The diameter in the image was measured&#xD;
      and a coefficient was obtained by dividing the real diameter to measurement on image. In the&#xD;
      images, the distance between the most coronal point of the implant neck and the point where&#xD;
      the implant bone contact first occurred was measured. This distance was divided by the&#xD;
      coefficient obtained and its actual values are obtained in mm.The difference between these&#xD;
      distances at two time points were recorded in patient forms as marginal bone loss. In&#xD;
      statistical analysis, comparisons between groups were made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the individuals included in the study came to the control appointments on the 3rd and 7th&#xD;
      days after implant surgery, and the sutures were also taken on the 7th day. All patients were&#xD;
      asked to fill the Turkish translation of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) forms three&#xD;
      times: preoperatively, postoperative day 3, and postoperative day 7. Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) forms were asked to be marked by the patients on the 3rd and 7th days after the&#xD;
      operation. VAS forms were prepared as a horizontal line with one side being the lowest score&#xD;
      and the other side with highest score. VAS forms were prepared to be in 0-100 mm and the&#xD;
      point marked by the patient was measured in cm. In VAS forms, patients were asked to mark&#xD;
      according to their post-operative pain status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the data in this study was done with Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS) 20 (International Business Machines Corporation Somers, New York, USA)&#xD;
      package program.In the evaluation of the data, besides descriptive statistical methods (mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation), T test was used for comparisons between groups. ANOVA test was used for&#xD;
      multiple group comparisons. Statistical significance level was determined as p &lt;0.05 .&#xD;
