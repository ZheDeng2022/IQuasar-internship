  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of digital promotions of a Supplemental&#xD;
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) fruit and vegetable incentive program on SNAP participant&#xD;
      patronage and sales at farmers' markets. The study will analyze SNAP transactions from zip&#xD;
      codes that receive digital promotions compared to zip codes that receive no additional&#xD;
      promotions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) financial incentives for fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables (FV) increase FV purchases and consumption with long-term implications for&#xD;
      nutrition-related chronic disease. However, many SNAP participants are not aware of these&#xD;
      programs, leaving them underutilized. The investigators aim to assess if digital promotions&#xD;
      of SNAP incentive programs increase SNAP patronage and sales at farmers' markets. Eligible&#xD;
      farmers' markets in the New England Nutrition Incentives Collaborative (NENIC) will receive&#xD;
      digital promotions for their SNAP fruit and vegetable incentive programs on the Fresh EBT app&#xD;
      and Facebook, randomly assigned to nearby eligible zip codes. Eligible zip codes will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the intervention (digital promotion) or serve as a comparison (no&#xD;
      additional promotion) with ads running for 13 weeks (Summer 2020 market season).&#xD;
