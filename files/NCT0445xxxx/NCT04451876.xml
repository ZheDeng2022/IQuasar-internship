    <textblock>
      The percentage of hypertension among adults aged 18 is relatively high which is about 30% in&#xD;
      Malaysia. Uncontrolled hypertension will increase the risk of diseases especially&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. However, adults still lack awareness about the importance of&#xD;
      knowledge of hypertension. In between, online health information seeking and the use of&#xD;
      social media to gather health information have been quite a norm among students. The wide use&#xD;
      of this platform has been proven in various researches and studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted among the undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM to look at the&#xD;
      various socio-demographic factors associated with their level of knowledge on hypertension.&#xD;
      Therefore, this may lead to a need to plan awareness programs on hypertension and to increase&#xD;
      the knowledge of hypertension among health science students in the future. A cross-sectional&#xD;
      study design will be done for this study. All undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM will be&#xD;
      selected through simple random sampling. Online questionnaires will be given via the selected&#xD;
      student email platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are limitations for this study where we only focus on the students of FMHS,&#xD;
      UPM. Hence, the results of this study may be limited to them only. The causal relationship&#xD;
      cannot be determined by this study design as well. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the social media use, online health information seeking practices with knowledge on&#xD;
      hypertension among undergraduate students in FMHS, UPM, and its associated factors&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Hypertension is a medical condition that acts as an important public health&#xD;
      problem worldwide. It contributes to the disease which is mostly seen in primary health care&#xD;
      settings such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure, and premature death if it is&#xD;
      not diagnosed as soon as possible. The World Health Organization (WHO) significantly mentions&#xD;
      that an estimation of 1.13 billion people worldwide from poor countries where the healthcare&#xD;
      system is weak have been detected with hypertension. Hypertension also puts an enormous&#xD;
      financial pressure towards individuals and medical services via utilizing limited resources .&#xD;
      Hypertension is predisposed to multiple factors. Such factors vary from country to country&#xD;
      and there is also a disparity between urban and rural areas of the same location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Malaysia, 30% of adults above 18 have hypertension. Based on another study, it was proven&#xD;
      that adults with uncontrolled hypertensive portrayed a higher risk of CVD mortality when&#xD;
      compared to normotensive adults. It was reported that there were 3550 of them all caused&#xD;
      hypertensive death and based on that 1027 are caused by cardiovascular disease; 771 are&#xD;
      caused by heart-specific diseases and 256 by a cerebrovascular specific disease. However,&#xD;
      untreated hypertension was stated to be the high risk of all caused death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a study by Grad I. et al, global knowledge on hypertension among adults is&#xD;
      relatively low which is almost 49.2%. Whereas for medium knowledge on hypertension has 38%&#xD;
      and only reported that 13% has higher knowledge on hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Besides, adults also have insufficient knowledge on epidemiology, method of treatment, and&#xD;
      avoidance of hypertension(6).In addition, a good understanding of hypertension has also been&#xD;
      linked with enhanced compliance with medications and good control of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Loiselle (1995), health information behavior is basically defined as a&#xD;
      self-regulatory technique used by patients to coordinate transactions between self-related&#xD;
      and health-related settings with the goal of balancing instrumental benefits and informative&#xD;
      subjective costs. The students use electronic health knowledge to take some essential&#xD;
      health-related decisions and actions. Students reported using the health details gathered&#xD;
      more as a guide for lifestyle changes (72.4%) and the rest is dealing with healthcare&#xD;
      practitioners online about the change in medication and guide of lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO states that many people, primarily in the developing world, have access to online medical&#xD;
      information, engage in online groups, buy well-being goods and services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the other side, hospital reports are often linked up by health agencies. The search for&#xD;
      online health information has been on the increase and the knowledge gained has diverse&#xD;
      influences on the healthcare outcomes of human beings. Based on a study conducted on 4504&#xD;
      respondents about mobile health use and perception among Malaysians in Selangor, only 1 in 5&#xD;
      respondents reported using some health-related application or mobile health device. The&#xD;
      analysis of the health details that Malaysia is pursuing is still limited. From the point of&#xD;
      view of scientific research, not much study has been done on different problems that occurred&#xD;
      in the sense of finding health knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the interventional strategies to the elimination of health inequalities is by&#xD;
      utilizing social media as a popular way to get health information. Depending on the concepts&#xD;
      of loyalty and mutuality, social media promotes the sharing of life-enhancing services, such&#xD;
      as health-related knowledge and social ties. In fact, social media sites are activating&#xD;
      feedback systems that result in an enhanced degree of self-efficacy, which is vital in&#xD;
      sustaining healthier behaviors and adhering to treatment. It becomes a mixture of direct&#xD;
      contact and mainstream media which is personalized and responsive. Social networking media,&#xD;
      including Facebook, one of the social media networking platforms, has such connectivity&#xD;
      features in their architecture. As of 2004, it has been extremely popular with more than 350&#xD;
      million users around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-communicable diseases constitute a worldwide crisis that contributes to more than 36&#xD;
      million (63 %) of all mortality globally. Almost 29 million (80%) of such deaths arise in&#xD;
      low-and middle-income nations. Increasing use of social media implies a strategy to achieve&#xD;
      scalability or even overcome barriers that often impede public health measures. For example,&#xD;
      a smartphone-based home glucose monitoring service has been implemented through which&#xD;
      community health professionals have given clinical advice for diabetic patients through&#xD;
      smartphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social media use, health information seeking, and knowledge on hypertension in Malaysia&#xD;
      are not well studied. It is beneficial to have an overview of the social media use, health&#xD;
      information seeking and knowledge on hypertension among the students of Faculty of Medicine&#xD;
      and Health Science (FMHS), UPM because they are individuals who will work in a healthcare&#xD;
      setting in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, knowledge of hypertension is relatively very important to reduce the&#xD;
      prevalence of hypertension and to create more awareness among the public. Ways of getting&#xD;
      knowledge and online health information like social media are important as it is becoming a&#xD;
      popular form of information. This study will be conducted among the students in FMHS, UPM&#xD;
      because of the variety of sociodemographic factors present that will be a platform to see the&#xD;
      association between the factors and their level of knowledge on hypertension. Moreover, this&#xD;
      may be a good start to plan an awareness program on Hypertension and also initiate programs&#xD;
      to increase the knowledge of hypertension among the students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVE General Objective To determine the social media use, online health&#xD;
      information seeking and knowledge on hypertension among students in FMHS, UPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objective I. To determine the socio-demographic factors (age, gender, race, family&#xD;
      income status, undergraduate course and year of study) of students of FMHS, UPM. II. To&#xD;
      determine the social media use of students among FMHS, UPM. III. To determine the online&#xD;
      health information-seeking behavior on hypertension among students of FMHS, UPM. IV. To&#xD;
      determine the level of knowledge on hypertension among students of FMHS, UPM. V. To study the&#xD;
      association of socio-demographic factors, social media use and online health information&#xD;
      seeking on the knowledge of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INSTRUMENTS Study instruments include a questionnaire adapted from a previously&#xD;
      published questionnaire. The questionnaire to assess the social media use and health&#xD;
      information seeking was adapted from a study about Health Information Seeking and Social&#xD;
      Media Use on the Internet among people with Diabetes. The hypertension knowledge&#xD;
      questionnaire was adapted from a tool developed to assess hypertension knowledge among urban&#xD;
      patients. This questionnaire is prepared in English and is divided into four parts.&#xD;
