  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of a manualized treatment (Goal Management Training, or&#xD;
      GMT) on the cognitive impairments associated with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), as&#xD;
      well as any impact on PTSD symptems themselves. Participants will be randomized to either GMT&#xD;
      group treatment, or a wait list condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD has an emotional impact on individuals, but it is also associated with impaired&#xD;
      cognitive functioning (e.g., processing speed, attention, executive functioning). This study&#xD;
      is an effectiveness trial investigating a cognitive remediation intervention (Goal Management&#xD;
      Training, or GMT) that has been shown to improve the cognitive impairment observed in other&#xD;
      populations (e.g., older adults). The present study will investigate the impact of GMT in&#xD;
      adults experiencing PTSD (including frontline healthcare workers suffering from PTSD related&#xD;
      to the COVID-19 pandemic) and its associated cognitive impairment. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions - GMT, or a wait list condition (in&#xD;
      which GMT will be postponed for approximately 21 weeks). Due to the pandemic, this study will&#xD;
      be conducted primarily online (i.e., online assessments and treatment, with optional fMRI&#xD;
      scans - functional magnetic resonance imaging). Once all assessments are complete,&#xD;
      participants in the wait list condition will be able to begin GMT thelmselves.&#xD;

    <description>GMT is a structured, short-term cognitive remediation program with an emphasis on mindfulness and practice in planning and completion of goal-oriented behaviours. The main objective of GMT is to help participants regain executive control in order to better define goals and monitor performance in achieving them. Sessions include instructional material, interactive tasks, discussion of patients' real-life deficits, and homework assignments. Mindfulness meditation is also incorporated for the purpose of developing the skill of bringing one's mind to the present to monitor ongoing behaviour, goal states, and the relationship between them, and for the development of attentional control. The program incorporates real-life examples to illustrate goal attainment failures and successes, as well as in-session practice of complex tasks that mimic real-life tasks - typically a challenge for individuals with executive function deficits (e.g., planning and set-shifting tasks).</description>
