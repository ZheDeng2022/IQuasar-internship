  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NACT is a heavy oncologic treatment, which can impair functional capacity, nutritional and&#xD;
      emotional status. These three impairments are often ignored and not taken into account in the&#xD;
      pre-therapeutic evaluations but are correlated with postoperative morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      after major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a prehabilitation before surgery, including physical, nutritional and psycho-social&#xD;
      support, has been defined. From a literature review, the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max)&#xD;
      seems to constitute a strong evaluation factor reflecting physical fitness, easily measured&#xD;
      with a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) at maximal effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown beneficial effects of trimodal prehabilitation programs on&#xD;
      postoperative functional capacity, return to daily activities and pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based program and connected devices may improve the feasibility and the compliance to&#xD;
      this program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that performing a connected supervised home-based and&#xD;
      patient-tailored multimodal prehabilitation program from diagnosis to surgery (with or&#xD;
      without ERAS program) during NACRT, for patients managed for ovarian cancer, will limit&#xD;
      physical fitness alteration and will positively affect postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study consists in an early and multidimensional (combining nutritional, physical,&#xD;
      emotional and medical support) prehabilitation program during NACT for patients with ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, in order to limit physical alteration before surgical treatment, and therefore&#xD;
      improve postoperative outcomes. It will include a home-based prehabilitation program, in&#xD;
      order to allow care access to all eligible patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective will be to determine if a prehabilitation program during NACT, for&#xD;
      patients treated for an advanced ovarian cancer will limit physical alteration before major&#xD;
      abdomino-pelvic surgery, compared to a control group without prehabilitation program. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the comparison of the variation of VO2 max, between baseline and&#xD;
      surgery, in the prehabilitation group vs control group: VO2 max will be measured with a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) at maximal effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, multicentric randomized control trial will be conducted in 7 French&#xD;
      comprehensive cancer Centers or University Hospital, in compliance with inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      After an initial evaluation, patients will be randomized in two groups: Prehabilitation group&#xD;
      (P group) and a Control group (C group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the P group, after baseline evaluation, we will be offering from diagnosis to surgery,&#xD;
      during the NACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standardized, patient-tailored preoperative physical activity training program will be&#xD;
           performed at home, from diagnosis to surgery. Supervision will be done with connected&#xD;
           device (connected watches) and activity will be adapted,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A nutritional care established in respect of the SFNEP-SFNCM guidelines. Nutritional&#xD;
           support will be adapted by a dietician according to information transmitted daily&#xD;
           (connected body fat weight scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A psychological support with coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the C group: Patients with ovarian cancer will undergo NACT after baseline evaluation&#xD;
      without prehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After NACT, for both groups, major abdomino-pelvic surgery will be done with or without ERAS&#xD;
      pathway, according to the practice in each center.&#xD;
