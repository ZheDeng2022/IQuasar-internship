  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is known to be one of the most common health concerns in in the general population&#xD;
      and has been associated with several health consequences. Medications are known to be&#xD;
      effective, and currently serve as the primary treatment for insomnia but their use is limited&#xD;
      due to the risk of adverse events. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-1) has also been shown&#xD;
      to be effective and safer in the treatment of insomnia but presents its own limitations such&#xD;
      as the time, cost, and training required. The relationship between vestibular stimulation and&#xD;
      sleep continues to be explored, however its usefulness in the treatment of insomnia is still&#xD;
      unknown. Vestibular stimulation itself has been shown to be safe across multiple populations.&#xD;
      If vestibular stimulation is shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia, it could&#xD;
      serve as a safer alternative to medications. It could also require less cost, time, and&#xD;
      training than CBT-1, providing a treatment option that is not only safe and effective, but&#xD;
      broadly available to the general population. Consequently this trial seeks to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of non-invasive electrical vestibular nerve stimulation as a method of improving&#xD;
      sleep quality and quantity, as compared to a sham control, in patients newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      insomnia.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the effect of the VeNS device, relative to control group, on quality of sleep quantified by change in the PSQI score.

    <description>The active device utilizes a technology termed vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS). The device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones and will deliver a small electrical current to the skin behind the ears, over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The sham device looks identical to the active device and interacts with the app in a similar manner to the active device. It will apply some stimulation to a user for a limited period of time (30 seconds), before tapering down to zero over a further 20 seconds, thus creating the impression of an active device. The device will be placed on the head in a manner analogous to headphones with hydrogel electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day.</description>

Participants will be advised to use the device at home for 1 hour per day.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data will be transferred in an encrypted PDF format. Trial staff will be given direction on how to share the trial data and given access to one specific section of a controlled cloud service which is controlled via role based access. Once they have authenticated with the service and the service verifies that they have the correct role to access the system they will be directed to a single webpage within the application where they will be able to upload the encrypted PDF. This PDF is generated on the fly and is therefore not stored in another location that could become compromised. Generating the PDF on the fly means that the source data is extracted from the database, processed and delivered in the context of a single request. These data will be transferred for each subject when they complete participation in the study.</ipd_description>
