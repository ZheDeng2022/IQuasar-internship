      Single-center study to determine the relationship between changes in depression symptoms and&#xD;
      electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for many psychiatric illnesses,&#xD;
      including major depressive disorder. While effective, objective markers have not been&#xD;
      developed to predict clinical outcome trajectories following ECT. This is important given the&#xD;
      risks and costs incurred during a full treatment course. Electroencephalography (EEG) is&#xD;
      typically employed to monitor the generation and termination of ECT-induced seizures but&#xD;
      leverage of markers toward prognostication remains a future goal. The investigators have&#xD;
      characterized two distinct EEG patterns associated with ECT-induced generalized seizures and&#xD;
      have two sleep markers that may serve as markers for predicting response to treatment.&#xD;
      Central Positive Complexes (CPCs) are large ictal complexes with a scalp topology of voltage&#xD;
      declining from the top of the head. CPCs are localized to cortical areas that are involved in&#xD;
      the formation of sleep spindles and slow wave sleep. A pattern of low-voltage activity, known&#xD;
      as post-ictal generalized electroencephalographic suppression (PGES), is frequently used to&#xD;
      document termination of these seizures. Additionally, two EEG markers of sleep microstructure&#xD;
      may have utility given their association with synaptic plasticity, a process presumably&#xD;
      invoked over the course of ECT-induced recovery from psychiatric illness as pathologic neural&#xD;
      circuitry undergoes reconfiguration. These two markers, sleep spindles and slow waves show&#xD;
      altered expression patterns in patients with psychiatric disorders, and thus may be useful as&#xD;
      objective markers of ECT responsiveness. None of the above EEG markers have been explored for&#xD;
      an association to interval changes in disease severity over the course of ECT. This project&#xD;
      will incisively probe the relationships between temporal trajectories of major depressive&#xD;
      disorder severity and longitudinal measurements of ictal and postictal EEG markers. Ninety&#xD;
      patients will be followed for up to 22 ECT sessions. Bedside clinical instruments will allow&#xD;
      assessments of depression severity. High-density (65-electrode) EEG caps will be acquired&#xD;
      before and up to 30 minutes following ECT electrical stimulation. Duration of CPCs will be&#xD;
      determined using a novel automated algorithm. Duration of PGES will be evaluated using&#xD;
      recently validated automated algorithms. Wireless wearable devices will address previous&#xD;
      barriers to the longitudinal study of sleep microstructure in the outpatient ECT setting.&#xD;
      Slow wave activity and density of sleep spindles will be evaluated at the first cycle of N3&#xD;
      and N2 sleep, respectively. For a subset of patients, feasibility will be assessed for the&#xD;
      potentiation of slow wave activity through closed loop acoustic stimulation.&#xD;
