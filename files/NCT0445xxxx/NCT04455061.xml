    <textblock>
      More and more critically ill patients have improved early survival, they have been suffering&#xD;
      from organ damage and inflammation for a long time, which is called chronic critical illness&#xD;
      (CCI). Among CCI, persistent inflammatory response-immunosuppression-catabolic syndrome&#xD;
      (PICS) is a special type of chronic severe disease, and immune paralysis is its main feature.&#xD;
      The clinical manifestations are repeated nosocomial infections, malnutrition, muscle loss,&#xD;
      and difficulty in wound healing and require long-term emergency medical support, which&#xD;
      ultimately leads to patients Repeated nosocomial infections, prolonged hospitalization, and&#xD;
      increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut provides the microbiome with habitat and the nutrients it needs, down-regulates the&#xD;
      immune response to form immune tolerance, and promotes its colonization in the&#xD;
      intestine.Under physiological conditions, the mutually beneficial symbiosis of the intestine&#xD;
      and microorganisms promotes the body's homeostasis. The composition and biodiversity of the&#xD;
      microbial community are highly susceptible to various factors, including diet, environment,&#xD;
      drugs, infections, inflammation, etc. Especially for acute stress, severe stress, the use of&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasoconstrictors and opioids, intestinal ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      injury, epithelial cell apoptosis, barrier integrity destruction, gastrointestinal Changes in&#xD;
      the motility of the tract, lack of nutrients in the intestinal cavity, etc. All those can&#xD;
      lead to rapid changes in the intestinal flora, and this change can last for a long time;&#xD;
      manifested by the loss of the richness and diversity of the intestinal microflora (especially&#xD;
      the symbiotic flora), The ratio of Bacteroidetes/thickwalled bacteria is severely unbalanced,&#xD;
      and a single flora (often a potential pathogen) overgrows, that is, bacterial flora imbalance&#xD;
      or microecological disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, for critically ill patients, there are few relevant studies, and currently&#xD;
      limited to small-scale, single cross-sectional studies. These studies have uncovered the&#xD;
      changes and impacts of intestinal microbiota in critically ill patients in ICU, but they are&#xD;
      still in the stage of touching the image of blind people. The relevant mechanisms and dynamic&#xD;
      changes and their significance are unclear, requiring large-scale, dynamic, continuous and&#xD;
      comprehensive In order to accurately grasp the role of intestinal flora in the development&#xD;
      and prognosis of the disease, we hope to accurately control the intestinal flora and achieve&#xD;
      effective treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the improvement and development of medical technology and concepts, the types,&#xD;
      progression, and outcomes of critically ill patients have changed dramatically. More and more&#xD;
      critically ill patients can successfully escape from the early critical state, and the&#xD;
      outbreak of multiple organ failure has been alleviated. However, due to the residual organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, the number of cases staying in the intensive care department for a long time is&#xD;
      increasing. Both severe trauma and sepsis undergo similar transformations. Although these&#xD;
      patients have improved early survival, they have been suffering from organ damage and&#xD;
      inflammation for a long time, which is called chronic critical illness (CCI). The definition&#xD;
      of CCI includes the number of days of ICU hospitalization greater than or equal to 14 days,&#xD;
      evidence of persistent organ dysfunction, and can be measured using components of the 14-day&#xD;
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Even nearly 40% of sepsis patients will&#xD;
      develop CCI. These critical survivors continue to recover and support treatment even after&#xD;
      being discharged from the hospital, often failing to recover and eventually die. Among them,&#xD;
      persistent inflammatory response-immunosuppression-catabolic syndrome (PICS) is a special&#xD;
      type of chronic severe disease, and immune paralysis is its main feature. These patients also&#xD;
      face several challenges such as persistent inflammatory response, acquired immunosuppression,&#xD;
      and high catabolism. The clinical manifestations are repeated nosocomial infections,&#xD;
      malnutrition, muscle loss, and difficulty in wound healing and require long-term emergency&#xD;
      medical support, which ultimately leads to patients Repeated nosocomial infections, prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the decline in organ function reserve of elderly patients, chronic diseases of basic&#xD;
      heart, lung, kidney and other systems are often combined. After suffering trauma and severe&#xD;
      infection, organ function disorders or failures are prone to occur and stay in the ICU ward.&#xD;
      With the advent of an aging population, such patients are increasing year by year. It is a&#xD;
      heavy burden on society and a huge challenge for the future development and progress of ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut flora is involved in a wide range of functions, food digestion, hormone production,&#xD;
      and the development and maturation of the immune system. After more than a billion years of&#xD;
      co-evolution, a stable symbiotic relationship has been formed between mammals including&#xD;
      humans and the gut microbiota. The gut provides the microbiome with habitat and the nutrients&#xD;
      it needs, down-regulates the immune response to form immune tolerance, and promotes its&#xD;
      colonization in the intestine; accordingly, the gut symbiotic microbiota promotes the health&#xD;
      of the body in various ways to form symbiosis Mode: (1) Inhibiting the colonization of&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria by competing for niche and nutrients, producing virulence factors, and&#xD;
      secreting bacteriocins, preventing their overgrowth, and protecting the body from pathogen&#xD;
      infection, called colonization resistance; (2 ) Promote the proliferation of epithelial&#xD;
      cells, secrete antimicrobial peptides and mucus to maintain the integrity of the intestinal&#xD;
      barrier; (3) Indirectly regulate the differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cells&#xD;
      located in the intestinal epithelial barrier and the whole body, promote the development and&#xD;
      maturation of the immune system, and strengthen immune cells Function; (4) Induce&#xD;
      extravascular tissue factor-protease activated receptor 1 (TF-PAR1) signal transduction,&#xD;
      promote small intestine angiogenesis; (5) participate in hormone signal transduction,&#xD;
      regulate intestinal endocrine function; (6) participate in intestinal origin Serotonin (5-HT)&#xD;
      metabolism and intestinal neuro-immune cooperation, regulate gastrointestinal motility; (7)&#xD;
      produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by fermenting dietary fiber, improve glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, participate in anti-inflammatory, Promote intestinal&#xD;
      motility; (8) Synthesize essential vitamins and neurotransmitters and metabolize bile salts;&#xD;
      (9) Participate in body drug metabolism and poison removal. This shows that under&#xD;
      physiological conditions, the mutually beneficial symbiosis of the intestine and&#xD;
      microorganisms promotes the body's homeostasis. The composition and biodiversity of the&#xD;
      microbial community are highly susceptible to various factors, including diet, environment,&#xD;
      drugs, infections, inflammation, etc. Especially for acute stress, severe stress, the use of&#xD;
      broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasoconstrictors and opioids, intestinal ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      injury, epithelial cell apoptosis, barrier integrity destruction, gastrointestinal Changes in&#xD;
      the motility of the tract, lack of nutrients in the intestinal cavity, etc. lead to rapid&#xD;
      changes in the intestinal flora, and this change can last for a long time; manifested by the&#xD;
      loss of the richness and diversity of the intestinal microflora (especially the symbiotic&#xD;
      flora), The ratio of Bacteroidetes/thickwalled bacteria is severely unbalanced, and a single&#xD;
      flora (often a potential pathogen) overgrows, that is, bacterial flora imbalance or&#xD;
      microecological disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local immune inflammatory storm in the intestine is an important cause of the imbalance&#xD;
      of the systemic immune inflammatory response, and the hypothalamic metabolism center is an&#xD;
      important target for regulating the body's continuous catabolism. In PICS, immunosuppression,&#xD;
      inflammation, and catabolism are mutually causal, forming a vicious circle. So what is the&#xD;
      reason for severe patients with different primary diseases to have the same PICS after the&#xD;
      acute phase? Are there common pathological changes induced by PICS in severe patients? If&#xD;
      further studies can be made to clarify the initiating factors of PICS and the path of&#xD;
      occurrence and development of PICS, it is undoubtedly a new breakthrough in the treatment of&#xD;
      PICS and the &quot;fundamental&quot; way to reduce the mortality of PICS patients. Combining our&#xD;
      previous research results, applicants speculate as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The intestinal tract is the &quot;promoting point&quot; for the occurrence of PICS in severely ill&#xD;
      patients, and it is also the &quot;central organ&quot; that promotes the development of the disease; 2.&#xD;
      The disturbance of the micro-ecology of the intestinal tract is an important reason for&#xD;
      causing PICS in the body (and may even be the decisive factor) ; 3. Correction of intestinal&#xD;
      microecological disturbances can effectively block the path of PICS development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the above ideas, specific explanations are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The intestine may be the &quot;promoting point&quot; for PICS in critically ill patients, and it&#xD;
           is also the &quot;central organ&quot; that promotes the development of the disease. The reasons&#xD;
           are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Our previous studies showed that acute gastrointestinal dysfunction is common in&#xD;
                severe patients. Whether it is local simple abdominal exposure injury or systemic&#xD;
                ischemia-reperfusion injury, it can cause acute gastrointestinal dysfunction; ②The&#xD;
                intestine is not only the main organ of digestion and absorption, but also the&#xD;
                body's largest immune organ (adult). When the intestine is acutely damaged, the&#xD;
                intestine can affect the nutritional metabolism center of the hypothalamus through&#xD;
                Grelin and other hormones, leading to refractory catabolism and exogenous&#xD;
                nutrition. At the same time, the local inflammatory reaction of the intestinal&#xD;
                tract can also cause an imbalance of the body's immune inflammatory response. In&#xD;
                addition, changes in central metabolism in critically ill patients are related to&#xD;
                hypothalamic inflammation (indicating that the intestine is &quot;capable&quot; to become the&#xD;
                central organ that promotes the occurrence and development of PICS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intestinal microecological disturbance is an important cause of PICS Under normal&#xD;
      physiological conditions, the intestine has powerful barrier functions, such as physical&#xD;
      barrier, chemical barrier, immune barrier, and biological barrier. Especially its biological&#xD;
      barrier function plays an important role in the body's metabolism and immunity. There is a&#xD;
      stable symbiotic relationship between the human body and the intestinal microbiota. The&#xD;
      intestine provides the microbiome with habitat and the nutrients it needs to downregulate the&#xD;
      immune response to form immune tolerance and promote its colonization in the intestine;&#xD;
      accordingly, the physiological state Next, the gut symbiotic microbiota also maintains the&#xD;
      body's health in various ways [2]. The intestine and microorganisms are symbiotic and promote&#xD;
      the body's homeostasis. However, the composition and biodiversity of the microbial community&#xD;
      are highly susceptible to various factors, including diet, environment, drugs, infections,&#xD;
      inflammation, etc.&#xD;
