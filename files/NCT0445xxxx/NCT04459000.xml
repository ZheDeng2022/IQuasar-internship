      This study is evaluating a randomized clinical trial and a quasi-experimental observational&#xD;
      study combined. Pregnant women with substance abuse issues are referred to the Substance Use&#xD;
      Treatment and Recovery (STAR) prenatal clinic, and those who consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be randomized to the STAR + maternal Attachment Biobehavioral Catchup (mABC) home&#xD;
      visiting model or to the STAR only treatment group. Those who opt out of receiving prenatal&#xD;
      care at STAR will be recruited as a control group for the QED portion. Those randomized to&#xD;
      STAR + mABC will receive additional supports from a licensed therapist, including up to 12&#xD;
      home visits focused on substance exposed babies and positive parenting.&#xD;

      This study is evaluating a randomized clinical trial and a quasi-experimental observational&#xD;
      study combined. Pregnant women with substance abuse issues are referred to the Substance Use&#xD;
      Treatment and Recovery (STAR) prenatal clinic, and those who consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be randomized to the STAR + maternal Attachment Biobehavioral Catchup (mABC) home&#xD;
      visiting model or to the STAR only treatment group. Those who opt out of receiving prenatal&#xD;
      care at STAR will be recruited as a control group for the QED portion. Those randomized to&#xD;
      STAR + mABC will receive additional supports from a licensed therapist, including up to 12&#xD;
      home visits focused on substance exposed babies and positive parenting. The study will focus&#xD;
      on the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (OKDMHSAS), in&#xD;
      partnership with two clinics at Children's Hospital at OU Medicine (CHOUM) - the Substance&#xD;
      use Treatment And Recovery (STAR) prenatal clinic and the A Better Chance Clinic (ABCC) for&#xD;
      infant assessment and treatment - have developed the Substance use Treatment and Access to&#xD;
      Resources and Supports (STARS) program for pregnant women who have a substance use issue. The&#xD;
      STARS program focuses on women residing in Oklahoma County (OK co.) who, at the time of&#xD;
      birth, are at risk of losing their infant to state custody care (child removal). The&#xD;
      effectiveness of combined focal services provided by the STAR (prenatal care, substance use&#xD;
      treatment supports and postpartum care) and the ABCC (assessment, evidence-based parent&#xD;
      training) clinics will be the target of the study described herein. The overarching goal of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the impact of these services on the well-being of and permanency&#xD;
      outcomes for children and families affected by substance abuse. The study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the quality of service implementation and the overall project's adherence to the following&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Develop training and cross-training to increase the knowledge base of the&#xD;
      medical, therapy, and child welfare. The key element of this objective is to increase the&#xD;
      state's capacity to deliver collaborative and integrated services to serve children ages 0-3&#xD;
      and their families. The STARS will increase the health care and child welfare workforce's&#xD;
      capacity by disseminating emerging and evidence-based services for substance-exposed newborns&#xD;
      and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. The ODMHSAS and OKDHS plan to enhance cross-systems&#xD;
      interventions that bridge agencies at policy and practice levels by pursuing procedural and&#xD;
      policy modifications and formalize agreements to implement targeted evidence-based training&#xD;
      that will enhance the knowledge base of statewide substance use disorder treatment providers,&#xD;
      child welfare and health care professionals. Because of the state and local infrastructure,&#xD;
      the ODMHSAS has developed to date, key partnerships, and access to data, the program is&#xD;
      well-positioned to focus on substance-exposed newborns and their families as Oklahoma&#xD;
      continues to strengthen and expand the statewide service and workforce capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Enhance the well-being of children, parents, and families; and improve safe and&#xD;
      permanent caregiving relationships. The key element of this objective is to improve&#xD;
      evidence-based practices to address attachment and bonding that will serve the mother and&#xD;
      baby. To achieve this, the STARS program will collaborate with A Better Chance Clinic (ABCC)&#xD;
      at OUHSC to implement modified maternal Attachment Biobehavioral Catchup (mABC) adaptation&#xD;
      for pre and postnatal babies. mABC is an intervention adapted from an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention for children who have experienced adversity (e.g., neglect). This adapted&#xD;
      intervention specifically targets the challenges of infants born to opioid-dependent mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Improve retention in substance use treatment and successful completion of&#xD;
      treatment for parents: STARS program will utilize an array of EBPs to improve treatment&#xD;
      retention and encourage completion of treatment services. Treatment outcomes are increased by&#xD;
      offering services to meet the parent's needs. Motivational Interviewing (MI), Community&#xD;
      Reinforcement Approach (CRA), and Seeking Safety (SS) and Cognitive Process Therapy for&#xD;
      trauma (CPT) will be utilized to address the treatment needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: Facilitate the implementation, delivery, and effectiveness of prevention&#xD;
      services and programs under the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018 for at-risk&#xD;
      families: Under Division E, Title VII - Family First Prevention Services Act, listed under&#xD;
      Prevention Activities under Title IV-E, it allows title IV-E dollars to fund promising,&#xD;
      supported, and well-supported mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment&#xD;
      provided by a qualified clinician, and in-home parent skill-based programs, for up to 12&#xD;
      months for candidates for foster care and for pregnant or parenting foster youth. ODMHSAS&#xD;
      will develop memorandums of understandings, conducting multidisciplinary teams, and providing&#xD;
      the evidence-based services that treat families that are at risk in compliance with this&#xD;
      services act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 5: Decrease the number of out of home placements for children by enhancing the&#xD;
      safety of children prior to delivery: ODMHSAS with collaboration with OKDHS will develop&#xD;
      Plans of Safe Care prior to delivery. The STARS program will implement Wraparound services to&#xD;
      connect families to resources to support the mother and baby after delivery to ensure they&#xD;
      have a safe environment and lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 6: Decrease the number of out of home placements for children at risk: The STARS&#xD;
      program will provide various services and supports prior to delivery of the baby. The program&#xD;
      will offer prenatal care; Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) when applicable, substance use&#xD;
      treatment through telehealth or in-person, peer recovery, housing and employment, and&#xD;
      aftercare supports.&#xD;
