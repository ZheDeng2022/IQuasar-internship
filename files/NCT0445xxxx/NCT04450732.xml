             for which there is no standard available therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has adequate organ function within 7 days before the first treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has adequate treatment washout period before the first treatment;:&#xD;

             treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment&#xD;
             with steroids may be included in the study if they have recovered from the acute toxic&#xD;
             effect of radiotherapy;&#xD;

             laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the&#xD;
             results of the trial, interfere with the patient's participation and compliance;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women who are lactating or pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test within 7 days&#xD;
             before first treatment;&#xD;
