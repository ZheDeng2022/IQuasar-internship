  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to assess the safety of primary, secondary and tertiary blood-stage&#xD;
      controlled human Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection of healthy malaria-naïve UK adults,&#xD;
      as well as to evaluate any effect of prior exposure to a blood-stage controlled human malaria&#xD;
      infection (CHMI) on the parasite multiplication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, the immune response to primary, secondary and tertiary P.&#xD;
      falciparum blood-stage infection, as well as gametocytaemia, will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nine to seventeen healthy adult volunteers, aged between 18 and 50 years, will be recruited&#xD;
      and receive a blood-stage controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) at the CCVTM, Oxford. Of&#xD;
      these volunteers, three will be newly recruited, malaria-naïve volunteers, who will receive a&#xD;
      primary CHMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining volunteers will be invited to be involved in this study, following previous&#xD;
      participation in the VAC063 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02927145). VAC063 was a&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, immune responses and efficacy of the new malaria vaccine&#xD;
      RH5.1/AS01. As part of this study, control volunteers, who did not receive a vaccine,&#xD;
      received a blood-stage CHMI, or &quot;challenge&quot;, in order to compare to the vaccinated&#xD;
      volunteers. Some control (unvaccinated) participants received two challenges and some&#xD;
      received just one challenge, therefore, in this study, participants who previously took part&#xD;
      in VAC063 will receive either a third or second malaria challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be challenged with malaria by administering a small amount of P. falciparum&#xD;
      infected blood intravenously. Blood will then be taken at regular intervals to measure the&#xD;
      parasite growth, quantify the sexual parasite forms and assess the immune response to&#xD;
      primary, secondary or tertiary P. falciparum CHMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When volunteers are diagnosed with malaria, treatment with a standard antimalarial course of&#xD;
      oral artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet) will be given over 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers who take part in this study will be involved in the trial for approximately 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
