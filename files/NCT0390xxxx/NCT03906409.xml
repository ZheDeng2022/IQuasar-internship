  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent work has established biological rhythms in human skeletal muscle. It remains unknown&#xD;
      how the timing and pattern of meals influences these rhythms. Therefore, this study sets out&#xD;
      to establish how frequent (CONSTANT) vs infrequent (BOLUS) feeding patterns influence&#xD;
      established biological rhythms in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human metabolism is regulated on a daily basis via a circadian timing system that coordinates&#xD;
      metabolic responses between various tissues. Skeletal muscle is a major site for the&#xD;
      oxidation or storage of key metabolites, with recent studies at Bath and Surrey demonstrating&#xD;
      biological rhythms in this tissue over a 24-h cycle. It is well established that dysregulated&#xD;
      metabolism in skeletal muscle contributes to poor metabolic health and that poor diet is a&#xD;
      causal factor in this deterioration. Diet can be characterised by three nutritional&#xD;
      considerations: how much is eaten (i.e. quantity/dose), what is eaten (i.e. type) and when it&#xD;
      is eaten (i.e. timing). Whilst most dietary approaches and most scientific studies have&#xD;
      focused on the first two factors, there is convincing evidence that human health is also&#xD;
      dictated by the pattern of nutrient delivery; this includes the frequency and regularity of&#xD;
      daily eating occasions, along with their timing both in absolute terms (i.e. time-of-day) and&#xD;
      relative to when other inter-related daily events occur - or usually occur (e.g. light&#xD;
      exposure, sleep, exercise, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains unknown whether the interaction of such factors may affect the biological rhythms&#xD;
      previously documented in human skeletal muscle. In particular, from a basic science&#xD;
      perspective, the fundamental contrast between frequent versus infrequent feeding warrants&#xD;
      investigation. To this end, 16-24 healthy adults will be randomly allocated to receive their&#xD;
      individual daily energy requirements delivered via naso-gastric infusion either continuously&#xD;
      over 24 hours (n=8-12; CONSTANT) or as two bolus infusions at the start (0800 h) and&#xD;
      mid-point (2000 h) of the monitoring period (n=8-12; BOLUS). Serial skeletal muscle (vastus&#xD;
      lateralis) biopsies will be sampled every 4 hours over a controlled 24-h sleep-wake cycle.&#xD;
