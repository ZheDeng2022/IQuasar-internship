      This Phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a CD19-targeting humanized&#xD;
      selective CAR-T (CD19 hsCAR-T) in refractory/relapsed CD19+ B-ALL leukemia patients who have&#xD;
      no available curative treatment options, have a limited prognosis with currently available&#xD;
      treatments, and were previously treated with a B cell directed cell therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19+ B-ALL patients who have relapsed after murine-based CD19 CAR-T (CD19mCAR-T) treatment&#xD;
      and/or have limited clinical response to CD19mCAR-T will be enrolled to receive CD19 hsCAR-T&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with refractory/relapse B-cell ALL with no available curative treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subjects previously treated with B cell-directed engineered cell therapy are eligible&#xD;
             if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. relapsed and/or MRD-positive after prior cell therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. partial response to prior cell therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Clinical and laboratory data are available;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented CD19 expression after previous B cell-directed therapies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Aged 1 to 75 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. KPS&gt;40；&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least 2 weeks or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is shorter must have elapsed since&#xD;
             any prior systemic therapy at the time the subject is planned for leukapheresis,&#xD;
             except for systemic inhibitory/stimulatory immune checkpoint therapy;&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Patients that are receiving anticoagulant therapy or have ever coagulation disorders;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Feasibility assessment during screening demonstrates &lt;30% transduction of target&#xD;
             lymphocytes, or insufficient expansion (&lt; 5-fold) in response to CD3/CD28&#xD;
             co-stimulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with any uncontrolled diseases that are unsuitable for enrollment;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that&#xD;
