  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-term intensive insulin therapy (SIIT) is able to reverse β cell dysfunction and induce&#xD;
      glycemic remission in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. On the other hand,&#xD;
      intensive control of glucose and lifestyle modification are two key elements in preventing&#xD;
      chronic complications, especially microvascular neuropathy. However, no study reported the&#xD;
      long-term effect of SIIT on the chronic complications. In this multi-center, case-control&#xD;
      study, effects of SIIT on the proportion of long-term chronic complications as well as&#xD;
      potential biomarkers were investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 777 patients with type 2 diabetes, including 259 patients who participated SIIT&#xD;
      when diabetes was newly diagnosed and 518 patients who received routine diabetic therapy will&#xD;
      be enrolled in 12 centers in China. After baseline assessments, all patients will undergo&#xD;
      complications assessment, including records of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), carotid&#xD;
      ultrasonography, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, fundus photography, urinary albumin&#xD;
      excretion, Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Scale and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the difference in the proportions of macrovascular and microvascular&#xD;
      complications between groups. Secondary endpoints include the difference of glucose control,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, complexity of anti-diabetic therapy and self-management skills and&#xD;
      quality of life between two groups. What's more, new biomarkers, which may indicate the&#xD;
      occurrence of chronic complications of diabetes, such as circulating endothelial progenitor,&#xD;
      β cell dysfunction, and T cells.&#xD;

Patients were questioned about five aspects, including positive attitude, negative attitude, ability to care for their diabetes, belief in importance of care, and self-care adherence. Each statement included a 5-point ranking scale, ranging from strongly disagree (never) to strongly agree (always), with 3 points as neutral. Items under the subscales of positive attitude, care ability, importance of care, and self-care adherence scoring ≥4 points and items of negative attitude scoring≤2 points were designated as good performance, whereas the opposites were poor.</description>

The DQOL contains a total of 46 items, and all the items are categorized into one of the following four domains: life satisfaction (15 items), diabetes impact (20 items), social/vocational related worries (7 items), and diabetes related worries (4 items). The DQOL adopts a 5-point Likert scale for its response options. The scores range from 1, labeled as &quot;very satisfied,&quot; to 5, labeled as &quot;very dissatisfied,&quot; for items in the life satisfaction domain; from 1, labeled as &quot;never impacted,&quot; to 5, labeled as &quot;always impacted,&quot; for items in the diabetes impact domain; and from 1, labeled as &quot;never worried,&quot; to 5, labeled as &quot;always worried,&quot; for the social/vocational related and diabetes related worries domains.
