  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure is a key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in India. Drug&#xD;
      therapies are highly effective and are recommended by local guidelines to reduce the risks of&#xD;
      serious cardiovascular complications. Behavioural approaches to blood pressure control based&#xD;
      upon sodium reduction are also recommended but there are no interventions proven effective in&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean sodium intake in India is about 5g/day (equivalent to about 12.5g salt) which is, more&#xD;
      than double World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Reduced sodium, added potassium&#xD;
      salt substitutes have favourable effects on blood pressure in settings where discretionary&#xD;
      salt use is high, but have not been tested in India. This single-site, Salt Substitute on&#xD;
      blood pressure in India Study will investigate the effects of reduced sodium added potassium&#xD;
      salt substitution on blood pressure in rural areas where hypertension is a prevalent disease&#xD;
      problem and additional, scalable and affordable interventions are required. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the effects of salt substitute on SBP at 3 months follow-up. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine effects on DBP, urinary sodium and potassium levels and&#xD;
      to determine acceptability of the salt substitute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial done in the Hyderabad region&#xD;
      amongst adult volunteers with a history of hypertension diagnosed by a health professional.&#xD;
      The main exclusion criteria will be known serous kidney disease or use of potassium&#xD;
      containing medications by the individual or others living in the household. Written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from potential participants followed by baseline data collection.&#xD;
      Eligible individuals will then be assigned at random to receive double-blind salt or salt&#xD;
      substitute which will be used to replace all dietary salt used for cooking and seasoning over&#xD;
      the next 3 months. Follow-up will be at one and three months after randomisation for blood&#xD;
      pressure, urinary electrolytes and acceptability of the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Excess sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure which is a leading risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in India. Drug therapies are highly effective interventions for&#xD;
      blood pressure lowering and are recommended by local guidelines to reduce the risks of&#xD;
      serious cardiovascular complications. Behavioural approaches to blood pressure control based&#xD;
      upon sodium reduction are also recommended but there are no interventions proven effective&#xD;
      and sustainable in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean sodium intake in India is about 5g/day (equivalent to about 12.5g salt) which is more&#xD;
      than double World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Reduced sodium, added potassium&#xD;
      salt substitutes have favourable effects on blood pressure in settings where discretionary&#xD;
      salt use is high, but have not been tested in India. Salt substitution is of particular&#xD;
      interest because it has great potential for scaling in under-served and resource poor&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of salt substitution on blood pressure in rural areas&#xD;
      where hypertension is a highly prevalent disease problem and additional, scalable and&#xD;
      affordable blood pressure lowering interventions are required. Accordingly, the primary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the effects of a reduced sodium, added potassium salt substitute&#xD;
      compared to usual salt on systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 3-months follow-up. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine effects on diastolic blood pressure (DBP), urinary sodium and&#xD;
      potassium levels and to determine acceptability of the salt substitute among patients with&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a double-blinded, randomized-controlled trial done in the villages of the&#xD;
      Hyderabad district amongst adult volunteers with a self-reported history of hypertension. The&#xD;
      main exclusion criteria will be known serous kidney disease or use of potassium containing&#xD;
      medications by the individual or others living in the household. Written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from potential participants followed by baseline data collection. Eligible&#xD;
      individuals will then be assigned at random to receive double-blind salt or salt substitute&#xD;
      which will be used to replace all dietary salt required for cooking and seasoning in the&#xD;
      household over the next 3-months. Follow-up will be at one and three months after&#xD;
      randomisation for assessment of blood pressure and acceptability of the intervention, with&#xD;
      urinary electrolytes measured at baseline and 3-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be 440 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio to intervention or control&#xD;
      which will provide more than 80% power (P=0.05) to detect a 5 mmHg or greater difference in&#xD;
      SBP between randomized groups. This estimate assumes a mean of 140mmHg and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 20mmHg for SBP at baseline. We will seek to recruit comparable numbers of men&#xD;
      and women. Analyses will be done using the principle of intention-to-treat and a repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis of variance that incorporates baseline, 1-month and 3-month measures of SBP&#xD;
      to maximize the efficiency of the analysis.&#xD;
