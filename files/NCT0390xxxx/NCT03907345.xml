  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether a one-session exposure treatment for spider-related stimuli&#xD;
      can lead to a generalization of extinguished fear to height-related stimuli in individuals&#xD;
      with comorbid fear of spiders and fear of heights.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure therapy has been proven to be effective in the treatment of specific phobias and in&#xD;
      a variety of fear evoking situations and stimuli. However, since there is a high prevalence&#xD;
      of comorbid fears, therapeutic interventions can get very extensive when each fearful&#xD;
      situation and / or stimuli needs to be treated separately and over a repeated number of&#xD;
      times. It has recently been shown, that exposure to one fearful stimuli (i.e., a spider), can&#xD;
      also lead to a reduction of fear to another, perceptually and conceptually related, but&#xD;
      untreated fearful stimulus (i.e., a cockroach) (Preusser, Margraf &amp; Zlomuzica, 2017).&#xD;
      Potentially, this generalization of exposure effects might also be relevant for coexisting&#xD;
      fears that do not share conceptually related fearful stimuli (e.g., fear of spiders and fear&#xD;
      of heights). The present study aims to investigate whether successful exposure treatment to&#xD;
      one fearful stimulus (i.e., a spider) can also lead to a reduction of fear to an untreated&#xD;
      fear evoking stimulus (i.e., height).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to the treatment or no-treatment condition. The entire&#xD;
      experimental procedure will take place in three sessions. The first session incorporates&#xD;
      spider and height fear related questionnaires and two Behavioral Approach Tests (BATs): One&#xD;
      that involves a spider and one that involves height. These BATs are counterbalanced in each&#xD;
      group with half of participants receiving the spider BAT first and the height BAT second, and&#xD;
      vice versa. The second session takes place approximately seven days later. The treatment&#xD;
      group receives a seven-step in vivo exposure with spiders (duration: 1,5 hours). Twenty-four&#xD;
      hours later, session 3 takes place and involves the same measures that were applied in&#xD;
      session 1. The treatment and no-treatment group receive an identical set of measures except&#xD;
      that the no-treatment group will not be subjected to exposure. The effects of exposure-based&#xD;
      anxiety reductions toward spiders (treated fear stimulus) and heights (untreated fear&#xD;
      stimulus to assess generalization of treatment outcome) are assessed on the behavioral and&#xD;
      subjective level at pretreatment and posttreatment (24 hours after exposure).&#xD;

A house spider (Tegenaria domestica) is used for the exposure.</description>
