      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy treatment, which could be either Cisplatin or carboplatin and&#xD;
      etoposide, and the research study drug, Pembrolizumab (also known as MK-3475) in patients&#xD;
      with high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gastroenteropancreatic system or lung who&#xD;
      are chemotherapy naïve. The chemotherapy treatment you receive will be either Cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin and etoposide. the participant's doctor will discuss this choice with you and&#xD;
      determined which chemotherapy treatment is best for you.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Combination chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with high grade GEPNETs&#xD;
      and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will utilize pembrolizumab, a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      receptor, thus blocks a protective mechanism of cancer cells and thereby allows the immune&#xD;
      system to destroy them, in combination with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination chemotherapy and pembrolizumab was recently FDA approved and ongoing trials are&#xD;
      utilizing this or similar combination with preliminary data demonstrating a promising safety&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;

             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (eg, CTLA-4,&#xD;
             OX-40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).&#xD;

             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (eg, FluMist) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
