      Brief Summary: The study compares four models of pertussis vaccination dispensation to&#xD;
      pregnant women on the vaccine coverage obtained. In addition, the cost of the different&#xD;
      models of vaccination will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent control group in pregnant women,&#xD;
      taking place in 4 regions of Québec (Montréal, Montérégie, Capitale-Nationale, Mauricie).&#xD;
      Four models of vaccine dispensation will be evaluated: one university hospital around&#xD;
      gestational diabetes screening, local health and social services centres (CSLC) and a high&#xD;
      volume clinic. 250 participants will be recruited in each of the four types of centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will also evaluate the costs incurred by all those involved in the&#xD;
      pertussis vaccination program for pregnant women as well as the cost per woman vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 to 20 health professionals involved in providing immunization services to pregnant women:&#xD;
      obsterician-gynaecologists, family doctors and nurses in participating clinics will be&#xD;
      interviewed to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes and professional practises regarding&#xD;
      pertussis vaccination during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the Cost:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed costing approach (micro-costing) will be used. Time and movement will be studied&#xD;
      by direct observation using a grid on an electronic file in each of the 5 environments&#xD;
      studied in order to identify the services and activities carried out as well as to determine&#xD;
      the resources involved in the implementation of these services and activities. Three typical&#xD;
      vaccination days will be chosen to make these observations, in each of the four study&#xD;
      environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main activities observed will be related to preparations for vaccination up to the&#xD;
      vaccination itself (informed consent, injection, etc.), the capture of vaccination data the&#xD;
      management of vaccines and equipment, clinical manifestations, etc. If necessary, the people&#xD;
      observed can be interviewed directly to better understand the activities or services&#xD;
      provided. Otherwise, some questions may be included in the interviews described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major cost categories that will be evaluated for each of the delivery modalities are&#xD;
      human resources and supplies. The cost components listed are: nursing time (immunization /&#xD;
      training), coordination time, support staff time, office supplies, vaccine storage equipment,&#xD;
      vaccine transportation equipment, vaccine transportation, health and safety equipment,&#xD;
      emergency, single-use vaccination equipment and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the costs borne by women, the main categories of variables evaluated will be:&#xD;
      the time spent making appointments and attending vaccination appointments, working time lost,&#xD;
      if any, transportation, childcare and other expenses&#xD;
