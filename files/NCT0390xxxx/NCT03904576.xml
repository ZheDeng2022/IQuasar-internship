      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of a single&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum change from baseline in Panic Symptom Scale (PSS) sum intensity score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 hours (h) prior trial medication administration and 4h, 4h 45 minutes (min), 5h 5min, 5h 10min, 5h 20min, 5h 30min and 192h thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>The last value before administration of the CCK-4 challenge in each period was considered the corresponding period baseline measurement. The PSS sum intensity score mean value of the two period baseline values was considered as the subject baseline. The PSS is a patient reported outcome measurement from which the following factors where derived: physical symptoms of fear and the perception of alertness, anxiety, fear, and pain. The subjects were asked to rate each of 18 characteristic questions on a scale from 0 (absent) to 4 (very strong). The sum of the scale over all items constituted the PSS sum intensity score. A higher score implies a stronger panic symptom.</description>
