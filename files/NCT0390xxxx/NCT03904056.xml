      Purpose: To compare panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as described in ETDRS Study combined&#xD;
      with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab (IVR) (ETDRS-PRP group) and retinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation targeted to ischemic retina combined with IVR (ISQ-RP group) in patients&#xD;
      with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized prospective clinical trial. Methods: Patients with PDR were assigned to&#xD;
      receive either PRP plus IVR (20 eyes) or retinal photocoagulation targeted to ischemic areas&#xD;
      plus IVR (20 eyes). ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield macular&#xD;
      thickness (CSFT) measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed at baseline&#xD;
      and every 4 weeks through week 48. Area of fluorescein leakage from active new vessels (FLA)&#xD;
      was measured every 12 weeks. Full-field electroretinography (ERG) was recorded at baseline&#xD;
      and after 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This parallel clinical trial was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee, and all&#xD;
      subjects gave written informed consent to participate. Between August 2014 and July 2016, all&#xD;
      adult patients with treatment-naive PDR and a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) better than&#xD;
      20/800 evaluated at our facility were invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the recruitment phase, twenty-three consecutive patients who met the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. At baseline visit, each patient underwent&#xD;
      detailed ophthalmologic assessment including BCVA measurement according to standardized ETDRS&#xD;
      refraction protocols using modified ETDRS cards 1, 2 and R; applanation tonometry; slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscopy examination under mydriasis (including classification of crystalline lens&#xD;
      opacity status using the Lens Opacities Classification System - LOCS III) (13); and indirect&#xD;
      funduscopic examination. Digital ocular stereoscopic fundus photographs (TRC-50DX - IMAGEnet;&#xD;
      Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), wide field fluorescein angiography and spectral domain optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (SD-OCT) (HRA-OCT, Heidelberg, Germany) were also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned using a computer-generated sequence, to one of the following&#xD;
      two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETDRS-PRP Group: patients were treated in two sessions (week 0 and week 2) of 800-900 shots,&#xD;
      for a total of 1600-1800 shots with a shot duration of 100 ms and power modulated in order to&#xD;
      generate moderately white spots on the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISQ-RP Group: patients were treated with single-spot targeted retinal photocoagulation&#xD;
      directed toward areas of retinal nonperfusion detected by fluorescein angiography. In this&#xD;
      group, laser treatment was also performed in two sessions (week 0 and 2), with a shot&#xD;
      duration of 100 ms, but spots were placed 1/2 burn apart and power modulated in order to&#xD;
      generate moderately white spots on the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, retinal photocoagulation was performed with single-spot full-scatter PRP&#xD;
      using Purepoint green diode laser (Alcon, Fortworth, Texas) with an Ocular Mainster PRP 165&#xD;
      lens with a dynamic field of view of 180 degrees, and a 200 micron spot size (which produces&#xD;
      a 392 micron spot size on the retina). Intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg (0.05 ml) ranibizumab&#xD;
      (Lucentis®) (IVR) were performed 180 minutes after the first laser session (week 0) by a&#xD;
      single retina specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal injection Intravitreal injections were performed in a clinic setting 180 minutes&#xD;
      after retinal photocoagulation with a disposable syringe with a BD Ultra-FineTM 29G ½&quot;&#xD;
      needle, via the pars plana 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus, using topical anesthesia. After&#xD;
      the procedure, optic nerve perfusion was assessed by indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy, with&#xD;
      paracenthesis of the anterior chamber considered in cases of poor perfusion. After injection,&#xD;
      patients were instructed to use antibiotic eyedrops (0.5% moxifloxacin), according to drug&#xD;
      label, one drop every 4 hours for one week, in the eye which received the intravitreal&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ophthalmologic evaluations Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including ETDRS BCVA and&#xD;
      central subfield macular thickness (CSFT) measured by SD-OCT as described elsewhere (15) were&#xD;
      performed at baseline and every 4 weeks through week 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Area of fluorescein leakage from active new vessels (FLA) was measured by wide field&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 using fluorescein&#xD;
      angiography pictures taken 2.0 to 3.0 minutes after the injection of fluorescein dye. Local&#xD;
      and systemic adverse effects, including changes in intraocular pressure and in crystalline&#xD;
      lens status, were monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment criteria At follow-up visits from week 12 to 48, patients were treated quarterly&#xD;
      with an IVR (0.5 mg in 0.05 ml) if FA demonstrated the presence of actively leaking retinal&#xD;
      neovascularization. From weeks 4 to 48, patients could receive monthly IVR if SD-OCT&#xD;
      demonstrated a CSFT of more than 300 µm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERG protocol Full-field ERG was performed at baseline, and 12, 24 and 48 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment (ColorDome and Espion E2 - Diagnosys LLC, Middleton, MA, USA). ERG was executed in&#xD;
      accordance to ISCEV standard [20] using DTL as positive electrodes. Skin electrodes (Red-Dot&#xD;
      - 3M) were placed on each temporal orbital rim to serve as references, and on forehead as&#xD;
      ground. A- and b-wave amplitude and implicit time were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 min dark adaptation, a series of flashes with increasing luminance was used as light&#xD;
      stimuli: 0.003, 0.01 (rod ERG), 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 (combined rod-cone ERG) and 10&#xD;
      cd.s/m2. Oscillatory potentials were filtered out of combined rod-cone ERG, using an off-line&#xD;
      fast-Fourrier algorithm set as a band-pass frequency filter (75 - 300 Hz) as previously&#xD;
      described [21], and area under the curve (OP-AUC) between a- and b-wave implicit time was&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients were light adapted for 10 min, and photopic ERG measurements were also&#xD;
      performed a series of increasing stimuli luminance: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 (cone ERG), 10.0 and&#xD;
      30.0 cd.s/m2, followed by the 30 Hz flicker (background during photopic stimulation = 30&#xD;
      cd/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size estimation was based on the standard deviation of fluorescein leakage area of&#xD;
      a previous study where PRP plus ranibizumab was used for proliferative diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      treatment (11). Considering this previous study, with a sample size of 15 patients per group,&#xD;
      there is an 80% power to detect a mean difference of 2 mm2 between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Baseline data were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by&#xD;
      Tukey-Kramer testing for multiple mean comparisons, while group comparisons during follow-up&#xD;
      were performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with &quot;group&quot;, &quot;time&quot; and &quot;group cross&#xD;
      time&quot; as effects, followed by Tukey HSD testing. Calculations were performed using JMP 10.0&#xD;
      (SAS). The significance level was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
