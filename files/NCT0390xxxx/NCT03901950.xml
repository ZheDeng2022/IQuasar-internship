  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project is testing this potential new medication for advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
      This research project is being done to get more information about the study drug (XNW7201).&#xD;
      The study drug is a potential new medication that blocks the activity of a protein found in&#xD;
      cancer cells called Wnt. Studies have shown that, in cancer, Wnt is involved in the&#xD;
      uncontrolled growth of cancer cells and helping them survive. It is hoped that by blocking&#xD;
      the activity of Wnt, the study drug may decrease the growth of cancer cells and their&#xD;
      survival. The purpose of this research is to check that the study drug is safe and to see how&#xD;
      well it is tolerated in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
      Another purpose is to find out the highest dose that is well tolerated (called the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose) and the right dose to use in future clinical research studies with this&#xD;
      potential new medication.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There will be 5 different doses of the study drug that will be tested. The dose of study drug that you will take will depend on when you enter the research project. The first few participants who enter the research project early will take lower doses of the study drug. Participants entering the research project at a later time will take higher doses of the study drug only if the lower doses that have been tested are well tolerated. You will be closely monitored after you take the study drug.</intervention_model_description>
