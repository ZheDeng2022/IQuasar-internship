  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of gastric cancer in local indigenous peoples is higher than the non-Indigenous&#xD;
      counterpart in Taiwan. How to design an effective prevention strategy for gastric cancer is&#xD;
      of importance. The present study aimed to identify the causes that may account for the health&#xD;
      inequalities, allowing generation of a plan of action on the whole population scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the continuing gap in cancer burden between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples,&#xD;
      reducing health disparities has drawn worldwide attention. Evidence indicates that the&#xD;
      gastric cancer incidence and mortality rates in Indigenous peoples are much higher than those&#xD;
      of non-Indigenous counterparts living in the same areas. Exposure to more risk factors from&#xD;
      social habits, lifestyle, and Helicobacter pylori infection has been considered the cause.&#xD;
      However, even though gastric cancer has been repeatedly shown to be preventable by&#xD;
      eliminating risk factors, eradication policies are rarely designed for Indigenous peoples.&#xD;
      Possible obstacles may include the lack of Indigenous health statistics, inadequate access to&#xD;
      care, difficulty in modifying social habits and lifestyles, and the presence of environmental&#xD;
      and cultural barriers. Developing and implementing a preventive strategy following the&#xD;
      evidence-based principle remains a challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Taiwan, the number of Indigenous peoples has grown; however, their life expectancy remains&#xD;
      substantially lower than that of the non-Indigenous population. Cancer is the most prevalent&#xD;
      cause of death for Indigenous peoples and a disproportionate prevalence of certain kinds of&#xD;
      cancer is noted for Indigenous peoples. These observations provide an opportunity to&#xD;
      establish a plan of action, in which a specific intervention is developed to decrease the&#xD;
      threat from each specific cancer so that the overall disparate burden can be reduced in a&#xD;
      stepwise manner.&#xD;
