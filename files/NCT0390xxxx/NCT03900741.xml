      Objective: the objective of the present randomized clinical trial is to compare changes in&#xD;
      radiographic peri-implant bone defect fill after regeneration of peri-implant intrabony&#xD;
      defects with a submerged versus a non-submerged protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: this project is a randomized controlled clinical trial, double blind,&#xD;
      with a parallel groups design. Thirty-six patients presenting with peri-implantitis&#xD;
      subsidiary of regenerative treatment will be recruited. After subjects have been given&#xD;
      informed consent, they will be randomized to test or control group. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      a session of non-surgical peri-implantitis therapy consisting on prostheses removal and&#xD;
      implant debridement with ultrasounds, curettes and air-abrasive under local anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Patients in test group will have their prostheses removed and the mucosa surrounding the&#xD;
      affected implants will be let heal covering the implants, while patients in control group&#xD;
      will have their prostheses installed again after the non-surgical therapy. Six to eight weeks&#xD;
      later, all subjects will undergo regenerative treatment with the use of a bone substitute, a&#xD;
      collagen membrane and fixation pins, and in control group tissues will heal following the&#xD;
      non-submerged protocol, meanwhile subjects in test group will undergo submerged healing. Six&#xD;
      months later, subjects in test group will have their prostheses reconnected to the&#xD;
      regenerated implants. All patients will undergo periodontal and peri-implant maintenance&#xD;
      therapy every three months during follow-up. Radiographic assessment of vertical bone level&#xD;
      changes (primary outcome), clinical status of peri-implant tissues, changes in soft tissues&#xD;
      margin, patient related outcomes and adverse events will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after peri-implantitis regenerative surgery.&#xD;
