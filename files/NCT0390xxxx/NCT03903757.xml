  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing and affects more than 650 million people of all ages&#xD;
      to become one of the foremost global health threats. Obesity is a complex syndrome that can&#xD;
      seriously impair health through a broad range of complications such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D), cancer, musculoskeletal disorders, psychosocial&#xD;
      imbalances, and reduced quality of life, and impacts the treatment of other conditions.&#xD;
      Weight reduction has been shown to have a positive effect on these co-morbidities and may&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of treatments specific for other co-morbidities. Lifestyle&#xD;
      modification is an integral part of the weight management journey, but is often insufficient&#xD;
      on its own, and can be complimented by pharmacological and surgical add-on treatments to&#xD;
      achieve greater and more sustainable weight loss, as appropriate. It is likely that there are&#xD;
      subgroups of patients that are more suited to certain types of treatment and results risk&#xD;
      dilution of perceived efficacy unless these groups are identified and treatment is&#xD;
      personalised. The aim of this project is to identify pathophysiologically and clinically&#xD;
      meaningful subgroups of obesity by performing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches and&#xD;
      network based algorithm that will allow the optimisation of prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      obesity and its complications.&#xD;

      Population study will be recruited at the Clinical Department of Internal Medicine and&#xD;
      Specialistics, Department of Advanced Clinical and Surgical Sciences belonging to University&#xD;
      of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;. This study will be performed according to the principles&#xD;
      outlined in the Helsinki Declaration. Subcutaneous adipose tissues located in the surgical&#xD;
      incision will be withdrawn without the use of surgical devices in order to avoid the&#xD;
      degradation of the biological sample from 50 obese subjects (25 obese subjects with Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes vs 25 obese subjects without Type 2 Diabetes) undergoing bariatric surgery. As&#xD;
      controls (n=50) we will recruit subcutaneous adipose tissues from patients without a clinical&#xD;
      history of cardiovascular or dysmetabolic diseases undergoing to surgery for stress inguinal&#xD;
      hernia. Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population will be available&#xD;
      from datasets generated by physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From tissue samples the genomic DNA and the total RNA will be extracted. Genomic DNA will be&#xD;
      extracted by using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue kit (QIAGEN), according to manufacturer protocol.&#xD;
      Pooled DNA samples consisting of equal quantities of DNA (2 µg) from cases and controls will&#xD;
      be shipped to Genomix4Life Genomics and Bioinformatics Service, to perform a global DNA&#xD;
      methylation analysis. For this aim, it will be used the Human Methylation 27K BeadChip&#xD;
      platform by using Bisulfite conversion technology (BBRS-Seq). Total RNA will be extracted&#xD;
      from tissues using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer protocol. The cDNA&#xD;
      library preparation will be performed starting from 4 ug of total RNA by using Illumina&#xD;
      TruSeq Libraries and then sequenced at high coverage on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 NGS platform.&#xD;
      Nucleic acid concentrations and quality control from Genomix4Life will be assessed by using&#xD;
      Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Qubit assay (Thermo Fisher&#xD;
      Scientific) and TapeStation 4200 (Agilent). The weighted human DNA methylation PPI network&#xD;
      (WMPN) will be construct to obtain a obesity interactome in both subgroups (obese and obese&#xD;
      with T2D vs controls) based on differentially methylated genes in order to identify putative&#xD;
      useful diagnostic biomarkers. The TargetScan algorithm , by searching the conserved seed&#xD;
      pairing regions in the 3' untraslated regions (UTR) of genes based on whole genome alignment,&#xD;
      will be used to robustly predict miRNA-target gene pairs from the same study population.&#xD;
