  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obstruction of the central airways (CAO) may be caused by a large variety of malignant&#xD;
      and non malignant processes, and it may present with a variety of symptoms ranging from mild&#xD;
      shortness of breath to life-threatening respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The epidemiologic impact of lung cancer leads to an increasing number of patients developing&#xD;
      complications of proximal endobronchial disease. An estimated 20-30% of patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer will develop complications associated with airway obstruction, e.g. dyspnea, pneumonia&#xD;
      and atelectasis, and up to 40% of lung cancer deaths may be attributed to locoregional&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although lung cancer patients with CAO are not candidates for surgical resection, more than&#xD;
      80% of these patients can receive palliative treatment using interventional bronchoscopy; in&#xD;
      addiction, almost the 85% of these procedures reach luminal clearance and endoscopic success&#xD;
      in terms of symptomatic relief, of pulmonary function and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no definitive data about factors such as type of disease or site of the lesion&#xD;
      which may affect the use of a single or a combined endoscopic modality or stenting in the&#xD;
      treatment of airway obstructions. A Dalar's retrospective study showed that airway stenting&#xD;
      is a useful treatment modality besides the other interventional bronchoscopic procedures: it&#xD;
      not only provides rapid relief of symptoms and an improved quality of life, but also gives&#xD;
      additional time for adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy that might provide prolonged survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Dumon introduced the first dedicated endoluminal airway stent, there was a clear&#xD;
      immediate relief of respiratory symptoms and significant quality survival in most patients&#xD;
      (9). In a Miyazawa's study all patients with malignant central airway obstruction had&#xD;
      significant improvements in dyspnea and also in spirometry after stenting, and the author&#xD;
      suggested that the correct positioning of the stent at the choke point leads to maximal&#xD;
      symptomatic benefit in these patients. The choice of different airway stents can be made&#xD;
      based on the nature (intrinsic, extrinsic or combined) and site of the lesion: for example&#xD;
      the Dumon stent can be preferred in lesions of trachea and right main bronchus, the Ultraflex&#xD;
      stent on the left and stenosis beyond the main bronchi. The underlying disease, the site of&#xD;
      lesion and treatment modality are known as independent predictors of survival. Complications&#xD;
      related to the placement of stents include re-obstructions of the lumen by tumor, granuloma&#xD;
      formation at the stent side, mucous plugging and migration of the stent; with the use of&#xD;
      laser, both perforation of airway wall and fire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding laser resection for malignant airway obstruction, it is associated with improved&#xD;
      survival rates (60% of patients alive at 7 months in one study). As these studies were not&#xD;
      randomized trials, it is impossible to conclude that the laser therapy was responsible for&#xD;
      the improved survival, but it is likely that laser therapy provided a rapid and safe means of&#xD;
      relieving central airway obstruction, which is associated with a high mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategy and modality of treatment for malignant central airway obstructions depends not&#xD;
      only on the endoscopic characteristics and location of the lesions, but also on the patient's&#xD;
      comorbidities, pulmonary function, previous treatment and life expectancy. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of treatment with interventional bronchoscopy alone remains to improve symptom&#xD;
      control and quality of life, not to improve the prognosis. However, the advent of&#xD;
      molecular-targeted therapy may change the impact of interventional bronchoscopy, especially&#xD;
      in lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations: in a Tomoyuki case report there is the first&#xD;
      description of the use of endoscopic treatment plus molecular-targeted therapy as combination&#xD;
      treatment, with benefits in terms of patient's general conditions and quality of life.&#xD;
      Moreover, some researchers have reported cases of malignant lymphoma patients with central&#xD;
      airway obstruction who were successfully treated using interventional bronchoscopy followed&#xD;
      by systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences between patients with central malignant&#xD;
      airway obstruction treated only with medical therapy versus patients submitted to endoscopic&#xD;
      plus medical therapy in terms of prognosis, quality of life and access to health services.&#xD;
