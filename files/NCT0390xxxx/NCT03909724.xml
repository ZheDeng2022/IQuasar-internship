    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare progression free survival rates of metastasized&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients refractory or intolerant to systemic therapy with&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, anti-VEGF therapy and anti-EGFR therapy (for&#xD;
      tumours with wild-type KRAS)); randomized for treatment with TAS-102 (standard-arm) or High&#xD;
      Dose Intermittent Sunitinib (700 mg once every 2 weeks). The investigators hypothesis is that&#xD;
      treatment with the experimental arm (sunitinib) will provide an improvement in progression&#xD;
      free in this patient group.&#xD;

      Study design: A prospective, open-label, randomized, mono-center, phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      (with registration intent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize a clinically relevant increase in PFS by 3 months;&#xD;
      from 2 months as reported for TAS-102 to 5 months in patients treated with sunitinib. They&#xD;
      further hypothesize that this will result in a meaningful improvement in Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to improve progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) treated with&#xD;
      high-dose sunitinib once every 2 weeks to 5 months, compared to the reported 2 months for&#xD;
      TAS-102 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Secondary objectives include: overall survival (OS), the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment, the quality of life in the two study arms, the value of&#xD;
      phosphoproteomics as a potential predictive biomarker for response to sunitinib, the&#xD;
      potential value of blood markers for molecular diagnostics disease and response monitoring&#xD;
      and the sensitivity, specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients eligible for inclusion are at least 18 years of age, with adequate&#xD;
      organ function, who have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      colon or rectum with documented metastatic disease and have an indication for palliative&#xD;
      treatment with TAS102 (refractory or intolerant to systemic therapy with fluoropyrimidine,&#xD;
      irinotecan, oxaliplatin, anti-VEGF therapy and anti-EGFR therapy (for tumours with wild-type&#xD;
      KRAS)). Major exclusion criteria include evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant&#xD;
      disease, previous extensive radiotherapy, recent major surgery or infection, unresolved bowel&#xD;
      disorders and poorly controlled hypertension. All patients will provide Informed Consent&#xD;
      prior to inclusion in the study and during the course of the trial, all relevant data will be&#xD;
      stored in electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study inclusion, patients will be randomized (1:1) via a centralized randomization&#xD;
      system to receive either oral sunitinib (700 mg once every 2 weeks) or TAS-102 (35 mg per&#xD;
      square meter, twice daily, 5 days a week, with 2 days of rest, for 2 weeks, followed by a&#xD;
      14-day rest period). Patients will receive treatment until disease progression or&#xD;
      discontinuation due to unacceptable toxic effects, withdrawal of consent, or other reason.&#xD;
