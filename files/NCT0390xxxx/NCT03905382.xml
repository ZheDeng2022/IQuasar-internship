  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in technology has meant that domiciliary non-invasive (NIV) devices can be remotely&#xD;
      monitored via modems in patients' homes. Possible benefits and challenges of modem technology&#xD;
      have yet to be established. This study explored the perspectives and experiences of patients,&#xD;
      their carers' and health care professionals (HCPs) on the addition of modem technology in&#xD;
      managing home NIV patients.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to consider the opinions of patients, their carers' and health care&#xD;
      providers on the addition of using modem technology in the management of patients with&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure receiving domiciliary NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the experience of patients receiving domiciliary NIV with modem&#xD;
           technology and how this compares to NIV treatment without a modem&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the experience of carers' of patients receiving domiciliary NIV with&#xD;
           modem technology and how this compares to NIV treatment without a modem&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To gain opinions of health care providers on the use of modem technology in caring for&#xD;
           patient with ventilatory failure and how this compares to delivering home NIV treatment&#xD;
           without a modem 4.2 Outcome The outcome of this study will inform future service&#xD;
           development of home NIV services to ensure they are designed with service users'&#xD;
           preferences in mind.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients and carers •Patients and their carers who received treatment from the Royal Free&#xD;
        London (RFL) domiciliary NIV service both pre and post modem installation will be eligible&#xD;
        to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HCPs&#xD;
&#xD;
        •Staff who have experience of looking after patients with NIV both with and without modems&#xD;
        will be able to take part in the study. Staff recruited will be currently working at RFL.&#xD;
        We have been using modems for all of our patients with NIV since December 2014. Therefore&#xD;
        rotational staff (e.g. registrars) working RFL will only have experience of looking after&#xD;
        patients with modems on their NIV. To allow for this factor staff will be allowed to join&#xD;
        the study even if their experience of looking after patients with NIV without modems is at&#xD;
        other hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients under the care of the RFL domiciliary NIV service who have only had&#xD;
             experience of treatment with a modem in situ will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to verbally communicate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot have an &quot;everyday&quot; level conversation in English&#xD;
