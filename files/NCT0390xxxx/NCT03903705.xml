      This study is composed of dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage. In dose escalation&#xD;
      stage, patients with advanced solid tumor will be enrolled and administrated with&#xD;
      Fruquintinib in combination with Sintilimab. The MTD ( maximum tolerated dose) or RP2D (&#xD;
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose) will be determined in this stage. In dose expansion stage,&#xD;
      additional patients will be enrolled and be treated at RP2D to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy.&#xD;

      This study is composed of dose escalation stage and dose expansion stage. In dose escalation&#xD;
      stage, 9-12 patients with advance solid tumor will be sequentially enrolled in Cohort A&#xD;
      (Fruquintinib 3 mg QD (once a day), oral dosing, 3 weeks on/1 weeks off+Sintilimab 200mg&#xD;
      Q4W(4 times a week), intravenous dosing) and Cohort B (Fruquintinib 4 mg QD, oral dosing, 3&#xD;
      weeks on/1 week off+Sintilimab 200mg Q4W, intravenous dosing). The MTD or RP2D will be&#xD;
      determined in this stage. In dose expansion stage, 75 patients with advanced solid tumor will&#xD;
      be enrolled and treated with RP2D. Efficacy, safety and tolerability will be assessed and PK&#xD;
      (Pharmacokinetics) analysis will be performed in this study.&#xD;
