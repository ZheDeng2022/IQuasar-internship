  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before performing endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS-Endoscopic Sinus Surgery), every candidate&#xD;
      for surgery is referred to perform a sinus CT scan of the sinuses. Because of the complicated&#xD;
      anatomy of the sinuses and their proximity to vital organs such as the brain, eye, and&#xD;
      carotid artery, the surgeon use the CT imaging during surgery to adjust the anatomy and to&#xD;
      avoid complications such as blindness, brain damage and massive bleeding (0.3%). Sometimes&#xD;
      the CT is integrated into a navigation system, although there is no evidence that the use of&#xD;
      navigation systems reduces the rate of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to examine whether ESS can be performed in chronic sinusitis patients&#xD;
      using MRI, with CT being used as a backup only.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sinuses are different from person to person and from side to side, and therefore it is&#xD;
      essential to be completely familiar with the anatomy of the specific patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sinuses are a maze of cells filled with air and surrounded by thin bony partitions&#xD;
      separating the cells, as well as separating the nasal and sinus cavities from the vital&#xD;
      organs mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT imaging is the standard test because it allows accurate detection of the bony partitions,&#xD;
      thus contributing to the accuracy and safety of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The known disadvantage of the CT is its radiation. The amount of radiation is not negligible&#xD;
      and involves the possible development of eye damage (cataracts) or tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a large number of patients, the CT imaging performed before surgery is neither the first&#xD;
      nor the last, so that the risk of tumor disease increases significantly, especially for the&#xD;
      younger population. Another disadvantage is the limited ability of the imaging to demonstrate&#xD;
      soft tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to CT, MRI is better for soft tissue demonstration. Another important advantage is&#xD;
      that it is a radiation-free scan. Its disadvantages are a poor demonstration of the bony&#xD;
      partitions and being relatively long, expensive, and therefore less available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the CT is more accurate in demonstrating bony structures, cheaper and more&#xD;
      accessible, the radiation risk is very disturbing to both the physicians and patients who&#xD;
      have become more aware of the problem in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among neurosurgeons, whose field of operation is very close to the surgical field of sinus&#xD;
      surgeons (for example, in the trans-sphenoidal surgery of the pituitary gland), surgery is&#xD;
      often performed only with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a potential patient arrives for sinus surgery with an MRI, some sinus surgeons will skip&#xD;
      the CT. However, this practice does not yet have an orderly basis, and that is where the&#xD;
      investigators are aiming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, the initiators (rhinologist and neuroradiologist) suggested that MRI&#xD;
      parameters could be upgraded to allow a better and clearer demonstration of the bony&#xD;
      partitions, so that the surgeon could rely on the anatomy derived from this scan. As a result&#xD;
      of the desired change, the patients will not be exposed to radiation, and at the same time, a&#xD;
      better demonstration of the soft tissues will also be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 20 patients who performed CT imaging prior to ESS were sent to perform sinus&#xD;
      MRI (new protocol- without gadolinium injection). Twenty-three bony anatomical structures&#xD;
      were selected that are important for the surgeon's orientation. The rhinologist and&#xD;
      neuroradiologist independently evaluated the CT and MRI of each patient and compared it by&#xD;
      giving a numerical score for the degree of visibility of each structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both disciplines, in about 55% of cases, the structures observed in MRI were observed&#xD;
      similarly in CT. According to the rhinologist, in 84% the CT was similar or better. According&#xD;
      to the neuroradiologist, in 86% the MRI was similar or better. Still, even for the&#xD;
      rhinologist, in 67% the MRI was similar or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, according to this protocol, it was found that in both disciplines, most of the&#xD;
      anatomical structures are well observed on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      adding the obvious superiority of MRI over CT in soft tissue demonstration, the investigators&#xD;
      conclude that MRI use in ESS can be considered at least in some cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators assume that a neuroradiologist has an advantage in reading MRI, and that an&#xD;
      rhinologist has an advantage in reading CT. It should be expected that over time and after a&#xD;
      learning curve, MRI readings among rhinologist will improve. This study is about to be&#xD;
      published these days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraged by its results, it is now necessary to examine the feasibility of the conclusions&#xD;
      in real setting.&#xD;
&#xD;

           questions of the three surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants, and number of centers planned to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      45 participants, in one center - Assuta&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/ protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three sinus surgeons will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each surgeon will recruit 15 patients for the study, a total of 45 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up patients who are potential candidates for ESS will be referred to conventional&#xD;
           CT scans of the sinuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgeons will be exposed to the verbal interpretation of the scan, in order to&#xD;
           finally decide whether to operate or not, but not to the imaging itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If surgery is to be performed, the patients will sign an informed consent and be&#xD;
           referred for a sinus MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before surgery, the surgeon will not look at the CT imaging, but only on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to surgery, the surgeons will be instructed about the new MRI protocol by the&#xD;
           neuroradiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The operation will be performed when only the MRI is displayed on the screen. However,&#xD;
           the CT scan will also be in the operating room in case the surgeon feels that the MRI is&#xD;
           insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgeons will observe the CT scan after the surgery, and then complete the&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
