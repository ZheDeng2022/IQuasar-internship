      The aim of this trial is to assess if patients treated with the combination of ribociclib and&#xD;
      endocrine therapy respond to treatment as fast as patients treated with chemotherapy only,&#xD;
      without decreasing their quality of life (QoL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women and the leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      mortality in most countries in Europe. Metastatic breast cancer remains an incurable disease&#xD;
      with a median overall survival (OS) of 2-4 years and a 5-year survival of only 25%. Patients&#xD;
      with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer involving visceral disease at diagnosis&#xD;
      have an even worse outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many oncologists still prefer to treat visceral disease primarily with chemotherapy rather&#xD;
      than with endocrine treatment, thinking to receive a faster response with chemotherapy than&#xD;
      with endocrine therapy, especially in patients with clinical symptoms or potentially&#xD;
      threatening lesions. However, results from cross-sectional clinical practice studies suggest&#xD;
      that endocrine therapy is associated with better quality of life, fewer concerns about side&#xD;
      effects, less activity impairment and higher treatment satisfaction compared to chemotherapy.&#xD;
      In addition, with the new data of CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine treatment there&#xD;
      is an even better efficacy data available compared to endocrine therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to assess if patients treated with the combination of ribociclib and&#xD;
      endocrine therapy respond to treatment as fast as patients treated with chemotherapy only,&#xD;
      without decreasing their quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
