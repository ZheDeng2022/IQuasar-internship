  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ANCA vasculitis is a pauci-immune systemic small vessel vasculitis. The anti-neutrophilic&#xD;
      cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are pathogenic and cause disease by activating neutrophils&#xD;
      which damage blood vessels. CD means &quot;cluster of differentiation&quot; . CD5 is a type I&#xD;
      transmembrane protein found on T cells, thymocytes, and some B cells. CD20 is a type III&#xD;
      transmembrane protein found on B cells. The investigators previously detected an association&#xD;
      between recovery of Interleukin 10 (IL-10)-secreting CD20+ and CD5+ regulatory B cells after&#xD;
      immunotherapy (with rituximab and corticosteroids) and decreased risk of subsequent relapse&#xD;
      in patients with ANCA-vasculitis. The investigators hypothesize that patients with complete&#xD;
      reconstitution of a functional regulatory B cell repertoire after induction therapy are at&#xD;
      low risk of relapse and may be monitored conservatively without further immunotherapy. The&#xD;
      investigators will test this hypothesis through a proof of concept randomized controlled&#xD;
      study. Patients with normalization of CD5+ regulatory B cells will be randomized to&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with rituximab vs. close observation without immunosuppression. Patients&#xD;
      whose peripheral CD5+ regulatory B cells remain low after induction therapy (who are at&#xD;
      higher risk of relapse), will receive maintenance immunosuppression with rituximab. Patients&#xD;
      needing or randomized to maintenance therapy who are unable to receive rituximab will receive&#xD;
      azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, two standard alternative medications for maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that, in ANCA vasculitis, use of CD5+ B&#xD;
      cells at the time of B cell reconstitution in the peripheral blood can be used to stratify&#xD;
      patients between those with low % CD5+ B cells at greater risk of relapse who would need&#xD;
      maintenance immunosuppression and those with normalized CD5+ B cells who would be at lower&#xD;
      risk and relapse, and therefore may not need maintenance immunosuppression. The latter group&#xD;
      will be randomized to either maintenance immunosuppression vs close clinical observation&#xD;
      without maintenance immunosuppression. This study is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      new therapies in ANCA vasculitis. The treatment regimen used in the proposed study are&#xD;
      routinely used in the treatment of patients with ANCA vasculitis and considered&#xD;
      standard-of-care.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome measure is time to first relapse defined as recurrence of any signs or symptoms attributable to active vasculitis after a period of complete remission, with at least 2 minor or 1 major item on the BVAS score (BVASâ‰¥2). Per protocol, complete remission is defined as a BVAS score = 0. Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's Granulomatosis(BVAS, range 0-64). The total score is composed of 34 predefined items, units on a scale, grouped into 9 organ systems. Each item carries a weight from 1-3, depending on disease severity. A score of 0 indicates no disease activity; a higher score indicates worsening disease.</description>
