  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lyric hearing device is a commercially available device produced by Sonova, and designed&#xD;
      to be used for extended periods of time. We further want to investigate the morphology of the&#xD;
      tissue around the device at different periods of time after the device has been fitted and&#xD;
      used for a while.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial imaging of the tissue will be taken for baseline measurements. Questionnaires will&#xD;
      also be used to assess patients satisfaction with the device and cognitive abilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      If the person seems to be a good candidate for the study, the Audiologist could discuss with&#xD;
      the patient the time involved in the study and arrange an appointment with the patient if&#xD;
      interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of appointments are designed to follow up the patient's development with the device&#xD;
      at determined times during the process. On the first appointment the patient will be&#xD;
      consented prior to any tests or health services given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first and last appointments are the longest ones with a duration of about 1 and a half&#xD;
      hours for questionnaires, medical history, and device fitting. Additionally, all appointments&#xD;
      include measurement of ear canal relative humidity which should take a total of 30 minutes&#xD;
      and imaging of the area to determine thickness and blood flow in the tissue surrounding the&#xD;
      device. Follow-up appointments with the Audiologist will take 45 minutes for all basic&#xD;
      procedures. The Lyric device is used commercially and Audiologist can provide it to patients&#xD;
      already, but the purpose of this study is to use a pioneer technique with a device that looks&#xD;
      inside the ear canal in the same way as a regular used speculum to look at details of the&#xD;
      tissue around the device to see if any changes occur due to extended wear of the Lyric&#xD;
      hearing aid device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete study per person will be completed in about six months. An Audiologist will&#xD;
      perform all the audiology testing plus the ear canal humidity measurements and his/her time&#xD;
      will be covered by the sponsor (a total of 9 hours per patient). The Lyric devices will be&#xD;
      provided on loan by the sponsor as well as the equipment and software needed to make the ear&#xD;
      canal humidity measurements. The imaging measurements will be conducted by the Audiologist&#xD;
      trained in using the handheld device.&#xD;
