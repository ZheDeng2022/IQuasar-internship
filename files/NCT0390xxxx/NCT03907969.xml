  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a modular Phase I/IIa, open-label, multi-centre, study of AZD7648 administered&#xD;
      orally, either as a monotherapy, or in combination with either cytotoxic chemotherapies or&#xD;
      novel anti-cancer agents in participants with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The modular design allows for an escalation of the dose of AZD7648 alone or in combination&#xD;
      with either cytotoxic chemotherapies or novel anti-cancer agents, with intensive safety&#xD;
      monitoring to ensure the safety of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 modules each evaluating the safety and tolerability of AZD7648&#xD;
      monotherapy or with a specific combination partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core module of the study is dose escalation (Part A) of AZD7648 monotherapy, administered&#xD;
      orally, in participants with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination module 1 has 2 study parts: Part A consisting of dose escalation cohorts and Part&#xD;
      B, a safety and proof of concept Phase IIa expansion. A Safety Review Committee will review&#xD;
      evaluable participants at each cohort and assess if the study should progress to Part B.&#xD;
