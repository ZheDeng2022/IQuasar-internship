  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ER+ and HER2- breast cancer(BC) patients for whom BCS is not feasible, we investigate the&#xD;
      rate of BCS can be increased while decreasing unnecessary chemotherapy thru selective&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy using tools of nodal status, Ki-67,&#xD;
      and multigene assay(Mammaprint)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with resectable BC, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recognized as one of the&#xD;
      standard therapy in order to control and prevent the micrometastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducting neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead to increased numbers of BCS compared with&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy and the prognosis of BC patients is known to be improved when there is&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with no pCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is different in breast cancer subtypes. The quasi-pCR&#xD;
      in HR- HER2+ BC is reported as 67% while 37% and 13% in triple negative and HR+ HER2- BC,&#xD;
      respectively and it indicates that neoadjuvant chemotherapy has only limited effect in HR+ BC&#xD;
      and the declined quality of life and the fecundity loss due to chemotherapy is a serious&#xD;
      socioeconomic loss, especially in young patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the SOFT trial, for high risk, pre-menopausal women, use of exmestane (AI,&#xD;
      Aromatase Inhibitors) and ovarian suppression as adjuvant systemic therapy did improve the&#xD;
      PFD compared with the use of tamoxifen and ovarian suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy as well as neoadjuvant chemotherapy has benefits in making&#xD;
      inoperable BC to operable BC and improving the possibility of BCS by reducing the tumor size&#xD;
      with complete response or partial response. Although these neoadjuvant systemic therapies&#xD;
      have an ultimate objective to reduce the recurrence rate and improve the survival rate, the&#xD;
      overall survival and disease-free survival has been reported similar to adjuvant systemic&#xD;
      therapies. The clinical response rate of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy ranged from 13.5% to&#xD;
      100%, the radiologic response rate by ultrasound ranged from 20% to 91.7%, and these are&#xD;
      statistically similar to the response rate of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+ patients.&#xD;
      Most studies where letrozole was tested among AIs showed that letrozole has a similar or a&#xD;
      little better effect on clinical or radiological response rate over tamoxifen and there were&#xD;
      statistically more patients who became operable or eligible for BCS after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Comparison studies among AIs showed that the response rates have been best&#xD;
      achieved in letrozole over anastrozole and exemestane and the BCS rate was lowest in&#xD;
      letrozole without statistical significance. According to the standard treatment guideline&#xD;
      suggesting the selective use of ovarian suppression along with tamoxifen in HR+,&#xD;
      premenopausal patients, a study investigated the combined treatment of letrozole with&#xD;
      reversible ovarian ablation using goserelin (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone: LHRH).&#xD;
      The results showed that the response rate of the combination treatment of goserelin and&#xD;
      anastrozole for 24 weeks as neoadjuvant hormonal therapy was statistically superior to&#xD;
      goserelin and tamoxifen in premenopausal BC patients and this was not observed in the&#xD;
      adjuvant setting. The most commonly used agents in BC are goserelin and leuprorelin(Leuplin)&#xD;
      and their mechanism of action is to desensitize the hypothalamus and suppress the ovarian&#xD;
      function by reducing the secretion of LH and FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MammaPrint, which analyses 70-gene expressed in breast cancer, can identify low risk patients&#xD;
      who may safely forgo chemotherapy and high risk patients who can benefit from chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Recent results from MINDACT trial have proved that 46.2% of HR+ and clinical high risk&#xD;
      patients were classified into MammaPrint low risk and they could avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In 2017 San Antonio breast cancer symposium, Dubsky et al. reported the&#xD;
      analysis of correlation between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and score of Endopredict(EP)&#xD;
      multigene assay in ER+ and HER2- patients treated on ABCSG 34. In neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      group, reduction of tumor size in patients with low EP score(Endopredict low risk group) was&#xD;
      significantly low(NPV 100%). Meanwhile, in neoadjuvant hormonal therapy group, reduction of&#xD;
      tumor size in patients with high EP score(Endopredict high risk group) was significantly&#xD;
      low(NPV 92%). These results support the evidence that response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or&#xD;
      hormonal therapy can be predicted by the molecular score of tumor and selective treatment can&#xD;
      maximize the effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, in this study, patients with MammaPrint test is performed, neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy is conducted to genomic High Risk patients, and neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is&#xD;
      conducted to Low Risk patients. Although adjuvant therapy is conducted after the completion&#xD;
      of this study, in case there is progressive disease (PD) after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy,&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy is conducted.&#xD;
