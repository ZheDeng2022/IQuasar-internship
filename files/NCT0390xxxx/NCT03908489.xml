  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preservation of the remaining vital portion of curiously exposed pulpal tissue in primary&#xD;
      teeth, was one of the most frequent problems in pediatric dentistry. To solve this problem,&#xD;
      pulpotomy therapy was introduced. Pulpotomy involves amputation of the coronal portion of&#xD;
      affected or infected dental pulp, treatment of the remaining vital radicular pulp tissue&#xD;
      surface should preserve the vitality and function of all or part of the remaining radicular&#xD;
      portion of the pulp. Furthermore, it is an accepted procedure for treating both primary and&#xD;
      permanent teeth with carious pulp exposures, several materials have been using for capping&#xD;
      the radicular pulp after pulpotomy, these included formocresol, glutaraldehyde, ferric&#xD;
      sulfate, and mineral trioxide aggregate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allium sativum is one of the most extensively researched medical plants and its antibacterial&#xD;
      activity depends on allicin produced by the enzymatic activity of allinase (a cysteine&#xD;
      sulfoxide lyase). Allicin and other thiosulfinates are believed to be responsible for the&#xD;
      range of therapeutic effects reported for garlic. Garlic extract has been reported to inhibit&#xD;
      growth of various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies showed that A.&#xD;
      sativum oil is used as new pulp medications and it offers a good healing potential, leaving&#xD;
      the remaining pulp tissue healthy and functioning. MTA is a unique material with various&#xD;
      advantages. It has been used successfully by pediatric dentists in a variety of clinical&#xD;
      applications. However, its drawbacks especially its high cost, discoloration potential,&#xD;
      difficulty in handling, and long setting time.&#xD;

      1. Hypothesis This research adopts null hypothesis; it assumes that the use of the both&#xD;
           garlic oil dressed in zinc oxide powder and MTA as vital pulpotomy dressing material&#xD;
           have the same effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pilot study, two arms split mouth design with 1:1 allocation ratio. Patient's, clinical&#xD;
           and radiographic outcomes assessors and statistician will be blinded in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Diagnostic procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Clinical examination will be done on the dental clinic using mirror and probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Diagnosis of the cases will be performed according to guidelines of AAPD 2017 for&#xD;
           treatment of vital pulp therapy in primary teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Preoperative photographs will be taken&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An individual XCP (Extension Cone Paralleling) index will be prepared for each&#xD;
                patient by registering the bite to allow consistent comparisons of the radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preoperative periapical radiograph will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Intra operative procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • After randomly selecting which side will be in an intervention or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Apply topical anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Local anesthesia administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Rubber dam application and access cavity preparation will be established using a&#xD;
           sterile bur.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Coronal pulp tissue will be removed using sharp large spoon excavator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Apply wet cotton pellet for few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Then one side will be treated with Allium sativum oil dressed with zinc oxide powder&#xD;
           -A. sativum oil paste, contralateral with MTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Then, a layer of zinc phosphate base will be placed over the dressing materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • After that, those molars will be restored with stainless steel crowns and cemented&#xD;
           using glass ionomer cement (GIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
           C. Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up will be performed at 3, 6 and 9 months according to guidelines for clinical&#xD;
           and radiographic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           D. Criteria for discontinuing or modifying intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case of unsuccessful outcomes of the intervention technique, the case will be managed&#xD;
           by MTA pulpectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           E. Strategies to improve adherence to intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Face to face sessions with the patients to stress on the importance of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           F. Concomitant care Oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ry outcome 1. Post-operative Pain: Spontaneous pain and pain on biting will be reported&#xD;
           by asking the patient using visual analogue scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ry outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain on percussion:Presence or absence of pain will be detected by tapping on the tooth&#xD;
           using back of mirror handle using visual analogue scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Swelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Presence or absence of swelling related to the affected tooth will be detected by visual&#xD;
           intra-oral clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sinus or fistula:Presence or absence of sinus or fistula related to the affected tooth&#xD;
           will be detected by visual intra-oral clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Furcation involvement:It will be evaluated radiographically using DIGORA software using&#xD;
           radiographic failure score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. periapical radiolucency: It will be evaluated radiographically using DIGORA software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pathological internal or external root resorption: It will be evaluated radiographically&#xD;
           using DIGORA software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Widening of periodontal membrane space:It will be evaluated radiographically using&#xD;
           DIGORA software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5- Recruitment: Recruitment of the patients will be from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Cairo University. Screening of patients will&#xD;
      continue until the target population is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6- Implementation Co-supervisor; Randa Youssef Abd Al Gawad will assign which participant&#xD;
      tooth will be included to either control or intervention groups according to the generated&#xD;
      random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Masking/blinding: The statistician, clinical and radiographic outcomes assessors will be&#xD;
      blinded in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Data collection, management, and analysis: Data collection method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected by the operator through a paper-based Case Report custom made&#xD;
      form (CRF) which will be developed by the research team. It will include the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient serial number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients medical history:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Past medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any present disease or illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Current medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any specific pre-treatment medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Past dental history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Records for current dental condition (intra-oral examination and caries index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The custom made CRF will be developed before online registration of the study protocol. CRF&#xD;
      will be anonymous where patients will be identified by their serial number. The full detailed&#xD;
      personal data of the patient will be written in a separate sheet having the patient's serial&#xD;
      number for further contact with patient, this sheet can be only seen by the operator and the&#xD;
      supervisors. The Co-supervisor; Dr. Randa Youssef Abd El-Gawad, will have the role to monitor&#xD;
      the process of data collection and check if there is any incomplete CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be collected by the lead researcher as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain (spontaneous or on biting):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Will be recorded by asking patient using visual analogue scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain on percussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Presence or absence will be detected by tapping the tooth with the back of the mirror&#xD;
           using visual analogue scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Swelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Presence or absence will be detected by visual examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sinus or fistula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Presence or absence will be detected by visual examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Widening in periodontal membrane space&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. furcation involvement or periapical radiolucency :Presence or absence will be detected&#xD;
           radiographically by Digora Image plate according to radiographic failure score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9- Data management: Data will be entered on a software then stored online on a Google app&#xD;
      (Google drive). Only the lead researcher will be allowed to enter the data and it will be&#xD;
      revised by both senior and co supervisors. Patient files will be stored in numerical order&#xD;
      and stored in secure and accessible place and all data will be maintained in storage for 1&#xD;
      year after completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans to promote participant retention and complete follow- up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone numbers of all patients included in the study will be recorded as a part of the&#xD;
      written consent. All patients will be given a phone call at the time of the pre-determined&#xD;
      follow up dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 - Data monitoring: Monitoring No formal data monitoring committee will be needed since&#xD;
      most of studies in Faculty of Dentistry are with known minimal risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11- Harms Any possible adverse effects of the interventions (allergy to any of the used&#xD;
      materials, swelling, sinus, fistula, pain or infection) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12- Audit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for auditing include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allocation to study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to trial interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcomes assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing will be performed in order to preserve the integrity of the trial. This will be&#xD;
      ensured by periodic independent review of trial processes and documents by the Evidence Based&#xD;
      Committee, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University IV. Ethics and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      13- Research ethics approval This protocol and the template informed consent forms appended&#xD;
      to the protocol will be reviewed by the Ethics Committee of Scientific Research, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14- Protocol amendments The Ethics Committee and Evidence Based Committee, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Cairo University will be notified of any administrative changes or modifications&#xD;
      of the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, potential benefit of the&#xD;
      patient or may affect patient safety, including changes of study objectives, study design,&#xD;
      sample sizes or study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15- Informed consent Once the child is identified as eligible to the study by the clinical&#xD;
      investigator, the trial procedures, benefits from the study and expected harms will be&#xD;
      clearly discussed with parent or the child's legal guardian. This explanation will be&#xD;
      simplified with avoidance of any pain promoting words when the trial is discussed with the&#xD;
      child. Verbal assent will be obtained orally from the eligible child and the written consent&#xD;
      will be signed by the child's guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16- Confidentiality Personal information about participants will be acquired during the&#xD;
      process of trial recruitment, eligibility screening, and data collection. Most of this&#xD;
      information consists of private details. All study-related information will be stored&#xD;
      securely at the study site. All participants' information will be stored in locked file&#xD;
      cabinets in areas with limited access. All records that contain names or other personal&#xD;
      identifiers, will be stored separately from study records identified by code number. All&#xD;
      reports, data collection, process, and administrative forms will be identified by the child's&#xD;
      ID (ticket serial number) and will not contain any personal information to protect the&#xD;
      participant's confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17- Declaration of interest No known conflict of interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18- Access to data Lead researcher, Nourhan Omar Elgebaly, will be given an access to the&#xD;
      data sets. All data sets will be password protected. To ensure confidentiality, data&#xD;
      dispersed to project team members will be blinded of any identifying participant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      19- Ancillary and Post-trial care&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Final restoration of the teeth participated at the trial will be done in the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • All patients will be followed up until 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Full mouth treatment in addition to preventive measures will be offered for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients will be instructed to follow up the teeth one year after the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20- Dissemination policy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study results will be published as partial fulfillment of the requirements for PHD&#xD;
           degree in Pediatric Dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The result of the trial are intended to be disseminated in the library of the Faculty&#xD;
           and in the Egyptian Dental Journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topics suggested for presentation or publication will be circulated to the authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If results show the advantage of one intervention over the other, it will be recommended&#xD;
           to be performed as a routine procedure during dental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thesis defence after completion of the study will be done in public with external&#xD;
           judges.&#xD;
