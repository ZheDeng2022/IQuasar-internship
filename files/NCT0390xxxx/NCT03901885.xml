  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a disease affecting between 5 and 15% of women and more than 40% of&#xD;
      infertile women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main stakes of this disease are that it is benign but difficult to diagnose, often very&#xD;
      painful, difficult to predict, potentially recurrent, while being resolvable at menopause. It&#xD;
      affects women of childbearing age and can cause infertility and pain during intercourse.&#xD;
      Also, by its characteristics, it can significantly deteriorate the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of endometriosis, from diagnosis to treatment, is not consensual. There are&#xD;
      medical or surgical treatments depending on the severity of the lesions, their location and&#xD;
      the severity of the symptoms. Deep endometriosis, that is to say when there is digestive,&#xD;
      urinary, utero sacral or peritoneal ligament more than 5mm deep, poses, in particular, a&#xD;
      therapeutic problem because surgery is often the only option but it can be decadent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to genital involvement, this disease has a real impact on the sexuality of patients.&#xD;
      Surgery allows in a number of cases to reduce pain, including those occurring during&#xD;
      intercourse. But the impact on sexuality in a more global way remains to be studied. The&#xD;
      latter can be improved by the reduction of pain, but impacted by the surgery which is not&#xD;
      insignificant on the representation of the woman of her own body.&#xD;
