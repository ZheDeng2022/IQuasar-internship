        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant. A serious AE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect or that was considered to be an important medical event. AEs were graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. The grades were defined as follows: Grade 0: no change from normal or reference range; Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE. The focus of AE summaries was on treatment-emergent AE (TEAE). An AE was considered TEAE if the event occurred during the on-treatment period.</description>
