  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to be able to describe optical coherence angiography (OCTA)&#xD;
      patterns of disease activity and quiescence in eyes that have received treatment. The target&#xD;
      population group is patients that have neovascular age-related macular degeneration and have&#xD;
      had treatment with aflibercept for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-site study and does not involve any masking or treatment allocation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of this condition (neovascular age-related macular degeneration - nAMD) with&#xD;
      aflibercept has transformed the outlook for patients with this sight-threatening disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, eye doctors commonly use a &quot;treat and extend&quot; approach to treatment in&#xD;
      which the interval between aflibercept injections is gradually increased once there is nAMD&#xD;
      disease quiescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is uncertain about the ideal retinal imaging biomarkers doctors should use to define&#xD;
      disease remission or inactivity; and therefore extend treatment intervals. Increased&#xD;
      certainty of the ideal biomarker would also avoid stopping treatment too soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scan the investigators will be performing (OCTA imaging) detects blood flow within the&#xD;
      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) - the immature blood vessel network which causes nAMD.&#xD;
      This scan is therefore a potentially powerful way of determining if the disease is active or&#xD;
      quiescent. Disease activity on this device can be defined as a blood flow pattern which&#xD;
      suggests an active CNV or lesion growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By better defining disease activity using OCTA, eye doctors would be more confident in&#xD;
      continuing and defining a treatment plan for nAMD.&#xD;

          -  Visual acuity in the study eye of 35 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study&#xD;
             (ETDRS) letter score or better (6/60 or better)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand the nature/purpose of the study and to provide informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom imaging of the study eye leads to ungradable OCTA images.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which, in the investigators' opinion, would conflict or otherwise&#xD;
             prevent the subject from complying with the required procedures, schedule or other&#xD;
