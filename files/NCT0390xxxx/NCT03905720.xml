  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improved assessment and pharmacologic management, cancer pain is still undertreated.&#xD;
      Using non-pharmacologic treatments alongside medications may better address patients' total&#xD;
      pain experience by relieving physical and psychological symptoms and reducing the adverse&#xD;
      effects of drugs. However, our knowledge of the benefits of multidisciplinary approaches in&#xD;
      real-world hospital settings is limited. Patients want to know &quot;How can I get the most pain&#xD;
      relief with the fewest side effects?&quot; This study proposal is designed to address this&#xD;
      question by testing how combining pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic (acupuncture and pain&#xD;
      counseling) treatments can: (1) maximize effectiveness, (2) minimize harms, and (3) align&#xD;
      with patients' preferences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study compares clinically-relevant therapeutic options in two high-volume hospitals (one&#xD;
      public, one university) to address the core research question of whether non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      approaches improve symptom management among diverse inpatients. Study investigators will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of acupuncture and of pain counseling independently and in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to two factors each with two levels, yielding four&#xD;
      experimental conditions: (1) standard pharmacologic pain management, (2) pharmacologic pain&#xD;
      management + acupuncture, (3) pharmacologic pain management + pain counseling, (4)&#xD;
      pharmacologic pain management + acupuncture + pain counseling. Patient outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed using a mixed-methods approach, with validated scales for quantitative measures and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews to elicit stakeholder perspectives (patients, caregivers, providers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a pragmatic clinical trial at two hospitals to address these&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effectiveness of adjunctive acupuncture and of pain counseling for&#xD;
           improving pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the extent that adjunctive acupuncture and pain counseling reduce use of&#xD;
           opioid analgesics and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine stakeholder perspectives on non-pharmacologic approaches to pain management.&#xD;

    <measure>Health-related quality of life assessed by the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for up to four hospital days</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'.

    <time_frame>Assessed once at the end of hospital stay (average length of stay = 5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale includes subscales of satisfaction with information, medical care, effectiveness, and side effects with reliability ranging from 0.83 to 0.92. Each of the subscales are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
