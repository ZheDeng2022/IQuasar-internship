  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)&#xD;
      inhibitor tolcapone, relative to placebo, affects response to alcohol, decision-making, brain&#xD;
      activation associated with alcohol cue reactivity, response inhibition, and selective&#xD;
      attention, or alcohol drinking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of an FDA-approved medication called tolcapone in people who&#xD;
      have both Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The&#xD;
      study involves seven visits over a three to four week period, including an assessment visit&#xD;
      and two eight-day medication periods during which participants will be assigned to take, in a&#xD;
      double-blinded fashion, both tolcapone and a placebo (three visits during each period).&#xD;
      During two of these visits, participants will undergo a one-hour MRI scan. Participants must&#xD;
      not be seeking treatment for AUD or ADHD and must not be currently taking any psychotropic&#xD;
      medications, including stimulant medications for ADHD.&#xD;
