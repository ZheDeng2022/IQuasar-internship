  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Society Score (KSS), a physician- and self-administered questionnaire consisting of several items to measure the outcomes; in this study, the following KOOS scores ranging from 0 to 100 were analyzed: Symptoms Score, Satisfaction Score, Expectation Score, Walking and Standing Score, Standard Activity Score, Advanced Activity Score, Discretionary Activity Score, and Functional Activities Score. Lower KSS scores indicated worse knee conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a self-administered psychometric response instrument to evaluate subject-reported assessment of pain in each knee. There are multiple ways to present VAS scores; in this study, the numerical score ranged from 0 to 100 was used, with the higher score corresponding to the worse pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index, a self-administered questionnaire consisting of several items (grouped into symptoms, function, daily living, pain, etc) to measure the outcomes using the scores: Total WOMAC score (sum of all scores), WOMAC pain score (range 0 to 20), WOMAC stiffness score (range 0 to 8), and WOMAC physical function score (range of 0 to 68). The higher WOMAC scores corresponded to worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Knee Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Total Knee Assessment score is a self-administered questionnaire comprising multiple-choice questions regarding subjects' knee-related pain and limitations in ability to work, sports, and other daily living activities. In this study, the numbers and percentages of subjects answering each multiple-choice question were summarized. The higher percentage of subjects giving an answer indicating a higher level of limitations was indicative of worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxford Knee Assessment (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Oxford Knee Assessment (OKS) is a self-administered questionnaire comprising multiple-choice questions aimed to grade subjects' ability to perform daily activities. The overall score is the sum of all items and range from 0 to 48, with a higher score corresponding to better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score (KOOS) is a self -administered joint-specific questionnaire comprising questions regarding subject's symptoms, knee stiffness, pain, function and daily living, function and sports and recreational activities, and quality of life; in this study, the following KOOS scores ranging from 0 to 100 (with a score of 0 indicating the worst possible symptoms) were analyzed: Pain Score, Other Symptoms Score, Function in Daily Living Score, Function in Sport and Recreation Score, and Quality of Life Score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score Jr (KOOS Jr)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score Jr (KOOS Jr) is a shorter self-administered alternative to KOOS focusing on joint pain, stiffness, and daily living and allowing for faster completion by the subject. In this study, the KOOS Interval Score ranging from 0 to 100 was analyzed (with a score of 0 indicating the worst possible symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 Version 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through last study visit, approximately 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 Version 1 is a self-administered multipurpose (not aimed to specific disease group) short form survey with questions selected from the longer SF-36 Health Survey and comprising the following scores: Physical Health Composite Score (range 0 for the worst health to 100 for the best health) and Mental Health Composite Score (range 0 for the worst health to 100 for the best health)</description>
