  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that inflammatory processes are key elements in the secondary effects of&#xD;
      severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study was designed to examine whether the&#xD;
      peripheral inflammatory markers and brain structural alterations be associated with clinical&#xD;
      measures and primary outcome following severe TBI. We hypothesized that peripheral&#xD;
      inflammatory markers might be correlated with voxel-based GM volumes in patients with&#xD;
      disorder of consciousness.&#xD;

      Background: Systemic inflammation, neurocognitive impairments, and morphologic brain changes&#xD;
      are associated with outcome in patients with disorder of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the value of peripheral inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and brain structural alterations in the chronic phase after severe traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and TNF-α were&#xD;
      investigated in patients with chronic disorder of consciousness and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Correlations were carried out between GM, WM, and CSF volumes and inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      levels. In addition, the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score was used to quantify the&#xD;
      severity, and long-term recovery clinical outcome at 12 month was determined according to&#xD;
      Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).&#xD;

    <description>Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score was used to quantify the severity, which consists of 23 hierarchically arranged items that comprise six subscales addressing auditory, visual, motor, oromotor/verbal, communication, and arousal processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors.</description>

      Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected in a Vacutainer® tube without anticoagulant, using&#xD;
      standardized phlebotomy procedures. Serum was prepared by centrifugation (2,000 g, 5 min,&#xD;
      4°C) and stored at -80°C until further analysis.&#xD;
