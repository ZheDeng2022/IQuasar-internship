  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Souroubea sympetala extracts have shown anxiolytic properties in animal models. Souroubea and&#xD;
      its active principle betulinic acid appear to exert these effects by acting as an agonist for&#xD;
      the benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site of the GABAA receptor with no withdrawal effects on&#xD;
      food intake, locomotor activity, or other symptoms typically associated with BZD agonism. As&#xD;
      such, this may offer a valuable source for an alternative anti-anxiety treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      single daily dose of an extract of a mixture of Souroubea spp. leaf and small branch material&#xD;
      and Platanus spp. bark when administered orally over two weeks in healthy volunteers. Based&#xD;
      on its safety in canine trials, we hypothesize that Souroubea-Platanus (SP) preparation will&#xD;
      be well tolerated with adverse event profile similar to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is (2) to establish whether some of the anxiolytic properties of&#xD;
      Souroubea-platanus seen in animal models will translate to human participants. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that Souroubea-Platanus preparation will demonstrate anxiolytic and/or stress-reduction&#xD;
      properties as indicated by salivary cortisol levels and self-report measures of anxiety.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within Latin American indigenous communities tea brewed from fresh or dried crushed Souroubea&#xD;
      leaves is used to treat Susto, a culture-bound syndrome resembling manifestations of Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorders. Souroubea sympetala (Ss) leaf extract has shown to be effective as an anxiolytic&#xD;
      in animal models, and betulinic acid (BA) is one of the active molecules responsible for&#xD;
      mediating this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plant-based natural products are sought by many individuals as alternatives or supplements to&#xD;
      standard medical care. As a result, more research is required in order to develop botanical&#xD;
      treatments that are evidence-based, safe and guided by health practitioners.&#xD;
      Souroubea-Platanus may offer such alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that Souroubea-Platanus was well tolerated in Beagles in a 28-day pilot&#xD;
      study at 8x recommended dose, producing significant reductions in plasma cortisol 1h&#xD;
      post-administration without any adverse reactions, except slightly reduced platelet count in&#xD;
      2 animals attributed to infection with Ehrlichia canis, likely contracted prior to the study&#xD;
      onset. In a follow-up 16 beagles and up to 5x the recommended does for 28 days such decrease&#xD;
      in platelet count was not observed, no there were any other adverse events. No adverse events&#xD;
      have been reported in animals for the animal health product version of the drug (Zentrol)&#xD;
      that has been on the market for 2 years. The naturalistic observations of Souroubea&#xD;
      consumption suggest that it is safe for human use, however, this has not been established in&#xD;
      a formal study. In addition, drug interactions have occurred with some herbal products,&#xD;
      particularly those that strongly inhibit or induce CYP enzymes. As Souroubea may act on the&#xD;
      BDZ binding site of the GABAA receptor, possible side-effects and symptoms similar to those&#xD;
      associated with benzodiazepine anxiolytics are possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has significant clinical relevance for anxiety and stress-related disorders and may&#xD;
      lead to developing a new anxiolytic agent or supplement with more selective effects and&#xD;
      reduced risks for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-five healthy adult volunteers will be enrolled in the single-center, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel group study. Power analysis revealed that to achieve a power of 0.80,&#xD;
      with an estimated effect size of 0.40 (estimate based on rodent studies), a total sample size&#xD;
      of 42 would be required. Accounting for approximately 10% predicted participant dropout rate&#xD;
      per group, it is expected that 45 participants will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups with 15 individuals&#xD;
      in each for detecting a dose-response effect. Treatment groups will be either (a) 190mg&#xD;
      extract (b) 380mg extract, or (c) inert placebo, all in identical vegicaps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsules containing the placebo and the extracts will be produced under GMP conditions. In&#xD;
      accordance with Health Canada guidelines, extract will conform to the acceptable limits for&#xD;
      heavy metal and biological contamination. The placebo will consist of microcrystalline&#xD;
      cellulose suitable for use in foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capsules will be taken once a day in the morning with water for 2 consecutive weeks. The&#xD;
      safety evaluations will be conducted at screening and repeated at the end of the 2-week study&#xD;
      period. Adverse events will be evaluated after 1 week and 2 weeks of treatment and 1 week&#xD;
      after discontinuation. The participants will be asked to maintain their regular lifestyle and&#xD;
      diet during the study period so long as those habits do not violate the study exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to take the capsules at the same time every morning. Compliance&#xD;
      will be facilitated by daily reminders by e-mail, text, or phone call and a review of the&#xD;
      returned medication vials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have 24-hour phone access to the study physician for emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Compensation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be reimbursed for their time in participation, as well as for&#xD;
      transportation and parking costs on prorated basis corresponding to minimal hourly wage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation&#xD;
      of clinical endpoints. Participant numbers will be assigned in sequential order as&#xD;
      participants enroll in the study. All participants will be asked to come in at the same time&#xD;
      for all testing periods after screening (Days 1, 7, 14, and 21) in order to account for&#xD;
      time-of-day effects on cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of the treatment groups according to a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization schedule prepared by contracted pharmacy personnel. The randomization&#xD;
      will be balanced by using permuted blocks. Pharmacy personnel will package and label study&#xD;
      drug for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigator or his/her designate and study participant will remain blind to the&#xD;
      participants' group until the completion of the study. The blind should be broken only if in&#xD;
      emergency requiring knowing the treatment status of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline screening will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Medical history, physical examination, and vital signs, including temperature,&#xD;
                heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Mental status examination, including completion of the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1&#xD;
                Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure - Adult with follow-up on any items rated as present&#xD;
                in at least mild degree;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Laboratory tests and urine drug screen as described below;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential; must not be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Each volunteer will provide a blood and urine sample in the morning, within 14 days&#xD;
                before the start of the study (baseline), 7 days after the first dose, and on the&#xD;
                last day of the study (day 14). Body weight will be measured at baseline and day&#xD;
                14. Physical examination including vital signs and inquiry of adverse events will&#xD;
                be performed on days 7 and 14. Additional evaluation of adverse events will be done&#xD;
                one week after discontinuation of the study drug. Vital signs will be monitored&#xD;
                until 1 hour after administration of the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete blood count: white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, red blood cell&#xD;
           (RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and indices, platelet count;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chemistry panel: glucose, calcium, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), BUN,&#xD;
           creatinine, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase,&#xD;
           aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatine kinase;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urinalysis will be standard, microscopic if indicated;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  salivary cortisol will be measured as a stress indicator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy testing in females will consist of a serum test (for convenience, since other blood&#xD;
      samples are already being collected during screening; this should not normally require&#xD;
      additional venipuncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will be collected using sterile saliva sample tubes. Blood and urine samples&#xD;
      will be collected at the clinical laboratory. Blood samples will be drawn by venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records of health data identifying participants will be kept on record for 25 years before&#xD;
      being destroyed; all records will be kept confidential during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) on Days 1 (baseline and 1 hour post-dose), 7 and&#xD;
           14.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DSM-5 Self-rated Level 2 anxiety adult short form on Days 1, 7, and 14&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cortisol (physiological marker of stress): salivary concentration; analysis - difference&#xD;
           between pre- and 1 h post dose on Day 1, max changes from baseline and group x time&#xD;
           effects and interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical means and standard deviations will be calculated for each continuous variable.&#xD;
      ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey's test will be used to evaluate significant differences&#xD;
      among dose groups and different days. A P-value of 0.05 will be considered as the level of&#xD;
      significant difference in the analysis of the data. Behavioural variables will be analyzed&#xD;
      using mixed effects ANOVA for repeated measures where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transformations for non-normality and/or corrective procedures will be applied if data is&#xD;
      found to be non-normally distributed or otherwise in violation of the assumptions of the&#xD;
      statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAI: the total sum scores (T-scores); analysis - max changes from baseline and group x time&#xD;
      effects and interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol: salivary concentration; analysis - difference between pre- and 1 h post dose on Day&#xD;
      1, max changes from baseline and group x time effects and interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will be based on the baseline to treatment-period differences in&#xD;
      laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs and the incidence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events (AE) regardless of casual relationship with investigational treatment will&#xD;
      be recorded. An AE will be considered treatment-emergent if it is new in onset or aggravated&#xD;
      in severity or frequency following administration of the investigational agent. All treatment&#xD;
      emergent AE will be followed until resolution or a stable clinical endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious AE, e.g. any AE that is fatal, immediately life threatening, requires or prolongs&#xD;
      hospitalization, causes permanent or significant disability will be reported to Health Canada&#xD;
      and IRB and immediately addressed medically as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to general,&#xD;
      non-directed questioning. All treatment-emergent AEs will be recorded in the source document&#xD;
      using medical terminology.&#xD;
