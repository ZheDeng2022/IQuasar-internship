  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the relative contributions of four established&#xD;
      predictors of hyperandrogenism (luteinizing hormone [LH] secretion, ovarian response to&#xD;
      recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin [r-hCG] administration, adrenal response to&#xD;
      adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] administration, and hyperinsulinemia) in older vs. young&#xD;
      women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in a cross-sectional, physiological study. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that hyperinsulinemia is a stronger independent predictor of free&#xD;
      testosterone (T) in older reproductive aged (vs. young) women with PCOS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PCOS is a highly prevalent reproductive disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism (HA) and&#xD;
      oligo/anovulation. PCOS is also associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. In young women with PCOS, several factors contribute to HA: a) excess LH&#xD;
      secretion, b) abnormal ovarian steroidogenesis, c) abnormal adrenal steroidogenesis, and d)&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia/ insulin resistance. Of interest, HA (and menstrual function) improves with&#xD;
      age in PCOS. However, the relative contributions of the aforementioned HA-related factors in&#xD;
      young adult vs. late reproductive-aged women with PCOS are not known. Identifying the most&#xD;
      important predictor(s) of HA in older women with PCOS will be critically important for&#xD;
      devising the most relevant therapeutic strategies for older women with PCOS. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to determine the relative contributions of four established predictors&#xD;
      of HA (LH secretion, ovarian response to r-hCG administration, adrenal response to ACTH&#xD;
      administration, and hyperinsulinemia) in older vs. young women with PCOS in a physiological&#xD;
      study. The investigators hypothesize that hyperinsulinemia is a stronger independent&#xD;
      predictor of free testosterone (T) in older reproductive aged (vs. young) women with PCOS. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators hypothesize that, in older vs. young women with PCOS: a) ovarian&#xD;
      response to r-hCG will be a weaker independent predictor of free T; b) mean LH will be a&#xD;
      stronger independent predictor of free T; and c) the predictive ability of adrenal response&#xD;
      to ACTH will be similar. This will be a cross-sectional physiological study. Ordinary Least&#xD;
      Square (OLS) regression will be utilized to determine the relative contributions of 4&#xD;
      established predictors of HA in older vs. young women with PCOS. Statistical plans include&#xD;
      intra-age group hypothesis testing, inter-age group hypothesis testing, and a ranking of the&#xD;
      importance of predictors in each age group.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with PCOS aged 20-30 years and 40-49 years. Subject is considered to have PCOS&#xD;
             if she has current or verifiable history of: a) clinical and/or biochemical evidence&#xD;
             of hyperandrogenism plus b) oligomenorrhea (average menstrual cycle length &gt;45 days or&#xD;
             fewer than 9 menses/year) or irregular menstruation (substantially inconsistent&#xD;
             menstrual cycle length). Note: For subjects aged 40-49 years, they will be allowed to&#xD;
             participate if they have fewer than 10 menses/year (average menstrual cycle length &gt;35&#xD;
             days) as long as they have a compelling past history of oligomenorrhea or irregular&#xD;
             menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening safety labs within normal reference ranges although mild abnormalities that&#xD;
             are common in obesity and/or hyperandrogenism will not be grounds for exclusion (see&#xD;
             exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to strictly avoid pregnancy (using non-hormonal methods) during the time&#xD;
             of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal status (i.e., absence of periods for previous year plus elevated&#xD;
             follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biochemical evidence for perimenopause as defined by an anti-Mullerian hormone &lt;0.5&#xD;
             ng/mL. As an alternative, cycle day 3 FSH &gt; 9 IU/L (with concomitant estradiol level&#xD;
             &gt;80 pg/mL), if this testing is available, will serve as evidence of perimenopause&#xD;
             status. NOTE: If FSH &gt;9 IU/L on screening (but it is not cycle day 3), FSH and&#xD;
             estradiol will be repeated on cycle day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being a study of older women with PCOS, children and men will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation within the past 6 months. Subjects with a positive pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be informed of the result by the screening physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of (or clinical evidence for) Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) &gt;200&#xD;
             ng/dL, which suggest the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 17-OHP will be&#xD;
             collected during follicular phase. NOTE: if a 17-OHP &gt;200 ng/dL and is confirmed on&#xD;
             repeat testing, an ACTH-stimulated 17-OHP &lt;1000 ng/dL will be required for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL, which suggests the possibility of virilizing neoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DHEA-S greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range (mild elevations may be&#xD;
             seen in PCOS, so elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in&#xD;
             these groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Virilization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, or a hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
             of ≥ 6.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Subjects with stable and&#xD;
             adequately-treated hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe hyperprolactinemia. Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in PCOS,&#xD;
             and elevations &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent liver abnormalities, with the exception that mild bilirubin elevations will&#xD;
             be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Mild transaminase elevations&#xD;
             may be seen in women with obesity, so elevations &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             will be accepted in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin level is less than 11 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt;36% and hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who remain anemic after two sequential months of ferrous gluconate (325 mg&#xD;
             twice daily) will be excluded from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal sodium, potassium, or bicarbonate concentrations or elevated creatinine&#xD;
             concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant history of pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., asthma or COPD requiring&#xD;
             intermittent systemic corticosteroid, pulmonary hypertension, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known or suspected congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known or suspected ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level &gt; 500 mg/dL).&#xD;
             Subjects with stable and adequately treated hypertriglyceridemia reflected by normal&#xD;
             triglyceride values will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cut off threshold for estimated dominant ovarian cyst size on the day of r-hCG&#xD;
             injection will be 18 mm. Since the ultrasound will be assessed 3-4 days prior to r-hCG&#xD;
             administration, we will estimate the size of the dominant follicle (at the time of&#xD;
             r-hCG administration) using the typical rate of ovarian follicle growth of 1.4 mm per&#xD;
             day. If the dominant follicle size exceeds the cut off threshold, the subject will be&#xD;
             asked to repeat the transvaginal ultrasound: if menses begin within 3 weeks of the&#xD;
             prior ultrasound, the ultrasound would be repeated during the new menstrual cycle. If&#xD;
             menses do not occur within 3 weeks of the prior ultrasound, the ultrasound will then&#xD;
             be scheduled at the subject's earliest convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ovarian enlargement, defined by ovarian volume greater than 15 mm on transvaginal&#xD;
             ultrasound. If the ovarian volume exceeds the cut off threshold, the participant will&#xD;
             be given an option to repeat the transvaginal ultrasound in 2-3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of venous thromboembolism (e.g. deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism (PE)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of blood clotting disorders (e.g., protein C, protein S, positive&#xD;
             antiphospholipid antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First-degree relative history of blood clotting disorder, unless the same disorder has&#xD;
             been formally excluded for the study subject. Note: any abnormal labs may be repeated&#xD;
             to exclude a lab error.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No medications known to affect the reproductive system can be taken in the 2 months&#xD;
             prior to screening and 3 months prior to the study. Such medications include oral&#xD;
             contraceptive pills, metformin, progestins, glucocorticoids, anti-psychotics and/or&#xD;
             mood stabilizers that are known to cause hormone abnormalities.&#xD;
