    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the PD, PK, and safety of 500 to 2000&#xD;
      mg/m2 PTX-100 in patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTX-100 will be administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes on days 1 to 5 of a 14-day cycle&#xD;
      for 4 cycles unless toxicity is observed.&#xD;
