  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ligelizumab in adult&#xD;
      Japanese subjects with CSU, who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H1-antihistamines&#xD;
      (AHs) at locally approved doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of approximately 65 male and female subjects aged ≥ 18&#xD;
      years who have been diagnosed with CSU and who remain symptomatic despite the use of H1-AH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase III multi-center, open-label, single arm study. There is a screening period&#xD;
      of up to 28 days, a 52 week treatment period, and a 12 week post-treatment follow-up period.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed as absolute change from baseline of UAS7 by visit up to end of study. The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is the sum of Hive Severity Score (HSS) and Itch Severiry Score (ISS).&#xD;
The HSS has a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe). A weekly score (HSS7) is derived by adding up the average daily scores of the preceding 7 days.&#xD;
The ISS also has a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe/difficult to tolerate). A weekly score (ISS7) is derived by adding up the average daily scores of the preceding 7 days.&#xD;
The UAS7 is the sum of the HSS7 score and the ISS7 score, and has a possible range in score of 0-42.</description>
