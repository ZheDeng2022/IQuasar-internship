  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and efficacy of the BridgePoint CTO system in recanalization of CTO&#xD;
      lesions which are resistant to a conventional wire approach in a multicenter study in Chinese&#xD;
      population&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects who are candidates for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), signed the&#xD;
      informed consent form and had chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) lesion will be evaluated&#xD;
      for enrollment in this study.At least 100 subjects will be enrolled. Each site will be&#xD;
      allowed to enroll up to a maximum of 25 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Effectiveness Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical Success: the ability of the BridgePoint Medical System to successfully facilitate&#xD;
      placement of a guidewire beyond a CTO lesion in the true vessel lumen/within the collaterals&#xD;
      in those cases that were otherwise refractory to treatment with a currently marketed&#xD;
      guidewire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-day MACE rate for CTO cases in which the BridgePoint Medical System was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MACE is defined as the composite of cardiac death, Q-wave and non-Q-wave myocardial&#xD;
      infarction(MI), and any ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization(TLR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    HGRAC approval letter had expired. The enrollment speed of FAST CTO is much slower than&#xD;
    planning and the scientific value becomes limited due to the delayed data readout anticipation.&#xD;
