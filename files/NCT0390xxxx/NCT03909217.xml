  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to examine whether&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical cranial-auricular acupoint stimulation (TECAS) is non-inferior to&#xD;
      the antidepressant drug (Escitalopram) in treating mild-to-moderate depression, to evaluate&#xD;
      the depressive subtypes who are suitable for the TECAS treatment. To achieve this objective,&#xD;
      470 patients with mild-to-moderate depression will be recruited and assigned to receive TECAS&#xD;
      treatment (n =235) or Escitalopram (n =235, 10-20mg/day, q.d.) for 8 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); other outcomes include&#xD;
      the17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA),&#xD;
      Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the Short Form 36 Health Survey and TCM diagnosis of&#xD;
      depression. In addition, the safety index will be measured throughout the whole study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a common and costly disorder with high prevalence rate and high suicide rate.&#xD;
      Antidepressants are the first-line treatments for depression. However, approximately 50% to&#xD;
      60% of the patients have not achieved adequate response following antidepressant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large body of evidence well confirms that electro-acupuncture is effective in improving&#xD;
      depression and reducing anti-depressant treatment-caused side effects, including pain,&#xD;
      nausea, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety and sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the combination of ancient and modern literature and famous traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine practitioners' experience, the Evidence-based Guidelines of Clinical Practice with&#xD;
      Acupuncture and Moxibustion-Depression (ZJ/TE003-2014) recommended Baihui (DU20) and Yintang&#xD;
      (DU29) as main acupoints in treating patients with depression via electro-acupuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team have completed a series of clinical trials, including electrical&#xD;
      stimulation on cranial and auricular acupoints for treating depression, postpartum&#xD;
      depression, post-stroke depression, and depression with somatic pain. These studies found&#xD;
      that cranial-auricular acupoint stimulation, as well as transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, can improve depressive symptoms and accompanying symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      depression significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike traditional acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical stimulation does not need needles&#xD;
      to penetrate the skin. It places electrodes on the skin of the corresponding acupoints. In&#xD;
      this way, traumatic pain and fear of acupuncture can be avoided. And it is more easily&#xD;
      accepted for patients and more convenient for clinical operation. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to build a novel transcutaneous electrical stimulation&#xD;
      therapy--Transcutaneous electrical cranial-auricular acupoint stimulation (TECAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study, a combination of transcutaneous electrical cranial and transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical auricular acupoint stimulation will be employed to treat patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate depression compared with antidepressant Escitalopram, to confirm the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of TECAS in mild-to-moderate depression.&#xD;

    <description>The 10-item Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) measures severity of depression in individuals 18 years and older (range, 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression; minimal clinically significant difference, 1.6 to 1.9 points). Each item is rated on a 7-point scale. The scale is an adaptation of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and has a greater sensitivity to change over time. The scale takes 20 to 30 minutes to complete and score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 week, 4 week, 8 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, abbreviated HDRS, HRSD or HAM-D, measures depression in individuals before, during and after treatment. The scale is administered by a health care professionals and contains 21 items, but is scored based on the first 17 items, which are measured either on 5-point or 3-point scales. It takes 15 to 20 minutes to complete and score.</description>
