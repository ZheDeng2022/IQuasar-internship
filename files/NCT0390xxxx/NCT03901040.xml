      Background: Gastric injections of Botulinum toxin A (BTA) may induce changes in gastric&#xD;
      emptying and body weight, but results vary. BTA dose and depth of injection may affect&#xD;
      efficacy. This study assess changes in satiation, symptoms, and body weight after endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of 100 U BTA into gastric antral muscularis propria of&#xD;
      obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Open label study of twenty five healthy, obese adults (age=21-49 years, body mass&#xD;
      index 35 = kg/m2) who received 100 U and were followed for 16 weeks. Measures included&#xD;
      satiation (by maximum tolerated volume [MTV] during nutrient drink test), gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms (by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) and body weight.&#xD;

      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty five overweight, healthy subjects were recruited. Persons with known gastroparesis,&#xD;
      peptic ulcer disease, active upper gastrointestinal ulceration, prior gastric or small bowel&#xD;
      surgery, ASA Class 3 (ASA, American Society of Anesthesiologists) or higher, or patients with&#xD;
      more than mild, infrequent symptoms of upper abdominal pain or nausea were excluded. Women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential underwent urinary pregnancy tests before endoscopic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satiation was assessed with the nutrient drink test, following the method of Tack et al.&#xD;
      Subjects ingested 120 ml of a nutrient drink (Ensure®) per 4 min. The cup containing the&#xD;
      nutrient drink was filled using a constant rate perfusion pump to maintain oral intake at the&#xD;
      filling rate. Participants scored their satiety at 5-min intervals using a graphic rating&#xD;
      scale that combines verbal descriptors on a scale graded 0-5 (0=no symptoms, 5=maximum, or&#xD;
      unbearable fullness). Participants stopped meal intake when a score of 5 was reached, and the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated volume (MTV) of nutrient drink was recorded. Normal values for MTV in&#xD;
      adults in our laboratory are ≥850 cc. Thirty minutes after completion, participants scored&#xD;
      symptoms of bloating, fullness, nausea, and pain using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      anchored with the words unnoticeable and unbearable at the left and right ends. The aggregate&#xD;
      symptom score was defined as the sum of the VAS scores for each symptom (i.e., maximum 400).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed with the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale&#xD;
      (GSRS), a validated questionnaire comprised of 15 items rating gastrointestinal symptoms with&#xD;
      values ranging from 0 to 3. In addition to an overall score ranging from 0 to 45, the GSRS&#xD;
      may be scored for five symptom subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      indigestion)with recall referring to the past week. It is responsive to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures During a 2-week baseline period, subjects underwent a gastric emptying test, a&#xD;
      nutrient drink test, were weighed weekly, and completed both the GSRS weekly. They then&#xD;
      underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) under propofol anesthesia. If no ulceration or&#xD;
      retained food was found during EGD, EUS and BTA injection (Botox®, Refinex) were performed&#xD;
      under the same sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS examinations were performed with pentax (Hitachi HIVISION 900) console. ??). BTA&#xD;
      injections were made via a 25-gauge EUS needle. Five injections were made into the gastric&#xD;
      antral muscularis propria, 2 to 3 cm proximal to the pylorus 20 U at each injection site&#xD;
      (total dose 100 U), Subjects were assessed for complications after recovery from anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 16-week follow-up period after BTA injections, subjects were weighed and completed&#xD;
      the GSRS weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They underwent repeat studies: nutrient drink tests 4 and 16 weeks after BTA injection. No&#xD;
      behavioral or dietary interventions were offered to study subjects.&#xD;
