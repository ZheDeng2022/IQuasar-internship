  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the ROAR project is to evaluate an Oregon Department of Corrections&#xD;
      (ODOC) pilot program that combines the use of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and&#xD;
      Certified Recovery Mentors pre-release with linkage to community substance use disorder&#xD;
      treatment to prevent fatal and non-fatal opioid overdoses among female adults released from&#xD;
      prison.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROAR examines implementation of a novel overdose prevention strategy for justice-involved&#xD;
      women as they re-enter community treatment settings after incarceration. The ODOC pilot&#xD;
      project offers initiation of opioid antagonist treatment prior to release (extended-release&#xD;
      naltrexone [XR-NTX]), ongoing support from a Certified Recovery Mentor (CRM), and facilitated&#xD;
      entry into community treatment for substance use disorders. Community treatment may include&#xD;
      continuation of XR-NTX,or transition to agonist therapy including buprenorphine or methadone,&#xD;
      or no medication for opioid use disorder.&#xD;
