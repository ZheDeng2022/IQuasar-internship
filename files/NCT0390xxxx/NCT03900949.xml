    <textblock>
      This phase I study hopes to explore how safe and tolerable is the combination of gemtuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin (GO) and midostaurin, with the standard induction therapy (cytarabine and&#xD;
      daunorubicin) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT-3 mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). GO&#xD;
      is FDA approved for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed CD33 positive AML and used&#xD;
      in combination with chemotherapy, cytarabine and daunorubicin. Midostaurin is FDA approved&#xD;
      for use with cytarabine and daunorubicin in patients with FLT3-mutated AML. By combining&#xD;
      standard induction therapy with GO and midostaurin, our aim is to investigate a novel&#xD;
      approach to treating patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to the&#xD;
      induction regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin (DA) and midostaurin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the frequency of early death associated with study treatment. II. To evaluate&#xD;
      the preliminary efficacy of the study treatment. III. To assess the safety profile of the&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Quantify CD33 expression on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts. II. Determine the CD33&#xD;
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) status previously reported to correlate with response&#xD;
      and correlate clinical outcomes of patients with the CD33 genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose finding study to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) schedule&#xD;
      of GO, and its safety and tolerability in combination with midostaurin in FLT3-mutated newly&#xD;
      diagnosed AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, daunorubicin&#xD;
      IV on days 1-3 and midostaurin 50mg orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 8-21. Patients also&#xD;
      receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV either on day or days 1 and 4 or days 1, 4 and 7 depending&#xD;
      on dose level in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RE-INDUCTION THERAPY: Between days 14 and 21 of Induction Therapy, patients who achieve at&#xD;
      least 5% bone marrow blasts after an optional bone marrow biopsy may receive a single 28-day&#xD;
      cycle of cytarabine and daunorubicin with or without midostaurin per the treating physician.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve a complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood&#xD;
      count recovery (CRi) may undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or receive&#xD;
      consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS &lt; 60 YEARS: Patients receive high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) IV on days 1, 3, and 5 and&#xD;
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV on day 1 of cycle 1 and midostaurin 50mg PO BID on days 8-21.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS &gt;= 60 YEARS: Patients receive cytarabine (MiDAC) IV on days 1, 3, and 5 and&#xD;
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV on day 1 of cycle 1 and midostaurin 50mg PO BID on days 8-21.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.&#xD;
