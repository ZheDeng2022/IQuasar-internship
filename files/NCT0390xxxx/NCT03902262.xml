      CASE PRESENTATION Case 1 An 8 year-old male started 48 hrs prior to admission with abdominal&#xD;
      pain in the right lower quadrant associated with vomiting and fever. The physical examination&#xD;
      revealed discrete bilateral conjunctival hiperemia, right cervical adenomegaly, and severe&#xD;
      abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant with a positive McBurney sign. Laboratory tests&#xD;
      showed CBC: Hb 14.1 g/dl, WBC 13,800, NT 81%, LT 3%, Plt 383,000/μl. C-reactive protein 230.9&#xD;
      mg/dl, BNP 106.4 pg/ml (0-99). Abdominal ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis.&#xD;
      A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed, and appendiceal distal enlargement with&#xD;
      fibrinopurulent tissue was found. Twelve hours after surgery, the patient presented increased&#xD;
      conjunctival hyperaemia, generalized rash as well as upper extremities edema and&#xD;
      desquamation, meeting criteria for Kawasaki disease. Cardiological evaluation showed mild&#xD;
      pericardial effusion (3mm), normal coronary arteries. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG),&#xD;
      aspirin and steroids were started with resolution of the fever, rash and the conjunctival&#xD;
      erythema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case 2. A 6-year-old male started 15 days prior to admission with fever. He presented hands&#xD;
      and feet edema and a generalized exantema. He was diagnosed with scarlet fever. The patient&#xD;
      presented conjunctival hyperemia and cheilitis. On day 15 the patient had severe abdominal&#xD;
      pain (right lower quadrant), and was hospitalized with the diagnosis of appendicitis. An&#xD;
      appendicetomy was performed and two perforations of the appendix were found. Appendicitis was&#xD;
      found (Figure 1). The patient persisted with fever and desquamation of perineal area, fingers&#xD;
      and toes were added to the clinical picture. Laboratories reported blood count: Hb 13 g/dl,&#xD;
      WBC 47,700/mm3 neutrophils 95% bands 8% platelets 551,000/μl, C-reactive protein 19.7 mg/dl,&#xD;
      ESR 53 mm/hr, hypoalbuminemia 2.2 g/dl. Diagnosis of KD was established and IVIG 2 g/kg and&#xD;
      aspirin were administered. Echocardiogram was normal. Surgical wound culture was reported&#xD;
      positive for Enterococcus faecium and Escherchia coli. Antibiotic therapy was administered&#xD;
      for 14 days with good evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case 3. A 5-year-old male patient, presented with a history of fever for 5 days diagnosed as&#xD;
      bacterial tonsillitis and treated with antibiotics without resolution. On the fifth day the&#xD;
      patient developed bilateral conjunctivitis, erythema on the lips, morbilliform exanthema in&#xD;
      the anterior and posterior thorax and abdominal pain in mesogastrium and right lower&#xD;
      cuadrant. His physical examination revealed non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis, cracked&#xD;
      lips, strawberry tongue, cervical lymphadenopathy of 0.5 x 1 cm, exanthema in thoracic and&#xD;
      dorsal region, with significant erythema of palms and soles, without skin exfoliation. The&#xD;
      patient presented with severe abdominal pain located in the right lower quadrant, with signs&#xD;
      of peritoneal irritation. Abdominal ultrasound was performed and was suggestive of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. Laboratories reported blood count: Hb 14.1 g/dl, Hcto 40.5%, WBC 3400 /uL,&#xD;
      neutrophils 3100/uL, lymphocytes 300 103/uL, platelets 41,000 103/uL; ferritin 1700 ng/ml,&#xD;
      triglycerids 190 mg/dl, C-reactive protein 8 mg/dl, normal hepatic and renal function. A&#xD;
      diagnosis of KD and acute appendicitis was made. Treatment was started with IVIG and aspirin.&#xD;
      The boy was taken to diagnostic laparoscopy where periappendicular inflammation was found.&#xD;
      The cecal appendix biopsy presented normal morphology up to the serous layer, with congestive&#xD;
      vessels, interstitial edema, and mild inflammatory infiltrate with predominantly mononuclear&#xD;
      cells within the lymphatic vessels (Figure 2). A final diagnosis of mild mononuclear&#xD;
      periappendicitis was made. The patient had an uneventful evolution with resolution of the&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
