    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of durvalumab when given together with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to others places in the&#xD;
      body (advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, pegylated liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, capecitabine, carboplatin, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with durvalumab&#xD;
      may improve how immune cells respond and attack tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of adding durvalumab to standard chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the changes that occur in the immune microenvironment in response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and assess how these changes alter the pharmacodynamic effects of a checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Investigate whether the response to immunotherapy correlates with patients' genetic&#xD;
      aberrations and/or the activation status of tumor-infiltrating and circulating T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore the relationship between immune status of the tumor and overall tumor mutational&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess preliminary antitumor activity of the durvalumab and chemotherapy combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 7 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of&#xD;
      cycles 1 and 2 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15&#xD;
      and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 8 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 and 22 of cycles 1 and 2 and day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, and&#xD;
      durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on days 8 of cycle 1, day 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles&#xD;
      3, and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM V: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 8 of cycle 1, days 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles 3, and day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM VI: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and durvalumab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 8 of cycle 1, days 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles 3, and day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM VII: Patients receive nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and durvalumab IV over&#xD;
      60 minutes on day 8 of cycle 1, days 8 and 15 of cycle 2, day 8 of cycles 3, and day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.&#xD;

                    -  For patients who have received chemotherapy in the past 6 months, a CD4&#xD;
                       count &lt; 250 cells/uL during chemotherapy is permitted as long as viral loads&#xD;
                       were undetectable during this same chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count &gt;= 250 cells/uL within&#xD;
                  28 days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must not be currently receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic&#xD;
                  infection and must not have had an opportunistic infection within the past 6&#xD;
                  months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Monitoring for HIV-infected patients should include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Viral load and CD4 count every 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of targeted agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. The&#xD;
             cytotoxic agents chosen for combination with durvalumab adversely affect human&#xD;
             fertility and gestation. For these reasons, women of childbearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use highly effective contraception prior to study entry for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation and for 6 months following the last dose of a study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there may be a risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued while&#xD;
             the patient is on this trial and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be willing not to donate blood while participating in this study or&#xD;
             for at least 90 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor and were taken off&#xD;
             drug for serious adverse events are excluded. Patients who had prior CTLA-4 inhibitor&#xD;
             treatment and did not experience serious adverse events are eligible for all arms.&#xD;
             Patients who had prior PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor treatment and did not experience serious&#xD;
             adverse events are excluded from the durvalumab monotherapy arm but are eligible for&#xD;
             the chemotherapy combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, or microsatellite stable (MSS)&#xD;
             colorectal cancer, or other histologies where clinical evidence exists that&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis (with&#xD;
             the exception of diverticulosis), systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome,&#xD;
             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.]. The following are exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with vitiligo or alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),&#xD;
             organizing pneumonia (e.g. bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia,&#xD;
             etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
             scan. Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab. The following are exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra&#xD;
                  articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;

             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (i.e., carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, oxcarbazepine,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone) will only be eligible for Arm 1 (durvalumab&#xD;
             monotherapy) and Arm 2 (durvalumab + gemcitabine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving warfarin are not eligible for Arm 4 (capecitabine) due to the&#xD;
             potential for life-threatening interactions. Patients on warfarin are eligible to&#xD;
             enroll in one of the other arms provided there is increased vigilance with respect to&#xD;
             monitoring international normalized ratio (INR)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to&#xD;

             hepatitis B surface antigen [HbsAg], quantifiable HCV-ribonucleic acid [RNA]), are not&#xD;
             eligible to participate. Testing for HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA will be mandatory for&#xD;
             patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) only; testing for hepatitis B or other&#xD;
             infections for eligibility will be performed only if clinically indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of grade &gt;= 2 infusion reactions or allergic reactions to humanized monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies. Exception: patients with a history of grade 2 infusion reactions to&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitors may be eligible if resumption of prior therapies with&#xD;
             pre-medications has been documented without recurrence of infusion reactions of any&#xD;
             grade; those patients should receive the same pre-medications with the first and&#xD;
             subsequent doses of durvalumab&#xD;
