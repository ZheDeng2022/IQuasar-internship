      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the outpatient ambulatory child psychiatric&#xD;

      describing the modalities of individual psychic functioning.&#xD;

      This research project concerns adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, a period of life towards&#xD;
      psychic individualization and autonomy. It is part of an outpatient child psychiatry sector&#xD;
      that is concerned with the multidisciplinary and institutional dimension of the care&#xD;
      provided. These are part of a long-term patient care dynamic. It is a therapeutic&#xD;
      accompaniment of the young person and his entourage, especially parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care is integrative and multidisciplinary (psychiatrist, psychologist, educator,&#xD;
      psychomotor, nurse). The care project is done after team discussion, several points are taken&#xD;
      into account (clinical evaluation, demand analysis, transfer, study of different psychic&#xD;
      movements, family dynamics). The eyes are crossed and the various references (psychodynamic,&#xD;
      psychoanalytic, systemic). The family consultations that are always present can be associated&#xD;
      with the individual care of the young person, and always link with the analysis of the&#xD;
      different institutional movements. This takes place especially at the time of the weekly&#xD;
      clinical summaries where the clinical situations of concern are evoked to allow a cross&#xD;
      reading and multidisciplinary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reflection, the exchange between the various stakeholders allow to weave an institutional&#xD;
      mesh containing. Thanks to this system, young people and their families can experience a&#xD;
      continuous and solid relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sector is also part of a very valuable network work with the various partners involved in&#xD;
      the daily life of the young person and their family (school institution, social services&#xD;
      ...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is intended to be as close as possible to the care we provide and is integrated&#xD;
      into a global work whose main interest is that of the patient.&#xD;
