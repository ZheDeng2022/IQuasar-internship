  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing iovera° treatment of the ISN, AFCN and LFCN&#xD;
      on postoperative knee pain and function following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most commonly reconstructed ligament in the knee is the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).&#xD;
      In 2006 a total of 134,421 ACL reconstructions were performed in the United States,&#xD;
      representing a 37% increase in procedures since 19941. Today, most ACL reconstructions are&#xD;
      performed on an outpatient basis. While this has led to improvements in patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and cost, it has simultaneously resulted in more complicated postoperative pain management.&#xD;
      Managing this pain via multi-modal strategies, including peripheral nerve blocks, in the&#xD;
      postoperative phase has been shown to decrease opioid related side effects, decrease hospital&#xD;
      stay, and increase time to ambulation. Nursing, hospital, and pharmacy utilization in&#xD;
      managing PCA, continuous regional nerve blocks, and administration of oral opioid dosing are&#xD;
      associated with higher costs of care and introduce sources for staff error. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      idea of multi-modal pain management extends beyond the surgical procedure. Decreasing&#xD;
      prescription opioid use during outpatient rehabilitation decreases NSAID and opioid related&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myoscience, Inc. (Fremont, CA) has developed a device - iovera° - as a novel,&#xD;
      minimally-invasive procedure using cold to target sensory nerve tissue and provide temporary&#xD;
      pain relief through cryoneurolysis. The iovera° device uses well-established principles of&#xD;
      cryobiology to temporarily deactivate sensory nerves that contribute to pain. Prior studies&#xD;
      of the iovera° device have provided evidence of effectiveness and safety for treatment of the&#xD;
      Infrapatellar Branch of the Saphenous Nerve and another study has demonstrated that a&#xD;
      short-term block of this nerve resulted in reduced pain following an ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicenter, double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized trial sponsored by Myoscience,&#xD;
      Inc, the iovera° device was shown to temporarily relieve pain in patients with osteoarthritis&#xD;
      of the knee. Compared to the sham group, patients who received active treatment had a&#xD;
      statistically significant greater change from baseline in the WOMAC pain subscale score at&#xD;
      Day 30 (p=0.0004), Day 60 (p=0.0176), and Day 90 (p=0.0061). Patients deemed WOMAC pain&#xD;
      responders at Day 120 continued to experience a statistically significant treatment effect at&#xD;
      Day 150. Most expected side effects were mild in severity and resolved within 30 days. The&#xD;
      incidence of device- or procedure-related adverse events was similar in the two treatment&#xD;
      groups with no occurrence of serious or unanticipated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study described herein is to determine the safety and efficacy of the iovera°&#xD;
      treatment for reducing the pain associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      reconstruction&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to 10 days post-surgery in mean Average Daily Pain (ADP) Intensity Scores for iovera patients compared to standard of care.&#xD;
Trial success is demonstrated under the primary hypothesis if the p-value corresponding to the study t-test for the effect of iovera compared to the standard of care group from baseline is less than or equal to 0.05.</description>

    <measure>Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE) score was introduced as a tool to aid in the assessment of clinical outcomes by decreasing the burden of gathering outcomes data without limiting the meaningfulness of the data. It has been demonstrated to be a reliable reflection of knee symptoms after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in both male and female subjects. The SANE score has been subjected to rigorous statistical evaluation and has proven to be a valid and responsive patient-reported outcome measure. The SANE score is determine by the subject's response to the following question:&#xD;
&quot;On a scale of 0 to 100, how would you rate your knee's function, with 100 being normal?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS JR.)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS JR. score consists of 7 questions from 3 subscales: Stiffness (1 question), Pain (4 questions), and Function in daily living (2 questions). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from None (0) to Extreme (4). A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated. A copy of the KOOS JR. is located in Attachment 1. After completion by the Subject, the study coordinator or designee will enter the data into the CRF.</description>
