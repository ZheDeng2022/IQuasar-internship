  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) score</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>ACB will be calculated based on methodology from Campbell et al (2016). Sum (Drug A #days prescribed X ACB scale score) + (Drug B #days prescribed X ACB scale score) + (Drug Xâ€¦)/Number of days with any medication prescribed. The cumulative score has a range from 0 to infinity, with higher values indicating a higher cumulative anticholinergic burden of the patient.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Korea Specific: Percentage of Participants With any Listed Anticholinergic Use</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated as number of participants with any listed anticholinergics use divided by number of participants fulfilling the general eligibility criteria of the study (in each study dataset) multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Korea Specific: Percentage of Participants With Strong Anticholinergic Use</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated as number of participants with strong anticholinergics use divided by number of participants fulfilling the general eligibility criteria of the study (in each study dataset) multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Korea Specific: Number of Anticholinergics Dispensed per Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>This will be calculated as total number of anticholinergics dispensed divided by number of participants fulfilling the general eligibility criteria of the study (in each study dataset) multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Korea Specific: Attribution Proportion of OAB medications to total ACB in OAB Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>Attribution proportion of OAB medication to total ACB will be calculated as the ratio between the sum over all OAB patients of the ACB scores of each OAB medication multiplied by the number of days supply in the numerator and the sum over all OAB patients of the ACB scores of each antimuscarinic medication multiplied by the number of days supply in the denominator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median percentage of ACB score derived from overactive bladder (OAB) treatment(s) in total ACB score</measure>
    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>The attribution of antimuscarinics for OAB treatment to entire anticholinergic exposures in OAB patients.</description>
