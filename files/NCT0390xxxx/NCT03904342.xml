  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based interventions using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and self-management&#xD;
      education have been demonstrated to effectively treat symptoms of depression and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life in populations with chronic illness. Research indicates that CBT is the most&#xD;
      effective psychosocial treatment for depression; as effective as pharmacotherapy and as&#xD;
      effective as adding another medication for patients who do not respond to one antidepressant&#xD;
      alone. Despite the existence of proven efficacious treatments for depression, however, fewer&#xD;
      than half of patients for whom depression treatment is indicated receive the services they&#xD;
      need. Access barriers (i.e., transportation, insurance coverage), limited clinician&#xD;
      availability (i.e., long waitlists, difficulty finding a provider), and competing (and&#xD;
      time-consuming) medical priorities contribute to inadequate depression treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with serious chronic illness. In this research the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      pilot randomized trial to compare results from implementation of two CBT strategies iHope and&#xD;
      Sophie.&#xD;

      A pre-implementation pilot study will be conducted with 20 adult patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      advanced (Stage 3 or 4) cancer who screen positive for moderate depression and are receiving&#xD;
      care at the Solomont Center for Hematology and Medical Oncology at Boston Medical Center&#xD;
      (BMC) with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a guide, design a&#xD;
           pilot implementation strategy for introducing the Sophie CBT system and iHope system&#xD;
           into the clinical context of care (Months 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a pre-implementation pilot study with randomization of 20 cancer patients who&#xD;
           screen positive for depression and/or anxiety into two arms with Sophie CBT or iHope&#xD;
           telemedicine (10 participants each) to: a) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
           appropriateness of implementing the Sophie CBT and iHope interventions in an ambulatory&#xD;
           cancer treatment center and b) evaluate the potential impact of the Sophie CBT and iHope&#xD;
           interventions on measures of depression, anxiety, coping, and quality of life for cancer&#xD;
           patients with comorbid depression (Months 5-10)&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in depressive symptoms will be measured using the PHQ-8, which is an 8-item scale with scores ranging from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicative of more depressive symptoms</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) will be used to assess changes in anxiety. The GAD-7 is a 7-item questionnaire that asks how often an individual has been bothered by a given item over the last 2 weeks. Scores range from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day.&quot;) A higher overall score indicates a greater level of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in coping</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in coping will be assessed using the Ways of Coping scale which is a 66 item scale with potential responses from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicative of more frequent use of a particular strategy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in quality of life will be assessed using the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS), which is a 15-item scale with potential responses ranging from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating a higher level of satisfaction with quality of life.</description>
