  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a phase I/II trial initiated by the investigator to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibody-activated autologous&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) combined with adjuvant chemotherapy in participants&#xD;
      with stage III colon cancer. Twenty participants were enrolled and anti-PD1&#xD;
      antibody-activated TILs was infused into participants after the final of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy to assess the safety and 3-year disease-free survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative colon cancer participants received 4 to 8 cycles of XELOX regimen adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and received anti-PD1 antibody-activated TILs on the day 15 of the final cycle&#xD;
      of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh tumor tissues or sentinel lymph nodes were collected from participants with&#xD;
      postoperative colon cancer, and the tumor tissues were digested with type IV collagenase at&#xD;
      37 °C for 2 to 4 hours. The cell pellet was washed, suspended in medium containing 10% AB&#xD;
      serum, planted in a 24-well cell culture plate, and periodically changed according to the&#xD;
      growth of the cells. After culturing for 2 to 3 weeks, TILs were co-stimulated with&#xD;
      radioactively irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and were&#xD;
      expanded in 100 ml of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) medium in a cell culture flask. After rapid&#xD;
      expansion for 15 days, the number of cells reached 0.1-1*10^10 cells. Before cell transfer,&#xD;
      TILs were incubated with anti-PD-1 antibody, and a fraction of the TILs were collected to&#xD;
      assess their number, phenotype, and viability of cells, and to test for possible&#xD;
      contamination by bacteria, fungi, or endotoxins. Then, autologous TILs (0.1-1*10^10 cells)&#xD;
      were transferred to participants via intravenous infusion.&#xD;
