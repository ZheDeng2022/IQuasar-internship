  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/Ib dose escalation, dose expansion, study to identify the best dose and&#xD;
      side effects of modified immune cells PRGN-3005 (autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T&#xD;
      cells developed by Precigen, Inc.) in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer that has spread to other places in the body, that has come back,&#xD;
      and is resistant to platinum chemotherapy. Autologous CAR T cells are modified immune cells&#xD;
      that have been engineered in the laboratory to specifically target a protein found on tumor&#xD;
      cells and kill them.&#xD;

             benefit will be eligible for the study. Patients must have measurable disease that can&#xD;
             be accurately measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 1.0 cm or &gt; 1.5 cm lymph node&#xD;

             techniques.&#xD;
