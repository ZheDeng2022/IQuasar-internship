    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the safety of combining intermediate frequency electric&#xD;
      field (TT Field) with immunotherapy in melanoma patients with brain metastasis. The data of&#xD;
      this study will also inform whether this combination will offer advantage in progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival.&#xD;

    <description>The PFS time will be calculated as the duration of time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of earliest intracranial progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who neither progress nor die by the data cutoff date will be censored at the last follow up.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
