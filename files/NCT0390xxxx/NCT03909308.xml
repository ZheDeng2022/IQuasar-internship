  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a beach tennis session on&#xD;
      24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in adults with hypertension. The main hypothesis is that a&#xD;
      single session of beach tennis would decrease ambulatory blood pressure compared with a&#xD;
      non-exercise control session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized crossover trial, participants performed randomly assigned two experimental&#xD;
      sessions: a beach tennis session and a non-exercise control session. The beach tennis session&#xD;
      started with a standardized 5-minute warm-up consisting of basic techniques, followed by&#xD;
      three 12-minute beach tennis matches with 2-minute intervals between them. Heart rate and&#xD;
      rating of perceived exertion were continuously recorded during the beach tennis session, and&#xD;
      enjoyment was measured after the beach tennis session. The control session was performed in&#xD;
      seated rest. Both experimental sessions lasted 45 minutes. Ambulatory blood pressure was&#xD;
      measured continuously for 24-hour after sessions.&#xD;

    <description>The participants performed a beach tennis training session throughout 45 min.The session started with a standardized 5-minute warm-up consisting of basic techniques (i.e., serve, volley, forehand, and backhand) followed by three 12-minute beach tennis matches with 2-minute intervals between the games. We used regular beach tennis rules in the game, which was played on a regular beach tennis court (i.e., 16 m long by 8 m wide and net 1.70 m high).</description>

    <description>The Beach Tennis training session will be composed by a warm up of 5 min of BT in which technical exercises (i.e., serve, volley, forehand and backhand) will be performed After that, 3 BT small games of 12 min with a 2 minute interval between games using the conventional rules of sport will be performed. Before the session and after each small game, data regarding heart rate, blood pressure and rate perceived exertion will be recorded.</description>
