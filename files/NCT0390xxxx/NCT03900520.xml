  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leading cause of severe respiratory disease and death in young children is Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae (pneumococcus). An estimated one-fifth of global childhood pneumococcal-related&#xD;
      deaths occurred in India. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is a primary prevention&#xD;
      tool against pneumococcal disease that is safe and effective and has been in use in many&#xD;
      countries. In alignment with the Government of India's rollout of PCV sub-nationally in&#xD;
      selected districts and states, this two-year observational study will use a&#xD;
      non-interventional, observational prospective study design to evaluate the impact of PCV in 7&#xD;
      sites in India (5 hospitals and 2 community sites) by assessing clinical and&#xD;
      serotype-specific outcomes that include hospitalized pneumonia and community pneumococcal&#xD;
      carriage. A sub-study to assess the cost of illness of pneumonia will also be conducted. This&#xD;
      study is anticipated to provide data to support sustainability of PCV expansion and disease&#xD;
      surveillance in India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease&#xD;
      and death in young children, and is also responsible for other serious diseases such as&#xD;
      meningitis and sepsis. Global disease burden models for the year 2015, estimate that 20&#xD;
      percent of global childhood pneumococcal deaths occurred in India. Data from India indicate&#xD;
      that available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) include serotypes that account for 66 to&#xD;
      74 percent of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in young children. The 2017 PCV launch into&#xD;
      the national immunization schedule in selected high-burden states was poised to successfully&#xD;
      combat the pneumococcal disease burden in the country once scale-up of vaccine coverage takes&#xD;
      place. The Government of India has recommended robust evaluation of PCV impact to facilitate&#xD;
      national rollout and sustained use of PCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the impact of PCV introduction to the national immunization&#xD;
      program. The investigators propose to quantify the impact of PCV on pneumonia and other acute&#xD;
      respiratory infections resulting in hospitalization and on community carriage of pneumococci.&#xD;
      Hereafter, in reference to the proposed study, the investigators use the term 'pneumonia' to&#xD;
      denote to a group of physician-based diagnoses representing a range of acute respiratory&#xD;
      illness including pneumonia. Specifically, the investigators propose to measure differences&#xD;
      in the proportion of pneumonia hospitalizations in children 1-35 months colonized with&#xD;
      vaccine-serotype (VT) pneumococcus, as well as differences in VT pneumococcal nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      (NP) colonization in the community, comparing children enrolled at sites where PCV has been&#xD;
      introduced (PCV sites) to children at sites where PCV has not yet been introduced (non-PCV&#xD;
      sites). The health economic aims will consist of assessing the cost of illness of&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease, and economic cost of pneumococcal disease and pneumonia&#xD;
      hospitalization. The investigators have designed this portfolio of PCV impact evaluations&#xD;
      within the context of PCV introduction and rollout in six selected states in India, mindful&#xD;
      of the need for baseline data, the staggered plan for PCV roll-out, variance of&#xD;
      cost-generating events, and the inherent biases of non-interventional studies with outcomes&#xD;
      that are not specific for pneumococcal disease and that may be subject to secular trends and&#xD;
      possible confounders. The study sites are located in New Delhi and within three of the six&#xD;
      states that were included in the PCV rollout plan starting in 2017. The investigators plan&#xD;
      this as a two-year study that will include data from both PCV sites and non-PCV sites, the&#xD;
      comparison of which will allow an assessment of vaccine impact. Active study sites will be&#xD;
      located in Delhi; Agra in Uttar Pradesh state (non-PCV-using); Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh&#xD;
      state; and Jaipur in Rajasthan state (PCV-using). Community enrollment will take place in two&#xD;
      demographic survey sites in Bhopal and Delhi, and economic assessment will take place in four&#xD;
      hospital sites. Sites will use a common protocol to identify and recruit children, obtain&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swabs for colonization studies, and run validated laboratory tests. A&#xD;
      reference laboratory will provide pneumococcal serotyping results, nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      quantification of pneumococcus, and provide site laboratory oversight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will provide evidence to policy makers on changes in pneumococcal disease burden&#xD;
      in young children, pneumococcal community transmission changes as a result of PCV&#xD;
      introduction, that can help policy makers support, optimize, and advocate for the expansion&#xD;
      of the PCV immunization program in India and in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of PREVAIL are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify the difference in the proportion of hospitalized pneumonia cases 1-35 months of&#xD;
           age carrying a vaccine-type pneumococcus in the nasopharynx in cases enrolled at sites&#xD;
           that have introduced PCV into the national immunization program compared to cases&#xD;
           enrolled at sites that have not introduced PCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantify the difference in the proportion of children in the community 1-35 months who&#xD;
           are colonized with vaccine-type pneumococcus enrolled at a site that has introduced PCV&#xD;
           into the national immunization program compared to the proportion of children colonized&#xD;
           with vaccine-type pneumococcus enrolled at a site that has not introduced PCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the overall economic impact of PCV by: (i) Estimating the total cost of&#xD;
           hospitalized pneumonia in children 1-35 months from the healthcare system and household&#xD;
           perspectives; and (ii) Estimating the proportion of households facing catastrophic&#xD;
           health spending and medical impoverishment from out-of-pocket health expenses due to&#xD;
           hospitalized pneumonia in children 1-35 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are evaluated within each of the four groups, and are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the difference in mortality and occurrence of illnesses within 3 months of&#xD;
           hospital discharge among children aged 1-35 months presenting with pneumonia in&#xD;
           PCV-using sites compared to children at non-PCV sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantify the difference in proportion among hospitalized cases aged 1-35 months with&#xD;
           alveolar consolidation detected on radiography in PCV-using sites compared to children&#xD;
           at non-PCV sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantify the difference in proportion among hospitalized cases aged 1-35 months with&#xD;
           hypoxemia (oxygen saturation&lt;90%) in PCV-using sites compared to children at non-PCV&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantify the difference in proportion of hospitalized cases aged 1-35 months that are&#xD;
           vaccinated at PCV-using sites (indirect cohort method to assess vaccine effectiveness)&#xD;
           between the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Carrying a VT vs. carrying a non-VT serotype&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. With vs. without alveolar consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. With vs. without hypoxemia&#xD;
