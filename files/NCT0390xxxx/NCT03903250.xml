  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, crossover design study which measures the effect of&#xD;
      alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (A-GPC) on reaction time and cognitive function in&#xD;
      non-resistance trained males and females. Participants will complete baseline testing and&#xD;
      then be randomized into one of two crossover treatments. Participants will report to the lab&#xD;
      for five consecutive days whilst only getting a maximum of five hours of sleep per night from&#xD;
      Monday through Thursday night. Once testing is complete on Friday, participants will receive&#xD;
      a one week washout period then return to complete the opposite treatment.&#xD;

      Subjects expressing interest in doing the study will be interviewed in the UMHB Human&#xD;
      Performance Lab (HPL) to determine whether they qualify to participate in the study. Upon&#xD;
      qualification, participants will be scheduled a familiarization session in which participants&#xD;
      will be taught how to use the Makoto Arena, a reaction time machine. Participants will then&#xD;
      schedule their first testing session which will include: questionnaires, hemodynamic&#xD;
      measures, reaction time testing, cognitive function testing via ImPACT, an acute exercise&#xD;
      bout, reaction time testing, and cognitive function testing via ImPACT. Participants will&#xD;
      then be randomized into one of two treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation protocol: Participants will be randomly assigned into one of two treatments&#xD;
      and will be given 4oz of either a placebo or active treatment mixed in orange flavored&#xD;
      Gatorade everyday for 5 days. On Monday, participants will consume the beverage after testing&#xD;
      is complete. Tuesday through Friday the beverage will be consumed as the participants arrive&#xD;
      in the HPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Mondays and Fridays, testing will be as follows: questionnaires, hemodynamic measures,&#xD;
      reaction time testing, cognitive function testing via ImPACT, an acute exercise bout,&#xD;
      reaction time testing, and cognitive function testing via ImPACT. On Tuesdays and Thursdays,&#xD;
      participants will come check into the HPL for 30 minutes. On Wednesday, participants will&#xD;
      come into the HPL to complete the acute exercise bout. To control their sleep to the best of&#xD;
      our ability, participants are required to send emails every 30 minutes beginning at 10pm&#xD;
      until their designated sleep time so the investigators know the participants are not asleep&#xD;
      and gaining more than 5 hours of sleep.&#xD;

    <description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (A-GPC) on changes in reaction time in young, non-resistance trained males and females. This will be accomplished by observing changes in reaction time via the Makoto Arena. The Makoto Arena is an instrument that utilizes lights and noises to assess reaction time. Participants are required to hit the lights when they appear on the tower as fast as possible. Participants are instructed to hit as many lights as fast as possible to acquire a score that consists of the following: number of targets hit, number of targets that appeared, average reaction time, and percentage of targets hit.</description>

    <description>The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effectiveness of alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (A-GPC) on changes in mental alertness in young, non-resistance trained males and females. This will be accomplished by observing changes in ImPACT test scores before and after acute exercise, and after 4 days of sleep deprivation defined as only 5 hours of sleep per night. The ImPACT test measures cognitive function via the following tests: verbal memory, visual memory, symbol matching, color matching, and a three letter sequence memory test. For the verbal and visual memory tests, a composite score is taken between 0-100 with 100 indicating best cognitive performance and 0 indicating the worst cognitive performance. For the symbol matching and color matching, a visual motor composite score is taken from 0-60 with 60 indicating the best cognitive performance and 0 indicating the worst cognitive performance.</description>
