Participants rated their satisfaction by answering CSQ Item 1=&quot;Rate your overall satisfaction with the fat reduction procedure on the treated area&quot; using the following scale: Very satisfied, Satisfied, Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, Dissatisfied or Very dissatisfied. Participants were analyzed based on BMI ranges from 18.5 to &lt; 25.0 and 25.0 to &lt; 30.0. BMI was defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m^2).</description>

    <description>Change in the volume of fat was assessed by a 3D stereoscopic camera which was used to generate a 3D image of the body, allowing quantification of the abdomen and flank areas. A 2-step 3D matching algorithm process was used, to identify the change of volume in milliliters (mL).</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in participants, users, or other persons, if related to the investigational medical device. A SAE is any AE, that is fatal, life threatening, requires hospitalization or results in prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. A TEAE is defined as any new adverse event or worsening of an existing condition after initiation of treatment.</description>

    <description>An ADE was defined in accordance with ISO 14155 as an AE related to the use of an investigational medical device or defined as AE with a reasonable possibility (Possible, Probable, or Causal relationship) that the device caused the event. SADE is an ADE that might have led to any SAE consequences if a suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made.</description>
