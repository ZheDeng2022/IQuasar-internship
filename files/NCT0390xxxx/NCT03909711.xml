  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this multicentric observational study is to define the role of&#xD;
      intraoperative temperature decrease (defined as reduction of at least 1 ° C during surgery)&#xD;
      as haemorrhagic risk factor, evaluated as reduction of at least 1 gr / dl of hemoglobin, and&#xD;
      to correlate it with the need for transfusion. Secondary objectives are infections and&#xD;
      complications affecting other organs and systems incidence in the first week after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, observational, multicentric study, after ethics committee approval and&#xD;
      patients informed consent, 20 patients for each center undergoing elective multi-level spine&#xD;
      surgery procedures will be enrolled. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled. No&#xD;
      randomization or concealment is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: adults (age&gt; 18), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III,&#xD;
      undergoing elective multi-level spinal surgery intervention. Patients with significant&#xD;
      comorbidities such as severe liver disease, severe renal disease (stage III-IV), heart&#xD;
      disease with organ failure, severe preoperative anemia requiring blood transfusions, severe&#xD;
      pneumopathy with high probability of postoperative prolonged mechanical ventilation are&#xD;
      excluded. Other exclusion criteria are: emergency intervention, known coagulopathy and&#xD;
      chronic preoperative anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature will be measured with tympanic, anal or esophageal probe according to the&#xD;
      availability and means of the department. Variables related to the patient (such as sex, age,&#xD;
      BMI, smoke, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in progress, presence of mild chronic&#xD;
      hepatopathy / cardiopathy / pneumopathy / renal failure, hemoglobin and the preoperative&#xD;
      hematocrit) will be compared with type and length of intervention, estimated blood loss,&#xD;
      intraoperative variables (such as diuresis, minimum temperature and its variations, blood&#xD;
      transfusions, ventilation mode) and post- operative hemoglobin level (the day after&#xD;
      operation) to assess patient prognosis in terms of need for transfusion and infectious and&#xD;
      respiratory complications incidence 7 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient will be measured initial intraoperative temperature (T0) and minimum&#xD;
      temperature (Tmin) with esophageal, anal or tympanic probe every 30 minutes during surgery.&#xD;
      The temperature delta will be calculated as T0 - Tmin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators will compare intraoperative reduction of basal body temperature with Hb&#xD;
      level reduction (preoperative Hb compared to Hb of the following day of intervention)&#xD;
      considering as significant a temperature reduction of at least 1 ° C and Hb reduction of at&#xD;
      least 1 g/dl, net of variables recognized correlated with increased bleeding in vertebral&#xD;
      surgery (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, arterial hypertension, ASA class, intervention&#xD;
      time, preoperative Ht) and liquid volume infused during intervention (hemodilution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation while the&#xD;
      categorical ones as frequency (percentage frequency, %).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate logistic regression analysis will be applied to evaluate the effect of patients&#xD;
      variables, surgical intervention with anesthesia management on patients prognosis in terms of&#xD;
      need for transfusion and presence / absence of infectious and respiratory complications 7&#xD;
      days after surgery Variables associated with the need for transfusion and 7-day complications&#xD;
      with p value &lt;0.10 on univariate analysis will be considered in a multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis model. The area under the receiver ROC curve (AUC) will be used as a&#xD;
      measure of the model's prediction capacity.&#xD;
