  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tears of the acetabular labrum appear to be common with the prevalence of asymptomatic tears&#xD;
      in the general population approaching 66% and 70% based on cadaveric dissection and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, respectively. Despite this prevalence, there is no currently accepted&#xD;
      justification for performing labral repair in an asymptomatic patient despite the many&#xD;
      postulated biomechanical benefits that an intact labrum imparts to the hip joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Representing a smaller proportion of all tears, symptomatic tears of the acetabular labrum&#xD;
      present a therapeutic challenge. Current treatment modalities range from conservative&#xD;
      measures to open surgical intervention. Conservative measures have typically included:&#xD;
      activity modification, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT), core strengthening and improvement of sensory motor control. In the past two&#xD;
      decades, technological advances in the form of surgical instrumentation and traction devices&#xD;
      have facilitated less invasive arthroscopic techniques to diagnose and treat hip problems and&#xD;
      as such is now the preferred treatment modality for many orthopedic surgeons treating&#xD;
      patients with hip pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining which patients, using age and arthritic burden as predictors, can benefit from&#xD;
      labral repair is paramount for several reasons. Showing arthroscopic repair is of little or&#xD;
      no benefit to a specific cohort can reduce the number of unnecessary surgeries performed,&#xD;
      increase the use of conservative therapy (if validated) and reduce the interval between&#xD;
      diagnosis and total hip replacement.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been only one prospective study documenting the outcomes of patients treated with&#xD;
      physical therapy for intra-articular conditions of the hip. These conditions included mild&#xD;
      FAI and mild developmental dysplasia of the hip. Here, physical therapy was given as a first&#xD;
      line treatment. Those who did not make satisfactory improvements in pain or wished to have&#xD;
      surgery were then scheduled for surgery to repair the defects. Patients saw improvement in&#xD;
      validated outcome measures at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there have been studies looking at age secondarily in patients with labral tears,&#xD;
      there is no prospective evidence to endorse or refute a recommendation of hip arthroscopy for&#xD;
      patients of any age being treated for a tear of the acetabular labrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently, the authors involved in this study performed a retrospective investigation&#xD;
      (unpublished data) to capture patients with clinically and radiographically confirmed&#xD;
      acetabular labral pathology electing to undergo conservative management defined as the&#xD;
      refusal of surgical intervention. Based on a retrospective review of 894 patients presenting&#xD;
      to clinic over a 10-year period, the investigators identified 22 patients with labral&#xD;
      pathology that were treated non-operatively. Retrospective case control analysis was&#xD;
      performed using outcome questionnaires administered to both surgical and non-surgical&#xD;
      cohorts. The investigators found that patients with labral tears managed non-operatively&#xD;
      appear to score highly on hip function outcome scores, preliminarily indicating there may be&#xD;
      some benefit in using conservative management alone in the treatment of labral pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 12-month prospective randomized control trial (RCT), which will enroll 121 subjects&#xD;
      with evidence consistent with a tear of the acetabular labrum. Labral tear will be diagnosed&#xD;
      by clinical exam and positive MRI findings. Subjects will receive conservative physical&#xD;
      therapy treatment alone or arthroscopic surgical labral repair and physical therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that pain, range of motion, activity level, and functional&#xD;
      performance, as judged by validated outcome measures and serial physical exams, will improve&#xD;
      when compared to baseline. The investigators also anticipate that the level of response will&#xD;
      be greater in the surgical treatment group than in the physical therapy group at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Primary Outcome is change in the modified Harris Hip Score at 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include changes in other outcomes measures (LEFS, HOS, NAHS, iHOT-33),&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and degree of improvement on physical exam, and the influence of OA&#xD;
      severity (Outerbridge scoring) and location on the aforementioned outcome measures.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the SPT group provided consent for arthroscopic acetabular labral repair with femoroacetabular osteoplasty. As previously described in various technique publications from our group, the senior surgeon's (S.D.M.) hip arthroscopy technique includes intra-articular fluid distension for initial portal placement, puncture capsulotomy, autograft capsular augmentation if insufficient or degenerative labral tissue is encountered, intermittent traction, sparing use of electrocautery, and preservation of the chrondrolabral junction. All SPT patients underwent a standardized postoperative physical therapy protocol developed jointly by the senior author (a sports medicine fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon) and the physical therapists. Patients were kept weightbearing as tolerated on crutches for 6 weeks to maintain a level pelvis without lurching when walking and were instructed to avoid impact loading exercises for 6 months.</description>

    <description>PTA patients were assigned a standardized, 24-week course of supervised, core-based PT. This course was designed in concert with physical therapists within our institution to help address symptoms of labral tear in patients older than 40 who had mild to moderate OA. Weeks 1 and 2 focused on normalizing gait, and weeks 3 through 24 focused on optimizing range of motion (ROM) while slowly integrating strength training. Unlike the prerandomization PT protocol, the PTA protocol was predominantly physical therapist-supervised (at least 1 in-person visit per week).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 40 or greater: higher likelihood or undetectable OA on imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Symptoms consistent with a tear of the acetabular labrum (at least one: catching,&#xD;
             clicking, popping, pain with sitting, episodic pain, pain with hip flexion, adduction,&#xD;
             and/or internal rotation): asymptomatic labral tears do exist in the general&#xD;
             population however there is not definitive evidence to suggest treatment of&#xD;
             asymptomatic tears is beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Symptoms not due to some other acute process in or around the hip (including septic&#xD;
             arthritis, osteonecrosis, hemarthrosis, iliotibial band syndrome, fractures of the&#xD;
             femoral neck or head, fractures of the acetabulum, greater trochanteric pain syndrome,&#xD;
             sacroiliac joint pain, piriformis syndrome, low back pain associated with hip pain and&#xD;
             not knee nor acute low back injury): certain conditions are not treatable by either&#xD;
             arthroscopy or physical therapy. Some of these conditions can be managed with physical&#xD;
             therapy but not arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Availability of hip radiographs and MRI: needed to assess eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Evidence on MRI of a tear of the acetabular labrum: documentation of acetabular labrum&#xD;
             tear&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willingness to undergo randomization and ability to understand and sign informed&#xD;
             consent document: ability to understand study and consent willingly&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Less than 2 mm of joint space on standing plain anterior-posterior radiographs of the&#xD;
             hip: indicative of severe osteoarthritic disease and the patient would benefit more&#xD;
             from a total hip replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Developmental dysplasia of the hip: distorted acetabular anatomy and biomechanics&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 4 changes: classified as large osteophytes, marked narrowing&#xD;
             of joint space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone contour; indicative&#xD;
             of severe OA&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tonnis Grade 3 changes: classified as large cysts in the head or acetabulum, severe&#xD;
             narrowing or obliteration of the joint space, severe deformity of the head, and&#xD;
             necrosis; indicative of OA&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unexpected pathology at the time of arthroscopy: source of pain less likely to due&#xD;
             dysfunction of the labrum and more likely due to aberrant extra-articular biology&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Same site surgery: complex anatomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Back pain greater than hip pain or back pain associated with leg symptoms below the&#xD;
             knee: source of pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to be&#xD;
             referred from the back/spine&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Back pain associated with positive neural tension signs e.g. positive slump test,&#xD;
             positive SLR (straight leg raise), positive reflex changes or drop foot: source of&#xD;
             pain less likely to be originating from the hip and more likely to be referred from&#xD;
             the back/spine&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Knee pain greater than hip pain: source of pain less likely to be originating from the&#xD;
             hip and more likely to referred from the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Bilateral tears of the acetabular labrum: difficult to gauge patient progress after&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Contraindication to surgery or physical therapy: cannot tolerate either treatment&#xD;
             grouping&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Alternate form of PT for greater than 6 weeks: will negatively augment results. May&#xD;
             affect recruitment.&#xD;

          <description>Hip Arthroscopy Surgery with Acetabular Labral Repair&#xD;
Hip Arthroscopy Surgery with Acetabular Labral Repair: The research coordinator will, perform a baseline assessment, and randomize the patients into the study at this visit.&#xD;
Randomization will be assigned utilizing an electronic randomization program. Patients are prospectively identified and randomized into one of two study arms: arthroscopic surgery (AS) or physical therapy (PT). A third study arm, dependent upon improvement with PT, was created as patients crossed over (CO) from PT to AS after a lack of improvement after a minimum of 8 weeks of PT. AS consisted of labral repair.&#xD;
Any subject randomized to surgery will be seen by Dr. Martin to be consented separately for the arthroscopic procedure, which is standard of care. Those receiving surgical management will be scheduled for the post-operative physical therapy protocol within 2 weeks of their operative date, once a surgical date has been scheduled.</description>

A third study arm, dependent upon improvement with PT, was created as patients crossed over (CO) from PT to AS after a lack of improvement after a minimum of 8 weeks of PT. AS consisted of labral repair or debridement, if repair was not possible, and PT consisted of a uniform, comprehensive PT protocol guided by selected physical therapists.&#xD;
Those randomized to the physical therapy side will be referred to PT. Those receiving conservative management will be scheduled for physical therapy.</description>

          <title>SPT Group: Surgery and Physical Therapy</title>
          <description>Patients randomized to the SPT group provided consent for arthroscopic acetabular labral repair with femoroacetabular osteoplasty. As previously described in various technique publications from our group, the senior surgeon's (S.D.M.) hip arthroscopy technique includes intra-articular fluid distension for initial portal placement,2 puncture capsulotomy,9 autograft capsular augmentation if insufficient or degenerative labral tissue is encountered,28,30 intermittent traction,37 sparing use of electrocautery,24 and preservation of the chrondrolabral junction.39 All SPT patients underwent a standardized postoperative physical therapy protocol developed jointly by the senior author (a sports medicine fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon) and the physical therapists. Patients were kept weightbearing as tolerated on crutches for 6 weeks to maintain a level pelvis without lurching when walking and were instructed to avoid impact loading exercises for 6 months. Appendix A (available in the online version of this article) provides the complete postoperative physical therapy protocol.</description>

          <title>PTA Group: Physical Therapy Alone</title>
          <description>PTA patients were assigned a standardized, 24-week course of supervised, core-based PT. This course was designed in concert with physical therapists within our institution to help address symptoms of labral tear in patients older than 40 who had mild to moderate OA. Weeks&#xD;
1 and 2 focused on normalizing gait, and weeks 3 through 24 focused on optimizing range of motion (ROM) while slowly integrating strength training. Unlike the prerandomization PT protocol, the PTA protocol was predominantly physical therapist-supervised (at least 1 in-person visit per week. Appendix B (available online) provides the complete 24- week PT protocol assigned to PTA patients.</description>

          <title>modified Harris Hip Score</title>
          <description>The modified Harris Hip Scale (mHHS) was developed for the assessment of the results of hip surgery, and is intended to evaluate various hip disabilities and methods of treatment in an adult population. It features a series of questions that are subjectively completed by the patient, which provides a value output (higher score = better result). The interpretation of outcome using the modified Harris hip score was as follows: &lt;70 (poor result), 70-79 (fair result), 80-89 (good result) and &gt;90 (excellent result).</description>

          <title>VAS Pain Score</title>
          <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. Scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot; Higher values = higher pain and worse outcome. Absolute values of pain on a 0-10 scale naturally grouped into three categories: 1-4 (mild pain), 5 or 6 (moderate pain) and 7-10 (severe pain).</description>

          <description>The International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT) was developed by Mohtadi et al as a means of assessing a patient's ability to return to an active lifestyle through obtaining subjective measures of symptoms, as well as determining emotional and social health status. The iHOT is comprised of 33 questions relating to: Symptoms and Functional Limitations, Sports and Recreational Activities, Job-Related Concerns, Social, Emotional, and Lifestyle Concerns. Higher scores = better function and less limitations.</description>

            <description>Patients randomized to the SPT group provided consent for arthroscopic acetabular labral repair with femoroacetabular osteoplasty. As previously described in various technique publications from our group, the senior surgeon's (S.D.M.) hip arthroscopy technique includes intra-articular fluid distension for initial portal placement,2 puncture capsulotomy,9 autograft capsular augmentation if insufficient or degenerative labral tissue is encountered,28,30 intermittent traction,37 sparing use of electrocautery,24 and preservation of the chrondrolabral junction.39 All SPT patients underwent a standardized postoperative physical therapy protocol developed jointly by the senior author (a sports medicine fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon) and the physical therapists. Patients were kept weightbearing as tolerated on crutches for 6 weeks to maintain a level pelvis without lurching when walking and were instructed to avoid impact loading exercises for 6 months. Appendix A (available in the online version of this article) provides the complete postoperative physical therapy protocol.</description>

            <description>PTA patients were assigned a standardized, 24-week course of supervised, core-based PT. This course was designed in concert with physical therapists within our institution to help address symptoms of labral tear in patients older than 40 who had mild to moderate OA. Weeks&#xD;
1 and 2 focused on normalizing gait, and weeks 3 through 24 focused on optimizing range of motion (ROM) while slowly integrating strength training. Unlike the prerandomization PT protocol, the PTA protocol was predominantly physical therapist-supervised (at least 1 in-person visit per week. Appendix B (available online) provides the complete 24- week PT protocol assigned to PTA patients.</description>

Hip Arthroscopy Surgery with Acetabular Labral Repair: The research coordinator will, perform a baseline assessment, and randomize the patients into the study at this visit.&#xD;
Randomization will be assigned utilizing an electronic randomization program. Patients are prospectively identified and randomized into one of two study arms: arthroscopic surgery (AS) or physical therapy (PT). A third study arm, dependent upon improvement with PT, was created as patients crossed over (CO) from PT to AS after a lack of improvement after a minimum of 8 weeks of PT. AS consisted of labral repair.&#xD;
Any subject randomized to surgery will be seen by Dr. Martin to be consented separately for the arthroscopic procedure, which is standard of care. Those receiving surgical management will be scheduled for the post-operative physical therapy protocol within 2 weeks of their operative date, once a surgical date has been scheduled.</description>

            <description>PTA patients were assigned a standardized, 24-week course of supervised, core-based PT. This course was designed in concert with physical therapists within our institution to help address symptoms of labral tear in patients older than 40 who had mild to moderate OA. Weeks&#xD;
1 and 2 focused on normalizing gait, and weeks 3 through 24 focused on optimizing range of motion (ROM) while slowly integrating strength training. Unlike the prerandomization PT protocol, the PTA protocol was predominantly physical therapist-supervised (at least 1 in-person visit per week. Appendix B (available online) provides the complete 24- week PT protocol assigned to PTA patients.</description>

As previously described in various technique publications from our group, the senior surgeon's (S.D.M.) hip arthroscopy technique includes intra-articular fluid distension for initial portal placement,2 puncture capsulotomy,9 autograft capsular augmentation if insufficient or degenerative labral tissue is encountered,28,30 intermittent traction,37 sparing use of electrocautery,24 and preservation of the chrondrolabral junction.39 All SPT patients underwent a standardized postoperative physical therapy protocol developed jointly by the senior author (a sports medicine fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon) and the physical therapists. Patients were kept weightbearing as tolerated on crutches for 6 weeks to maintain a level pelvis without lurching when walking and were instructed to avoid impact loading exercises for 6 months.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Crossover rates in this study were high. For ethical reasons, all randomized patients had to meet surgical eligibility, potentially increasing crossover rates because participants randomized to PTA were aware that they met surgical eligibility. Second, some patients may have had bias for either SPT or PTA. However, to minimize this bias, we imposed strict inclusion criteria to ensure that patients did not prefer one treatment arm and were fully committed to completing their assigned treatment.</limitations_and_caveats>
