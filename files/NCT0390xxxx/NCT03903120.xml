  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a pediatric motor speech disorder that impairs the&#xD;
      planning of movements needed for intelligible speech. Children with CAS often show little or&#xD;
      slow progress in standard speech therapy. This research is a Phase 1 study that tests initial&#xD;
      efficacy and optimal parameters of a theoretically based integral stimulation treatment&#xD;
      called ASSIST (Apraxia of Speech Systematic Integral Stimulation Treatment). In three small&#xD;
      randomized group design studies, children (N=20 per study) receive 16 hours of individual&#xD;
      ASSIST. The three studies systematically investigate treatment intensity (2 vs. 4 weeks) and&#xD;
      two critical aspects of target selection: complexity (simple vs. complex target) and&#xD;
      lexicality (words vs. nonwords). Each study also systematically examines the effect of&#xD;
      treatment on functional outcome measures, including parent ratings of intelligibility and&#xD;
      communicative participation, and objective intelligibility measures obtained from unfamiliar&#xD;
      listeners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research involves a hypothesis-driven series of Phase 1 studies using comparative group&#xD;
      designs to investigate a new integral stimulation treatment program for children with CAS,&#xD;
      called ASSIST (Apraxia of Speech Systematic Integral Stimulation Treatment). The overall&#xD;
      objective of this research is to test the initial efficacy of ASSIST and determine its&#xD;
      optimal parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To test the initial efficacy of intensive ASSIST for children with CAS, by&#xD;
      examining short-term improvements on the primary outcome measure of speech accuracy. Forty&#xD;
      children (combined across two studies) will be randomly assigned to a treatment or a control&#xD;
      group (who will receive the treatment). The central hypothesis is that ASSIST enhances speech&#xD;
      motor skill, and predicts greater improvements after 2 weeks (16 hours) for the treatment&#xD;
      group than for the control group (who have not yet received treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the optimal parameters of ASSIST for children with CAS. In three&#xD;
      studies, children (N=20 each) will be randomly assigned to condition, to address three&#xD;
      critical treatment parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a: COMPLEXITY: simple vs. complex targets (Study 1). Simple targets may enhance&#xD;
      motivation through greater success during treatment, but more complex targets may facilitate&#xD;
      greater transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2b: LEXICALITY: real word vs. nonword targets (Study 2). Real words may enhance&#xD;
      motivation through functional relevance, but nonwords may facilitate transfer through a focus&#xD;
      on underlying speech motor skills rather than existing lexical or speech motor&#xD;
      representations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2c: INTENSITY: massed vs. distributed ASSIST (Study 3). Massed practice may enhance&#xD;
      learning through neuroplasticity principles, but motor learning principles predict greater&#xD;
      learning for distributed practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine changes on functional outcome measures following ASSIST&#xD;
      treatment. In particular, for each of the three studies, the investigators will examine&#xD;
      changes on the following outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3a: Parent-rated measures of intelligibility and communicative participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3b: Objective measures of intelligibility based on transcriptions by unfamiliar&#xD;
      listeners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research includes three small-scale group treatment studies (Studies 1-3), conducted&#xD;
      during summer to minimize confounds from concurrent treatment provided at school. In all&#xD;
      three treatment studies, 20 children will be randomly assigned to conditions and will receive&#xD;
      16 hours of ASSIST in two-week blocks (weeks 2-3 and/or 5-6). Data will be collected in weeks&#xD;
      1, 4, and 7 (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). Assessment will take place 2-8 weeks prior to T1&#xD;
      to allow time to develop individualized sets of potential treatment targets for each child.&#xD;
      For each treatment study, the investigators will conduct a corresponding experiment with&#xD;
      unfamiliar listeners (Studies 4-6) to evaluate potential impact of ASSIST on intelligibility.&#xD;
      Studies 2 and 3 will be informed by, but are not contingent on, preceding studies. For&#xD;
      example, if Study 1 shows an advantage for simple targets, then Study 2 will compare simple&#xD;
      words vs. simple nonwords. Thus, each study independently contributes to the overall&#xD;
      objective of this proposal and addresses an independent aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will attend a summer camp with 19 other children. Camp days (4 days per week during&#xD;
      treatment block 1 [weeks 2-3] and treatment block 2 [weeks 5-6]) are 8:00 am to 3:00 pm and&#xD;
      involve group activities and individual treatment sessions. All children participate in&#xD;
      child-appropriate group activities in both treatment blocks (e.g., arts and crafts projects,&#xD;
      games). Group activities are not treatment and have no focus on communication, but serve as&#xD;
      the control condition. Treatment follows the pull-out model in which children attend&#xD;
      individual treatment sessions in a separate room and then return to the group room. Treatment&#xD;
      will be delivered by SLP graduate students under supervision of certified, licensed, and&#xD;
      experienced SLPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment involves 32 individual sessions of 30-minutes (16 hours total) in which the child&#xD;
      works with an SLP graduate student clinician to work on individualized speech goals. Children&#xD;
      in intensive ASSIST conditions (all children in Studies 1 &amp; 2, and Massed ASSIST groups in&#xD;
      Study 3) will receive four 30-minute sessions per day (2 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon)&#xD;
      separated by at least one hour to minimize fatigue, in either the first treatment block (camp&#xD;
      weeks 2-3) or the second treatment block (camp weeks 5-6). Children in the Distributed ASSIST&#xD;
      condition (Study 3) will receive two 30-minutes sessions per day (1 in the morning, 1 in the&#xD;
      afternoon) separated by at least one hour to minimize fatigue, in both treatment blocks (camp&#xD;
      weeks 2-3 and 5-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment words or phrases will be tailored to each child based on pre-treatment testing and&#xD;
      personal relevance, as well as study aim. From each child's list of potential targets, two&#xD;
      sets will be created and matched on relevant variables except for those under study. One set&#xD;
      will be treated; the other set will serve to measure generalization (randomly assigned). Each&#xD;
      target will be practiced in several frames (e.g., more _ , I want _ , _ is yummy) to bolster&#xD;
      communicative relevance, enable variable practice, incorporate prosody, and engage language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each 30-minute session targets several items (active set) from the treatment set developed&#xD;
      for each child; new items are introduced as previous items are mastered and moved to&#xD;
      maintenance practice. ASSIST uses step-up and step-down criteria for adaptive practice and&#xD;
      pre-practice and practice components. Each session starts with pre-practice to ensure&#xD;
      motivation, establish a reference of correctness and ability to identify a correct response,&#xD;
      and establish ability to produce an accurate response. During pre-practice, the clinician&#xD;
      elicits targets via integral stimulation on the first attempt, provides feedback and elicits&#xD;
      additional attempts using cues and supports as needed. The clinician also solicits the&#xD;
      child's self-evaluation (e.g., &quot;Did that sound right?&quot;) and provides feedback on this&#xD;
      self-evaluation. Criteria to begin practice are either ≥1 accurate response per target and&#xD;
      correctly identifying ≥1 accurate response, or 15 minutes have elapsed (to ensure that&#xD;
      sessions include at least 10 minutes of practice). During practice, the clinician aims to&#xD;
      elicit as many attempts as possible. Treatment will follow a structured protocol with event&#xD;
      sequences called teaching episodes. A teaching episode involves an initial target elicitation&#xD;
      by the clinician, followed by feedback and/or a cue and another attempt by the child. Thus,&#xD;
      each teaching episode involves at least two attempts by the child. Practice occurs in&#xD;
      practice runs, which are bursts of practice separated by 1-minute breaks to minimize risk of&#xD;
      fatigue. A practice run will continue for 4 minutes or until each target in the child's&#xD;
      active set has cycled through 5 teaching episodes. The last practice run of a session&#xD;
      includes all previously targeted items (active set + maintenance items). Conditions are&#xD;
      systematically adapted to facilitate learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult listeners will transcribe recordings of speech samples produced by children with CAS.&#xD;
      Listeners will hear speech samples (randomized with respect to time of recording) and type&#xD;
      what the child said. They will be able to control the volume to ensure a comfortable loudness&#xD;
      level. They will type their responses to enhance data quality (legibility). These procedures&#xD;
      will take up to 2 hours, which may be completed in a single 2-hour session or two 1-hour&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
