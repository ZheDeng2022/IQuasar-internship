  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a chronic disease whose prevalence, due to the aging of the population, is&#xD;
      increasing. In France, the prevalence of this pathology is 2.3% (it reaches 10% in the over&#xD;
      75 years) and affects nearly a million patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehospitalization of patients with heart failure affects 25% of patients within 1-3&#xD;
      months of hospital discharge, and 66% at 1 year while 75% of hospitalizations are&#xD;
      preventable. These readmissions result in decreased quality of life and increased mortality;&#xD;
      from an economic point of view, hospitalization accounts for 70% of expenses related to the&#xD;
      management of heart failure. Avoiding rehospitalization is therefore a major public health&#xD;
      issue. The current predictive scores remain perfectible, even though risk factors for&#xD;
      readmission have already been the subject of numerous studies. The identification of patients&#xD;
      at risk of rehospitalization is still an issue, especially for patients with preserved left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction. Targeting patients requiring appropriate care remains an&#xD;
      issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rise of innovative statistical techniques around Big Data in health opens new&#xD;
      perspectives for the scientific exploitation of data available in electronic medical records,&#xD;
      for example in the field of prediction. This study aims to explore the risk of&#xD;
      rehospitalization in heart failure patients by analyzing routine data collected in medical&#xD;
      records and by mobilizing artificial intelligence algorithms. A review of the literature&#xD;
      confirms the innovative nature of such an approach: the majority of the studies identified&#xD;
      implemented a prospective collection of data; only 20% of the studies mobilized the medical&#xD;
      file; no French study used the new machine learning algorithms.&#xD;
