  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus - defined as ringing, humming, or other sounds in the ears or head - is a very&#xD;
      common problem for Veterans. Hearing aids that deliver low-level amplification are being used&#xD;
      by audiologists to help people with tinnitus who also have normal hearing. However, there is&#xD;
      a lack of research evidence showing that this practice is effective. Despite this fact, the&#xD;
      practice clearly is spreading. Reports from audiologists in the field as well as research&#xD;
      presentations refer to hearing aids being used in this way. Use of hearing aids has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce distress from tinnitus for people with hearing loss. Additionally, the use of&#xD;
      external sound to help reduce the impact of tinnitus has been shown to be effective. There is&#xD;
      clearly a gap in the research regarding the use of hearing aids as a therapeutic method to&#xD;
      manage tinnitus when hearing is considered normal. This study will obtain pilot data&#xD;
      evaluating people with normal hearing and bothersome tinnitus to find out whether low-level&#xD;
      amplification through hearing aids may provide benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus - defined as ringing, humming, or other sounds in the ears or head - is the most&#xD;
      prevalent service-connected disability among Veterans. Tinnitus affects 10-15% of the adult&#xD;
      population. For about 20% of these, tinnitus impacts their lives with respect to sleep&#xD;
      disturbance, impaired concentration, and/or emotional reactions. These 20% are the most in&#xD;
      need of clinical services. It has been shown that providing amplification via hearing aids&#xD;
      for people with hearing loss can also be beneficial in reducing functional effects of&#xD;
      tinnitus, presumably because amplifying environmental sounds reduces the contrast between the&#xD;
      tinnitus and background sound, allowing the tinnitus to be more easily ignored. There have&#xD;
      been increasing reports from the field of audiologists providing hearing aids set to deliver&#xD;
      low-gain amplification on patients with bothersome tinnitus who are not otherwise hearing aid&#xD;
      candidates, with beneficial outcomes. However, this nontraditional fitting practice has not&#xD;
      been formally evaluated, so there is no research evidence to support the practice. It is&#xD;
      essential for VA to show evidence supporting such practices to justify the use (and expense)&#xD;
      of these devices with patients who otherwise do not qualify to receive hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is a pilot study that would lay the groundwork for a future full&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the use of low-gain amplification for bothersome&#xD;
      tinnitus in patients with normal hearing. A pilot sample of 20 Veterans with normal hearing&#xD;
      thresholds and bothersome tinnitus will be fit with mild amplification through&#xD;
      receiver-in-the-canal hearing aids. Hearing aids will be programmed to provide a low-level of&#xD;
      amplification, using NAL-NL2 guidelines for target gain. Outcome measures will be evaluated&#xD;
      pre-fit and post-fit at two follow-up time points (2 weeks and 3 months post-fit). Outcomes&#xD;
      will include the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults&#xD;
      (HHIA) and the Quick Speech in Noise (QuickSIN) test. Outcomes pre and post hearing aid fit&#xD;
      will be compared to evaluate whether the hearing aids provided benefit to participants in&#xD;
      terms of their tinnitus and hearing outcomes. Additionally, participants will be interviewed&#xD;
      at their last visit to find out their self-reported benefit from the hearing aids, as well as&#xD;
      any barriers they encountered to wearing the hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a group of VA clinical audiologists will be interviewed by telephone. These&#xD;
      clinicians will be identified via an email survey sent to the VA audiologist email group,&#xD;
      asking whether they are providing low-gain amplification for bothersome tinnitus to patients&#xD;
      with normal hearing. The survey will also ask audiologists to volunteer if they are willing&#xD;
      to participate in a brief telephone interview. The aim will be to identify at least ten&#xD;
      audiologists who are fitting hearing aids in this way, and up to five who are not. These&#xD;
      audiologists will be interviewed over the telephone to find out why they have incorporated&#xD;
      this into their clinical practice (or why they have not), and inquire about specific fitting&#xD;
      procedures and criteria for identifying candidates that they have used. These responses will&#xD;
      inform the protocol of the future RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of this project, enough information will be collected to propose a&#xD;
      controlled study of low-gain amplification for bothersome tinnitus in people with normal&#xD;
      hearing. The protocol for that project will be informed by both the successful aspects of the&#xD;
      pilot protocol as well as the input from VA clinicians who are doing this in the field. A&#xD;
      preliminary evaluation of benefit provided by these hearing aids will provide justification&#xD;
      for a large controlled study. Finally, the pilot data will provide the basis for a power&#xD;
      calculation to determine sample size, as well as an estimate of drop-out rate to sufficiently&#xD;
      adjust for attrition. A full RCT demonstrating efficacy of low-gain amplification for&#xD;
      bothersome tinnitus in people with normal hearing would provide needed evidence supporting a&#xD;
      clinical practice that has already gained some traction both within and outside VA. Robust&#xD;
      research evidence is needed to support the continuation and future expansion of this&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
