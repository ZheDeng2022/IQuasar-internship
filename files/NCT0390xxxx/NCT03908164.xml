      A multicentre study to evaluate the impact of timing of whooping cough (pertussis)&#xD;
      vaccination in pregnancy, with participants randomised to receive whooping cough vaccination&#xD;
      at one of three time points in pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pertussis is a highly infectious respiratory illness caused by Bordetella pertussis, which&#xD;
      characteristically causes paroxysms of coughing with an associated inspiratory 'whoop'. In&#xD;
      young infants the clinical presentation can be atypical, is frequently associated with&#xD;
      apnoeic episodes and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Following the&#xD;
      introduction of pertussis vaccination into routine infant schedules worldwide there was a&#xD;
      significant reduction in the incidence of pertussis. However, recently in a number of&#xD;
      countries, despite high vaccine coverage, there has been a resurgence of pertussis disease&#xD;
      associated with an increase in infant deaths. Various strategies to control the increasing&#xD;
      burden of infant pertussis disease have been considered including cocooning, a strategy in&#xD;
      which close contacts of an infant are vaccinated, a neonatal dose of a pertussis containing&#xD;
      vaccine, the addition of an adolescent dose to the schedule and vaccination in pregnancy. Of&#xD;
      these, the latter has gained most support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination in pregnancy is a strategy which relies on effective transport of antibody across&#xD;
      the placenta, a process which depends on the antibody available, the gestation of the&#xD;
      pregnancy and the health of the placenta. In the case of pertussis, the main aim is to&#xD;
      prevent disease in babies (prior to the age of routine vaccination) as they have a higher&#xD;
      mortality than any other age group from pertussis disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now clear that pertussis vaccination in pregnancy can reduce the burden of disease in&#xD;
      young infants in the period prior to them being fully immunised, and can do so safely.&#xD;
      However, it is not established whether there is an optimal time to vaccinate in pregnancy to&#xD;
      ensure maximal protection of the infant. This is reflected in the different guidelines&#xD;
      currently in place in different countries: in the UK vaccination is advised from 16 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, in Canada from 26 weeks, in the USA from 27 weeks and in Australia from 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While some studies have suggested that vaccination later in pregnancy can achieve higher&#xD;
      antibody concentrations in the newborn, others have found earlier vaccination provides&#xD;
      improved immunity compared to later vaccination. The significance of this is that if earlier&#xD;
      vaccination is shown to be equivalent, there are clear logistical benefits in allowing the&#xD;
      widest possible time window in order to maximise the opportunities for pregnant women to be&#xD;
      vaccinated and thereby improve vaccine coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the pertussis vaccination in pregnancy programmes were first implemented, vaccination&#xD;
      was recommended in the third trimester (USA 27-36 weeks, UK 28-32 weeks). This decision was&#xD;
      based on the hypothesis that vaccination would be most effective if it was timed to allow the&#xD;
      peak in maternal antibody levels after vaccination to coincide with the time of most&#xD;
      efficient placental transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant lack of agreement on optimal timing of pertussis vaccination in&#xD;
      pregnancy due to conflicting data. This is the rationale for this randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study all participants will receive a pertussis containing vaccine licensed for use&#xD;
      in pregnancy. In the UK currently the vaccine used is Boostrix-IPVÂ® manufactured by&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline. This vaccine contains pertussis toxin (PT) (8 micrograms), filamentous&#xD;
      haemagglutinin (FHA) (8 micrograms) and pertactin (PRN) (2.5 micrograms) as well as&#xD;
      diphtheria toxoid (not less than 2 international units), tetanus toxoids (not less than 20&#xD;
      international units) and inactivated polio virus types 1-3 (type 1 40 D-antigen unit, type 2&#xD;
      8 D-antigen unit, type 3 32 D-antigen unit). This vaccine will be given at the time period&#xD;
      assigned by randomisation. All possible time periods included in the study are within that&#xD;
      recommended in the UK as part of routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood sampling prior to vaccination, 14 days following vaccination and&#xD;
      at the time of delivery. At delivery a cord blood sample will also be obtained and an infant&#xD;
      sample taken from the infants of participating women at 28-42 days after completion of their&#xD;
      primary immunisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of information about functional immunity of anti-PT antibody in serum and&#xD;
      colostrum/breastmilk following vaccination in pregnancy. We will be investigating this in two&#xD;
      exploratory sub-studies. The first of these (investigation of functional immunity of anti-PT&#xD;
      antibody in serum) will be performed on samples being performed as part of the main study.&#xD;
      For investigation of functional immunity of anti-PT antibody in colostrum and breastmilk we&#xD;
      will ask participants at two participating institutions if they are willing to participate in&#xD;
      a breastfeeding sub-study if they decide to breastfeed. For participants who take part in&#xD;
      this sub-study a sample of colostrum will be obtained within 48 hours of delivery and a&#xD;
      further breast milk sample at 14 days and 5 months following delivery.&#xD;
