  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot study to assess the acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and participant-level outcomes among girls and their mother/female caregiver&#xD;
      participating in a preconception health program. The program was developed through an&#xD;
      extensive formative phase and is delivered weekly over ~3 months. The investigators will&#xD;
      enroll a total of 60 female caregivers and their 8-11 year old daughters/female children to&#xD;
      participate in the program and evaluation. Implementation data including acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and satisfaction will be collected through REDCap and paper assessments completed&#xD;
      after each program session and at the completion of the program. Preliminary impact data will&#xD;
      be collected through REDCap up to 3 months post-intervention completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To understand if the preconception health program is feasible and acceptable among young&#xD;
           girls and their mothers or female caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore optimal implementation of the program to inform future research and scale up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess preliminary impact of the preconception health program on girls' and&#xD;
           caregiver's knowledge, cultural connectedness, caregiver-child relationship, community&#xD;
           and school connectedness, coping skills, parenting self-efficacy, depression, quality of&#xD;
           life as well as substance use behaviors and intentions and intention about sexual&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot evaluation to understand the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, satisfaction and explore preliminary impacts of a preconception health&#xD;
      program. The primary research question is: Is the preconception health program developed&#xD;
      through the formative phase of this study acceptable and feasible to girls and caregiver&#xD;
      participants? The program aims to improve the overall health and wellbeing of girls and their&#xD;
      female caregivers by decreasing and delaying the initiation of substance use and risk&#xD;
      behaviors associated with sexual initiation among adolescent girls. A second research&#xD;
      question is: does the preconception health program have preliminary impacts on key protective&#xD;
      and risk factors related to substance use and risky sexual behavior among girls and their&#xD;
      female caregivers?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Preconception Health Program will consist of 11 sessions conducted with girls ages 8-11&#xD;
      and their female caregivers. 5 of the 11 sessions will be taught to groups of 8-12 girls and&#xD;
      their mothers, and 6 of the sessions will be taught to individual girl/female caregivers'&#xD;
      dyads. The mix of group- and home-based lessons is based on findings from the formative phase&#xD;
      about preference for certain topics to be taught in groups vs. individual dyads. Each of the&#xD;
      sessions (group and individual) will be 60-90 minutes in duration and delivered by a trained&#xD;
      Family Health Coach (FHC). Group sessions will take place at a local community center in a&#xD;
      private room. Individual dyad sessions will take place in the girls'/female caregivers home&#xD;
      or another private place of their choosing such as our local Johns Hopkins offices. The&#xD;
      program will be conducted over 2.5-3 months with one session occurring every week for 11&#xD;
      weeks. The total program duration is 660-990 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adequately assess the primary research question, the investigators will enroll 60 dyads,&#xD;
      grouped into three cohorts of 10 dyads each, who will complete satisfaction questionnaires&#xD;
      after each of the program sessions and upon completion of the program. To assess preliminary&#xD;
      impact on girls' risk for substance use and intention about sexual activity, including&#xD;
      cultural connectedness, mother-daughter communication and psychological health and wellbeing,&#xD;
      the investigators will deliver an evaluation conducted at baseline, upon completion of the&#xD;
      intervention (post-intervention assessment) and 3 months following completion of the&#xD;
      intervention (3-month follow-up assessment). The investigators will also assess program&#xD;
      impact on female caregivers' substance use, parent-child communication and factors related to&#xD;
      the female caregivers' wellbeing through an evaluation conducted at baseline, upon completion&#xD;
      of the intervention (post-intervention assessment) and 3 months following completion of the&#xD;
      intervention (3-month follow-up assessment).&#xD;
