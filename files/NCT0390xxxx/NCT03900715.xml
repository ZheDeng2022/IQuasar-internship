    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation&#xD;
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of luspatercept (ACE-536) for the treatment of anemia due to&#xD;
      International prognostic scoring system-Revised (IPSS-R) very low, low or intermediate risk&#xD;
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)in Japanese subjects who are not requiring Red blood cell&#xD;
      (RBC) transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into the Screening Period, a Treatment Period and a Post-Treatment&#xD;
      Follow up Period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is considered to be one of the most prevalent cytopenias in patients who have&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes, an umbrella term used to describe disorders relating to the&#xD;
      ineffective production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and/or platelets. Ranging in&#xD;
      severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe, anemia can result in patients requiring regular&#xD;
      red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which can lead to further complications from iron&#xD;
      overload. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and PK of luspatercept in&#xD;
      anemic patients who are categorized as International Prognostic Scoring System-Revised&#xD;
      (IPSS-R) very low, low, or intermediate risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and not&#xD;
      requiring RBC transfusion. Subjects deemed eligible for the study will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treated with luspatercept. Best supportive care (BSC) may be used in combination with study&#xD;
      treatment when clinically indicated per investigator. Best supportive care includes, but is&#xD;
      not limited to, treatment with transfusions, antibiotic, antiviral and/or antifungal therapy,&#xD;
      and nutritional support as needed. Best supportive care for this study excludes the use of&#xD;
      ESAs. Patients should receive treatment up to a minimum of 24 weeks after which an MDS&#xD;
      Disease assessment visit is scheduled to assess the response to treatment. Patients who are&#xD;
      determined to be experiencing clinical benefit may continue treatment. Continued clinical&#xD;
      benefit will be re-assessed every 24 weeks. Once patients are discontinued from study&#xD;
      treatment, they will enter a post treatment follow-up period.&#xD;
