  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to describe the environmental aerosolization&#xD;
      patterns burden of RSV in the air and on surfaces in surrounding adult patients in a&#xD;
      real-life setting. Specific objectives are to determine the particle size distribution and&#xD;
      the quantity of airborne pathogens dispersed by symptomatic participants, to establish a&#xD;
      spatial model of airborne emission and subsequent surface burden of RSV emission and&#xD;
      dispersal in clinical settings (emergency department and inpatient units; 1 foot vs. 3-6 feet&#xD;
      vs. 8-10 feet), and to obtain information regarding the potential association of illness&#xD;
      severity and risk factors to the scale of airborne dispersal (e.g., super spreaders). This&#xD;
      study will be used to collect data of the emission patterns of RSV. Subsequent investigations&#xD;
      will help guide policymakers in the assessment of the airborne exposure risk to RSV and the&#xD;
      implementation of appropriate infection prevent measures such as respirators and face masks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the airborne emission patterns of Respiratory Syncytial&#xD;
      Virus varies between individual patients. The investigators are proposing to assess the&#xD;
      particle size and spatial distribution of airborne RSV emitted by affected patients within a&#xD;
      routine care environment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize individuals who develop respiratory illnesses caused by RSV in terms of&#xD;
           demographics, co-morbid conditions, prior vaccinations (e.g., influenza vaccine, DTAP),&#xD;
           use of antivirals, and severity of illness (fever, respiratory symptoms, malaise).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the particle size distribution patterns and quantities of the pathogen in two&#xD;
           settings, an emergency department and an inpatient unit (ICU and non-ICU settings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish a spatial model (1 foot vs. 3-6 feet vs. 8-10 feet) of airborne pathogen&#xD;
           dispersal and subsequent surface burden in two settings, an emergency department and an&#xD;
           inpatient unit (ICU and non-ICU settings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the correlation between the human aerosolization patterns and the severity of&#xD;
           illness (fever, respiratory symptoms, malaise) in individual participants (super&#xD;
           spreader?).&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods The main objective of this study is to identify and determine&#xD;
      airborne emission and subsequent surface burden patterns of RSV in naturally infected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen at the Emergency Department( ED) or admitted to the hospital with respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms and diagnosed with RSV are eligible for enrollment. The results of routine in-house&#xD;
      laboratory diagnostic tests such as the Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) will be used to&#xD;
      identify patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wake forest baptist medical center (WFBMC) is an 885 bed tertiary care teaching hospital.&#xD;
      There are approximately 36,000 inpatient admissions and &gt;89,000 ED visits annually&#xD;
      (pediatric/adult). Air sampling is conducted in patient rooms under turbulent airflows (6&#xD;
      total air changes/hour) at approximately 20Â°C temperature and 40% Relative Humidity. Air is&#xD;
      filtered by ANSI/ASHRAE 52.2 compliant endfilters with a minimum efficiency reporting value&#xD;
      of 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One nasopharyngeal swab will be obtained from each subject. The sample will be used to&#xD;
      confirm RSV infection and determine the amount of the pathogen carried by the individual.&#xD;
      Samples will be inoculated into Becton Dickinson Universal Viral Transport System (VTM, BD&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-time air samples will be collected using six-stage Andersen air sampling devices and&#xD;
      settle plates at three locations, head of bed/chair two feet away from patient head, foot of&#xD;
      bed/chair eight feet away from head, and at the exit of the patient room (11):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected in viral transport media (VTM), supplemented with RNA stabilization&#xD;
      buffer (Qiagen AVL buffer) and carrier RNA and then stored at -80C. Carrier RNA will serve as&#xD;
      both a carrier and an internal control by containing genomic RNA of the plant tobacco mosaic&#xD;
      virus. A 540 ul volume of RNA sample will be purified with the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini&#xD;
      Extraction Kit and concentrated approximately 10-fold. RSV serotypes A and B as well as the&#xD;
      control viral tobacco mosaic virus RNA will be detected by reverse transcription and&#xD;
      quantitative PCR. Additionally, nNasopharyngeal swab with also be used for cultures with&#xD;
      inoculation in petri dish containing RSV specific media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surface burden of RSV will be assessed by placement of open standard Petri dishes filled&#xD;
      with VTM at the three air sampling locations. The covers of the Petri dishes will be removed&#xD;
      at the beginning of and closed after the air sampling session. Selected environmental&#xD;
      surfaces will be sampled with sterile swabs moistened with VTM or TSB broth. A two square&#xD;
      inch area will be swabbed once at three high-touch locations daily: head of the bed hand&#xD;
      rail, middle of food tray table, and a table/horizontal surface at back of room&#xD;
      (approximately 10 feet away past foot of bed). The swabs will be vortexed for 30 seconds, and&#xD;
      processed as described for RSV detection in air samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the sampling health care professional (HCP) and study staff will wear respirators&#xD;
      (N-95) to reduce the risk of external contamination due to potential RSV carrier status. The&#xD;
      respirators will be collected and a two square inch midsection of the respirator will be cut&#xD;
      out using sterile scissors. The cut-outs are placed in 2mLs VTM or TSB broth and frozen.&#xD;
      After thawing, samples are vortexed/agitated, and further processed as described for the RSV&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
