      The goal of this study is to implement such an approach conceptualized by a community health&#xD;
      worker (CHW) to pilot an innovative, multi-level intervention to address social and&#xD;
      structural determinants that negatively influence MEH disparities for Latinas from low-income&#xD;
      households. The proposed research integrates CHW navigation with group peer support. Both of&#xD;
      these strategies have been shown to be culturally appropriate and effective for improving a&#xD;
      variety of health outcomes with this population. Our transdisciplinary, community-engaged&#xD;
      team will use a convergent parallel mixed method research design to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      the intervention and its impact on six domains of interest: 1) emotional support, 2)&#xD;
      informational support, 3) depression, 4) social isolation, 5) empowerment, and 6) social&#xD;
      determinants needs. To prepare for future extramural funding, the investigators will include&#xD;
      development of an advocacy plan for multi-level social change impact.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic women (Latinas) experience mental and emotional health (MEH) concerns and disorders&#xD;
      that often go unrecognized by health providers, and even when recognized, Latinas have&#xD;
      low-levels of treatment follow-through with biomedical modalities. Using a novel&#xD;
      community-directed, solution-based approach to increase access to existing services and&#xD;
      nurture culturally meaningful social relationships, it is possible to address social&#xD;
      determinants of health and reduce these disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to implement such an approach conceptualized by a community health&#xD;
      worker (CHW) to pilot an innovative, multi-level intervention to address social and&#xD;
      structural determinants that negatively influence MEH disparities for Latinas from low-income&#xD;
      households. The proposed research integrates CHW navigation with group peer support. Both of&#xD;
      these strategies have been shown to be culturally appropriate and effective for improving a&#xD;
      variety of health outcomes with this population. Our transdisciplinary, community-engaged&#xD;
      team will use a convergent parallel mixed method research design to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      the intervention and its impact on six domains of interest: 1) emotional support, 2)&#xD;
      informational support, 3) depression, 4) social isolation, 5) empowerment, and 6) social&#xD;
      determinants needs. To prepare for future extramural funding, the investigators will include&#xD;
      development of an advocacy plan for multi-level social change impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Create a group navigation model to improve mental and emotional health equity for&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking Latina women. In a series of peer group sessions facilitated by Guadalupe&#xD;
      Fuentes, a CHW who designed the model, the investigators will create a&#xD;
      culturally-appropriate, non-stigmatizing group intervention. The group process will allow&#xD;
      participants to explore their own MEH, better understand the ways that mental health&#xD;
      influences well-being and everyday dynamics of their lives, and to develop empowering&#xD;
      knowledge and action plans through the support of other women. The investigators will&#xD;
      document group discussions, processes, and themes, gather information about women's&#xD;
      explanatory models of MEH, and administer a multidimensional survey to capture information&#xD;
      about the domains of interest. Through individual case management, Fuentes will work&#xD;
      individually with women from the groups to identify their specific social and structural&#xD;
      determinants needs, assist them to make an individual action plan, provide them with&#xD;
      information about available resources, and help them navigate systems and access resources&#xD;
      and services. The investiagtors will document participant needs and navigation outcomes.&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Participation will decrease depression, social isolation, and social determinants&#xD;
      needs, and increase emotional support, informational support, and women's sense of&#xD;
      empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Create an advocacy plan. With data gathered in group meetings and individual&#xD;
      navigation sessions, the investigators will identify social and structural barriers that&#xD;
      negatively influence participants' MEH outcomes and ability to access resources and services.&#xD;
      The investigators will create an advocacy plan to address structural and policy barriers that&#xD;
      can be implemented by CHWs and advocacy groups in the future. Hypotheses: The investigators&#xD;
      will be able to identify factors that negatively influence the MEH and well-being of Latinas.&#xD;
      They hypothesize that in the future, this knowledge can be used to develop a strategic plan&#xD;
      with the potential to address socio-structural and policy barriers through advocacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Assess the feasibility of the intervention. The investigators will track recruitment,&#xD;
      attrition, attendance at group sessions, and attendance at individual CHW navigation&#xD;
      meetings.The investigators will gather survey data and qualitative data to document&#xD;
      participant experiences with and perceptions of the group process, working with the CHW, and&#xD;
      the value of the intervention. Hypotheses: The intervention pilot will be feasible,&#xD;
      acceptable, valuable, and culturally appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome. This pilot study will use team science to test an intervention that emerged&#xD;
      organically in the community and contribute to building the next generation of health&#xD;
      disparities research using knowledge generated through solution-based investigation as the&#xD;
      foundation for submitting an NIH R21 research proposal.&#xD;
