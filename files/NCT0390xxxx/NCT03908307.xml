In this format, scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score.</description>

             are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, antimetabolites, and/or alkylating agents&#xD;
