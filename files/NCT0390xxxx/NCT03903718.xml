    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MEDI8852 for the treatment&#xD;
      of influenza caused by a wild type A/H1N1 challenge strain in healthy, influenza&#xD;
      serosusceptible adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, eight healthy subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, will be enrolled at one study&#xD;
      center in the United States of America (USA) and will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose&#xD;
      of MEDI8852 (Cohort 1, dose 1) on Day 1. The subjects will be admitted to a Phase 1 unit (Day&#xD;
      -1), for dosing (Day 1) and for follow-up (through discharge from the Phase 1 unit on Day 2).&#xD;
      Subjects will then be followed through Day 60 for treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs),&#xD;
      treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), treatment emergent adverse events of&#xD;
      special interest (TEAESI), concomitant medications, nasal and blood PK, and ADA. Initiation&#xD;
      of Part 2 of the study will be based on review of safety data from Part 1 (Days 1-8) by a&#xD;
      study-specific Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC). For subjects in Part 1, the study is&#xD;
      approximately 90 days in duration, consisting of a screening period of up to 30 days, a&#xD;
      treatment period of 1 day and a follow-up period of 59 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, approximately 60 healthy, influenza serosusceptible subjects, 18 to 65 years of&#xD;
      age, will be enrolled at the same study center in the USA and will receive a wild-type A/H1N1&#xD;
      challenge strain on Day 1. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 into 5 cohorts&#xD;
      (approximately 12 subjects per cohort) to receive the following on Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: A single IV dose of placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: OS, 75 mg orally BID (twice a day) for 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: A single IV low dose of MEDI8852 (dose 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: A single IV high dose of MEDI8852 (dose 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: A single IV low dose of MEDI8852 (dose 2) and oseltamivir (OS), 75 mg orally&#xD;
           BID for 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be admitted to the Phase 1 unit (Day -1), for influenza challenge strain&#xD;
      administration (Day 1), dosing (Day 2 [Cohorts 2, 4 and 5] and Days 2-6 [Cohorts 3 and 6]),&#xD;
      and follow-up (through discharge from the Phase 1 unit on Day 9). Subjects will then be&#xD;
      followed through Day 14 for solicited influenza symptoms, and through Day 60 for TEAEs,&#xD;
      TESAEs, TEAESIs, concomitant medications, nasal and blood pharmacokinetics (PK), and antidrug&#xD;
      antibody (ADA). For subjects in Part 2, the study is approximately 120 days in duration,&#xD;
      consisting of a screening period of up to 60 days, a treatment period of 8 days and a&#xD;
      follow-up period of 52 days&#xD;

    <masking_description>Subjects will be assigned to Part 1 of the study (Cohort 1) in an unblinded manner.&#xD;
Part 2 is a partial double-blind study of MEDI8852 and placebo. Because MEDI8852 and placebo are not completely indistinguishable in appearance, an unblinded investigational product manager will prepare the investigational product using a coloured sleeve to cover the infusion bag containing investigational product. An unblinded investigational product monitor will perform investigational product accountability. The unblinded personnel will not reveal the treatment allocation to the sponsor or site staff. Neither the subject/legal representative nor any of the investigator or sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. In the event that the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the sponsor must be notified immediately.</masking_description>
