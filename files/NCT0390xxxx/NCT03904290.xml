  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to examine cardiopulmonary and respiratory physiology&#xD;
      pre and post PFO/ASD closure in patients who are undergoing surgical closure of their&#xD;
      PFO/ASD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is present in ~30% of the general population. The PFO has&#xD;
      historically been considered to be trivial. However, recent work by the investigator's group&#xD;
      and others has identified that, compared to individuals without a PFO, those with a PFO have&#xD;
      a higher core body temperature, significantly worse pulmonary gas exchange efficiency,&#xD;
      blunted ventilatory responses to chronic hypoxia and acute carbon dioxide and increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to altitude illnesses such as acute mountain sickness, and high altitude&#xD;
      pulmonary edema. Specific to this application, subjects with a PFO maybe worse pulmonary gas&#xD;
      exchange efficiency because a PFO is a potential source of right-to-left shunt that will make&#xD;
      pulmonary gas exchange efficiency worse. If true, then this may negatively impact exercise&#xD;
      capacity and/or exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's lab group has demonstrated that hypoxemia increases blood flow through&#xD;
      intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVA) in healthy and subjects with COPD. When&#xD;
      these subjects breathe 100% O2 it prevents or reduces blood flow through IPAVA. This suggests&#xD;
      that hypoxemia per se induces blood flow through IPAVA. The blood flow through IPAVA and&#xD;
      presence of a PFO is also associated with increased risk of stroke and/or transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack (TIA). In addition, an atrial septal defect (ASD) is a hole within the interatrial&#xD;
      septum, and is considered a congenital heart defect. An ASD is typically larger than a PFO,&#xD;
      and thus, the symptoms may be worse in those with an ASD, compared to those with a PFO. Thus,&#xD;
      some hypoxemic patients who have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack, who also have a&#xD;
      PFO/ASD may undergo surgical closure of their PFO/ASD to prevent subsequent neurological&#xD;
      sequelae. This surgical closure may also prevent the hypoxemia thereby reducing or preventing&#xD;
      blood flow through IPAVA. Of note, blood flow through IPAVA has been demonstrated to be&#xD;
      strongly correlated with TIA and/or stroke and has not previously been taken into&#xD;
      consideration in randomized clinical trials mentioned below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three randomized clinical trials have determined that PFO closure is not superior to regular&#xD;
      medical management, for the prevention of subsequent stroke and/or TIA. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      American Heart Association still recommends that &quot;in patients with cryptogenic [unexplained]&#xD;
      TIA or stroke, a PFO, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), guidelines from the American College of&#xD;
      Chest Physicians currently recommend vitamin K antagonist therapy for 3 months and&#xD;
      consideration of PFO closure rather than no vitamin K antagonist therapy or aspirin therapy.&quot;&#xD;
      Additionally, in the largest single center retrospective study performed to date, PFO closure&#xD;
      for the purpose of preventing hypoxemia was found to result in &quot;improvement in&#xD;
      echocardiographic evidence of right to left shunt, New York Heart Association functional&#xD;
      class, and oxygen requirement.&quot; Thus, PFO/ASD closure remains a potentially beneficial option&#xD;
      for both hypoxemic and stroke/TIA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, preliminary data also suggest greater levels of plasma inflammatory mediators in&#xD;
      subjects with a PFO and systemic inflammation is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, exercise is known to reduce so of these systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory mediator levels. Thus, PFO/ASD closure may allow for greater exercise capacity&#xD;
      and a subsequent reduction in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, although a PFO has been traditionally considered to have a minimal impact of physiology&#xD;
      and pathophysiology, emerging evidence suggests this may not be the case. The investigator's&#xD;
      lab is focused on understanding how and why a relatively small hole in the heart (PFO/ASD)&#xD;
      can have a relatively large impact on cardiopulmonary and respiratory physiology.&#xD;
