  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide,&#xD;
      even in high income countries. Uterine atony is estimated to cause 70-80% of postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage. Prolonged labor and augmented labor are known risk factors for postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage. In attempts to reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with known risks factors, it is essential to optimize preventative practices in&#xD;
      order to reduce the rates postpartum hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although oxytocin is considered the first line therapy for preventing and treating uterine&#xD;
      atony, early consideration of additional prophylactic uterotonic agents may be indicated in&#xD;
      women with prior oxytocin exposure given oxytocin receptor desensitization and down&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, investigators sought to examine whether multimodal prophylactic uterotonics&#xD;
      (standard oxytocin + methylergonovine), in patients who are increased risk of developing&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage (specifically laboring patients who ultimately require a cesarean&#xD;
      section) would benefit from the addition of prophylactic uterotonics. The clinical rational&#xD;
      for administration of multimodal prophylactic uterotonics at the time of cesarean delivery in&#xD;
      laboring patients is three-fold: to decrease the incidence of uterine atony, to decrease the&#xD;
      incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, decrease the number of uterotonics required at the time&#xD;
      of cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be to evaluate the need for additional uterotonic agents&#xD;
      (Methylergonovine, Carboprost, Misoprostol) at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (quantitative blood&#xD;
      loss &gt;1 liter), surgical assessment of uterine tone four minutes following delivery of the&#xD;
      placenta, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, the need for a blood transfusion,&#xD;
      intensive care unit admission, uterine infection (endometritis).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients who meet eligibility for the study will be consented during their clinic visit&#xD;
      or upon arrival to labor and delivery. If patients elect to participate in the study,&#xD;
      enrollment in the study will be noted in their sticky note in EPIC (electronic medical&#xD;
      record) which will be ready available to all members of the health care team. If patients&#xD;
      during the labor process require a cesarean section, the anesthesiologist will pick up a&#xD;
      sealed envelope (which will contain the allocation sequence and group assignment). A&#xD;
      randomization block design with mixed block sizes will be used to generate the allocation&#xD;
      sequence by using the nQuery Advisor computer software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sealed envelopes will be readily available to the anesthesiologist and kept in the&#xD;
      anesthesia workroom. Following delivery of the infant, the patient will receive the standard&#xD;
      oxytocin infusion. Following administration of the oxytocin infusion, the patient will be&#xD;
      given either methylergonovine 0.2 mg IM (intramuscular) or placebo (1 ml of normal saline,&#xD;
      intramuscular). This will be drawn up and administered by the anesthesiologist. The&#xD;
      obstetrician (delivering provider performing the cesarean section) will be blinded to the&#xD;
      group assignment. Documentation of the drug will be recorded in epic in the medication&#xD;
      administration record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivering provider will be responsible for determining and relaying to the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist whether additional uterotonics are needed throughout the procedure.&#xD;
      Additional uterotonics will be given in accordance to the current guidelines outlined by the&#xD;
      American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The delivery provider will&#xD;
      assess uterine tone at 4 minutes (satisfactory versus unsatisfactory). The registered nurse&#xD;
      will be responsible for setting up a timer to let the OB provider know when 4 minutes have&#xD;
      passed. Nursing will call out once the 4 minutes have passed and the OB provider will state&#xD;
      whether adequate tone was noted. The anesthesiologist will be responsible for documenting&#xD;
      whether a placebo/study drug was given and uterine tone after 4 minutes. This documentation&#xD;
      will be placed back into the sealed envelope by the anesthesiologist and placed in the&#xD;
      anesthesia workroom. Nicole Masse (primary investigator) will be responsible for storing&#xD;
      folders in a secured, locked file cabinet within the Maternal Fetal Medicine offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As routinely done at the time of cesarean delivery, the registered nurse will be responsible&#xD;
      for measuring and documenting the quantitative blood loss. As routinely performed on all are&#xD;
      patients who undergo a vaginal or cesarean delivery, preoperative hemoglobin and&#xD;
      postoperative day one hemoglobin levels will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event a postpartum hemorrhage was to occur, the obstetrician will then be un-blinded&#xD;
      as management of a postpartum hemorrhage will be driven by whether normal saline or&#xD;
      methergine was given as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, the need for additional uterotonics, will be assessed in the operating&#xD;
      room. Other outcome which will be assessed in the operating room include uterine tone and&#xD;
      quantitative blood loss. Outcomes which will be assessed in the immediate postpartum period&#xD;
      include: postpartum hemoglobin values, need for a blood transfusion, admission to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit, endometritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No long-term follow will be needed.&#xD;
