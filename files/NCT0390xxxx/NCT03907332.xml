      Title: Using Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Nurses (CHNs) to increase Skilled Attendant&#xD;
      at Birth (SAB) and improve Maternal and Neonatal Health in Rural Ghana&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: SAB is a key strategy for improving maternal and new born health since most of&#xD;
      the complications occurring at childbirth could be better managed when the delivery is&#xD;
      supervised by a doctor, midwife or nurse. The effect of home visits to pregnant women by a&#xD;
      CHW/CHN partnership on SAB is yet to be evaluated in a trial in Ghana. This trial will&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of a CHW/CHN home visit intervention to pregnant women on&#xD;
      increasing SAB and improving birth outcomes for mothers and their neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Following ethical approval, we will train CHWs and CHNs to provide a package of&#xD;
      health education and support for delivery during three home visits to each pregnant woman.&#xD;
      This partnership will be evaluated through a cluster randomized controlled trial in 20&#xD;
      electoral areas in Ellembelle district of Ghana: 10 will be randomized to receive the CHW/CHN&#xD;
      partnership intervention and 10 to the control arm (usual care), with a target recruitment of&#xD;
      46-50 women per cluster. The CHWs and CHNs will receive technical and financial support&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on SAB, maternal utilization of safe practices during pregnancy, breast feeding&#xD;
      initiation, exclusive breastfeeding, immunization coverage for mother and new born, maternal&#xD;
      deaths and neonatal death rates will be collected. The impact of the CHW/CHN intervention on&#xD;
      these indicators will be reported.&#xD;

      Methods: Assignment of interventions (for controlled trials) Implementation of intervention,&#xD;
      Randomization process Randomization of the 20 electoral areas will be done by a statistician.&#xD;
      There will be block randomization of clusters depending on the availability of either a&#xD;
      Community Health Nurse midwife or a staff midwife within the Electoral area. The block&#xD;
      randomization will ensure adequate distribution of intervention and control arms across all&#xD;
      the categories of healthcare services available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to intervention or control once informed consent is given,&#xD;
      based on their electoral area. All participants in a cluster will be recruited at a health&#xD;
      facility located within the electoral area. Participants will not know which group they&#xD;
      belong at the time of consent to reduce selection bias. Following random allocation and&#xD;
      assignment to either intervention or the control arm, the groups will continue their usual&#xD;
      antenatal care of at least four ANC visits as part of the components of Focused Antenatal&#xD;
      Care (FANC) services at facility level. Participants will also have access to all on-going&#xD;
      health interventions available for all pregnant women. The interventional arm will in&#xD;
      addition to their usual care, receive up to three home visits by the CHW/CHN where specific&#xD;
      health information will be provided to the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographics of women in the two arms will be compared to determine if any differential&#xD;
      take-up resulted in unbalanced groups. There may be other consequences of differential&#xD;
      take-up that are not evidenced by a comparison of participant demographics; this will be a&#xD;
      limitation of the research but cannot be further mitigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size In calculating the sample size, the weighted average of the baseline SAB rate of&#xD;
      37% from 2017 actual data for four health sub-districts and the intra-cluster correlation of&#xD;
      0.033, reported from three studies by Pagel et al in 2011 were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence for each of the two arms, there will be 10 electoral areas (clusters) in which 46-50&#xD;
      women will be recruited for a total sample size of 456 per arm. The total sample size of 912&#xD;
      mothers means the trial would have 80% power to detect a relative increase of 35% in the rate&#xD;
      of SAB with an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 46-50 women per cluster. Should no women drop-out of the study, the&#xD;
      sample size required to detect the size of effect sought with enough statistical power would&#xD;
      be 912 (46-50 per cluster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The data collectors will be blinded; they would not know which women were in the&#xD;
      intervention or control arms. All data on the primary outcome will be verified by the&#xD;
      researcher, who cannot be blinded. Also, it is impossible to blind the pregnant women and the&#xD;
      CHW/CHNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involvement of District staff The CHWs and CHNs will conduct the visits; one visit in the&#xD;
      second trimester and two in the third trimester- a total of three home visits per pregnant&#xD;
      woman. The district officers will assist in supervising the CHW and CHN visits. Other staff&#xD;
      who will be blinded, will be trained to collect outcomes data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data collection, management, and analysis Data collection methods Initial data on&#xD;
      participants' background characteristics will be documented at the health facility where&#xD;
      recruitment occurs. This will be done by the researcher using a pre-tested data collection&#xD;
      questionnaire (see Appendix 2) and assisted by midwives. Outcome data will be collected from&#xD;
      the pregnant women at the end of the trial by blinded district officers for reliability and&#xD;
      validity. This will be done using a questionnaire administered in the woman's home (Appendix&#xD;
      2). The blinded data collection officers will collect outcomes data only. They will not know&#xD;
      which group the women belong to but the researcher (who will only collect data to verify the&#xD;
      primary outcome and visit acceptability) will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collectors will be trained to respond appropriately in circumstances where mother&#xD;
      experienced a distressful event during pregnancy and /or delivery (offering empathy and&#xD;
      adapting the data collection process intended to avoid any further distress) and contact the&#xD;
      researcher immediately. The researcher will then ensure the social welfare officer is linked&#xD;
      with the affected woman and her family and the needed support provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality All deliveries will be verified by the researcher at the facility or place where&#xD;
      the birth occurred. Also, antenatal visits will be verified from the Maternal health record&#xD;
      book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entries, coding, storage Data will be collected on paper by blinded data collection&#xD;
      officers. The hard copies will be submitted to the researcher at the end of each day's field&#xD;
      work and stored in locked file cabinets at the research unit of the district health&#xD;
      directorate. Entries will be made in MS Excel by the researcher. The Excel database (which&#xD;
      will be anonymous) will be updated to the Warwick email regularly and Supervisors copied. The&#xD;
      hard copies or anonymous soft copies will be made available to the DMEC for data&#xD;
      verification. Check codes using Excel formulae will be built into the database to help&#xD;
      prevent data entry errors and data loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Statistical tables will be generated, and appropriate statistical tests&#xD;
      used to analyze the variables of interest. Data analyses will be done using STATA version&#xD;
      14.0. Dr Nicholas Parsons and Dr Peter Kimani have provided professional statistics support&#xD;
      and, have agreed to provide further support with the Randomization process through the&#xD;
      school's Statistics Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main measure of association to be determined is the Relative Risk of SAB (RR) in&#xD;
      intervention arm compared to control. The estimated effect of the intervention will be&#xD;
      presented as a RR together with its 95% confidence interval. Same will be computed for the&#xD;
      controls. The analysis for each outcome will be by intention-to-treat and will account for&#xD;
      clustering by Electoral area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of subject involved The participants involved are pregnant women. Only women who&#xD;
      reside in Ellembelle will be enrolled in the study. As such women should have lived&#xD;
      continuously in the Electoral area for at least 3 months prior to enrolment into this study.&#xD;
      Enrolment will proceed for eligible participants only after informed consent has been given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial monitoring The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) The TSC has seven members comprising, the&#xD;
      investigator, the research supervisors who are experienced researchers at the University of&#xD;
      Warwick, and four independent policy makers and research experts from the Ghana Health&#xD;
      Service and Ghana's Ministry of Health. They will provide technical guidance on the conduct&#xD;
      of the trial and support timely and efficient dissemination of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The members of the TSC are&#xD;

      Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) The trial data will be monitored by the DMEC,&#xD;
      which comprises three independent members from Ghana and supported by project supervisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMEC members are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mr Isaac Korankye- Snr. Biostatistician (Ghana Health Service)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mr Francis Nuoh- Snr. Biostatistician, Ghana Health Service&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mr Prince Oppong-Darko - (Health Information Officer) Ghana Health Service&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dr Celia Brown (Research Supervisor- Warwick)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prof Paramjit Gill (Research Supervisor- Warwick)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DMEC will receive confidential data on the trial, monitor progress and give the relevant&#xD;
      advice where needed. The CHW/CHN trial is a health education intervention delivered in the&#xD;
      pregnant woman's home at the community level, and its evaluation depend on skilled births&#xD;
      occurring within a year, hence the DMEC will not conduct any interim analyses.&#xD;
