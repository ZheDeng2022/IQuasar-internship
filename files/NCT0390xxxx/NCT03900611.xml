  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common and disabling disease that affects more than 10% of the population&#xD;
      worldwide. The prevalence of migraine in Taiwan is around 9.1%. The migraineurs missed 2&#xD;
      workdays due to migraine per year, that is 3.7 million estimated missed workdays in total and&#xD;
      an estimated cost of 4.6 billion New Taiwan dollars. In addition, some migraineurs have poor&#xD;
      response to the medications or suffer from adverse effects, and may further develop&#xD;
      medication-overuse headache. Therefore, in recent years, efforts have been made to develop&#xD;
      non-medication treatments, and the number of studies using neuromodulation as an intervention&#xD;
      has increased dramatically. Among them, peripheral electrical stimulation has long been a&#xD;
      routine treatment for pain in the clinic, and research has also shown its good evidence. In&#xD;
      addition, recent studies have shown that peripheral electrical stimulation can also alter the&#xD;
      cortical activities. Compared with the proximal brain stimulation, the remote electrical&#xD;
      stimulation is safer, more convenient, less expensive and suitable for home use. To date,&#xD;
      only one research had focused on the immediate anesthetic effect of remote electrical&#xD;
      stimulation whereas the research for migraine prevention is still absent. Therefore, we&#xD;
      expect to utilize a more remote electrical stimulation than trigeminal nerve electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, which is the commonly used research method nowadays, as an interventional model.&#xD;
      In three years, we will recruit 80 migraineurs along with 40 healthy controls and investigate&#xD;
      the effects of 8-week home-based remote electrical stimulation on the prevention of migraine&#xD;
      and the mechanisms using brain imaging, electrophysiological and biochemical examinations. We&#xD;
      also aim to identify the predictors of the responders to remote electrical stimulation. If&#xD;
      the effects of remote electrical stimulation are confirmed, as a non-drug neuromodulation&#xD;
      management with features of non-invasive, low adverse effects and high accessibility, it will&#xD;
      greatly lower the cost of social health care and better improve the quality of life and&#xD;
      clinical status of the migraineurs.&#xD;
