  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previous research study comparing the efficacy of intravenous ketamine to&#xD;
      morphine showed ketamine to provide equivalent relief of moderate to severe acute pain in&#xD;
      emergency department patients. A second study by the investigators showed that increasing the&#xD;
      time of administration of the ketamine, from a push injection to a drip infusion, will&#xD;
      minimize the adverse effects experienced by recipients of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now aim to see if nebulized subdissociative-dose ketamine administered as a&#xD;
      single agent in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg via Breath-Actuated Nebulizers (BAN) over 5-15 minutes&#xD;
      will provide a better pain relief in comparison to 1 mg/kg and 0.75 mg/kg doses or if the&#xD;
      lower doses are equally as effective.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients 18 years of age and older presenting to the ED with acute and chronic&#xD;
      painful conditions such as traumatic and non-traumatic abdominal, flank, back, or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain as well as exacerbation of chronic abdominal, musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      neuropathic pain with a score of 5 or more on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating&#xD;
      scale and requiring sub-dissociative dose ketamine analgesia, as determined by the treating&#xD;
      attending physician. Patients' screening and enrollment will be performed by study&#xD;
      investigators and research assistants. All patients will be enrolled at various times of the&#xD;
      day when study investigators will be available for patient enrollment and an ED pharmacist&#xD;
      will be available for medication preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Patients 18 years of age and older presenting to the ED with acute and&#xD;
      chronic painful conditions such as traumatic and non-traumatic abdominal, flank, back, or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain as well as exacerbation of chronic abdominal, musculoskeletal and&#xD;
      neuropathic pain with a score of 5 or more on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Altered mental status, allergy to ketamine, pregnant patients, weight&#xD;
      greater than 150 kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 or&gt;180 mm Hg, pulse&#xD;
      rate &lt;50 or &gt;150 beats/min, and respiration rate &lt;10 or &gt;30 breaths/min), inability to&#xD;
      provide consent, and past medical history of alcohol or drug abuse, or schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing analgesic efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of nebulized SDK administered at three different doses to patients presenting to&#xD;
      the ED of Maimonides Medical Center with acute and chronic painful conditions. Upon meeting&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized into one of three study arms based on&#xD;
      the dosing of the SDK: 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures: Each patient will be approached by a study investigator for&#xD;
      acquisition of written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
      Act authorization after being evaluated by the treating emergency physician and determined to&#xD;
      meet study eligibility criteria. When English will not be the participant's primary language,&#xD;
      a staff interpreter or licensed telephone interpreter would be used. Baseline pain score will&#xD;
      be determined with an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 to 10), described to the patient as&#xD;
      &quot;no pain&quot; being 0 and &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; being 10. A study investigator will record&#xD;
      the patient's body weight and baseline vital signs. The on-duty ED pharmacist will prepare a&#xD;
      breath-actuated nebulizer with doses of 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg according to the&#xD;
      predetermined randomization list, which will be created in SPSS (version 24; IBM Corp,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY) with block randomization of every 10 participants. The medication will be&#xD;
      delivered to the treating nurse in a blinded fashion and will be administered via&#xD;
      breath-initiated nebulization with a minimum time of 5 min and maximum time of 15 min up to&#xD;
      three doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 15, 30, 60,&#xD;
      90, and 120 minutes. If patients reported a pain numeric rating scale score of 5 or greater&#xD;
      and requested additional pain relief, a second (equivalent to the first dose) of SDK via BAN&#xD;
      will be administered to the patient in a blinded fashion. In situations when nebulized SDK&#xD;
      will fail to achieve acceptable (by patient) pain relief or patient will refuse to continue&#xD;
      nebulized SDK treatment, morphine at 0.1 mg/kg will be administered as a rescue analgesic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients' sex, demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, and vital signs and entered into SPSS (version 24.0; IBM Corp) by the&#xD;
      research manager. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent&#xD;
      acquisition for all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research&#xD;
      manager and statistician, who would work independent of any data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored for any change in vital sings and for adverse effects&#xD;
      during the entire study period (up to 2 h) by study investigators. Common adverse effects&#xD;
      that are associated with sub-dissociative dose ketamine are felling of unreality, dizziness,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, and sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data analyses will include frequency distributions, paired t-test to assess a&#xD;
      difference in pain scores within each group, and independent-sample t-test to assess&#xD;
      differences in pain scores between the 3 groups at the various intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed-model linear regression will be used to compare changes in pain numeric rating scale&#xD;
      across time points. This will compensate for participants lost to follow-up and allow all&#xD;
      patients' data to be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For categorical outcomes (eg, complete resolution of pain), a X2 or Fisher's exact test will&#xD;
      be used to compare outcomes at 30 minutes. Percentage differences and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals between the treatment groups will be calculated for all time points with P&lt;.05 to&#xD;
      denote statistical significance. Based on the validation of a verbally administered rating&#xD;
      scale of acute pain in the ED and the comparison of verbal and visual pain scales, we will&#xD;
      use a primary outcome consisting of a minimal clinically meaningful difference of 1.3 between&#xD;
      three groups at the 30-minute pain assessment.28,29&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Assuming an SD of 3.0, a power analysis determined that a repeated-measures&#xD;
      ANOVA with a sample size of 34 patients per group ( 102 total) will provide at least 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a difference of at least 1.3 at 30 minutes (as well as at any other interval&#xD;
      post-baseline), with an alpha=.05. To account for possible missing data the total sample size&#xD;
      will be 120 patients (40 per group).A pre-planned interim data analysis will occur upon&#xD;
      reaching a total of total of 60 patients ( 20) patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: The primary outcome will include a comparative reduction of pain scores on&#xD;
      numeric rating pain scale (NRS) between recipients of nebulized SDK at three different doses&#xD;
      at 30 minutes post-analgesic administration. The secondary outcomes will include a need for&#xD;
      second or third dose, a need for rescue analgesia at either 30 or 60 minutes and adverse&#xD;
      events in each group. With respect to unique adverse effects of SDK, we will use Side Effect&#xD;
      Rating Scale for Dissociative Anesthetics (SERSDA) and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale&#xD;
      (RASS) (ref) SERSDA Scale includes fatigue, dizziness, nausea, headache, feeling of&#xD;
      unreality, changes in hearing, mood change, general discomfort, and hallucinations with&#xD;
      severity of each graded by patients on a five-point scale, with &quot;0&quot; representing the absence&#xD;
      of any adverse effects and &quot;4&quot; representing a severely bothersome side effect. RASS evaluates&#xD;
      the severity of agitation and/or sedation in accordance to the nine-point scale with scores&#xD;
      ranging from &quot;-4&quot; (deeply sedated) to &quot;0&quot; (alert and calm) to &quot;+4&quot; (combative).&#xD;
