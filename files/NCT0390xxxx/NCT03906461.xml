    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, multicenter, post-market, single-arm, observational&#xD;
      study designed to characterize the usage of the Lesion Index (LSI) with the market-released&#xD;
      TactiCath Contact Force Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled (TactiCath SE) in subjects with&#xD;
      Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) in a real-word environment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize LSI achieved values for durable lesion&#xD;
      formation using the TactiCath SE catheter in the different anatomical regions around the&#xD;
      pulmonary veins (PVs) of the heart during RF ablation for the treatment of drug-refractory&#xD;
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the use of EnSite Automap and AutoMark module software settings,&#xD;
           including LSI threshold (OUS), contact force, time, power, flow, and AutoMark spacing&#xD;
           using the TactiCath SE catheter for RF ablation for the treatment of drug-refractory&#xD;
           PAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize LSI achieved values for lesions that reconnected versus those that were&#xD;
           durable, both in an acute procedural setting as well as in patients who undergo&#xD;
           additional ablations during the 12-month follow-up period after an index RF ablation&#xD;
           procedure for the treatment of drug-refractory PAF.&#xD;
