  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the standard of care for the detection of colorectal polyps and adenoma, and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer detection. Despite a meticulous evaluation of the colonic mucosa during&#xD;
      colonoscopy, a substantial number of colorectal polyps might be missed and colorectal cancer&#xD;
      might not be prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies described a 12-28% of miss-rate for all polyps, a 31% for hyperplastic&#xD;
      polyps and 6-27% for adenomas, with a higher miss rate noted for smaller polyps. The lesion&#xD;
      missing rate depends on several factors, such as the location on difficult areas to be&#xD;
      evaluated with conventional colonoscopes (the proximal side of the ileocecal valve, haustral&#xD;
      folds, flexures or rectal valves), a flat shape, an inadequate bowel preparation and&#xD;
      inadequate endoscopy technique, a time-limited colonoscope withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the standard 140º angle of view colonoscope is used approximately 13% of the colonic&#xD;
      surface is unevaluated. The incorporation of colonoscopes with a 170-degree wide angled could&#xD;
      improve adenoma detection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of high definition (HD) colonoscopes and visual image enhancement&#xD;
      technologies, such as narrow band imaging (NBI, Olympus America, Center Valley, PA), I-SCAN™&#xD;
      (Pentax Medical, Montvale, NJ) and Fuji Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE™, Fujinon&#xD;
      Endoscopy, Wayne, NJ) have improved the lesion characterization; however, several studies&#xD;
      have failed to prove an increase in the adenoma detection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Third Eye Retroscope (Avantis Medical Systems, Sunnyvale, CA) is a disposable retrograde&#xD;
      viewing device advanced through the accessory channel of a standard colonoscope. It allows&#xD;
      retrograde viewing behind colonic folds and flexures simultaneously with the forward view of&#xD;
      the colon. Although it shows an increase in the adenoma detection rate by 11%-25%, it has&#xD;
      many disadvantages. First, it requires a separate processor and the device is disposable,&#xD;
      increasing the cost of the procedure. Second, it occupies the working channel of the&#xD;
      colonoscope, limiting the ability to suction. Third, if a polyp is detected, the viewing&#xD;
      device has to be removed in order to perform the polypectomy. Fourth, the optic is not high&#xD;
      definition and finally, the endoscopist has to get used to visualizing and processing two&#xD;
      simultaneous video streams from the colonoscopy and from the retroscope device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Retroview™ (Pentax Medical, HOYA Co.) colonoscope has a short turning radius at the&#xD;
      colonoscope tip, that allows a retroflexed view of the colon during withdrawal. This might&#xD;
      allow the detection of polyps hidden behind flexures, folds, and valves, from the cecum to&#xD;
      the rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device offers many advantages, such as the ability to provide a high definition view of&#xD;
      the proximal aspects of colonic folds, flexures, and valves with no additional equipment or&#xD;
      device costs. The image quality is high definition and the colonoscope also incorporates the&#xD;
      I-SCAN technology. The suction/work channel of the colonoscope is available for therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures. Polypectomy can be performed with the colonoscope during retroflexion, without&#xD;
      losing view of the polyp. The only disadvantages are the higher consumed withdrawal time&#xD;
      because the additional retroflexed withdrawal to the standard withdrawal and that a small&#xD;
      portion of the colon is obscured by the shaft of the colonoscope in retroflexion that may be&#xD;
      the reason why combined standard withdrawal with retroflexed withdrawal has proved to be&#xD;
      better than retroflexed withdrawal alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determinate the polyp and adenoma detection rate via performing a&#xD;
      colonoscopy using a conventional scope with standard withdrawal (forward view) and a combined&#xD;
      forward and retroflexed withdrawal technique using the RetroView™ colonoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion's dimensions and characteristics will be recorded to determine a difference between&#xD;
      both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Setting: Instituto Ecuatoriano de Enfermedades Digestivas (IECED), Omni&#xD;
      Hospital Academic Tertiary Center. We will include patients from January 2019 to November&#xD;
      2019. The study protocol and consent form has been approved by the Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      of our institution and will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients&#xD;
      will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: endoscopic technique. Participants will be submitted to two colonoscopies on&#xD;
      the same day. First, a standard colonoscopy will be performed using a conventional HD&#xD;
      colonoscope with I-Scan (EC 3490LK, PENTAX, Montvale, NJ) that has a 13.2 mm tube diameter&#xD;
      and a total length of 2023 mm). Then a second procedure, combining the standard forward view&#xD;
      and retroflexed withdrawal will be performed using the Retroview™ colonoscope (EC34-i10TL,&#xD;
      Pentax Medical, Montvale, NJ), that has an 11.6 mm tube diameter and 2023 mm length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscopy images will be seen on a 27-inch, flat panel, HD LCD monitor (Radiance™&#xD;
      ultra-SC-WU27-G1520 model). All participants will have the same colonic preparation with 4&#xD;
      liters of polyethylene glycol (PEG) the day before and bowel preparation will be evaluated&#xD;
      using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two endoscopists with proficiency in retroflexed withdrawal will perform the colonoscopies.&#xD;
      Colonoscopies will be performed in a tandem, random manner. First one endoscopist will&#xD;
      perform the conventional colonoscopy using standard withdrawal technique with standard&#xD;
      colonoscopes and then the second endoscopist blinded to the first colonoscopy results will&#xD;
      perform the second colonoscopy with the Retroview scope and combination withdrawal&#xD;
      (retroflexed with standard withdrawal). The operator assigned to each colonoscopy will be&#xD;
      chosen randomly. A minimum withdrawal time of 10 minutes will be required for each procedure.&#xD;
      After the examination, endoscopist will fill a questionnaire describing each polyp and&#xD;
      adenoma found, including the size and location. The withdrawal time spent in each procedure&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Baseline characteristics will be analyzed using Chi-square o Fisher&#xD;
      Test for categorical variable and Mann-Whitney Test for continuous variables. If there is&#xD;
      more than one polyp in one patient it will be considered individually for statistical&#xD;
      purposes. A P value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All the&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed using R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations: The protocol will be performed in a single-center by six endoscopists. A lack of&#xD;
      a control group because the intention is to compare two endoscopic techniques in the same&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
