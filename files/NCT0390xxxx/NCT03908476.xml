  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to be effective for relieving intractable&#xD;
      chronic pain. However, a portion of patients who initially succeed with SCS will eventually&#xD;
      lose their therapeutic benefit. Reliable methods have not been identified for restoring&#xD;
      neuromodulation benefit to this underserved population, so additional research is required.&#xD;
      This study will prospectively observe subjects who utilize Abbott neurostimulation devices&#xD;
      after failing to sustain pain relief with their previous SCS system. The effectiveness of&#xD;
      Abbott systems in restoring neuromodulation benefit will be evaluated over the course of a&#xD;
      two-year follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the utility of Abbott neurostimulation devices for restoring&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit from neuromodulation therapy. These devices include programming the&#xD;
      BurstDR waveform in an enabled implantable pulse generator (IPG), and dorsal root ganglion&#xD;
      stimulation (Proclaim DRG). The BurstDR waveform offers a unique mechanism of action that may&#xD;
      explain why it can restore efficacy where tonic stimulation has failed. While all forms of&#xD;
      SCS activate the lateral pain pathway, which is responsible for the sensory aspects of pain,&#xD;
      only BurstDR has been shown to activate the medial pain pathway which is responsible for the&#xD;
      affective components. It is this medial activation that may allow BurstDR to succeed despite&#xD;
      psychological factors such as catastrophizing and depression. Additionally, it is possible&#xD;
      that BurstDR may be less susceptible to habituation because it more closely mimics natural&#xD;
      thalamic firing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several different methods of implementing BurstDR may be included in this investigation to&#xD;
      account for a range of possible existing systems and patient needs. It can be implemented by&#xD;
      reprogramming a BurstDR-capable device, connecting a BurstDR-capable IPG to existing leads&#xD;
      with an adapter or compatible header, or through full system replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While traditional SCS applies stimulation to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, DRG&#xD;
      stimulation targets a bundle of sensory nerve cell bodies just outside of the spinal cord&#xD;
      known as the dorsal root ganglion. This form of stimulation has been shown to make it easier&#xD;
      to achieve pain-paresthesia overlap, provide consistent stimulation irrespective of body&#xD;
      position, and produce paresthesia with a lower current than traditional SCS. Using DRG&#xD;
      stimulation as a replacement or supplement to SCS may ensure reliable coverage of the entire&#xD;
      painful area and improve pain outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first prospective investigation designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Abbott&#xD;
      neurostimulation devices for restoring pain relief in patients with waning or failed therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Adult Profile The PROMIS-29 is a 29-item profile instrument that covers 7 health domains (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and social function) with 4 questions each. The final item is an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale (NRS). Subjects should read each item and check the one box that most closely represents their response.&#xD;
Each item is scored on a scale from 1-5 with total scores for each domain ranging from 4-20. Greater scores represent more of whatever concept is being measured (e.g., depression or physical function). The scoring tables have been provided in the measure manual. Raw domain scores are converted to t-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The t-scores were validated on a sample from the general population and all items must be answered to utilize the scoring tables.</description>
