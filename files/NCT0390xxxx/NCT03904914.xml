      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accurate skeletal maturity assessment is important for prediction of curve progression and&#xD;
      clinical management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) including bracing decision and&#xD;
      counseling for prognosis. Determination of the timing of peak growth height velocity and&#xD;
      growth remaining are paramount important.1,2 Commonly used clinical or radiological methods&#xD;
      are still inadequate or too complex for rapid clinical use in the outpatient setting.3-5&#xD;
      Risser sign had disadvantages of low visibility in PA spinal radiograph, wide variability&#xD;
      with maturity level and imprecise representation of PHV timing.6 Greulich and Pyle atlas (GP&#xD;
      atlas) and Tanner-Whitehouse-III (TWIII) method are more reliable and comprehensive&#xD;
      classifications to predict maturity, but they are cumbersome and time consuming to be used&#xD;
      clinically.7 Both methods require the usage of an atlas, a learning curve required for exact&#xD;
      matching of atlas plate or assignment of scores to bones.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some latest skeletal maturity bone models were evolved trying to solve these problems but&#xD;
      were still imperfect.9 Recently, Sanders made modifications to TWIII method to form Skeletal&#xD;
      Maturity Scoring System (SMSS) which focused on epiphysis of small hand bones from all 5&#xD;
      digits. SMSS was proved to have excellent correlation with the curve acceleration phase.10&#xD;
      Digital skeletal age scores between 400 and 425 are associated with the beginning of the&#xD;
      curve acceleration phase in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.11 Excellent intra-observer&#xD;
      reliability and substantial inter-observer reliability among senior surgeons were&#xD;
      demonstrated in SMSS.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new skeletal age classification has yet to be developed, although SMSS has considered a&#xD;
      promising method. A recent study to test SMSS's reliability in less experienced staffs&#xD;
      demonstrated average inter-observer reliability (K=0.53).8 It showed that a learning curve&#xD;
      was present and several recommendations were added in each classification stage to avoid&#xD;
      controversy and confusion during usage.13 Therefore, using SMSS requires an organized&#xD;
      teaching system with detailed descriptions, self-assessment examinations, viewing&#xD;
      presentations and the newly added recommended modification guidelines to improve the&#xD;
      reliability. Another scoring system &quot;Distal Radius and Ulna (DRU)&quot; score simplified the&#xD;
      measurement to just using radial and ulnar epiphyses but results observed that DRU score had&#xD;
      the least correlation of &quot;Radio Ulna and Short bones&quot; (RUS) growth centers with scoliosis&#xD;
      behavior.9,10 In addition, the variable appearance of ulnar epiphysis were difficult to be&#xD;
      seen clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators introduce Thumb Ossification Classification Index (TOCI).&#xD;
      TOCI employed the measurements of epiphysis of distal phalange, proximal phalange, and&#xD;
      adductor sesamoid, and results were analyzed together to form a composite stage (composite&#xD;
      score) to predict maturity in patient at their peripubertal period. Ultimately the&#xD;
      application of TOCI should not be limited to IS patients only. After the establishment of&#xD;
      TOCI classification system, the staging system would be applied to radiographs from patients&#xD;
      without spinal deformity or suffering from diseases not related to spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure different bony features at hand bones and classify the bony features to TOCI&#xD;
           stages&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the TOCI system by comparing the measured TOCI stages with digital skeletal age&#xD;
           (DSA) and radio ulna and short bones (RUS) scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of TOCI system&#xD;
