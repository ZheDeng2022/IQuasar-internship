    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some T-cell lymphomas and leukemias do not respond to standard treatment. Researchers hope to&#xD;
      develop a treatment that works better than current treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if interleukin (IL-5) combined with avelumab is safe and effective for treating&#xD;
      certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with relapsed T-cell leukemias and lymphomas for which no standard&#xD;
      treatment exists or standard treatment has failed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy: A small needle will be inserted into the hipbone to take out a small&#xD;
           amount of marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or PET scans and MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the&#xD;
           body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs for 6 cycles of 28 days each. They will have a midline&#xD;
      catheter inserted: A tube will be inserted into a vein in the upper chest. They will get&#xD;
      IL-15 as a constant infusion over the first 5 days of every cycle. They will get avelumab on&#xD;
      days 8 and 22 of each cycle. They will be hospitalized for the first week of the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tests throughout the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another tumor biopsy if their disease gets worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans every 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible repeat MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another bone marrow biopsy at the end of treatment, if there was lymphoma in the bone&#xD;
           marrow before treatment, and they responded to treatment everywhere else.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they finish treatment, participants will have visits every 60 days for the first 6&#xD;
      months. Then visits will be every 90 days for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
      Visits will include blood tests and may include scans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature T-cell cancers are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of malignancies which&#xD;
      constitute 10-15% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Patients with relapsed/refractory T&#xD;
      cell lymphomas have limited therapeutic options, making new therapeutic approaches extremely&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory cytokine&#xD;
      that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and long-term CD8+&#xD;
      memory T-cells, has been assessed in several Phase 1 trials in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) fully human IgG1 antibody that inhibits&#xD;
      PD1/PD-L1 interactions while leaving the PD1/PD-L2 pathway intact and enhances immune&#xD;
      activation against tumor cells. It has received U.S. FDA accelerated approval for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other approved anti-PD-L1/PD1 antibodies, avelumab induces lysis of tumor cells via&#xD;
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), indicating an additional mechanism of&#xD;
      action. However, avelumab has not shown ADCC against normal immune cell subsets in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant number of T-cell malignancies express PD-L1, and since the anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      avelumab has shown ADCC activity in vitro, agents that may enhance ADCC by increasing number&#xD;
      and activity of Fc-binding effector cells such as rhIL15 could improve efficacy of avelumab&#xD;
      in these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL-15 administration in combination with standard&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) avelumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of &lt;= 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory T-cell lymphoma other&#xD;
      than adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL),&#xD;
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma T follicular helper phenotype (PTCL-TFH) and&#xD;
      enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single-center, non-randomized Phase 1 study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated rhIL-15 with fixed&#xD;
      dose avelumab with a small expansion cohort at the MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycle) of combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, the&#xD;
      accrual ceiling will be set at 30 patients.&#xD;

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the following T-cell leukemias/lymphomas: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma&#xD;
             (ATLL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma T&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of grade &gt; 1, with the exception of the&#xD;
             following: alopecia, sensory neuropathy grade less than or equal to 2, or other grade&#xD;
             less than or equal to 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigator's&#xD;
             judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting PD-1/PD-L1 Tcell&#xD;
             coregulatory proteins (immune checkpoints)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses less than or equal to 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known CNS involvement should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous malignant disease other than the target malignancy within the&#xD;
             last 5 years with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of any organ transplantation, including allogenic stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a live vaccine within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab. Vaccination with&#xD;
             a live vaccine while on trial is prohibited. NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for&#xD;
             injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal&#xD;
             influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist ) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to rhIL-15 or avelumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection requiring systemic therapy, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or refusal to practice effective contraception during therapy or the&#xD;
             presence of pregnancy or active breastfeeding. Based on its mechanism of action,&#xD;
             avelumab can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies&#xD;
             have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk&#xD;
             of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;

             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or history of any autoimmune disease, unrelated to their&#xD;
             malignancy, including asthma requiring chronic inhaled or oral corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             with history of asthma requiring mechanical ventilation; patients with a history of&#xD;
             mild asthma that are on or can be switched to non-corticosteroid bronchodilator&#xD;
             regimens are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular disease: Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease:&#xD;
             cerebral vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure&#xD;
             (greater than or equal to New York Heart Association Classification Class II), or&#xD;
             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
