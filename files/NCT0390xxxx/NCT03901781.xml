    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of ST266 given by non-invasive&#xD;
      intranasal trans-cribriform delivery to glaucoma suspect subjects with ocular hypertension,&#xD;
      optic nerve cupping, or family history of glaucoma.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is a dose escalating design in three (3) cohorts. In the first cohort,&#xD;
      subjects will be treated with ST266 delivered using a non-invasive trans-cribriform&#xD;
      intranasal delivery device daily for 14 days, in alternating single nostrils. If there are no&#xD;
      SAEs and no pattern of concern in the AE's, the Investigator may proceed to the second&#xD;
      cohort. In Cohort Two, subjects will be administered ST266 to each nostril daily for 14 days.&#xD;
      As with the first cohort, if there are no safety concerns, the investigator may move on to&#xD;
      the third cohort. In Cohort Three, subjects will be administered ST266 to each nostril daily&#xD;
      for 28 days. All subjects will be followed for 12 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
      ST266 will be administered by a health care professional trained to deliver ST266&#xD;
      intranasally. No efficacy data will be collected.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This clinical trial is a dose escalating design in three (3) cohorts of three (3) subjects per Cohort. In the first cohort, subjects will be administered ST266, delivered intranasally, at a dose of two hundred microliters (200 µL) daily for 14 days, in alternating single nostrils. After 14 daily treatments there is a seven (7)-day follow-up period. If there are no SAEs and no pattern of concern in the AE's, the Investigator may proceed to the second cohort of three (3) subjects. In Cohort Two, three (3) subjects will be administered 200 µL to each nostril daily (400 µL total per day) for 14 days. There will be a seven (7)-day follow-up. Like Cohort One, if there are no safety concerns, the investigator may move on to the third cohort of three (3) subjects. In Cohort Three, three (3) subjects will be administered 200 µL to each nostril daily (400 µL total per day) for 28 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Safety will be determined by comparing the results of the screening tests at baseline and again at the end of the treatment period through the end of study. Adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be recorded. The primary safety variable is the incidence of subjects with any adverse event during the entire study.</description>
