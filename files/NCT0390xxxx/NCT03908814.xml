      This is a phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of LDP in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      malignant tumors.&#xD;

      This trial is an open, dose escalation phase I clinical trial study of patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer who have failed standard treatment. The trial is divided into a dose escalation phase&#xD;
      and an expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 130 patients will be enrolled in this trial. The dose-increasing phase is about&#xD;
      30 cases, and the expansion stage is about 100 cases.&#xD;
