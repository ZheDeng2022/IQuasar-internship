  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, prospective, multicentric feasibility study assessing&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA PET-CT and 18F-FDOPA PET-CT to differentiate early recurrence from post-radiation&#xD;
      modifications in patients treated with radiotherapy for glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a MRI performed since the end of the radiotherapy until 12 months of follow up&#xD;
      after the end of radiotherapy, will be referred for both 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDOPA PET-CT,&#xD;
      whatever the conclusion of the MRI (post radiation modifications, relapse or doubtful MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of doing 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDOPA brain PET-CT in each case will be discussed in&#xD;
      detail with the referring physician and an informed consent will be taken from each patient&#xD;
      for the study. The two imaging studies will be done at least with a gap of 6 hours, using the&#xD;
      same PET-CT scanner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas are the most common primary intra-axial brain tumors arising from the glial cells.&#xD;
      The reference treatment consists in a surgical removal followed by radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Temozolomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of frequent recurrences after first-line therapy, an accurate neuroimaging is needed.&#xD;
      The reference anatomical modality is represented by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),&#xD;
      especially multimodal MRI (MRI with gadolinium injection associated with spectroscopy,&#xD;
      perfusion and diffusion). One of the particular goals of this imaging is to discriminate&#xD;
      recurrences after therapy from radiation-related complications, which can be challenging.&#xD;
      These last ones are side effects which turn out after radiotherapy, particularly when high&#xD;
      doses are delivered or if chemotherapy is associated. It can occur during the first 3 months&#xD;
      after radiotherapy as a subacute radiation related side effects and is then denominated&#xD;
      &quot;pseudo-progression&quot;, or after the first 3 months of completing radiotherapy as a later and&#xD;
      chronic inflammation radiation-related complication named radiation necrosis. It can display&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and imaging features which can mimic a relapse. Biopsy is the gold standard&#xD;
      but may be not feasible or inconclusive due to limited and non-representative sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional nuclear imaging usually completes the anatomical imaging in the oncological&#xD;
      response assessment, by providing further metabolic information. Many Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET) tracers have been studied such as 18F-FDG exploring glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      18F-FLT as a nucleoside analogue, and 18F-FDOPA, 18F-FET, 11C-MET which are radiolabeled&#xD;
      amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new promising PET radio-tracer is currently soaring. This is the Prostate Specific Membrane&#xD;
      Antigen (PSMA) radiolabeled with Gallium 68, a positron emitter, readily available because of&#xD;
      a &quot;homemade synthesis&quot;. The PSMA is a transmembrane glycoprotein over-expressed in prostate&#xD;
      adenocarcinomas&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies performed glioblastomas functional imaging based on this PSMA over expression.&#xD;
      All achieved to display glioblastomas with 68Ga-PSMA PET-scanner. A recent publication&#xD;
      performed on five patients compared 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG in the diagnostic value of&#xD;
      glioblastomas recurrence detection. 68Ga-PSMA showed better identification of recurrent&#xD;
      lesions owing to a higher target to background ratio. However the place of this new promising&#xD;
      tracer in the glioblastomas monitoring remains poorly documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a study reported that 18F-FDOPA was more accurate than 18F-FDG in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      brain tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, there are no findings concerning 68GA-PSMA and 18F-FDOPA&#xD;
      comparison in distinguishing glioblastomas recurrence from radiation-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the cost and availability of 68Ga-PSMA, if its performances were better than or&#xD;
      similar to 18F-FDOPA ones, it could tend to replace this last one in the future. Whether it&#xD;
      could be a surrogate to the 18F-FDOPA has not been elucidated yet, representing an&#xD;
      interesting challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility of using 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT to&#xD;
      distinguish recurrent glioblastomas from radiation-related complications, and its comparison&#xD;
      with 18F-FDOPA. This study will not allow a proper evaluation of the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, which will be performed in a next larger research after completion of this&#xD;
      preliminary phase.&#xD;
