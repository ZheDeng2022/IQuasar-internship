  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been recently shown to&#xD;
      result in a significant reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality. However, the utility of&#xD;
      LDCT screening in developing countries with high incidence of tuberculosis has not been&#xD;
      adequately studied. The investigators hypothesize that LDCT screening in tuberculosis endemic&#xD;
      regions is likely to yield a large proportion of false-positive results, especially in the&#xD;
      initial round of screening, posing a significant burden on the healthcare system. Herein, the&#xD;
      investigators assess the utility of LDCT and its cost-effectiveness in India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening for lung cancer may reduce lung cancer mortality by diagnosing the disease at an&#xD;
      early stage when it is treatable more effectively. There are several methods available for&#xD;
      screening of lung cancer. These include sputum cytology, chest radiography, computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) of the chest, and positron emission tomography (PET). However, sputum&#xD;
      cytology and chest radiography have been found to be ineffective as screening tests for lung&#xD;
      cancer as there is no reduction in lung cancer mortality. The use of CT or PET for lung&#xD;
      cancer screening may be associated with unacceptable levels of radiation exposure and&#xD;
      enormous cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest is a special type of CT, which uses&#xD;
      relatively low radiation exposure to create a low-resolution image of the entire thorax. The&#xD;
      radiation exposure associated with LDCT is 5-6 times less than that of a conventional CT scan&#xD;
      of the thorax. LDCT screening has been to shown to result in a 20% reduction in lung&#xD;
      cancer-specific mortality. Several national and international guidelines recommend this&#xD;
      strategy for lung cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these guidelines and recommendations by several organizations, lung cancer screening&#xD;
      has not been established in several developing countries, where a controversy arises due to&#xD;
      high rates of granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis. Emerging evidence indicates that&#xD;
      false positive results with LDCT in developing countries may not be unacceptably high as&#xD;
      previously believed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators intend to assess the utility of lung cancer screening using&#xD;
      low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in India, a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis.&#xD;
