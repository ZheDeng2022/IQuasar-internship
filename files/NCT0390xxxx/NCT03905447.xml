  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of pre-emptive treatment with an experimental drug PC945 in lung&#xD;
      transplant recipients whose lungs are infected by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PC945 may be useful in treating patients infected with Aspergillus fumigatus as, unlike the&#xD;
      usual treatments, it is inhaled into the lung and has been designed to stay there and treat&#xD;
      the infection. Participants will be monitored for up-to 12 weeks for the presence of&#xD;
      Aspergillus in their lungs. Suitable participants will receive PC945 for an initial 28 days&#xD;
      (Pre-emptive treatment phase) and, if needed, a further 8-weeks (Extended treatment&#xD;
      phase).The amount of fungus in the patients' lungs will be measured over the course of the&#xD;
      study. Participants with lung infections but not eligible for PC945 will be followed-up for&#xD;
      16-weeks on standard of care treatment. The study will take place at multiple sites in UK and&#xD;
      10 participants will receive PC945. The maximum study duration will be about 28 weeks.&#xD;
