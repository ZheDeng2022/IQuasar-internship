      Patients &gt;18 years of age presenting to Ohio State Wexner Medical Center Emergency department&#xD;
      with stroke symptoms, within 6 hours of last know well and found to have acute anterior&#xD;
      circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) will be included in this study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the differential expression of exosomal microRNAs in patients with&#xD;
      stroke due to acute LVO as compared to healthy controls. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      also evaluate the differential expression of exosomal microRNA in patients with good vs poor&#xD;
      collateral grade.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients aged &gt;18 years presenting to the Emergency Department at the Ohio State University&#xD;
      (OSU) Wexner Medical Center with acute ischemic stroke will be screened. The investigators&#xD;
      will include patients with anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke secondary to sudden&#xD;
      acute large vessel occlusion (LVO). Healthy subjects will be used as controls to assess&#xD;
      miRNAs specific to stroke population. Since hemodynamically significant preexisting stenosis&#xD;
      may result in alteration of miRNA expression, the investigators will exclude patients with&#xD;
      &gt;50% stenosis of internal carotid artery (ICA), &gt;50% stenosis of bilateral vertebral arteries&#xD;
      as well as patients with moderate to severe intracranial atherosclerotic disease as seen in&#xD;
      CT Angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck. To minimize confounders, patients with known&#xD;
      moderate to severe peripheral vascular disease or symptomatic coronary artery disease with&#xD;
      history of stent or coronary artery bypass graft will also be excluded. Prisoners and&#xD;
      Pregnant women will be excluded from this study as well.Differential expression of exosomal&#xD;
      microRNAs in patients with acute LVO compared to healthy controls will be evaluated. In&#xD;
      addition, a Neuroradiologist will grade the cerebral collateral circulation as (i) good or&#xD;
      (ii) poor, after carefully reviewing CTA and CT perfusion (CTP) studies in each patient using&#xD;
      validated collateral scoring method. Thirty patients with large vessel occlusion will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study in addition to 15 healthy controls (n=45). Blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
      at 4 different time points from symptom onset for each patient: (i) 0-6 hours, (ii) 6-12&#xD;
      hours, (iii) 12-24 hours and (iv) 5-7 days. Differential MiRNA expression will also be&#xD;
      evaluated between the patients with varying collateral grades&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the process of collateral maturation likely begins shortly after hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      induced by LVO, the investigators plan to collect the first sample within 0-6 hours. Three&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected during the first 24 hours to increase the chances of&#xD;
      capturing the miRNA expression profile at the beginning of the collateral remodeling process.&#xD;
      miRNA profiles of these patients will then be analyzed and compared to healthy volunteers. In&#xD;
      addition, comparison will be done between patients with good and poor cerebral collateral&#xD;
      grade.We will analyze the miRNA profiles of these patients using methods described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exosome Isolation and Characterization: Quantification of exosome number and size will be&#xD;
      carried out using a NanoSight NS300 (Nanosight, UK) at the OSU CCC Analytical Cytometry Core&#xD;
      as previously described. Briefly, exosomes will be isolated from cell-free plasma using Total&#xD;
      Exosome Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Exosomes&#xD;
      will be suspended in PBS buffer and stored at 4Â° C for up to 7 days. The exosome suspension&#xD;
      will then be diluted to achieve a working concentration between 2 x 108 - 8 x 108 for use in&#xD;
      the NanoSight NS300, after which exosomes will be counted and sized11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total RNA Isolation: Total RNA will be isolated from exosomes suspended in PBS using the&#xD;
      Circulating Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (Qiagen) as previously described12. DNA contamination&#xD;
      will be mitigated through use of Qiagen's RNase-free DNase set. RNA will be concentrated and&#xD;
      purified using the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NanoString Assay: The multiplexed nanoString nCounter miRNA system (nanoString Technologies)&#xD;
      at The Ohio State University CCC Genomics Shared Resource will be used for miRNA expression&#xD;
      profiling as described12. Total RNA (100ng) isolated from exosomes will be used as input&#xD;
      material. Small RNA samples will be prepared by ligating a specific DNA tag onto the 3'-end&#xD;
      of mature miRNAs according to manufacturer's instructions (nanoString Technologies). These&#xD;
      tags will normalize the melting temperatures of the miRNAs and provide identification for&#xD;
      each miRNA species in the sample. Excess tags will be washed away, and the resulting material&#xD;
      hybridized with miRNA:tag-specific nCounter reporter probes. Hybridized probes will then be&#xD;
      purified and immobilized on a streptavidin-coated cartridge using the nCounter Prep Station&#xD;
      (nanoString Technologies). The nCounter Digital Analyzer will be used to count individual&#xD;
      fluorescent barcodes and quantify miRNA molecules present in each sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      miRNA Expression Profile Normalization and Analyses: Quality control, normalization, and data&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using nSolver 2.0 Analysis Software (nanoString Technologies) as&#xD;
      previously described. Hierarchical clustering of miRNAs identified through the nanoString&#xD;
      query will be conducted using dChip (v 1.3) software. Differentially expressed miRNAs in&#xD;
      patients with good or poor collateral scores (as described above) will be defined by a&#xD;
      greater than or less than 2-fold change using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) assay with&#xD;
      a significance level of p&lt;0.05 and with correction for false discover rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT-PCR Validation of Exosomal miRNAs: Select miRNAs isolated from exosomes will be reverse&#xD;
      transcribed using the miRCURY LNA Universal cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon) according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocol as described previously. miRNAs will be quantified by real-time PCR&#xD;
      using ExiLENT SYBR Green (Exiqon) on a Mx3000P qPCR platform, with expression normalized to a&#xD;
      housekeeping reference (i.e. SNORD44).&#xD;
