    <textblock>
      Pathophysiological mechanisms leading to pulmonary hypertension (PH) are complex.&#xD;
      Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) can help us to study morphological alterations in&#xD;
      patients with PH. These CT morphometrics are useful to predict the degree of PH severity at&#xD;
      least in PH secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We hypothesized that&#xD;
      assessing lung perfusion using dual energy CT (DECT) can refine our knowledge on PH&#xD;
      pathophysiology and help to predict PH severity irrespective of its etiology&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious disease with poor prognosis and high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. It is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) above or&#xD;
      equal to 25 mmHg measured by right heart catheterization, which is an invasive technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the classification of PH and the&#xD;
      identification of pulmonary etiologies responsible for PH (chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis...) or signs of chronic thromboembolic PH&#xD;
      (CTEPH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative CT allows accurate analysis of the morphological changes found in PH and leading&#xD;
      to a better understanding of the complex interactions involved (arterial and bronchial&#xD;
      remodeling in PH secondary to COPD, inflammation etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energy CT acquisition has shown its interest in helping to diagnose pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
      It provides information on pulmonary perfusion by performing iodine mapping and measuring&#xD;
      pulmonary perfusion blood volume (PVB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project intends to study morphological and functional alterations at bronchial and&#xD;
      vascular levels in PH patients using quantitative DECT and to examine their impact to predict&#xD;
      existence and severity of PH irrespective of its etiology. To measure from DECT scan images,&#xD;
      cross sectional area of small pulmonary vessels (CSA), bronchial wall thickness (WT) and&#xD;
      pulmonary perfusion blood volume. To collect data from right heart catheterization,&#xD;
      echocardiography, pulmonary functional tests and blood tests. All these examinations will be&#xD;
      performed in routine care within a week after the patient is referred to our institution.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of these parameters could lead to a multivariate model able to predict&#xD;
      existence and severity of PH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, DECT allows the use of low energy (low Kilovoltage), which increases contrast&#xD;
      and improves segmentation of the pulmonary arteries. Thus, peripheral pulmonary arteries and&#xD;
      veins can be distinguishable in order to evaluate not just the sectional area of the small&#xD;
      pulmonary vessels but also 3D volume of small pulmonary arteries (VSA). This technical&#xD;
      modification would make it possible to refine the quantitative exploration of the vascular&#xD;
      compartment of PH&#xD;
