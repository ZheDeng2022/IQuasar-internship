  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of paclitaxel protein bound (also known&#xD;
      as nab-paclitaxel), gemcitabine, and cisplatin when given with high dose Ascorbic Acid will&#xD;
      be safe and effective in individuals with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C is a nutrient found in food and dietary supplements. It protects cells and also&#xD;
      plays a key role in making collagen (which provides strength and structure to skin, bones,&#xD;
      tissues and tendons). High-dose vitamin C may be given by intravenous (IV) infusion (through&#xD;
      a vein into the bloodstream) or orally (taken by mouth). When taken by intravenous infusion,&#xD;
      vitamin C can reach much higher levels in the blood than when the same amount is taken by&#xD;
      mouth. Some human studies of high-dose IV vitamin C in patients with cancer have shown&#xD;
      improved quality of life, as well as improvements in physical, mental, and emotional&#xD;
      functions, symptoms of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, and appetite loss. Intravenous&#xD;
      high-dose ascorbic acid has caused very few side effects in clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer continues to be a very lethal disease. It was estimated that in 2016,&#xD;
      53,070 Americans would be diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), and 41,780&#xD;
      would die from the disease. This makes pancreatic cancer the third leading cause of death&#xD;
      from cancer in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDA is the twelfth most common cancer in the world with 338,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012.&#xD;
      It is estimated that worldwide there will be &gt; 300,000 deaths from pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      Furthermore unfortunately PDA is projected to be the second leading cause of death from&#xD;
      cancer in the US by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of pancreatic cancer has notoriously been very late in the disease and therefore&#xD;
      the 5-year survival rate is only 8%, which is actually a slight improvement over the last few&#xD;
      years. Right now the only potential cure for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection (if the&#xD;
      disease is caught early). However only about 20% of PDA patients are eligible for potentially&#xD;
      curable resection and unfortunately most (&gt; 80%) have recurrence of their cancer within 2&#xD;
      years of resection, and those recurrences are almost universally fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it has been shown that there are regimens that actually improve survival for&#xD;
      patients with advanced stage IV PDA. Conroy and colleagues have developed the Folfirinox&#xD;
      regimen, which in a large randomized trial improved survival over gemcitabine as a single&#xD;
      agent. Von Hoff and colleagues developed the nanoparticle albumin (nab) associated paclitaxel&#xD;
      plus gemcitabine regimen which improved survival over single agent gemcitabine. Even more&#xD;
      recently Jameson and colleagues have presented a combined regimen of nab-paclitaxel +&#xD;
      gemcitabine + cisplatin in a small 24 patient phase Ib/II trial which showed a response rate&#xD;
      of 71% with 2 patients having complete response, a 1-year survival of 65% and a median&#xD;
      survival of 16+ months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there have been multiple investigators and investigations into the use of ascorbic acid&#xD;
      for patients with cancer (see ClinTrials.gov), its use has generally not been found to be of&#xD;
      help for patients particularly when given orally - e.g. 10 grams daily.&#xD;
