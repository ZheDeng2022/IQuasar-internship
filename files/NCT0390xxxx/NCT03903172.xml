      This study aims to examine whether use of an abdominal binder for postpartum patients after&#xD;
      vaginal delivery can effectively manage their pain and reduce the need for pharmacologic&#xD;
      analgesics. The investigators hypothesize that use of an abdominal binder will decrease&#xD;
      patient pain as reported on a visual analog scale of one to ten, and will decrease quantity&#xD;
      of pain medications given. The study will be conducted at the Berry Women's Center at Miami&#xD;
      Valley Hospital. Potential eligible participants will be approached regarding the study on&#xD;
      admission to labor and delivery. The investigators will recruit 130 participants that will be&#xD;
      randomized to two study arms, standard care and standard care plus abdominal binder with 65&#xD;
      participants in each study arm. Data will be collected prospectively while participants are&#xD;
      admitted, and through review of electronic medical records. Potential benefits of this study&#xD;
      include investigation of a cost-effective method for pain management that could improve&#xD;
      patient comfort and reduce need for medications.&#xD;

      Hypothesis Use of an abdominal binder postpartum after a vaginal delivery will be associated&#xD;
      with lower pain scores and reduced need for pharmacologic analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background A significant part of postpartum care involves management of patients' pain and&#xD;
      discomfort. Etiologies of this pain include perineal pain, incisional pain, uterine&#xD;
      involution pain, and pelvic girdle and lower back pain. Postpartum pain management primarily&#xD;
      focuses on the former three types of pain: perineal, incisional and uterine involution. In a&#xD;
      review of the management of postpartum pain, Eshkevari et al discuss several well-established&#xD;
      pain management strategies employed for postpartum patients, including ibuprofen and other&#xD;
      NSAIDs for uterine involution pain and inflammation; local anesthetics for perineal&#xD;
      lacerations or episiotomies; warm or cold compresses for perineal pain; and opioids for&#xD;
      post-operative or poorly controlled postpartum pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding management of pelvic girdle and lower back pain is scarce and the limited&#xD;
      literature available primarily focus on the pregnant patient. Different proposed treatment or&#xD;
      management strategies during pregnancy include physical therapy, targeted exercises,&#xD;
      acupuncture, NSAIDS and opioids. Approximately 25% of postpartum women endorse pelvic girdle&#xD;
      and/or lower back pain, and these types of pain can persist for as long as several weeks to&#xD;
      1-2 years after delivery. Therefore, management remains key for the postpartum patient as&#xD;
      well. The proposed pathophysiology behind pelvic girdle pain and lower back pain in the&#xD;
      context of pregnancy is widening of the pubic symphysis and increased laxity in the&#xD;
      sacro-iliac joints (SIJ) secondary to both biomechanical shear forces of increased weight&#xD;
      bearing and elevated levels of relaxin, a polypeptide hormone that increase laxity of&#xD;
      ligaments. A prospective study investigating the impact of abdomino-pelvic belts at different&#xD;
      positions on the laxity of the SIJ found that use of the abdomino-pelvic belt significantly&#xD;
      decreased mobility of the SIJ. Additionally, pelvic belts or abdominal binders may help&#xD;
      provide stability to muscles of the abdomen, back and spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies investigating the use of abdominal binders for pain management in post-operative&#xD;
      patients following both cesarean section and gynecologic surgery have had mixed results. A&#xD;
      randomized control trial examining impact of abdominal binders on patient reported pain and&#xD;
      symptom distress found no significant difference in pain on post-operative days one and two,&#xD;
      and the difference in distress on post-operative day two was no longer statistically&#xD;
      significant after correction for multiple measures. Another study involving gynecologic&#xD;
      surgery patients randomized to abdominal binder or control groups found that there was no&#xD;
      overall significant difference in morphine use or pain scale between the groups, and the&#xD;
      benefits were limited to a significant effect on post-operative ambulation for a subset of&#xD;
      patients with highest risk of complications: patients &gt; 50 years, cancer patients, and those&#xD;
      with vertical incision. In contrast, a more recent randomized controlled trial assessing&#xD;
      abdominal binders following cesarean delivery found that pain and symptom distress scores&#xD;
      were significantly lower at all time points in comparison to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common theme in the current literature regarding postpartum pain management is the need for&#xD;
      more research. In light of the current opioid abuse epidemic, which affects approximately 2.1&#xD;
      million people and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services declared a public health&#xD;
      emergency in 2017, there is a renewed emphasis utilizing non-opioid methods on pain control.&#xD;
      As a primary source of pain in the postpartum period is associated with musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pelvic discomfort, the use of a supportive abdomino-pelvic belt may be a non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      modality that could reduce pain and decrease narcotic requirements in postpartum patients. No&#xD;
      studies have directly assessed the effectiveness of abdominal binders on pain management in&#xD;
      postpartum patients. This study aims to examine how use of an abdominal binder might impact&#xD;
      postpartum pain, and the use of pharmacologic analgesia following vaginal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Patients admitted to Labor and Delivery will be evaluated for potential participation&#xD;
           in the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined below. If&#xD;
           appropriate to approach, eligible potential participants will be approached in their&#xD;
           labor and delivery room prior to delivery. If interested in participation, the Informed&#xD;
           Consent document will be presented and explained in the room to ensure privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Informed consent process will take place at the Berry Women's Center at Miami&#xD;
                Valley Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Written and signed consent will be obtained in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plans of obtaining informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Potential eligible participants will be approached in the labor and delivery room to&#xD;
           ensure privacy. The research assistant will provide and discuss an informed consent form&#xD;
           with the participant. The informed consent form will describe the project goals, length&#xD;
           and rational, as well as the types of PHI that will be collected. All participants who&#xD;
           agree to participate in the study will sign the informed consent form. All participants&#xD;
           will be provided with a copy of the signed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After signing informed consent, participants will be assigned to the intervention&#xD;
                or control group via block randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Those participants in the standard of care group will receive routine postpartum&#xD;
                care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Those participants in the intervention group will receive an abdominal binder in&#xD;
                addition to routine postpartum care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determination of appropriate binder size will be based on a visual assessment of&#xD;
                the patient's abdominal circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nursing staff will evaluate participant's pain level using a visual analog scale of&#xD;
                1-10 a minimum of every 4 hours. Patient reported pain score and pain location will&#xD;
                be recorded in the participant's electronic medical record. These processes do not&#xD;
                deviate from current standards of care and documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional non-pharmacologic pain relief measures utilized by patients will be&#xD;
                documented on the data collection sheet attached to the patient's chart. These&#xD;
                measures include heating pad, ice pack, and tucks pads&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All medications received will be documented in the electronic medical record per&#xD;
                usual documentation protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size Estimation &amp; Data Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample size was estimated using G*Power. In order to detect a difference between&#xD;
                groups on pain scores and use of pain medications, 65 patients per group will need&#xD;
                to be enrolled. This will enable the investigators to detect a moderate difference&#xD;
                (i.e., medium effect size) between the groups with a power = 80% and p at &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The two groups will be compared for 1. reported pain scores (assessed by nursing&#xD;
                staff and documented in the EMR) and for 2. pain medications used (morphine&#xD;
                equivalent as recorded in the MAR) for the duration of patients' hospital stay.&#xD;
                T-test will be used to compare the groups on average pain scores and total pain&#xD;
                medication use. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to determine&#xD;
                differences between the groups over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prospective data collection with hard copy data entry form that includes PHI for&#xD;
                participant identification, basic demographic information, delivery information&#xD;
                (see separate document), non-pharmacologic pain relief measures used&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Electronic medical record review for: pain scores, pain location, medications&#xD;
                received&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain score immediately postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain scores (average scores) on PPD#0 and PPD#1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient reported pain locations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quantity (total) of non-narcotic pain medication received on PPD#0 and PPD#1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quantity (total) of narcotic pain medication received on PPD#0 and PPD#1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allergic reaction to fabric of abdominal binder&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Skin irritation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increased discomfort or pain with use of abdominal binder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mitigation of risks o If participants experience an allergic reaction or skin irritation&#xD;
           from the abdominal binder symptomatic treatment will be offered. Participants in the&#xD;
           experimental arm will be encouraged to keep the abdominal binders in place for 24 hours&#xD;
           postpartum, but will be permitted to remove the abdominal binder at any time should it&#xD;
           cause irritation, increased pain or any other adverse reaction.&#xD;
