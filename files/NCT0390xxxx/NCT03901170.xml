      Letrozole (Femara), is an aromatase inhibitor which is used in the treatment of&#xD;
      hormonally-responsive breast cancer after surgery. It is a good target for selective&#xD;
      inhibition because estrogen production is a terminal step in the biosynthetic sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aromatase inhibitors are widely used as adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with breast cancer. They have been used off-label in the treatment of patients for increasing&#xD;
      the number of ovarian follicles recruited in ovulatory women undergoing controlled ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation (COH). A shorter half-life (48 hours) which would predict a lower risk of&#xD;
      teratogenicity. No direct antiestrogenic adverse effects on the endometrium, due to an&#xD;
      absence of peripheral estrogen receptor blockade and the shorter half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ovarian normal responders, instead of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), luteal support&#xD;
      with exogenous progesterone supplementation is the standard protocol for patients who&#xD;
      received fresh embryo transfer for avoiding the risk of OHSS. In other normal responders who&#xD;
      have increasing risk of OHSS, the strategy of freezing all embryos are more favored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, high estrogen-induced endometrial gland cells apoptosis might account&#xD;
      for the defective endometrial receptivity in women with excessively high estrogen&#xD;
      concentrations after ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF cycles. Since letrozole can reduce the&#xD;
      serum level of estrogen due to its pharmacological properties, which in turn reduces the&#xD;
      adverse effects of high estrogen on the endometrium and improve the endometrial receptivity&#xD;
      for embryo implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that infertility patients will receive short-term oral&#xD;
      administration of letrozole (2.5 mg/tab) once a day when estrogen is elevated in the late&#xD;
      stage of ovulation stimulation when receiving ovulation stimulation for two to three days.&#xD;
      And transvaginal ultrasound was performed every two to three days for growth of ovarian&#xD;
      follicles until two days before oocyte retrieval. Observing whether taking the drug can&#xD;
      improve the maturity of the oocyte, pregnancy rate, implantation rate, miscarriage rate,&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate of the fresh embryo transfer cycle.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Letrozole, sold under the brand name Femara among others, is an aromatase inhibitor which is&#xD;
      used in the treatment of hormonally-responsive breast cancer after surgery. Aromatase is a&#xD;
      microsomal cytochrome P450 hemoprotein-containing enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting&#xD;
      step in the production of estrogens: the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone via&#xD;
      three hydroxylation steps to estrone and estradiol, respectively. It is a good target for&#xD;
      selective inhibition because estrogen production is a terminal step in the biosynthetic&#xD;
      sequence. Aromatase activity is present in many tissues, including the ovaries, brain,&#xD;
      adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and breast. The investigators use letrozole as routine for&#xD;
      patients of breast cancer who want to keep chance of fertility in the future before receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy which may do damage to their ovarian function. After they complete the treatment&#xD;
      protocol of breast cancer, they can practice the fertility plan with these frozen embryos or&#xD;
      oocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aromatase inhibitors are widely used as adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with breast cancer. They have been used off-label in the treatment of patients for increasing&#xD;
      the number of ovarian follicles recruited in ovulatory women undergoing controlled ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation (COH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A shorter half-life (48 hours) which would predict a lower risk of teratogenicity. No direct&#xD;
      antiestrogenic adverse effects on the endometrium, due to an absence of peripheral estrogen&#xD;
      receptor blockade and the shorter half-life. In a previous report, the addition of letrozole&#xD;
      to gonadotropins (compared with gonadotropins alone) during IVF resulted in a greater number&#xD;
      of oocytes and blastocysts, similar pregnancy rates, and no increased risk of ovarian&#xD;
      hyperstimulation syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the current guidelines for the treatment course of IVF in NTUH (National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital), fresh embryo transfer (ET) cycle is considered for patients who have&#xD;
      poor ovarian response because of its low risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).&#xD;
      Patients who have high response to ovarian stimulation with freezing all the embryos should&#xD;
      be the best policy for avoiding high risk of OHSS and have the advantage of increasing the&#xD;
      cumulative pregnancy rate. For ovarian normal responders, instead of hCG, luteal support with&#xD;
      exogenous progesterone supplementation is the standard protocol for patients who received&#xD;
      fresh embryo transfer for avoiding the risk of OHSS. In other normal responders who have&#xD;
      increasing risk of OHSS, the strategy of freezing all embryos are more favored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study had shown that in the population of ovarian normal responder, the&#xD;
      cryopreservation group has a higher clinical pregnancy rate per ET transfer (84% vs 54.7%)&#xD;
      compared to fresh ET group. The implantation rates were 70.8% and 38.9%, respectively. The&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancy rates per transfer (at 10 weeks' gestation) were 78.0% and 50.9%,&#xD;
      respectively. The attributable risk percentage of implantation failure due to reduced&#xD;
      endometrial receptivity in the fresh group was 64.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estrogen serum level is about 200~300pg/mL in a normal menstrual period. In previous&#xD;
      studies, high estrogen-induced endometrial gland cells apoptosis might account for the&#xD;
      defective endometrial receptivity in women with excessively high estrogen concentrations&#xD;
      after ovarian hyperstimulation in IVF cycles. Since letrozole can reduce the serum level of&#xD;
      estrogen due to its pharmacological properties, which in turn reduces the adverse effects of&#xD;
      high estrogen on the endometrium and improve the endometrial receptivity for embryo&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In IVF cycles, the data regarding coadministration of gonadotropins and letrozole for 5 days&#xD;
      (days 2-6 or 3-7) in normal and high responders are quite limited. Favorable outcomes related&#xD;
      to letrozole have been reported, including lower doses of gonadotropin consumed which&#xD;
      decreased the cost of the IVF and increased the number of oocytes and mature oocytes while&#xD;
      achieving the same pregnancy rate compared with conventional stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that infertility patients will receive short-term oral&#xD;
      administration of letrozole (2.5 mg/tab) once a day when estrogen is elevated in the late&#xD;
      stage when receiving ovulation stimulation for two to three days. Other follow-up&#xD;
      examinations and general IVF treatments are exactly the same with control group, that is, the&#xD;
      whole course of treatment takes about two to three days. Blood test is taken four to five&#xD;
      times to check the concentration of hormones: including estrogen, luteinizing hormone,&#xD;
      follicle stimulating hormone, progesterone, etc. (about 5 cc each time) And transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound was performed every two to three days for growth of ovarian follicles until two&#xD;
      days before oocyte retrieval. Observing whether taking the drug can improve the maturity of&#xD;
      the oocyte, pregnancy rate, implantation rate, miscarriage rate, ongoing pregnancy rate and&#xD;
      live birth rate of the fresh embryo transfer cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first endpoint of our study was to demonstrate higher implantation rates, pregnancy&#xD;
      rates, ongoing pregnancy rates and live birth rates in the group of using letrozole. The&#xD;
      second endpoint: the investigators want to discover the cut-off value for upper limit of&#xD;
      estrogen serum level in fresh ET cycle which does not make significant difference in&#xD;
      pregnancy rate between natural estrogen level and in letrozole cycle.&#xD;
