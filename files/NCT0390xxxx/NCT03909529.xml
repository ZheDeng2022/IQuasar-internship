      An open label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period,&#xD;
      crossover oral drug-drug interaction study of spironolactone (perpetrator) and Digoxin&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Drug interaction studies between spironolactone and digoxin, particularly studies in which&#xD;
      digoxin was administered intravenously (Waldorf, S 1978; Fenster, P.E. 1984), indicate that&#xD;
      spironolactone may decrease the renal clearance of digoxin by 18-25%, and increase the (area&#xD;
      under curve) AUC of digoxin by 35-44%. Although the radioimmunoassay used in the study may be&#xD;
      confounded, these results suggest that inhibition of P-gp in the renal proximal tubules may&#xD;
      be possible. To account for possible renal P-gp inhibition, subjects in the test group will&#xD;
      be pretreated with spironolactone for about 5 days to allow accumulation of some of the&#xD;
      metabolites which have a long half-life (e.g., canrenone ~33 hours) and continue to be&#xD;
      treated with spironolactone while digoxin is renally eliminated from the body. Based on this&#xD;
      assessment, the FDA suggested study design is Treatment A: Single dose of digoxin alone.&#xD;
      Treatment B: Digoxin + Spironolactone; Day 1- 9: Spironolactone quarter die (QD) dose; Day 6:&#xD;
      Digoxin single oral dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, digoxin has a long half-life of 1.5-2 days, and the Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling&#xD;
      scheme of up to 72 hours may not be enough to characterize the elimination kinetics of&#xD;
      digoxin. Hence, the plasma concentrations of digoxin up to 96 hours (4 days) postdose is&#xD;
      considered This will allow you to detect possible differences in the clearance of digoxin&#xD;
      mediated by an interaction with P-gp in the renal proximal tubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also involves collecting urine samples and measuring renal clearance (CLR) and&#xD;
      unchanged drug excreted in urine (fe) for digoxin.&#xD;
