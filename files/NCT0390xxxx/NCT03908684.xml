  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective in this study is to identify an optimal ultrasound spectroscopy parameter that&#xD;
      can be used as an early predictor of pathological complete or partial response in men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer and men and women with rectum and head and neck cancers receiving treatment&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously demonstrated that high-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy, and recently&#xD;
      conventional-frequency ultrasound and spectroscopy may be used to detect cell death in vitro,&#xD;
      in situ and in vivo. The method can detect different forms of cell death and has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be sensitive to apoptotic, necrotic and mitotic cell death. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to evaluate the use of ultrasound imaging and spectroscopy as a predictive&#xD;
      marker of advanced tumour response to radiotherapy. Since radiation treatments may also act&#xD;
      on tumour vasculature to &quot;normalize&quot; it we will also evaluate blood-vessel imaging by&#xD;
      standard Doppler-imaging and with standard higher-resolution imaging using clinically&#xD;
      approved microbubble contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal, as described above, is to select the best ultrasound spectroscopy parameter to&#xD;
      use as an early predictor of pathological complete response&#xD;
