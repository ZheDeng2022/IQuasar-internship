  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effective dose of moxidectin to treat human scabies is not known. This study aims to&#xD;
      provide proof of concept that a single dose of moxidectin is effective in eliminating the&#xD;
      scabies parasite in humans and to enable the determination of an optimal dose of moxidectin&#xD;
      for treatment of scabies for further clinical studies.&#xD;
