  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healing of the Apicomarginal defects will be checked by comparing 2 groups . In first group&#xD;
      amniotic membrane will be applied over the defect before flap closure during surgery and in&#xD;
      second group no GTR material will be applied. Healing of the lesions will also be compared 2&#xD;
      dimensionaly and 3 dimensionaly using CBCT&#xD;

      Study Title: - To evaluate the efficacy of guided tissue regeneration in the healing of&#xD;
      periapical defects with periodontal communication: A randomized controlled trial with 3D&#xD;
      analysis using CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: - Healing of lesions with apicomarginal defects is often less satisfactory.&#xD;
      Various studies and case reports have reported high success rate with the use of guided&#xD;
      tissue regeneration technique. Only few clinical trials have evaluated the effect of guided&#xD;
      tissue regeneration on the healing of apicomarginal defects. To best of our knowledge only&#xD;
      two studies have conducted randomized controlled trial. However, no study has used CBCT for&#xD;
      the assessment of healing in such type of lesions. So, this is the first randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial studying the effect of guided tissue regeneration in the healing of&#xD;
      periapical defects with periodontal communication using 3D radiological evaluation using&#xD;
      CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim &amp; Objectives: - 1. To evaluate the difference in the healing outcome of periapical&#xD;
      defects with periodontal communication with or without the use of guided tissue regeneration&#xD;
      technique 2. To evaluate the difference in the healing outcome derived from the assessment of&#xD;
      2D periapical radiographs and 3 D CBCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: - Study will be conducted in Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak in&#xD;
      the department of Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: - A randomized controlled trial Time Frame: - 12 to 18 months Population /&#xD;
      Participants: - Patients of age 16 years (male/female) and above will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: - Patients of age 16 years and above, Patients with no general medical&#xD;
      contraindications for oral surgical procedures (ASA-I and ASA-II according to the&#xD;
      classification of the American Society of Anesthesiologist's, periapical defect with&#xD;
      periodontal communication, periodontal pocket &gt;6mm with apicomarginal communication confined&#xD;
      to buccal aspect of interproximal space or mid buccal aspect of the root ., -ve response to&#xD;
      vitality test, failed previous root canal treatment with purulent discharge or failed&#xD;
      previous surgery or recurrent episode of purulent discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: -Presence of buccal bone on flap elevation, Unrestorable tooth, fractured&#xD;
      /perforated roots, smokers, pregnant females and lactating mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: - 30 patients (15 patients in each group) Methods: - Diagnosis of the lesion&#xD;
      will be made clinically and radiographically, vitality will be checked by EPT, preoperative&#xD;
      clinical evaluation will include, clinical attachment level, gingival marginal position and&#xD;
      pocket depth. Marginal bone loss, width of bony crypt, height of the bony crypt, depth of the&#xD;
      crypt and height of the buccal bone plate (if present) will be measured radiographically and&#xD;
      at the time of surgery. Surgical procedures will be carried out under operating microscope&#xD;
      with 8 Ã— 16 magnification by the standardized treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: - Follow up of patients will be carried out at 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 months and&#xD;
      outcome measures will be assessed clinically by absence of signs and symptoms and 2&#xD;
      dimensionally using radiographs by Rud and Molven criteria for periapical healing and 3&#xD;
      dimensionaly using CBCT by modified PENN criteria at 12 months follow up for periapical&#xD;
      healing and buccal bone level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical method: - The data will be entered into Microsoft Excel and analysed using SPSS&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Science) package for relevant statistical comparison.&#xD;
      Distribution of data into normal and non-normal will be done by Kolmogorov-Smir-Nov test. If&#xD;
      the data will be normal then student T test and paired T test will be applied for unpaired&#xD;
      and paired data respectively. For categorical data Chi - square test will be applied. The&#xD;
      interobserver analysis will be done by cohen kappa analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the data will be non-normal then Mann - Whitney and Wilcoxon rank sum test will be applied&#xD;
      for unpaired and paired data respectively. For categorical data Chi - square test will be&#xD;
      applied. The interobserver analysis will be done by cohen kappa analysis.&#xD;
