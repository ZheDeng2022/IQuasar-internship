    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the trial are to assess the efficacy, clinical safety and&#xD;
      tolerability parameters of PRO 140 in combination with failing ART during the initial&#xD;
      one-week treatment period, and in combination with Optimized Background Therapy during the&#xD;
      subsequent 24-week treatment period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRO 140, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for treatment&#xD;
      experienced adult HIV-1 patients infected with CCR5-tropic virus. These patients must&#xD;
      demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy and have&#xD;
      documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to at least one ART drug within three drug&#xD;
      classes (or within two or more drug classes with limited treatment option). The options may&#xD;
      be limited as a result of drug antiviral class cross-resistance, documented treatment&#xD;
      intolerance, documented objective assessments such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (e.g.&#xD;
      high creatinine at baseline, limiting treatment options due to potential for toxicity), past&#xD;
      adverse reactions such as hypersensitivity reactions or neuropsychiatric issues that could&#xD;
      limit use of currently approved drugs. Study population includes treatment-experienced&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus who demonstrates evidence of HIV-1 replication&#xD;
      despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented genotypic or phenotypic resistance to&#xD;
      ART drugs within three drug classes (or within two drug classes with limited treatment&#xD;
      option). The primary objectives of the trial are to assess the efficacy, clinical safety and&#xD;
      tolerability parameters of PRO 140 in combination with failing ART during the initial&#xD;
      one-week treatment period, and in combination with Optimized Background Therapy during the&#xD;
      subsequent 24-week treatment period.&#xD;
