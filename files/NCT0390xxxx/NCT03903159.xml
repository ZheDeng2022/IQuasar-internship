  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is development of the Positive Peer Journaling (PPJ)&#xD;
      intervention and the feasibility, acceptability, and logistics of treatment delivery. A&#xD;
      second objective is to observe whether PPJ is associated with improvement in hypothesized&#xD;
      outcomes. The primary outcomes the investigators will examine are enhanced treatment&#xD;
      retention and reduced recurrence of substance use. The investigators will also explore the&#xD;
      association between the intervention and a set of hypothesized mediators of the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on outcomes, e.g., improvement in mood and satisfaction with recovery.&#xD;

    <description>PPJ is a journaling practice to support addiction recovery. PPJ encourages past 24 hour review and upcoming 24 hour planning to improve quality of life in recovery and reduce relapse. PPJ uses standard lined journals with column headings under which individuals make bullet-pointed lists. On the left hand page, past 24 hours is recalled, itemizing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; things that happened and things for which one is grateful. Wishes for others are also expressed on this page. On the right hand page, values-based activities for the upcoming 24 hours are planned via headings representing valued life domains such as &quot;recovery,&quot; &quot;work/school,&quot; &quot;spirituality,&quot; &quot;home and household,&quot; and &quot;health.&quot;</description>

Positive Peer Journaling (PPJ): PPJ is a journaling practice to support addiction recovery. PPJ encourages past 24 hour review and upcoming 24 hour planning to improve quality of life in recovery and reduce relapse. PPJ uses standard lined journals with column headings under which individuals make bullet-pointed lists. On the left hand page, past 24 hours is recalled, itemizing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; things that happened and things for which one is grateful. Wishes for others are also expressed on this page. On the right hand page, values-based activities for the upcoming 24 hours are planned via headings representing valued life domains such as &quot;recovery,&quot; &quot;work/school,&quot; &quot;spirituality,&quot; &quot;home and household,&quot; and &quot;health.&quot;</description>
