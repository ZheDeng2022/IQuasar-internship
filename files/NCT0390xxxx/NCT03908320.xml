  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quitlines are efficient and cost-effective treatments for smoking cessation, yet little&#xD;
      research has explored how to personalize and optimize quitline services for women. The goal&#xD;
      of this project is to explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a quitline&#xD;
      intervention that considers the menstrual cycle as compared to standard care for cessation.&#xD;
      If funded, the results of this study will directly inform future research on quitline smoking&#xD;
      cessation interventions for premenopausal women, including a full scale clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although more than 75% of women who smoke want to quit, they do not have the same success&#xD;
      that men have. This is of particular concern as premenopausal women smokers are more likely&#xD;
      to experience smoking-related morbidity and mortality than men smokers. Further, mothers are&#xD;
      the primary source of secondhand smoke exposure in children. Quitlines are broad reaching,&#xD;
      cost-effective programs that disseminate smoking cessation treatment; however, little&#xD;
      research has focused on tailoring quitline programs for women. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate how the quit interventions can be informed by the menstrual cycle to improve&#xD;
      cessation outcomes in women. This study will enroll 116 women between 18-40 years of age from&#xD;
      the Arizona Smokers' Helpline. Menstrual phase identification will be determined using&#xD;
      methods from published recommendations. Consistent with existing quitline protocols,&#xD;
      participants will receive 4-weeks of NRT (patch) concurrent with six-weeks of telephone-based&#xD;
      behavioral coaching. Data will be collected at Baseline, Week 0 (quit day), Week 1, Week 4&#xD;
      (end of treatment), and a follow-up at Month 3 using telephone interviews, validated&#xD;
      questionnaires, and dried blood spots (to measure sex hormones to verify menstrual phase and&#xD;
      cotinine to verify smoking status). Primary outcomes include determining acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of this menstrual-cycle based intervention (recruitment and retention rate, the&#xD;
      ability to correctly identify the menstrual phase, and overall participant study&#xD;
      satisfaction). Smoking cessation outcomes (self-report and/or biochemically verified) will be&#xD;
      assessed at Week 1, Week 4 (end of treatment), and at Month 3 follow-up. Finally, we will&#xD;
      explore menstrual phase differences in theoretically-relevant factors known to be associated&#xD;
      with smoking cessation (e.g., social support, weight concerns, urge coping). Study results&#xD;
      will guide protocol development and generate hypotheses for larger-scaled randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. This study is novel and pragmatic, integrating emerging evidence for the&#xD;
      role of menstrual-cycle timed quit dates with state-of-the-science quitline cessation&#xD;
      programs. If successful, this model can be cost-effectively replicated within state and&#xD;
      national quitline programs. It can address the unique barriers to smoking behavior change&#xD;
      among premenopausal women, increase successful quit outcomes and reduce disease risk&#xD;
      associated with high tobacco-related morbidity rates.&#xD;
