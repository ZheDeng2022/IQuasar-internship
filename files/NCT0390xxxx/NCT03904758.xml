  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostics of extraesophageal reflux (EER) is challenging. Currently, 24-h dual-probe&#xD;
      esophageal pH monitoring or impedance is considered the best diagnostic method for EER. The&#xD;
      24-h oropharyngeal pH monitoring is a newer method aimed at detecting episodes of reflux to&#xD;
      the oropharynx. Unfortunately, all these methods have many disadvantages. Pepsin detection in&#xD;
      saliva would be an almost ideal diagnostic technique. However, data of its reliability is&#xD;
      lacking. The aim of the study is to compare results of oropharyngeal pH monitoring and&#xD;
      esophageal impedance monitoring, compared to a quantified pepsin presence in the saliva&#xD;
      obtained immediately prior to 24-hour monitoring and to evaluate the feasibility of this&#xD;
      technique as a routine option of diagnosing the presence of extraesophageal reflux.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extraesophageal reflux (EER) has recently been found to be a risk factor for many head and&#xD;
      neck pathologies. Many studies have shown that contact between the refluxed content and&#xD;
      mucous tissue can cause local inflammation and edema and thus facilitate the development of&#xD;
      inflammation. Although important, the diagnostics of EER is not easy. The simplest means of&#xD;
      collecting information about reflux problems is questioning potential sufferers. However,&#xD;
      although many questionnaires have been developed over the last few years, questioning is&#xD;
      still not a suitable technique for the evaluation of EER, the reason being that symptoms of&#xD;
      EER are heterogeneous and very common. Currently, 24-h dual-probe esophageal pH monitoring or&#xD;
      impedance is considered the best diagnostic method for EER. The 24-h oropharyngeal pH&#xD;
      monitoring is a newer method aimed at detecting episodes of reflux to the oropharynx and&#xD;
      seems to generate similar results. However, these methods may not be tolerated well.&#xD;
      Moreover, the position of the sensor, which is placed in the hypopharynx or oropharynx, does&#xD;
      not precisely reflect the amount of reflux content that reaches larynx, nasopharynx, nasal&#xD;
      cavity or middle ear. Another disadvantage of pH monitoring is that it enables only a&#xD;
      short-term analysis over a timespan of just 24-48 h. Detection of pepsin in fluids and&#xD;
      tissues is considered by some authors to be perhaps more appropriate than pH monitoring&#xD;
      because it reflects the long-term effects of EER and proves that EER is truly affecting the&#xD;
      examined region. This is particularly true for more distant regions like the middle ear.&#xD;
      Pepsin detection in saliva would be very well tolerated and fast diagnostic method. However,&#xD;
      data of its reliability are lacking. The aim of the study is to compare results of&#xD;
      oropharyngeal pH monitoring and esophageal impedance monitoring, compared to a quantified&#xD;
      pepsin presence in the saliva obtained immediately prior to 24-hour monitoring and to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of this diagnostic option as a routine method.&#xD;
