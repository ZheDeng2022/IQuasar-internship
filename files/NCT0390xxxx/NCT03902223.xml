  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is an unblended randomized screening trial will have consecutive patients with&#xD;
      no suggestion of cardiac sarcoidosis according to usual screening enroll in an enhanced&#xD;
      screening protocol. The routine clinical care is to gather patient's history of symptoms and&#xD;
      under go an ECG. If a patient has an abnormal results in standard screening, they typically&#xD;
      have further evaluations as part of their routine medical care. These tests might include an&#xD;
      echocardiogram, ambulatory ECG, and advanced cardiac imaging (MRI, PET scan as per local&#xD;
      practice). A patient that has normal results on standard screening will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to enhanced screening at each center. Half the patients will be randomized to usual follow-up&#xD;
      (annual symptom assessment and ECG) and the other half will be assigned to the enhanced&#xD;
      screening (echocardiogram and ambulatory ECG at enrollment and at 24 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that screening using conventional history, physical and ECG in&#xD;
      the general sarcoidosis population, followed by appropriate advanced imaging testing, will&#xD;
      result in the identification of a higher percentage of ascertained cardiac sarcoidosis than&#xD;
      has been reported historically (2-5%). The investigators hypothesize that routine use of&#xD;
      echocardiogram with strain and ambulatory ECG will identify additional patients who will have&#xD;
      advanced imaging abnormalities or who meet criteria for cardiac sarcoidosis. The&#xD;
      investigators further hypothesize that re-screening patients after 24 months with repeat&#xD;
      echocardiogram and ambulatory ECG will identify additional patients with suspicion for&#xD;
      cardiac sarcoidosis who had no abnormalities on the standard screening tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac involvement is among the most feared complications of sarcoidosis, and it is the&#xD;
      second leading cause of death from sarcoidosis. Autopsy studies and serial imaging studies in&#xD;
      patients without cardiac symptoms suggest that approximately 25% of U.S. sarcoidosis patients&#xD;
      have evidence of cardiac involvement. 3 Major manifestations of cardiac sarcoidosis include&#xD;
      conduction delays, dysrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy. Given the increased recognition of&#xD;
      cardiac involvement, prompt screening and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis has been&#xD;
      emphasized as a key priority for sarcoidosis research. Screening for cardiac sarcoidosis&#xD;
      conventionally has relied on symptoms and electrocardiogram. However, there are no validated&#xD;
      screening instruments for symptom assessment, and the usefulness of individual components of&#xD;
      the medical history (e.g. palpitations, chest pain, presyncope) has not been assessed. In one&#xD;
      study, symptom assessment was found to be less than 50% sensitive for identification of&#xD;
      individuals with abnormal cardiac imaging studies. ECG performed poorly, with less than 10%&#xD;
      sensitivity. Holter monitoring and echocardiogram were more sensitive than ECG in that study,&#xD;
      identifying 50% and 25%, respectively, of those with imaging findings suggesting cardiac&#xD;
      sarcoidosis (CS). The intensity of screening for CS in unselected sarcoidosis patients is&#xD;
      controversial. The Heart Rhythm Society working group could not agree that echocardiogram or&#xD;
      ambulatory ECG added significantly to conventional testing of eliciting cardiac symptoms and&#xD;
      ECG; therefore, the working group was unable to recommend adding these procedures as a&#xD;
      routine for all sarcoidosis patients. In a large series of Greek non-cardiac sarcoidosis&#xD;
      patients, echocardiogram and ambulatory ECG added little prognostic information to usual&#xD;
      care. On the other hand, more sophisticated echocardiographic techniques such as speckle&#xD;
      tracking seem to provide independent prognostic information. In a second study, Holter&#xD;
      monitoring and echocardiography abnormalities were both more common in those with MRI&#xD;
      findings consistent with CS, although the usefulness of the tests disappeared in&#xD;
      multivariable analysis. While history and ECG are considered the standard of care at present,&#xD;
      there is a continuing need to identify markers of poor outcomes. Cardiac MRI and/or cardiac&#xD;
      FDG-PET scan can identify large proportions of individuals with asymptomatic imaging&#xD;
      abnormalities, but they are expensive, require specialized expertise to interpret, require&#xD;
      radiation (PET scan) and are likely impractical for widespread use in all sarcoidosis&#xD;
      patients. A second unresolved issue concerning screening for cardiac sarcoidosis is the&#xD;
      frequency of re-screening sarcoidosis patients who demonstrate no evidence for cardiac&#xD;
      sarcoidosis on an initial screen. The investigators hypothesize that screening using&#xD;
      conventional history, physical and ECG in the general sarcoidosis population, followed by&#xD;
      appropriate advanced imaging testing, will result in the identification of a higher&#xD;
      percentage of ascertained cardiac sarcoidosis than has been reported historically (2-5%). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that routine use of echocardiogram with strain and ambulatory ECG&#xD;
      will identify additional patients who will have advanced imaging abnormalities or who meet&#xD;
      criteria for cardiac sarcoidosis. The investigators further hypothesize that re-screening&#xD;
      patients after 24 months with repeat echocardiogram and ambulatory ECG will identify&#xD;
      additional patients with suspicion for cardiac sarcoidosis who had no abnormalities on the&#xD;
      initial screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the rate of diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis during standard of care&#xD;
           clinical practice that relies on patient symptoms and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether second-tier screening tests (echocardiogram and ambulatory ECG)&#xD;
           improve the rate of diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis beyond conventional screening&#xD;
           methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the rate of diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis in sarcoidosis patients who had&#xD;
           initial negative conventional and second-tier screening tests after undergoing these&#xD;
           screening tests again at two years.&#xD;
