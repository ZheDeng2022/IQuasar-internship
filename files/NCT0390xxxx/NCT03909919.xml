      The present study aims to validate the kinematic analysis obtained by two motion capture&#xD;
      instruments for the functional objective assessment of elderly patients with Heart Failire&#xD;
      (HF) and to develop a new functional index formed by kinematic parameters and other&#xD;
      functional objective parameters and scales which may be impaired in patients with HF and they&#xD;
      could allow the stratification of these patients based on different levels of functional&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular diseases carried on being the leading cause of disability due to&#xD;
      noncommunicable diseases from 1990 to 2016. Within cardiovascular diseases, it has been&#xD;
      estimated that heart failure (HF) has a prevalence in the population of approximately 2% to&#xD;
      3%. However, it is the only cardiovascular disease that is increasing in incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence due to the aging of the world population, since the prevalence of this disease&#xD;
      increases with age. Furthermore, heart failure represents the most important hospital&#xD;
      diagnosis in older adults, being the main cause of hospital admissions for people older than&#xD;
      65 years and contributing to the increase of medical care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with HF use to show a reduced aerobic capacity, a decreased muscle strength in the&#xD;
      lower limbs, low weekly physical activity, intolerance to exercise and a lower walking speed&#xD;
      than healthy subjects of the same age. In general, patients with heart failure have altered&#xD;
      functional capacities and experience a decline in the ability to carry out activities of&#xD;
      daily living and suffer a reduced quality of life. When it is assessed functional parameters&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure, the maximum oxygen consumption (V0â‚‚ max) obtained from a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test is considered the gold standard measure of cardiovascular&#xD;
      functional capacity. Moreover, some functional tests have been used, such as the 6-Minute&#xD;
      Walking Test, which provides an indirect measure of cardiovascular functional capacity, and&#xD;
      the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which also provides a useful and indirect&#xD;
      indication of muscle functional capacity. However, at the time of diagnosing or classifying&#xD;
      patients with heart failure, the functional assessment does not use to be considered. The&#xD;
      implementation of diagnostic guidelines or a functional assessment based on evidence can be&#xD;
      important to improve prognosis and quality of life in patients with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to identify functional markers related to functionality that are&#xD;
      indicative of heart failure. For this, it is necessary to use instruments to measure&#xD;
      functional variables that must be valid and reliable, as established by the COSMIN taxonomy.&#xD;
      Kinematic measurements allow quantifying normal and pathological movements, quantifying the&#xD;
      degree of deterioration, planning rehabilitation strategies and evaluating the effect of&#xD;
      various interventions. Inertial sensors and depth cameras are accurate and reliable methods&#xD;
      for the kinematic analysis of human movement, in addition to presenting a good correlation of&#xD;
      kinematic data between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, it can be used the Simmer3 Inertial Sensor and 3D motion capture systems with a&#xD;
      camera to analyse kinematics and these instruments are being integrated as a rehabilitation&#xD;
      tool in patients. The use of Shimmer3 Inertial Sensor and 3D motion capture cameras would&#xD;
      help to find fast and cheap assessment methods for professionals.&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaire used to assess functional, emotional and cognitive components. It is composed of 15 items from the 4 instruments such as the geriatric depression scale (GDS), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL) using the Katz index and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) using the Lawnton &amp; Brody scale. The score varies from 0 to 30 points, giving 1 point to each of the items of the GDS (4 points in total), 12 to the 3 items from the scale of Lawton &amp; Brody, 8 points to the 4 items from the MMSE and 6 points to the 3 items from the Katz index.</description>
