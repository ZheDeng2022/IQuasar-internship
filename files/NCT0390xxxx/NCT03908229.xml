    <textblock>
      Previous studies that examined whether the presence of an additional observer, more&#xD;
      specifically a GI fellow, during colonoscopy can enhance detection of all polyps and adenomas&#xD;
      yielded conflicting results. Of note, all of the aforementioned studies were retrospective&#xD;
      and robust evidence derived from well-designed randomized controlled trials are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to examine whether fellow participation during screening,&#xD;
      surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopy influence overall, size-specific, or&#xD;
      location-specific adenoma or polyp detection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be planned to enroll 812 patients (406 per arms) within 1 year. Adenoma detection&#xD;
      rate will be the primary outcome.&#xD;

      Background Colonoscopy is instrumental in colon cancer prevention as through polypectomy it&#xD;
      may interfere with the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, thus resulting in a clear survival&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, not all adenomatous polyps are identified during a colonoscopy. The overall&#xD;
      false-negative (&quot;miss&quot;) rate for colonic adenomas is estimated to be as high as 24%,&#xD;
      according to studies of same-day, tandem colonoscopies. In addition, flat and depressed&#xD;
      lesions often remain undetected during white-light colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-cost optimization of existing resources, such as use of a second observer or water-aided&#xD;
      colonoscopy, were recently found to be able to significantly increase colon adenoma detection&#xD;
      rate (ADR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies that examined whether the presence of an additional observer, more&#xD;
      specifically a GI fellow, during colonoscopy can enhance detection of all polyps and adenomas&#xD;
      yielded conflicting results. Of note, all of the aforementioned studies were retrospective&#xD;
      and robust evidence derived from well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical procedure In the control arm all colonoscopy will be performed by full-time&#xD;
      board-certified gastroenterologists who have each done more than 5000 colonoscopy&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigation arm colonoscopy will be performed by gastroenterology fellows. The&#xD;
      fellows will always start the case and proceed generally until they are unable to make&#xD;
      further progress despite &quot;coaching&quot; from the staff attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedures with fellows, the staff attending will always actively participate in&#xD;
      the entire procedure and assess for the presence of any lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopies will be performed by using only high-definition white-light (HDWL) scopes&#xD;
      (Olympus 180 series CF H180).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation will be uniform and consist of 4 L of polyethylene glycol. All detected&#xD;
      lesions will be endoscopically removed and samples will be sent to pathologists for&#xD;
      histological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment strategy Patients complying with the eligibility criteria will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 fashion to undergo colonoscopy performed by a trainee (under attending physician&#xD;
      supervision) or colonoscopy performed by an experienced physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical considerations On the basis of previous retrospective&#xD;
      comparative reports, the study is designed to detect an increase in ADR by 8%. Therefore, 812&#xD;
      patients (406 per arm) will be required to have a 80% power to detect the target difference&#xD;
      at a 0.05 significance level (two sided). The primary endpoint will be ADR. In order to&#xD;
      collect the estimated sample size, up to 1 year of recruiting will be needed.&#xD;
