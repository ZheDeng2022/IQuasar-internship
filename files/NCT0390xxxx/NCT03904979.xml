  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The investigators hypothesize that exposure to chronic environmental stress is a&#xD;
      risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes related to preterm birth and preeclampsia among&#xD;
      high-risk pregnant women. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that women can be&#xD;
      screened for high levels of environmental stress through the perceived stress scale, and&#xD;
      therapeutic writing can be used as a low-resource intervention to help decrease maternal&#xD;
      perceived stress and inflammation - measured through analysis of maternal serum and placental&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Pregnant women at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, enrolled in prenatal care at UNC will be recruited for&#xD;
      participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Using results from the perceived stress scale, the investigators will identify&#xD;
      women who screen positive for high environmental stress. Women meeting inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be contacted for possible participation at regularly scheduled prenatal visits. Women&#xD;
      who are enrolled will be randomized to generalized writing prompts, therapeutic writing&#xD;
      prompts, or no writing during their pregnancy to be administered at each prenatal visit.&#xD;
      Maternal blood sample for biochemical markers of stress and gene expression will be obtained&#xD;
      at the initial visit; a followup blood sample will be obtained later in pregnancy, and a&#xD;
      small portion of the placenta saved at delivery. Delivery outcomes will be obtained through&#xD;
      medical record review.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, women regularly interact with healthcare professionals, an often untapped&#xD;
      resource and opportune time to optimize mental health, positively impacting outcomes.&#xD;
      Cumulative psychosocial stress is a risk factor for several adverse obstetric outcomes&#xD;
      including preterm birth (PTB), preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and postpartum&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypothesis of this study is that pregnant women with high levels of stress&#xD;
      can be identified through easily-implemented screening tools; importantly, the investigators&#xD;
      propose that these women can be engaged in care via a cost-effective therapeutic writing&#xD;
      intervention combined with the availability of expert pastoral and perinatal psychiatry&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be enrolled early in pregnancy and followed prospectively. Some women (if&#xD;
      randomized to a writing group) will complete a standardized writing prompt at several time&#xD;
      points during gestation. The investigators will follow their outcomes prospectively.&#xD;
