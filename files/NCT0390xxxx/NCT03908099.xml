  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects approximately 10-15% of couples and one of its important modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor is obesity, which affects 19% of Canadian women of reproductive age. Accordingly, many&#xD;
      organizations have recommended that women should be assisted to adopt a healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      prior to conception and maintain it during pregnancy. We therefore propose to conduct a&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      Fit-For-Fertility in women with infertility and obesity. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      Fit-For-Fertility program is an efficient and low cost solution to improve access to&#xD;
      motherhood for women suffering from obesity and infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, seven fertility clinics having a good ethnic diversity will&#xD;
      participate in this RCT and recruit a total of 616 women with obesity (BMI according to&#xD;
      ethnicity) who consult at the fertility clinic. Participants will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of these two groups: the intervention group will be invited to participate in the Fit-for&#xD;
      Fertility Program alone for 6 months and then in combination with usual fertility treatments;&#xD;
      while the control group will receive standard fertility treatments from randomisation. The&#xD;
      aim of the Fit-for Fertility Program will be to implement progressive and sustainable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes, using 1) individual sessions with a dietitian and a kinesiologist every&#xD;
      6-12 weeks, for a total of 18 months or until the end of pregnancy; and 2) eight educational&#xD;
      group sessions. Evaluation visits will take place prior to randomisation and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 18 months. Women who become pregnant will be evaluated early during pregnancy and&#xD;
      at 26 weeks of gestation. Clinical outcomes will be assessed after a total follow up of 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated contributions: The results of our multicenter RCT will provide important data on&#xD;
      the importance of a lifestyle program supporting women with obesity consulting in fertility&#xD;
      clinics, in order to improve their fertility and response to ART, as well as helping them to&#xD;
      have a healthy baby. This study will also provide valuable information on potential cost&#xD;
      savings for individuals and the healthcare system.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           Infertility affects approximately 10-15% of couples and costs associated with medically&#xD;
           assisted reproduction (MAR) are growing, such that equitable access to high quality&#xD;
           reproductive care is a challenge for the Canadian health care system. This is especially&#xD;
           true for women with obesity. A modifiable risk factor for infertility is obesity (body&#xD;
           mass index (BMI) &gt;= 30 kg/m2), which accounts for as many as 19% of Canadian women of&#xD;
           reproductive age. Moreover, obesity increases the costs of fertility treatments, reduces&#xD;
           their effectiveness and predisposes to several pregnancy and neonatal complications. As&#xD;
           important, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and excessive gestational weight gain were&#xD;
           consistently associated with early development of obesity and diabetes in the offspring.&#xD;
           Childhood obesity is closely linked to adult obesity, which perpetuates the&#xD;
           intergenerational cycle of obesity. Accordingly, we strongly believe that targeting&#xD;
           women with obesity prior to conception may be essential to reduce the burden of&#xD;
           infertility and MAR costs in Canada, as well as obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To prevent these adverse effects, many organizations have recommended that obese women&#xD;
           should be assisted to adopt a healthy lifestyle prior to conception and maintain it&#xD;
           during pregnancy. In a recent survey, all women who were obese or overweight and&#xD;
           considering pregnancy were interested in adopting a healthy lifestyle pre-conception and&#xD;
           91% reported their willingness to participate in a lifestyle program. However, most&#xD;
           Canadian women with obesity do not have access to such targeted lifestyle programs&#xD;
           integrated with their fertility care. Our solution is therefore to give these women&#xD;
           access to the Fit-for-Fertility Program, an interdisciplinary lifestyle intervention,&#xD;
           integrated into the fertility clinic care pathway. This program supports participants in&#xD;
           their adoption of sustainable healthy behaviours, prior conception and during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To fill these gaps, in 2010 Dr. Baillargeon set up the Canadian network on reproductive&#xD;
           and maternal health of women with obesity and infertility. Through this network, our&#xD;
           team has conducted a CIHR-funded RCT evaluating the impact of the Fit-for-Fertility&#xD;
           Program, which was implemented at the fertility clinic of the Centre hospitalier&#xD;
           universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS), on 130 obese women randomized to 1) Control group:&#xD;
           standard fertility treatments right away; or 2) Intervention group: follow the&#xD;
           Fit-for-Fertility program alone for 6 months, then in combination with fertility&#xD;
           treatments if not pregnant. The analysis of the 108 women who completed at least 6&#xD;
           months in the study (83%) shows that after a maximum follow-up of 18 months and in&#xD;
           comparison with the standard fertility treatments (n = 57), the Fit-for-Fertility&#xD;
           program (n = 51) significantly increased the rates of total pregnancy (61% vs. 39%, p =&#xD;
           0.02) and spontaneous pregnancy (31% vs. 12%, p = 0.01), as well as a tendency to&#xD;
           increase live birth (51% vs. 37%, p = 0.14). Such results from the pilot study are&#xD;
           highly clinically significant. The total cost of this intervention was only $870 per&#xD;
           participant, as compared to standard fertility care costs averaging $4,400 per woman&#xD;
           with obesity in the above-mentioned trial. As such, these preliminary results thus&#xD;
           suggest that our low-cost lifestyle intervention for women who are obese and infertile&#xD;
           may significantly improve their fertility and reduce the need for expensive MAR. These&#xD;
           promising findings provide strong justification for further validation in diverse&#xD;
           Canadian populations using a multicenter trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The general goals of our research program are therefore to i) improve the fertility of&#xD;
           women with obesity, ii) reduce costs associated with their fertility treatments, and&#xD;
           iii) promote the health of mothers and their offspring. To achieve this goal, we ask the&#xD;
           question: Does the Fit-for-Fertility Program improve in a cost-effective manner the live&#xD;
           birth rate and other fertility outcomes, as well as pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, in&#xD;
           women with obesity and infertility who consult a fertility clinic, as compared to usual&#xD;
           care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the main objectives of our national multicenter RCT are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Fit-for-Fertility Program on fertility and lifestyle&#xD;
           outcomes in a diverse Canadian population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess costs per live birth and other measures of cost-effectiveness of the program; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the impact of the program on maternal and neonatal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. CENTERS INVOLVED IN THE TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven fertility clinics covering Canada from coast to coast and having a good ethnic&#xD;
      diversity will participate in this RCT: Olive Fertility Centre in Vancouver, with its Asian&#xD;
      population; Pacific Centre for Reproductive Medicine in Edmonton, Mount Sinai Hospital in&#xD;
      Toronto and Centre hospitalier universitaire (CHU) of Montréal, with large multiethnic&#xD;
      communities; CHU of Sherbrooke and CHU of Québec, smaller centers with mainly Caucasian&#xD;
      clientele; and Atlantic Assisted Reproductive Therapies Clinic in Halifax that has a&#xD;
      Caucasian and Afro-American population. All clinics have provided strong support and&#xD;
      partnership.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur following the baseline visit (V0), when all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be available for the candidate. Group allocation will be concealed using on-line&#xD;
      computerized randomization with permuted blocks of variable block sizes (2 to 6), stratified&#xD;
      by center and PCOS status (yes/no), which decreases fertility and may affect response to the&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention. Randomization list will be generated by an independent statistician.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in two arms using 1:1 ratio. Central randomization will be&#xD;
      conducted using a customized web-based program designed for the study. The randomization&#xD;
      process will be initiated by the site investigator or delegate who will access the web-based&#xD;
      system and enter the patient's confirmation of eligibility and informed consent. The&#xD;
      patient's unique study identifier and open-label study treatment allocation will then be&#xD;
      electronically delivered to the local site investigator or delegate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, the research staff will inform the fertility care team of their&#xD;
      patient's allocation group. If the participant is randomized to the control group, the&#xD;
      fertility care team will be informed that their patient can undergo fertility treatments&#xD;
      immediately, according to their usual care. On the other hand, if the participant is&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention group, the fertility clinic will be notified that the patient&#xD;
      will have to postpone any medically assisted reproduction (MAR) procedures for the following&#xD;
      6 months, during which she will be enrolled in the Fit-for-Fertility Program. At the end of&#xD;
      this first 6-month period, if the participant is not pregnant, the research staff will&#xD;
      contact the fertility clinic team to inform them that the participant can now undergo usual&#xD;
      fertility care, in combination with the Fit-for-Fertility Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      As illustrated in the Study Flow Chart, page ix, research evaluation visits will take place&#xD;
      in both groups at baseline and every 6 months for a total of 18 months if no pregnancy&#xD;
      occurs. Women who will become pregnant within the first 18 months of follow-up will be&#xD;
      evaluated at the beginning of pregnancy and at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy, or up to a total&#xD;
      follow-up of 24 months. In our pilot trial, only one participant who became pregnant within&#xD;
      18 months of follow-up delivered after a total follow-up of 24 months. Women who will become&#xD;
      pregnant after 18 months of follow-up will not undergo research visits during their&#xD;
      pregnancy. All measures and evaluations performed during these research visits are detailed&#xD;
      below, in section 8.1, and are listed in the Schedule Table at page x. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact the study team if events occur between visits or phone calls.&#xD;
      Importantly, all clinical outcomes will be ascertained with participants and their medical&#xD;
      records 24 months after participants' randomization, regardless of the timing of their last&#xD;
      research visit and the occurrence of a pregnancy. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes occurring&#xD;
      after 24 months from a pregnancy achieved within 24 months will not be included in the&#xD;
      primary analysis of the primary outcome, but will be recorded for secondary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. ANALYSES OF THE DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experts from the Canadian network on reproductive and maternal health of women with obesity&#xD;
      and infertility were surveyed, and they concluded that the minimal absolute increase in the&#xD;
      18-month cumulative incidence of live birth (live birth rate) between groups of participants&#xD;
      that would change clinical practice must be between 10% and 20%. The only RCT that is similar&#xD;
      to our study was published in the NEJM26 and used an increase of 15% for their sample size&#xD;
      calculation. Therefore, our sample size calculation was based on a 15% absolute difference,&#xD;
      an estimated live birth rate of 35% in the control group (from our ongoing RCT), a power of&#xD;
      95% and an alpha level of 5%, and resulted in 293 women per group (nQuery avisor 4.0).&#xD;
      Assuming a withdrawal rate of 5% (eligibility criteria violation and loss to follow up), the&#xD;
      number of women to recruit is 616. A 95% power will provide enough power for most of our&#xD;
      secondary outcome analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to recruit a total of 616 participants in 18 months, the two clinics with smaller&#xD;
      practices (CHUS and CHUQ) will need to recruit 53 participants (i.e. 39 per year), and the&#xD;
      other 5 clinics will have to recruit 102 participants (i.e. 68 per year). These rates of&#xD;
      recruitment are feasible since a survey of participating fertility clinics showed that&#xD;
      smaller practices (CHUS, CHUQ) evaluate 80 to 315 new women with obesity per year, and larger&#xD;
      practices, between 265 and 810.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Quantitative Data Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable of interest will be 24-month live birth cumulative incidence and the&#xD;
      primary analyses of interest will be ITT, including all randomized participants with&#xD;
      available data and no violation of eligibility criteria. The ITT analyses will be&#xD;
      supplemented by per-protocol analyses where women will be excluded if they drop out of the&#xD;
      study during the first 6 months. The 24-month cumulative incidences of live birth will be&#xD;
      compared between the two arms using the Mantel-Haenszel test with stratification by center&#xD;
      and PCOS status. This analysis will be supplemented by a survival analysis (log rank test)&#xD;
      where the time to live birth will be used. To assess balance across arms, baseline&#xD;
      demographic and clinical data of women will be compared between arms. In the very unlikely&#xD;
      event that a substantial imbalance is found, additional analyses will be carried to assess&#xD;
      the potential confounding effects of this imbalance, using multiple logistic regression and&#xD;
      Cox proportional hazards model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar analyses will be used for other clinical outcome variables, which will be assessed as&#xD;
      categories, and continuous variables. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on baseline&#xD;
      age, level of obesity, ethnic origins, socio-economic status, the cause of infertility and&#xD;
      polycystic ovary syndrome status. A 5% level of significance will be used for all analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of our multicenter RCT will have major scientific impact since they will provide&#xD;
      important data on the importance of a lifestyle program supporting women with obesity&#xD;
      consulting in fertility clinics, in order to improve their fertility and response to ART as&#xD;
      well as helping them to have a healthy baby. This study will also provide valuable&#xD;
      information on potential cost savings for individuals and the healthcare system.&#xD;

    <description>The Fit-for-Fertility Program aims at implementing progressive and sustainable lifestyle changes. Participants will attend individual sessions with a dietitian and a kinesiologist every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, then every 8 weeks for the 6 following months, and then every 12 weeks until end of the study. Follow-up by telephone/e-mail will be offered between in-person meetings. These professionals will be trained in motivational counselling skills. Participants will also benefit from weekly group sessions divided into 2 parts: 1) Workshops covering 8 different topics (45 minutes) addressing healthy lifestyle and 2) Supervised classes of physical activity where one of 8 different types of exercise (45 minutes) will be practiced. Women will be required to attend all 8 different sessions within the first 6 months. Pregnant women will be met to set new lifestyle objectives specific to pregnancy, including optimal gestational weight gain based on the Institute of Medicine guidelines.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Infertility defined as (a) failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after ≥12 months of&#xD;
             regular unprotected sexual intercourse, (b) not conceiving after having tried ≥6&#xD;
             months in women with irregular menstrual cycles or ≥35 years of age; or (c) women with&#xD;
             an established cause of infertility;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Aged between 18 and 40 years; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or 27 kg/m² for Asian and Latin American), or overweight for&#xD;
             women with PCOS (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any uncontrolled medical or mental condition that contra-indicates fertility&#xD;
             treatments, based on clinical judgment of the fertility specialist;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If the only clinically indicated MAR procedure is IVF (e.g. bilateral tubal factor,&#xD;
             severe male factor, etc.) or in case of insemination with donor, because natural&#xD;
             conception is impossible or highly unlikely;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recurrent spontaneous abortions (&gt;2 miscarriages at less than 22 weeks of gestation)&#xD;
             within the last 12 months (with evidence of conception, such as positive β-hCG),&#xD;
             because these women do not have difficulty to conceive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previously diagnosed uncontrolled eating disorder or major depression that would&#xD;
             contra-indicate the initiation of a lifestyle intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A high level of depressive state, as determined by a score for depression on the&#xD;
             Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) ≥ 15, since that would contra-indicate&#xD;
             the initiation of a lifestyle intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Planning for or past history of bariatric surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Planning for or engaging in another intensive lifestyle intervention (that includes&#xD;
             face-to-face visits every 8 weeks or less, which would be similar to the intervention&#xD;
             tested);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to understand the language in which group sessions will be provided in the&#xD;
             participating center, i.e. French in Quebec province and English in other provinces;&#xD;
             and&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Planning to be unable to attend research visits at the participating center for the&#xD;
             next 18 months, due to moving in another region, for example.&#xD;
