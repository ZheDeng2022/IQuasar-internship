  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study product is a Cold Ablation Robot-guided Laser Osteotome (CARLO®) robotic surgery&#xD;
      device. It is a device that removes hard tissue such as bone by means laser ablation - it is&#xD;
      therefore an alternative to Piezo-Electric osteotomes and/or oscillating saws or other&#xD;
      mechanical instruments for bone cutting. In this study, the CARLO device is integrated with a&#xD;
      computer-assisted pre-operative planning and intra-operative navigation, and will be used for&#xD;
      Patients requiring an orthognathic procedure with a mid-face osteotomy, for whom a procedure&#xD;
      plan is defined based on preoperative imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this first-in-man study is to confirm the performance and safety of the&#xD;
      CARLO® robotic surgery device (manufactured by Advanced Osteotomy Tools SA) for the execution&#xD;
      of preoperatively planned midface osteotomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed and powered to confirm, in clinical use across multiple sites, that the&#xD;
      CARLO® device can be used to accurately perform straight-line mid-face osteotomies according&#xD;
      to preoperative plans, and with results and a safety profile that are comparable to current&#xD;
      state-of-the-art osteotomy methods. Multiple risk mitigations are in place to ensure safety,&#xD;
      especially for the initially enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A postoperative follow-up of up to 28 days will be included in this study, in order to assess&#xD;
      initial soft tissue healing and recovery, and to enable the identification of any soft-tissue&#xD;
      injuries that would not have been immediately apparent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After end of study of each individual patient, safety monitoring will go on for the duration&#xD;
      of the study until the last visit of the last patient.&#xD;
