    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib plus&#xD;
      ramucirumab versus osimertinib alone using progression free survival (PFS). Events associated&#xD;
      with PFS include: disease progression per RECIST 1.1 and death due to any cause. A total of&#xD;
      150 patients will be enrolled and randomized in a 2:1 fashion (osimertinib plus ramucirumab&#xD;
      vs. osimertinib) to the two treatment arms according to the following stratification factors:&#xD;
      types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and presence of brain metastasis.&#xD;
