  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in 1,000 individuals aged 14 years or older, diagnosed with&#xD;
      Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) who meet all eligibility criteria in Coccidioides endemic&#xD;
      regions. This study is designed to provide data on the prevalence of primary pulmonary&#xD;
      coccidioidomycosis among persons presenting with CAP in endemic regions. Among individuals&#xD;
      diagnosed with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, we aim to describe the clinical course,&#xD;
      predictors of the clinical course and compare the response to prescribed antifungal therapy&#xD;
      versus no antifungal therapy. The hypothesis for patients with primary pulmonary&#xD;
      coccidioidomycosis is that early treatment with antifungal therapy is effective in reducing&#xD;
      the frequency, severity and associated adverse outcomes of infection with recently acquired&#xD;
      coccidioidomycosis pneumonia. The study will be divided into Step 1 and Step 2. Step 1 will&#xD;
      identify which subjects have primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis based on the case&#xD;
      definition for the protocol and Step 2 will follow subjects who meet the case definition and&#xD;
      will observe their clinical management and clinical outcomes. Subjects will enroll in Step 1&#xD;
      within 28 days of symptom onset. In Step 1, blood work for serologic determination of&#xD;
      Coccidioides infection will be drawn at the time of enrollment (Day 1), and again 21 days&#xD;
      later if a positive result is not reported at Day 1. Subjects with a diagnosis of primary&#xD;
      pulmonary coccidioidomycosis confirmed by positive serologic testing during Step 1 will enter&#xD;
      Step 2 within 21 days of a positive test result; subjects with a negative serology at Day 1&#xD;
      and Day 22 will not be followed further. Subjects referred to the study after a diagnosis of&#xD;
      primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis confirmed by positive serologic testing will also be&#xD;
      allowed to enter Step 2 directly within 21 days of a positive test result and within 7 weeks&#xD;
      of symptom onset, as long as they meet study enrollment criteria. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the prevalence of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis (PPC) in subjects with&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in coccidioidomycosis endemic areas.&#xD;

      assess the prevalence of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis (PPC) in subjects with&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in coccidioidomycosis endemic areas. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are divided into two categories. For subjects with CAP in coccidioidomycosis&#xD;
      endemic areas the secondary objectives are: 1) To determine demographic, clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory factors that predict PPC; 2) To describe the practice of empiric antifungal&#xD;
      treatment of subjects with CAP. For subjects with confirmed primary pulmonary&#xD;
      coccidioidomycosis the secondary objectives are: 1) To describe the clinical course of&#xD;
      primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis from earliest presentation; 2) To assess the&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, laboratory and treatment predictors of the clinical course of primary&#xD;
      pulmonary coccidioidomycosis; 3) To describe the practice of antifungal treatment of subjects&#xD;
      with confirmed primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis; 4) To compare the outcomes of antifungal&#xD;
      therapy vs. no therapy for primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis as measured by clinical signs&#xD;
      and symptoms, functional scores of health and well-being and ability to participate in social&#xD;
      roles and activities, time missed from school and work, dissemination, and mortality.&#xD;
