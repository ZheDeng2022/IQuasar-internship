  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Designing food and drink that maximizes satiety has long been an ambition of industry and&#xD;
      public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For obvious reasons, foods that fill faster and for longer are desirable to consumers for&#xD;
      controlling their weight, and to public health programs that are designed to prevent obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods for measuring satiety have weak predictive value, commonly fail to replicate,&#xD;
      and are yet to be validated with respect to energy consumption in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to overcome this deficiency by developing the Omnibus Satiety&#xD;
      Metric (OmniSaM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OmniSaM is proposed as a multi-modal metric that targets the full spectrum of processes&#xD;
      underlying the satiety cascade, composing brain, blood, mind and behavior of consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a proof-of-concept, subjects (normal BMI) will undergo a preload ad libitum paradigm, with&#xD;
      a 2-parameter factorial design comparing milk based products differing in levels of caloric&#xD;
      load and protein-to-carbohydrate ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will acquire 1. high-resolution neuroimaging data, whilst 2. simultaneously&#xD;
      recording appetitive hormones, 3. blood metabolite composition, 4. subjective sensory indices&#xD;
      of appetite and 4. behavioral metrics of consumption.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching strategy is to give subjects preload foods of variable combinations of&#xD;
      protein-to-carbohydrate ratios (two levels) and caloric load (two levels), testing the effect&#xD;
      this has on ad libitum consumption, using neuroimaging, sensory and endocrine metrics as&#xD;
      predictor variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a repeated measures cross-over study, meaning that all&#xD;
      subjects will be exposed to all four combinations of protein-to-carbohydrate ratio and&#xD;
      caloric loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 subjects will complete the study. Subjets will consume a shake preload drink&#xD;
      outside the Magnetic Resonance-scanner (MR-scanner) and after a wait time of 4 hours during&#xD;
      which scanning, endocrine and sensory measures are obtained, the subjects will eat an ad&#xD;
      libitum meal consisting of standardized prepared spaghetti bolognese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrine and sensory measures will continue until one hour after intake of the ad libitum&#xD;
      meal. All subjects will undergo four test days of ~5 hours in the Danish Research Centre for&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance (DRCMR), Hvidovre Hospital, a maximum of one test day per week because of&#xD;
      blood loss considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On study days the participants will arrive at 11:30am having fasted since 22:00 the previous&#xD;
      evening with a fixed consumption of 200 ml of water in the morning 2 hours before the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Intravenous cannula will be placed in participants arm to take blood samples, and baseline&#xD;
      blood samples and baseline measures of appetite sensations will be collected. At time 0&#xD;
      participant will be instructed to consume a preload shake of Queal (Queal, Queal Smooth&#xD;
      Vanilla, Queal Quick Meal, The Netherlands) added whey protein isolate (LACPRODAN SP-9225&#xD;
      INSTANT, Arla Foods Ingredients, Denmark) or lactose monohydrate (VARIOLAC 992, Arla Foods&#xD;
      Ingredients, Denmark) and water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This candidate comparison is designed to exploit known differences in satiating capacity for&#xD;
      both caloric load, and for protein to carbohydrate.The logic behind the selection of these&#xD;
      factors is to use factors for which we have the strongest a priori evidence for their satiety&#xD;
      effects, such that the method can be developed as a proof-of-principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the preloads, participants will drink 200 ml water containing 1.5g of paracetamol&#xD;
      as a tracer for gastric emptying. Afterwards the participants will be placed on a bed&#xD;
      connected to the MRI-scanner, and fMRI scanning will start. The scanning will be stopped&#xD;
      shortly when presenting questionnaires and taking blood samples. In the following two and a&#xD;
      half hours participants will alternate between being scanned, resting, and completing&#xD;
      questionnaires, repeating at ~15 minutes intervals. At ~t=180 min an ad libitum meal of&#xD;
      Spaghetti Bolognese will be served. Subjects will be instructed to eat until pleasantly&#xD;
      satiated, and intake will be calculated via weight of food consumed. Blood sampling and&#xD;
      sensory measures will continue until one hour after intake of the ad libitum meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples: Samples will be drawn through intravenous access by a catheter in the cubital&#xD;
      fossa, taken at regular intervals of between 5 and 30 minutes from t=-15 to t=240 which&#xD;
      includes testing 1 hour after the ad libitum meal. The amount of blood drawn from&#xD;
      participants will be a maximum of 180ml (for each test day), which will not impose any risks&#xD;
      for the participants who are all healthy (typically, voluntary blood donation involves&#xD;
      donating 500 ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested no more than once per week such that there is sufficient time for&#xD;
      recovery from the experimental blood loss. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide and CCK, PYY, Ghrelin,&#xD;
      GIP, GLP-1, FFA, Triglyceride and glucagon will be measured. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged, plasma and serum will be pipetted, frozen, and labeled with non-sensible and&#xD;
      non-identifiable personal data for later analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum/Plasma samples will be analyzed at Clinical Biochemistry, Hvidovre Hospital where&#xD;
      automatic biochemist analyses are performed. Other biochemical analyses that cannot be&#xD;
      performed locally will be sent to our collaborating laboratory either at the A) Institute of&#xD;
      Biomedicine (Professor Jens Juul Holst), which has specific equipment for analysis of blood&#xD;
      samples for intestinal hormones or B) Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital (Professor Kjeld Hermansen) which will perform another subset of&#xD;
      biochemical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective measures of appetite: Subjective sensations will be measured by presenting&#xD;
      questions about; liking, hunger, fullness, satiety, desires, prospective consumption and&#xD;
      thirst, one question at the time in randomized order. Appetitive measures will be taken&#xD;
      regularly throughout the test day, from prior to intake of pre-load to post ad libitum meal&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When lying in the scanner, subjects will rate the magnitude of their responses on a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS), using button presses. And outside the scanner these responses will be&#xD;
      recorded via an equivalent pen and paper VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR-Scanning: During MRI scanning, participants are inserted into a long tube, surrounded by a&#xD;
      coil, which yields a strong magnetic field. By changing the slope of the magnetic field, we&#xD;
      can detect oxygenation of the blood. Subjects will be scanned through different imaging&#xD;
      sequences. The participant will not be able tell the difference between these, but will hear&#xD;
      the scanner makes a variety of sounds, depending on the sequence running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a scan, the various anatomical images of the brain are taken. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators measure changes in the magnetic signal generated by an increased blood&#xD;
      oxygenation to certain parts of the brain. This is the BOLD signal, and is the purpose of the&#xD;
      fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be inserted into the scanner at timepoint ~t=15, to around t=180 with a 10&#xD;
      minute break outside the scanner at timepoint ~t=80. From t=0, the subjects will drink the&#xD;
      queal preload prior to entering the scanner. Subjects will perform the in-scanner subjective&#xD;
      ratings (specified above) at the time points following the blood samples. Scanning will stop&#xD;
      shortly to allow for blood samples to be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take blood samples, a researcher will approach the subject who will remain in the bore of&#xD;
      the magnet throughout, and draw blood from the catheter. Once blood sampling and appetite&#xD;
      ratings have been collected, scanning will resume. In the gaps between functional sequences,&#xD;
      standard structural will be run, lasting approximately 15 minutes. Subjects will be&#xD;
      functionally scanned up to 6 more times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once complete, subjects will be removed from the scanner and complete the rest of the&#xD;
      experiment in a nearby testing room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad libitum meal: At ~t=180 subjects will begin the ad libitum (all you can eat) meal of&#xD;
      spaghetti bolognaise, in a dedicated private room, where they will be on their own and&#xD;
      unobserved. They can sit and eat for up to 30mins. Subjects will be instructed to eat until&#xD;
      &quot;pleasantly satiated&quot;. After consumption the amount eaten will be calculated by the weight&#xD;
      differential. Subjects will be provided with 200 ml water during the meal (forced intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional measures: As physical activity can affect appetite and ultimately energy intake in&#xD;
      the ad libitum meal, energy expenditure will be restricted by advising participants to&#xD;
      refrain from physical activity of high intensity three days in advance of each test day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, on test days participants must travel by automated vehicle to the hospital to ensure&#xD;
      a low level of physical activity immediately prior to testing. To measure participants&#xD;
      physical activity levels an activity tracker will be used. Participants will receive an&#xD;
      activity tracker minimum four days before the test day and receive instruction in its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be sampled during each study days (for a total of 720 mL over 4 days with minimum&#xD;
      1 week between each test day). On each test day, blood samples will be centrifuged, plasma or&#xD;
      serum will be pipetted, frozen and labeled with non-sensitive and non-identifiable personal&#xD;
      data for batch analysis after completion of the whole trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum/Plasma samples will be analyzed at Clinical Biochemistry, Hvidovre Hospital where&#xD;
      automatic biochemist analyses are performed. Other biochemical analyses that cannot be&#xD;
      performed locally will be sent to a collaborating laboratory either at the A) Endocrinology&#xD;
      Research Section, Panum Institute (Professor Jens Juul Holst), which has specific equipment&#xD;
      for analysis of blood samples for intestinal hormones or B) Department of Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Internal Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital (Professor Kjeld Hermansen) which will perform&#xD;
      another subset of biochemical analyses. All samples will be kept until analysis in a research&#xD;
      biobank at Hvidovre hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unanalyzed samples will be kept until 01.01.2027 after which samples will be destroyed&#xD;
      according to routine procedures. The biobank is only accessible for research staff involved&#xD;
      in the project. Participants provide informed written content on the amount and storage of&#xD;
      blood samples and can withdraw consent at any time resulting in destruction of the biological&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations: 25 x 4 repeated measures = 100 data points. For a two-tailed test, for a&#xD;
      medium effect size with f-square value of 0.15, for an alpha of 0.05. With 35 predictor&#xD;
      variables (25 subject factors, and then 10 aggregated predictor variables) we have 64 degrees&#xD;
      of freedom, the calculated power for this design &gt; 0.9. If we calculate the power for&#xD;
      inferring the effect of protein to carbohydrate ratio on consumption, the power is also very&#xD;
      high. If we suppose an effect size of 10% difference in consumption from the lowest to the&#xD;
      highest protein to carbohydrate ratio, then that is a slope of 3.85 (with respect to log PC&#xD;
      ratio). If the null hypothesis is a slope of 0, with sd of 4, then the power also &gt; 0.9.&#xD;
