  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism (PE), is a highly prevalent complication of malignancy. The development of VTE in&#xD;
      cancer patients is associated with several adverse consequences including worsened short- and&#xD;
      long-term prognosis and survival, mortality, morbidity, chemotherapy postponement, potential&#xD;
      hospitalization, need for long-term anticoagulation with attendant bleeding complications and&#xD;
      high rates of recurrent VTE . In addition, VTE leads to significant consumption of health&#xD;
      care resources; in one study of cancer patients, the adjusted mean incremental all-cause&#xD;
      health care costs of VTE were $30,538 per patient. Therefore, the optimal prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of VTE are crucial components of patient care in this population. Currently,&#xD;
      Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH), is the gold standard for the CAT management for the last&#xD;
      15 years Moreover, in a variety of high-risk thrombosis clinical settings, LMWHs agents are&#xD;
      safe and effective in preventing VTE. Multiple randomized trials of thromboprophylaxis have&#xD;
      been conducted focusing on ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. ESMO and ASCO&#xD;
      current guidelines suggest considering thromboprophylaxis in high-risk ambulatory cancer&#xD;
      patients with LMWHs. ECOG index, metastatic malignancy, chemotherapy and history of&#xD;
      thrombosis were significantly associated with the decision to use thromboprophylaxis in most&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, in 2016 Hellenic Society of Medical Oncology (HeSMO) has conducted the GMaT&#xD;
      study to assess the awareness of Thrombosis and highlight the current clinical practice in&#xD;
      Greece. The study has precluded adoption of outpatient prophylaxis in largely unselected&#xD;
      patients with cancer without significant adverse events. Based on GMaT findings, the&#xD;
      investigators will proceed in an observational study focusing on thromboprophylaxis in cancer&#xD;
      patients with high thrombotic cancer types. In particular, the title of this new study will&#xD;
      be &quot;Prevention and Prophylaxis (Thromboprophylaxis - ACT) of Cancer Associated Thrombosis&#xD;
      (CAT) in High Risk Oncology Patients: ACT4CAT&quot;.&#xD;

        The objective of the &quot;ACT4CAT&quot; study is to collect real world data of daily clinical&#xD;
        practice regarding thromboprophylaxis in high thrombotic risk ambulatory cancer patients.&#xD;
        In particular, in this study we will collect data from patients with high thrombotic risk&#xD;
        solid tumors (GI, thoracic, gynecologic, genitourinary or CNS) who receive or not&#xD;
        anticancer treatment and have already administered thromboprophylaxis treatment according&#xD;
        to the current clinical practice guidelines. Based on these real world data we will try to&#xD;
        assess the efficacy and safety of long term VTE thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients.&#xD;
