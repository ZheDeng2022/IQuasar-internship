  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sympathetic nerve activity can be measured transcutaneously in awake patients by&#xD;
      computer-based filtering of raw signal obtained via skin leads attached on the chest and the&#xD;
      right arm. Electrocardiogram can be removed by applying a high-pass filter setting of 150 Hz.&#xD;
      Electromyogram can be filtered by applying a high-pass filter setting of 500 Hz or a&#xD;
      band-pass filter setting of 500-1000 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the therapeutic effect of stellate, thoracic, and lumbar sympathetic ganglia block&#xD;
      (SGB, TSGB, and LSGB, respectively) in patients with chronic pain is generally evaluated by&#xD;
      using thermogram/thermography (change in temperature of the upper or lower extremeties) or&#xD;
      questionnaire-based scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not known whether the skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) can be measured&#xD;
      in patients undergoing SGB/TSGB/LSGB and used as an alternative tool for assessing the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of SGB/TSGB/LSGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we planned this pilot study to observe whether the SKNA can be obtained in&#xD;
      patients undergoing SGB/TSGB/LSGB and whether it is well correlated to thermogram or&#xD;
      questionnaire-based scoring. If the SKNA is observed and decreases after SGB/TSGB/LSGB, it&#xD;
      will be presented in milivolt (uV) and compared to that of pre-block values.&#xD;

    <description>A few studies reported that skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) signal could be potentially observed by applying a high-pass filter of 500 Hz or a band-pass filter of 500~1000 Hz to electric signal from skin leads attached on the skin of the chest in awake volunteers. However, it is not known if it would be also possible to observe the SKNA signal in patients undergoing stellate, thoracic, and lumbar sympathetic block. Also, there is no established, objective tool for quantitative or qualitative assessment of the effect of stellate, thoracic, and lumbar sympathetic block.</description>
