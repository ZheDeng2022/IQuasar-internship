  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to confirm and extend previous finding that four weeks of daily intake of 40&#xD;
      g of walnuts improve microvascular function, increasing the reactive hyperemia index (RHI),&#xD;
      effects which were greatest in individuals with the worst initial RHI and correlating to&#xD;
      circulating levels of vasoactive plasma epoxides. The current trial will enroll&#xD;
      postmenopausal women who are at risk for cardiovascular disease due to their menopausal&#xD;
      status and increased central adiposity. The initial trial focused on non-esterified (i.e.&#xD;
      plasma) derived oxylipins, but substantial and unique changes were also observed in the&#xD;
      esterified lipoprotein pool. The current study will add the esterified lipoprotein pool,&#xD;
      important, as the mechanisms by which walnut intake influences endothelial function are&#xD;
      currently undefined, but may include lipoprotein induced modulation of vascular hemostasis.&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, primary metabolism and urolithin metabotype will be analyzed as a&#xD;
      way to capture the influence of potential differences in habitual diet and metabolism on&#xD;
      physiologic response. Therefore, this study will combine measures of cardiovascular&#xD;
      physiology, metabolomics, and walnut-derived metabolite analyses to assess the 12 week&#xD;
      influence of 40 g of daily walnut intake on the health of overweight and obese postmenopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      A dietary intervention trial will be conducted to achieve the following objectives and&#xD;
      outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Determine the 12 week change in bioactive lipid mediators, and their&#xD;
      relationship to vascular function and platelet reactivity in overweight or obese&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with walnut incorporation into their habitual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Assess the contribution of metabolic phenotype on the variance in biomarker&#xD;
      response that includes both primary metabolism and urolithin metabotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: Forty g of daily walnut intake for six- and 12- weeks is predicted to&#xD;
      positively impact the production of bioactive lipid mediators known to favorably regulate&#xD;
      cardiovascular and inflammatory signaling. AA derived oxylipins produced from COX, LOX, and&#xD;
      CYP epoxygenases are known as regulators of inflammation, platelet activation and vascular&#xD;
      function. Therefore, understanding how certain foods such as walnuts can change the relative&#xD;
      ratio of PUFA substrates (i.e., AA, ALA, LA, EPA and DHA), and their subsequent bioactive&#xD;
      species produced through these enzyme pathways is necessary for the refinement of dietary&#xD;
      recommendations with regard to specific foods and dietary patterns aimed at reducing the risk&#xD;
      of chronic disease. Although a positive outcome is predicted, there may be substantial&#xD;
      variability in response. To explore potential genetic and dietary factors that may contribute&#xD;
      to the variability in response to the above functional markers, primary metabolism and&#xD;
      urolithin metabotype will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Assess the influence of 12 weeks of walnut intake on facial wrinkles in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome: Tweleve weeks of 40 g of walnut intake will improve facial wrinkles and&#xD;
      erythema in the study population, and the improvements will be related to changes in&#xD;
      metabotype.&#xD;
