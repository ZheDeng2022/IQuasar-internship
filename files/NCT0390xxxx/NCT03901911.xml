    <textblock>
      Adult patients will be included by consecutive manner from the diagnostic center at the&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patient information and medical history will be obtained from the patient and&#xD;
      recorded byte principal investigator of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental examinationof permanent fully erupted teeth will be performed by the principal&#xD;
      investigator of this study, excluding third molars, retained roots, and implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal examinations will be performed using full-mouth periodontal examination (FMEP)&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is defined here as 1-2 mm clinical attachment loss (CAL)in interproximal area&#xD;
      in two non-adjacent teeth and Staging involves four categories (stages 1 through 4) and is&#xD;
      determined after considering several variables including clinical attachment loss, amount and&#xD;
      percentage of bone loss, probing depth, presence and extent of angular bony defects and&#xD;
      furcation involvement, tooth mobility, and tooth loss due to periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grading includes three levels (grade A - low risk, grade B - moderate risk, grade C - high&#xD;
      risk for progression) and encompasses, in addition to aspects related to periodontitis&#xD;
      progression, general health status, and other exposures such as smoking or level of metabolic&#xD;
      control in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study will be explained to the patient, and informed consent will be given to him&#xD;
      to sign and will be maintained with the rest of the data .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluated parameters will be: clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing depth (PD),&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival recession (GR), plaque index (PI), furcation involvement&#xD;
      ,tooth mobility and radiographic examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (CAL)will be Measured from the CEJ to the bottom of the gingival sulcus using Williams&#xD;
      marking probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD will be measured at six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal,mid-buccal, distobuccal,&#xD;
      mesiolingual, mid-lingual and distolingual), PD will be measured as the distance from the&#xD;
      cemento enamel junction (CEJ) to the bottom of the pocket using Williams marking probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GR will be measured as the distance from the CEJ to the free gingival margin, and this&#xD;
      assessment will be assigned negative sign if the gingival margin is located coronally to the&#xD;
      CEJ using Williams marking probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOP gentle probing of the orifice of the gingival crevice. The periodontal probe will be&#xD;
      inserted 1 to2 mm into the gingival sulcus starting at one interproximal area and moving to&#xD;
      the other. If bleeding occurs within 10 seconds a positive finding is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PI the measurement of the state of oral hygiene by Silness-Löe Plaque index is based on&#xD;
      recording both soft debris and mineralized deposits on the teeth using Williams marking&#xD;
      probe. Missing teeth are not substituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 No plaque&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth. The&#xD;
      plaque may be seen in situ only after application of disclosing solution or by using the&#xD;
      probe on the tooth surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Moderate accumulation of soft deposit s within the gingival pocket, or the tooth and&#xD;
      gingival margin, which can be seen with the naked eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival&#xD;
      margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furcation involvement will be measured according to Glickman,1953 using Naber's Furcation&#xD;
      Probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination will be performed by periapical radiograph for the most affected&#xD;
      area to measure the linear measurement of bone loss &amp; calculate the percentage of bone loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Consensus report of workgroup 2 of the 2017 World Workshop on the&#xD;
      Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In grade A, there is slow rate of progression where the percentage of bone loss divided by&#xD;
      age is less than 0.25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In grade B there is a moderate rate of progression where the percentage of bone loss divided&#xD;
      by age is from 0.25 to 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In grade C there is a rapid rate of progression where the percentage of bone loss divided by&#xD;
      age is greater than 1.0.&#xD;
