      The aim of the study is to determine if intervening with combined local therapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy prior to chemotherapy alone in patients with oligorecurrent and oligometastatic&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma led to significant improvements in progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with oligometastatic diseases and pathologically confirmed esophageal&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma after initial radical treatment [i.e., completely resected&#xD;
             surgery or radical (chemo)radiotherapy], the primary esophageal sites are controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Definition of metastasis: patients with distant organ metastases or non-regional&#xD;
                  lymph node metastases; or patients with distant organs/non-regional lymph node&#xD;
                  metastases and regional lymph node metastases as defined in the eighth edition of&#xD;
                  the AJCC. Patients with only regional lymph node metastasis and/or&#xD;
                  anastomotic/esophageal recurrence are not eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. According to the classification of oligometastatic disease, oligometastasis&#xD;
                  including synchronous oligometastasis, metachronous oligometastasis, and repeat&#xD;
                  oligometastasis could be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. In visceral metastases or non-regional lymph node metastases, at least one&#xD;
                  metastatic lesion obtains pathological confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The total number of metastases is 4 or less and maximum 3 metastases in any single&#xD;
             organ system (i.e. lung, liver). The maximum diameter for each lesion should be less&#xD;
             than 5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Each lesion was counted separately at the time of registration and contributed to&#xD;
                  the total number of metastases.If regional recurrences are existed, all positive&#xD;
                  regional lymph nodes are count together as one lesion. For non-regional lymph&#xD;
                  node metastases, adjacent metastatic lymph nodes can be treated as one lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Lesions that have subsided during previous treatment (i.e., were no longer&#xD;
                  visible on CT or had eliminated affinity on PET-CT) are not included in the total&#xD;
                  number. For patients with synchronous oligometastasis, the controlled primary&#xD;
                  tumor and regional lymph nodes on imaging are counted toward the total of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All metastases of current diagnosis did not receive local treatment such as&#xD;
             radiotherapy, surgery, radiofrequency ablation before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Previous chemotherapy was allowed, but no anti-tumor medication was received within 3&#xD;
             months prior to the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The measurable lesion was determined by the investigator based on the RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             assessment. A lesion located in a previous radiotherapy area can be considered a&#xD;
             target lesion if it is confirmed to progress and is considered to be measurable&#xD;
             according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient is over 18 years old and has an ECOG score of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Estimated survival time &gt;12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The function of vital organs meets the following requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. platelets ≥ 100 × 10^9 / L;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9g / dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. serum albumin ≥ 2.8g / dL;&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN, ALT, AST and / or AKP ≤ 2.5 × ULN; if there is liver&#xD;
                  metastasis, ALT and / or AST ≤ 5 × ULN; if there is liver metastasis or bone&#xD;
                  metastasis AKP ≤ 5 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL / min;&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. For patients with pulmonary lesions or previous lung irradiation who are known or&#xD;
                  suspected to have impaired lung function, the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) for&#xD;
                  1 second of lung function must be above 1L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing age must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to randomization. Subjects agreed to adequate contraception&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Any other malignant tumor was diagnosed within 5 years prior to or after the diagnosis&#xD;
             of ESCC, except for malignant tumors with a low risk of metastasis and death (5-year&#xD;
             survival rate &gt;90%), such as well-treated basal cells or squamous cell skin cancer or&#xD;
