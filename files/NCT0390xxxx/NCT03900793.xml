  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1/1b clinical trial that aims to determine the Maximally Tolerated Dose&#xD;
      of Losartan and Sunitinib Combination Therapy. Patients will first be accrued to the Dose&#xD;
      Escalation phase of the study, using a 3+3 design. Medication dosages will increase until a&#xD;
      maximally tolerated dose is found. Patients will then be accrued to the Dose Expansion phase&#xD;
      of the trial, where efficacy of pre-determined dose will be preliminarily assessed.&#xD;

    <description>Part 1: This is a study escalating doses (Dose level 1-3) of losartan on a continuous daily dosing schedule and sunitinib (escalating on dose level 4) on a daily dosing with 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off. A cycle of therapy is 6 weeks (42 days).Dosing will be performed based on body surface area (BSA). This portion of the study uses a 3+3 design (i.e. cohort sizes of 3 patients for the first and second cohort at each dose level).&#xD;
Part 2: Once the Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) has been determined, 12 patients will enroll to the expansion cohort. These patients will receive the MTD as long as less then 33% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.</description>

Dosing will be performed based on weight in kilograms and rounded to the nearest 12.5 mg (half of 25 mg tablet). Dose level 1 dosing will not exceed 50 mg daily and dose levels 2 and 3 dosing will not exceed 100 mg daily.
