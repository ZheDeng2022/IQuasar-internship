    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assesse the levels of various biomarkers, specifically interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-6, platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs), 11, 12 soluble vascular cell adhesion&#xD;
      molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), transforming growth factor (TGF) β1, and sCTLA-4, in TKI-treated&#xD;
      patients with CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the fluctuations in the levels of sCTLA-4, TGFβ1, and PDMPs, and to clarify the&#xD;
      clinical significance of these biomarkers during TKI therapy in patients with CML..&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder in which leukemic cells&#xD;
      display the Philadelphia chromosome generated from a reciprocal t(9:22) (q34:q11)&#xD;
      translocation.1 The chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 transposal of t (9:22) and (q34:q11)&#xD;
      causes the cancer gene C-ABL at 9q34 to link with the BCR gene at 22q11, forming the BCR-ABL&#xD;
      gene on chromosome 22.2 CML is presented by constitutional complaints (fatigue, weight loss,&#xD;
      and fever), those related to splenomegaly (abdominal fullness, anorexia, abdominal pain, and&#xD;
      early satiety) and bleeding tendency (easy bruising or bleeding) are most frequent symptoms.&#xD;
      Splenomegaly (≥ 95%), sternal tenderness, hepatomegaly, purpura, and retinal hemorrhage are&#xD;
      commonly reported signs at physical exam. To diagnose CML, doctors use a variety of tests to&#xD;
      analyze the blood and marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Complete Blood Count (CBC). This test is used to measure the number and types of cells in&#xD;
      the blood. People with CML often have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased hemoglobin concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased white blood cell count, often to very high levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible increase or decrease in the number of platelets depending on the severity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood cells are stained (dyed) and examined with a light microscope. These samples show:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific pattern of white blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small proportion of immature cells (leukemic blast cells and promyelocytes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Larger proportion of maturing and fully matured white blood cells (myelocytes and&#xD;
           neutrophils).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These blast cells, promyelocytes and myelocytes are normally not present in the blood of&#xD;
      healthy individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytogenetic Analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease is classically staged into chronic phase (CP, most patients at presentation),&#xD;
      accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP).3 Many definitions have been used for these&#xD;
      stages, but all the data generated from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) studies has used&#xD;
      the historically standard definition where AP is defined by the presence of one or more of&#xD;
      the following: ≥15% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow, ≥20% basophils in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood , platelets &lt;100,000/μL unrelated to treatment or the development of&#xD;
      cytogenetic evolution. Blast phase is defined by the presence of ≥30% blasts in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood or bone marrow, the presence of clusters of blasts in marrow or the presence&#xD;
      of extramedullary disease with immature cells (i.e., a myeloid sarcoma).4 Progression to BP&#xD;
      occurs at a median of 3-5 years from diagnosis in untreated patients, with or without an&#xD;
      intervening identifiable AP.5. After initiating therapy for CML, patients should be monitored&#xD;
      for treatment response assessment. The process of monitoring response to therapy is important&#xD;
      to determine if an adequate response is being achieved, or if patients should be transitioned&#xD;
      to a higher dose or different therapy Since therapy is continued indefinitely and relapse&#xD;
      occurs upon cessation of therapy in most patients, it is critical that the disease is closely&#xD;
      monitored. Continued monitoring over time is needed, even in the setting of an optimal&#xD;
      response, in order to detect and treat potential recurrence. Specific response criteria,&#xD;
      including optimal, suboptimal, and failure have been established to guide appropriate&#xD;
      increase or change of therapy&#xD;
