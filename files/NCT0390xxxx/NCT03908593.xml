  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety for 12- vs. 1-month of&#xD;
      pantoprazole treatment in preventing dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)-related upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal mucosal injury after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been no study using esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to compare the&#xD;
      differences in upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury (including reflux esophagitis) after 6&#xD;
      and 12 months of PPI treatment combined with two different DAPT regimens (clopidogrel plus&#xD;
      aspirin or ticagrelor plus aspirin).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective trial was designed as a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with patients allocated in a ratio of 1:1. Within 3 days after CABG, patients willing&#xD;
      to participate in the study will be carefully evaluated by a cardiac surgeon together with a&#xD;
      gastroenterologist based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be followed up to&#xD;
      12 months post-randomization unless death. The outcome will be collected at 2±1 days, 9±2&#xD;
      days, 1 month, 3 months (phone call), 6 months, 9 months (phone call), and 12 months after&#xD;
      CABG surgery, respectively. 13C urea breath testing is used to detect Helicobacter pylori (H.&#xD;
      pylori) infection before enrollment. At 6 and 12 months post-randomization, routine&#xD;
      laboratory tests and EGD will be performed respectively. Computed tomographic angiography&#xD;
      (CTA) or coronary angiography (CAG) is also required at 12 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of end of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The date on which the last subject completed the last follow-up was the endpoint of this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients randomized to the control group (1-month pantoprazole treatment group) should&#xD;
           continue PPI treatment if GERD-Q questionnaire score 8, endoscopic findings of reflux&#xD;
           esophagitis (LA-A and above), gastroduodenal mucosal injury of modified Lanza score of&#xD;
           4, or upper gastrointestinal bleeding at any time during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the ITT principle, all patients randomized in this study should be evaluated for&#xD;
      primary and secondary endpoints regardless of changes in PPI treatment. Thus, patients in the&#xD;
      1-month pantoprazole treatment group required PPI treatment at any time after 1 month and&#xD;
      could also be assessed for primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the results of the preliminary study, the cumulative incidence rate of gastric&#xD;
      and duodenal bulb erosion and ulcers of the 1-month PPI treatment group is assumed to be 36%,&#xD;
      and that of the 12-month PPI treatment group was assumed to be 18%. Based on a two-sided α of&#xD;
      0.05 and a randomization ratio of 1:1, a total of 186 subjects are required to provide a&#xD;
      power of 80%. Considering a 20% drop-out rate, the sample size of 232 subjects was&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two subgroup analyses will be performed in this study, including (1) H. pylori infection:&#xD;
      negative and positive; (2) DAPT: aspirin + clopidogrel and aspirin + ticagrelor.&#xD;

    <description>Gastroduodenal erosions and ulcers will be assessed according to the Lanza Endoscopic Scoring System. Lanza score is a categorical score (0-4) and defined as follows: 0, normal; 1, mucosal hemorrhages only; 2, 1-2 erosions; 3, 3-10 erosions; 4, &gt;10 erosions or an ulcer ≥3 mm. In addition, ≥1 ulcer with a diameter no less than 5mm will be grouped separately.</description>

    <description>According to the definition of non-CABG related bleeding in the modified TIMI criteria, the severity of UGIB is classified into 3 grades: major, minor and minimal. 1, Major: Clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of ≥5 g/dL. 2, Minor: Clinically overt signs of UGIB, resulting in hemoglobin drop of 3 to &lt;5 g/dL. 3, Minimal: Any overt bleeding event that does not meet the criteria above. According to the consensus updated by the Asia-Pacific working group in 2018, patients with hemodynamic shock and signs of UGIB should be offered urgent endoscopy after resuscitation and stabilization (Gut 2018; 67:1757-68).</description>
