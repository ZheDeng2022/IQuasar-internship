    <textblock>
      The proposed research will evaluate the ability of a mobile, rapid induction procedure to&#xD;
      engage individuals in ongoing medication assisted treatment. A total of 250 untreated&#xD;
      individuals meeting criteria for opioid use disorder and at high risk of opioid overdose will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. Recruitment will take place in two targeted neighborhoods of&#xD;
      Philadelphia (Kensington and South Philadelphia) with a high prevalence of fatal and&#xD;
      non-fatal opioid overdose. A total of 250 participants will be engaged in the research.&#xD;
      Following informed consent and determination of eligibility, 125 individuals will be enrolled&#xD;
      as they engage with the mobile, rapid induction team and 125 individuals will be enrolled as&#xD;
      they seek treatment from the CRC Episcopal Hospital (serving Kensington area) or BAC/CRC Hall&#xD;
      Mercer Community Mental Health (serving South Philadelphia). The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive four weeks of treatment with buprenorphine /naloxone and support for treatment&#xD;
      engagement provided by a case manager and a peer recovery specialist. All participants will&#xD;
      be assessed at baseline and then 1- and 6-month following enrollment. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      for the study is continued enrollment in medication-assisted treatment at 6-month&#xD;
      post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will evaluate the ability of a mobile, rapid induction procedure to&#xD;
      engage individuals in ongoing medication assisted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of the mobile, transitional MAT intervention on its&#xD;
           ability to engage participants in targeted, existing MAT treatment slots at 1- and&#xD;
           6-month post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of the mobile intervention on subsequent drug use and&#xD;
           overdoses at 6-month post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To assess the acceptability and costs of the intervention. The program and&#xD;
           patient costs of delivering and participating in the intervention will be documented.&#xD;

      1. Study Objectives Aim 1: To evaluate the impact of the mobile, transitional MAT&#xD;
           intervention on its ability to engage participants in targeted, existing MAT treatment&#xD;
           slots at 1- and 6-month post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of the mobile intervention on subsequent drug use and&#xD;
           overdoses at 6-month post-enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 3: To assess the acceptability and costs of the intervention. The program and&#xD;
           patient costs of delivering and participating in the intervention will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study participants who will receive buprenorphine/naloxone will be provided with&#xD;
           information, counseling, and support for selection of ongoing treatment options&#xD;
           including methadone maintenance (MMT), extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), or&#xD;
           continued treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study design Duration of Study Participation The duration of study participation&#xD;
           including screening/baseline assessments to follow-up will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Total Number of Subjects A total of 250 participants will be engaged in the research at&#xD;
           the time they seek treatment: 125 individuals will be enrolled as they engage with the&#xD;
           mobile, rapid induction team and 125 individuals will be enrolled as they seek treatment&#xD;
           from the BAC/CRC (treatment as usual).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject Recruitment The recruitment of participants for this study will be accomplished&#xD;
           using a community awareness campaign involving street outreach, targeted social media,&#xD;
           and local advertisement. This campaign will begin one month before activation of the&#xD;
           rapid induction intervention. During this time, the mobile assessment team will begin to&#xD;
           be present in the designated location where the Mobile Clinical Trials Unit (MCTU) will&#xD;
           be parked.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant Education and the Informed Consent Process Potential participants who&#xD;
           express interest in initiating treatment will be engaged in a structured approach to&#xD;
           education about the study and its procedures. The information delivered at this point&#xD;
           will be supportive and motivational and describe study participation as an opportunity&#xD;
           to consider options for treatment. It will also be explained that their participation&#xD;
           can contribute to a better understanding of the most effective ways to assist&#xD;
           individuals who want to begin treatment. Staff will make it clear that even if they do&#xD;
           not become engaged in treatment, their experiences are important and their contributions&#xD;
           to the research will be valuable. This discussion will offer potential participants a&#xD;
           chance to ask questions and receive prepared materials explaining the study and the&#xD;
           requirements for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those who appear to be eligible and express interest will begin the informed consent&#xD;
           process to allow for screening. The informed consent process will give the participant&#xD;
           an accurate understanding of the research procedures and make it clear that&#xD;
           participation is voluntary. The informed consent document will be read and reviewed with&#xD;
           the participant. The consent form includes clear language with special attention to the&#xD;
           provision of permissions to contact the participant and individuals they identify as&#xD;
           acceptable contacts if the research assistants are unable to make direct contact with&#xD;
           the participant for the 1- and 6-month assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Screening assessments For those who remain interested following discussions and appear&#xD;
           to meet eligibility criteria, the consent form will be signed and the screening visit&#xD;
           will be conducted. This visit will include completion of assessments to confirm&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Nurse Practitioner will complete a medical&#xD;
           history, a physical exam, a rapid blood test for HIV, a pregnancy test for women, and&#xD;
           collect 10ml of blood for liver function tests. Research staff will complete baseline&#xD;
           assessments. Those who are not eligible will receive a listing of treatment providers&#xD;
           and encouraged to make contact for help with their substance use problems. For those who&#xD;
           appear eligible following the screening visit, an appointment for initiating the&#xD;
           intervention will be scheduled within 1 or 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Measures All interviews will be administered by experienced research assistants&#xD;
           trained in the administration of the proposed assessments. Following confirmation of&#xD;
           eligibility, the mobile research assistants will complete the baseline assessment&#xD;
           (described below). The participant assessments in this research will be sharply focused&#xD;
           on the valid and reliable measurement of its primary endpoints i.e. ongoing treatment&#xD;
           engagement will be the primary endpoint on which the study is powered. The two groups&#xD;
           will be compared with respect to the rate of continued opioid use and subsequent&#xD;
           overdoses. All assessments will be completed by trained research staff (not clinicians)&#xD;
           at baseline, and again at 1- and 6-month post-enrollment. A follow-up rates of 95% and&#xD;
           90% at Month 1 and 6, respectively is anticipated. The assessments will take&#xD;
           approximately 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical history and examination including a blood test to evaluate the liver&#xD;
                function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Locator Data Collection: A detailed contact sheet (Locator Form) will be completed&#xD;
                for all subjects as part of the baseline assessment. The form will be updated at&#xD;
                each scheduled assessment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DSM-5 Substance Use Disorder Checklist: This form is a listing of the eleven DSM-5&#xD;
                criteria for substance use disorder. Opioids, cocaine, and alcohol use disorders&#xD;
                will be screened for confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A score of&#xD;
                4-6 is considered moderate severity and from 7-11 is considered severe substance&#xD;
                use disorder. An opioid use disorder score of 4 or greater will be required for&#xD;
                study eligibility. Alcohol use disorder and benzodiazepine scores of 4 or greater&#xD;
                will be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A study specific questionnaire that gathers socio-demographic information (e.g.&#xD;
                age, gender, race and ethnic identity, marital status, sexual orientation,&#xD;
                educational level, employment status, income and income sources) and descriptive&#xD;
                information about the subject's living situation and housing stability, history of&#xD;
                involvement with the criminal justice system, drug use, and drug treatment history.&#xD;
&#xD;
                o Addiction Severity Index (ASI) sections for Drugs and Alcohol and Medical Status:&#xD;
                The ASI is a structured interview developed to assess the range of problems seen in&#xD;
                drug users. The ASI produces severity ratings and composite scores in each of seven&#xD;
                areas, and each type score has been assessed with regard to validity and&#xD;
                reliability. Severity ratings and composite scores have demonstrated high levels of&#xD;
                inter-rater, test-retest, and concurrent reliability (Cacciola et al., 2008;&#xD;
                McLellan, Cacciola, Alterman, Rikoon, &amp; Carise, 2006; McLellan et al., 1992). The&#xD;
                Medical and the Drug and Alcohol sections will be administered at baseline, 1- and&#xD;
                6-month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): Given the important role of depression in&#xD;
                accessing and adhering to treatments for substance use disorder and other chronic&#xD;
                medical problems (Mahajan, Avasthi, Grover, &amp; Chawla, 2014; Tavakkoli, Ferrando,&#xD;
                Rabkin, Marks, &amp; Talal, 2013), the severity of depression using the 9-item Patient&#xD;
                Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be assessed. This brief assessment asks&#xD;
                participants to indicate the frequency of occurrence of each of the nine DSM-IV&#xD;
                diagnostic criteria for depression during the previous two weeks. This instrument&#xD;
                has been widely used in clinical research and has strong psychometric properties.&#xD;
                The PHQ-9 will be completed at baseline and month-1 and -6.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine drug screen using the CLIA waived® ACON Dip-and-Read 8-panel test for THC,&#xD;
                cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, PCP, methamphetamine, benzodiazepines,&#xD;
                barbiturates, and buprenorphine. The urine sample will be provided using standard&#xD;
                procedures with temperature monitoring to preclude tampering and dilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HIV testing: Chembio SURE CHECK HIV 1/2® rapid-HIV test kits will be used to detect&#xD;
                antibodies. These FDA approved and CLIA Waived kits produce results in 15 minutes&#xD;
                from a blood drop. For those who test antibody positive, additional blood will be&#xD;
                drawn for confirmatory testing via RNA viral load assay. Approximately 10% of&#xD;
                participants will test positive for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Economic evaluation: The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be performed&#xD;
                using data collected with questionnaires widely used for cost-effectiveness&#xD;
                analyses, the Drug Abuse Treatment Cost Analysis Program (DATCAP) and Non-Medical&#xD;
                and Other Services Form (NSMOS). The DATCAP is a reliable instrument widely used by&#xD;
                substance abuse treatment programs for the collection and organization of&#xD;
                programmatic costs (French et al. 1997). The NSMOS is a questionnaire adapted from&#xD;
                the Treatment Services Review (McLellan et al., 1992; Cacciola et al., 2008 ) for&#xD;
                individuals receiving substance abuse treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Overview of Interventions Rapid Induction Intervention (RI) The rapid induction&#xD;
           intervention will be delivered by the project's mobile team led by a nurse practitioner&#xD;
           supported by a certified peer recovery specialist (CPRS), and a case manager (CM). Team&#xD;
           members will work closely with each other and coordinate screening and treatment&#xD;
           initiation, medication adherence monitoring, and assessment and linkage to ongoing MAT.&#xD;
           Two half-time research assistants (RA) will participate as team members but will have&#xD;
           intervention responsibilities. The RAs will assist with the community awareness campaign&#xD;
           and recruitment and will conduct all assessments for the project. The mobile team will&#xD;
           be based at Prevention Point Philadelphia and will receive clinical supervision from the&#xD;
           mobile team's buprenorphine physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Induction: Once eligibility has been determined, the NP will begin preparing the&#xD;
           participant for induction, following the buprenorphine/naloxone induction protocol used&#xD;
           by D'Onofrio et al., 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) engagement during the month of intervention will be&#xD;
           facilitated by the Peer Recovery Specialist (PRS). The purpose of a PRS is to support&#xD;
           the participant in their recovery process. In addition, the project will provide&#xD;
           intensive training and ongoing consultation on MAT. The PRS hired for this study will&#xD;
           also receive intensive training focused on addiction as a chronic medical condition,&#xD;
           motivational enhancement strategies and facilitating short-term behavioral contracts.&#xD;
           The PRS will meet with the participant a minimum of 3 times per week and be available&#xD;
           for telephone counseling and support throughout the one-month intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mobile team's Case Management (CM) function will be performed by a master's level&#xD;
           social worker. The CM will have primary responsibility for identifying the treatment&#xD;
           program that best meets the needs of the participant. The CM effort will be sharply&#xD;
           focused on identifying and removing barriers to MAT treatment engagement. This will&#xD;
           include completing medication authorization forms and insurance enrollment if necessary,&#xD;
           and then making referrals to additional supports, including mental health treatment,&#xD;
           housing, medical, legal support, and peer-based recovery supports in the community. The&#xD;
           CM will work collaboratively with participants to remove barriers to care and to enhance&#xD;
           program outcomes and to provide psychosocial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The mobile team will insure that there is a clear plan for rapid engagement with ongoing&#xD;
           treatment as soon as possible. Buprenorphine/naloxone will be provided during the time&#xD;
           of transition to their long-term provider for up to 1 month. Telephone support will be&#xD;
           available should participants have questions or need assistance and the mobile team will&#xD;
           also have daily contact with participants until they complete contact with their ongoing&#xD;
           provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparison group - Treatment as usual During the same period of time, participants will&#xD;
           also be recruited at the City of Philadelphia Behavioral Health System Behavioral&#xD;
           Assessment Centers (BAC) and Crisis Response Centers (CRC) located at Episcopal Hospital&#xD;
           serving Kensington area and Hall Mercer BAC/CRC (a University of Pennsylvania program)&#xD;
           serving South Philadelphia area. Two research assistants from the TRI-PHMC will enroll&#xD;
           and follow-up 125 participants at BAC/ CRC. The participants will complete the same&#xD;
           assessments at baseline, 1- and 6-month follow-up. Authorization for the Philadelphia&#xD;
           Department of Public Health to look shared information about their subsequent use of&#xD;
           health department services (CARES database,&#xD;
           http://www.phila.gov/hhs/data/Pages/Cares.aspx) will also be requested in the consent&#xD;
           form. Research staff will only conduct assessments. Treatment engagement services will&#xD;
           be provided by the staff of the BAC/CRC as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject Withdrawal Participants may choose to withdraw from the study at any time. They&#xD;
           do this by providing verbal or written communication to this effect. Withdrawal from the&#xD;
           study will not impact access to care. The Principal Investigator may withdraw subjects&#xD;
           for reasons related to safety or for administrative reasons. It will be documented&#xD;
           whether or not each subject completes the study. Subjects who do not complete the&#xD;
           intervention will continue to be contacted to complete follow-up visits (Month 1 and 6)&#xD;
           to collect final evaluations and to assess adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical Plan 3.1. Data Quality Trained staff will review all forms prior to the&#xD;
           completion of the study visit in an effort to minimize problems associated with missing&#xD;
           values and incorrect skip patterns. All assessments will be recorded on final version of&#xD;
           the electronic Case Reporting Forms (eCRFs). eCRFs will also be developed to capture the&#xD;
           results of all biological assessments. All eCRFs will be completed using only&#xD;
           participant identifying numbers and will not include names, addresses, or other data&#xD;
           that could possibly be used to disclose the identity of the participant. Research staff&#xD;
           will be responsible for entering all data into the secure web-based developed on REDCap&#xD;
           (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is designed to comply with HIPAA regulations.&#xD;
           Data will be input with secure web authentication, data logging, and Secure Sockets&#xD;
           Layer (SSL) encryption. REDCap allows multisite access. It allows real-time data entry&#xD;
           validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails, and the ability to set&#xD;
           up a calendar to schedule and track critical study events such as participant visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data quality control process associated with data processing will consist of the&#xD;
           following stages: potential subject pre-screening for eligibility, registration, subject&#xD;
           eligibility confirmation, first data entry, second data entry in the form of 100%&#xD;
           interactive verification, data validation, and data auditing. A random 5% of the&#xD;
           questionnaires in each wave of data collection (i.e., baseline, 1- and 6-month) will be&#xD;
           subjected to database auditing throughout the trial. This data quality control process&#xD;
           ensures that all stages of the data handling process will be subjected to data quality&#xD;
           control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Data analyses Propensity score model to account for non-randomized allocation: The&#xD;
           participants are not randomly assigned to the mobile rapid induction intervention and&#xD;
           BAC/CRC groups, so it is possible that there will be confounding of the group effect&#xD;
           with the effects of characteristics of the participants. Propensity score approach&#xD;
           (Rosenbaum 2002, Rothman, Greenland et al. 2008) will be used to account for this. A&#xD;
           broad range of baseline variables will be entered as covariates in a logistic regression&#xD;
           model predicting treatment group, including age, race/ethnicity, gender, number of&#xD;
           previous overdoses, number of previous treatments for opiate use disorder, type of&#xD;
           opioid used, and depression. The model will yield predicted probabilities of BAC/CRC&#xD;
           group for all participants (the propensity score), and a five-level ordinal variable&#xD;
           based on the quintiles of the propensity score will be created. This ordinal variable&#xD;
           will be included as a stratum variable in our models.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses for the primary aim: i.e. to evaluate the impact of the mobile, transitional&#xD;
           MAT intervention on its ability to engage participants in targeted, existing MAT&#xD;
           treatment slots at 1- and 6-month post-enrollment. For each of the 1- and 6-month time&#xD;
           points, the participants will be classified as being engaged/not-engaged (where&#xD;
           non-engaged will include dropped out or missing). The groups will be compared on&#xD;
           engagement rates at the two time points using a repeated measures logistic regression&#xD;
           model, incorporating the propensity score as described above (Diggle, Heagerty et al.&#xD;
           2002). The fixed effects will be binary indicators of treatment group and time point;&#xD;
           test for a group by time interaction to assess whether the group effect differs at month&#xD;
           1 and month 6. As there are only two time points, the use an unstructured covariance&#xD;
           matrix to accommodate within-participant covariance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses for Aim 2: Repeated measures model will be run to compare the groups on the ASI&#xD;
           (addiction severity index) drug composite score at month-1 and 6. The model will be&#xD;
           similar to that described for the engagement analyses of Aim 1, but with a beta&#xD;
           distribution assumed for the response, to accommodate the bounded range (zero to one) of&#xD;
           the ASI composite scores. The groups will be compared on the number of overdoses per&#xD;
           participants using repeated measures Poisson regression models, if there is sufficient&#xD;
           variability in the number of overdoses reported. If a low rate of overdoses causes&#xD;
           convergence issues for the Poisson model, participants will be classified as having no&#xD;
           overdose versus at least one, and compare the groups using repeated measures logistic&#xD;
           regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Missing data. For the longitudinal analyses described above, premature discontinuation&#xD;
           from treatment and occasional missing daily use indicators will lead to incomplete data.&#xD;
           The repeated measures models described above can make use of all available data provided&#xD;
           by subjects, but the inferences drawn from them will be unaffected by the missing data&#xD;
           only if the missing data can be regarded as ignorable, essentially meaning that&#xD;
           missingness can be predicted/explained from the baseline data and from responses&#xD;
           obtained prior to drop-out. The sensitivity of our main analyses to the presence of&#xD;
           missing data will be assessed by performing a sensitivity analysis, in which estimates&#xD;
           of the group effect will be obtained under various non-ignorability assumptions.&#xD;
           Selection models will be used to examine the effects of missing data (Robins, Rotnitzky&#xD;
           et al. 1995), in which the probability of premature discontinuation at a time point as a&#xD;
           function of baseline characteristics and responses at previous time points will be&#xD;
           modeled using logistic regression models, and incorporate the predicted probabilities&#xD;
           into a weighted analysis of the main hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analyses for Aim 3: The total costs and per-participant costs of rapid initiation of MAT&#xD;
           for opioid treatment engagement will be estimated using a cost-offsets approach to&#xD;
           determine the economic value of this novel strategy. A cost-offsets approach requires a&#xD;
           comparison of the total cost of the intervention (proposed enhanced procedure or&#xD;
           treatment as usual) to the future costs of healthcare utilization avoided (i.e.,&#xD;
           benefits) due to the intervention. Healthcare utilization and medical costs will be&#xD;
           estimated before and after participants receive either rapid initiation of MAT for&#xD;
           opioid treatment engagement or treatment as usual. Information on healthcare utilization&#xD;
           will be collected from participants at each assessment when study-staff administer the&#xD;
           Non-Medical and Other Services Form (NSMOS; detailed description in Instruments&#xD;
           section). Medical costs associated with these treatments/services will be estimated&#xD;
           using Medicaid data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety and Adverse Events 4.1. Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) For this study, the&#xD;
           University of Pennsylvania established procedures and infrastructure for data and safety&#xD;
           monitoring will be used. During the course of the study, safety and data quality&#xD;
           monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis by the Principal Investigators and the&#xD;
           study staff. Study staff members are responsible for collecting and recording all&#xD;
           clinical data using the established MOP. This includes ensuring that all source&#xD;
           documents exist for the data on the Case Report Forms, ensuring all fields are completed&#xD;
           appropriately, and ensuring that all corrections are done according to Good Clinical&#xD;
           Practice (GCP). Any inconsistencies/deviations will be documented. The study Key&#xD;
           Personnel will review data on an ongoing basis and will document reviews by initialing&#xD;
           and dating reports. Study staff members conduct 100% quality assurance on data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff training will consist of an explanation of the protocol and review of the e-Case Report&#xD;
      Forms. In addition, the duties of each staff person will be outlined and all applicable&#xD;
      regulations will be reviewed. Senior personnel will supervise junior staff and provide&#xD;
      re-training in the study protocol as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Independent Monitor for this study is the University of Pennsylvania Center for Studies&#xD;
      on Addiction DSMB. The DSMB will review the study every 6 months for all the duration of the&#xD;
      study. The DSMB form could be find in Appendix at the end of this document. The PI will&#xD;
      provide a summary of the status of the project that occurs during the reporting period. These&#xD;
      data will also be reported to CDC on an annual basis as part of the progress report. The DSMB&#xD;
      report will include the participants' socio-demographic characteristics, expected versus&#xD;
      actual recruitment rates, treatment retention rates, any quality assurance or regulatory&#xD;
      issues that occurred during the past year, summary of SAEs, and any actions or changes with&#xD;
      respect to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Adverse Events Adverse events that occur at any point in the trial will be identified,&#xD;
      managed, and documented in accordance with reporting requirements of the the City IRB (the&#xD;
      IRB of record) and the sponsor (the CDC). Adverse events are defined as negative biologic&#xD;
      events and/or social harms that occur during the course of the trial. When needed, referrals&#xD;
      to medical treatment or specialists will be made. All patients will have comprehensive&#xD;
      psychiatric and medical screening prior to randomization and at each counseling and&#xD;
      assessment where evaluations for AEs will be routine. A member of the research team will be&#xD;
      available at all times to answer questions and assess possible AEs. Participants will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study if they show severe deterioration or if determined clinically&#xD;
      necessary for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Internal Monitoring and Auditing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oversight and Monitoring: The City of Philadelphia IRB will monitor the protection of human&#xD;
      subjects and the safe and secure collection and storage of data. This committee assesses all&#xD;
      studies before study initiation and then reviews protocols annually. The committee ensures&#xD;
      the scientific, technical, and statistical soundness of the research and guarantees that&#xD;
      methods for the ethical and safe treatment of human subjects are in place. The committee&#xD;
      scrutinizes the scientific and ethical aspects of protocols and provides for an objective and&#xD;
      ongoing assessment of the study's scientific and ethical integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol monitoring will ensure that the research protocol specified is being followed&#xD;
      without unauthorized deviations. Weekly meetings will be held to monitor the progress of the&#xD;
      trial. These meetings will involve the Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators, Project&#xD;
      Director, Site coordinator and other study staff. This will help to ensure standardized&#xD;
      application of the protocol and will serve as an ongoing mechanism by which project staff and&#xD;
      investigators will communicate in order to maintain a consistently high quality of study&#xD;
      conduct. Concerns identified will be addressed through training and retraining of personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database Auditing: Project director and RAs will review data entered into the database versus&#xD;
      that recorded on the CRFs. All accrued cases will be subjected to database auditing&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the trial. Depending on the data management findings, re-training&#xD;
      will be provided, should problems such as increased errors be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Auditing: Project director and staff RAs will review safety data recorded on the CRF&#xD;
      versus that contained on the actual source document (client chart, EHR). All accrued cases&#xD;
      will be subjected to auditing throughout the duration of the trial. A Regulatory Binder&#xD;
      Review by OHR will include the following essential documents: IRB Protocol, Consent Form and&#xD;
      Amendment Approvals, IRB Closure Letter, List of Authorized Signatures, Laboratory&#xD;
      Certifications, Protocol and Amendment Signature Pages, Financial Disclosure Questionnaires,&#xD;
      and Monitoring Log. Additional monitoring by OHR may include: source documentation&#xD;
      verification; adverse event documentation; and facility assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Security: Using network firewall technologies, the database will prevent the three major&#xD;
      sources of data security problems: unauthorized internal access to data, external access to&#xD;
      data, and malicious intent to destroy data and systems. Controlled user access will ensure&#xD;
      that only appropriate and authorized personnel are able to view, access, and modify trial&#xD;
      data. All modifications to data will document user access and data associated with the&#xD;
      modification, as well as values prior to modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of Training in Human Subject Research: All personnel working on this project will be&#xD;
      required to review the protocol, complete training in the protection of human subjects and&#xD;
      undergo training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Since self-report and medical data will be collected and stored as part of&#xD;
      this study, it is possible that subject privacy or confidentiality can be threatened. To&#xD;
      address this concern, the Data Management System has set up several safeguards to prevent&#xD;
      unauthorized access to study data. An automatically generated index number is assigned to a&#xD;
      subject's study identification number (unique for personnel and clients). A linked subject&#xD;
      identification table is created for the storing of subject name, address and telephone&#xD;
      contact information. This table uses the automatically generated index number rather than the&#xD;
      study identification number. The master subject map and subject identification information&#xD;
      tables are maintained in a separate database. Using this method, no identifying subject&#xD;
      information is directly linked to medical information or other study data. The present&#xD;
      research team has not experienced the unauthorized use of study data. A web-based data&#xD;
      collection procedure will minimize the possibility of loss of privacy or confidentiality. The&#xD;
      risk of a potential breach of confidentiality is addressed in the informed consent documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computers and Databases Trained staff will review all forms prior to the completion of the&#xD;
      study visit in an effort to minimize problems associated with missing values and incorrect&#xD;
      skip patterns. All assessments will be recorded on final version of the electronic Case&#xD;
      Reporting Forms (eCRFs). eCRFs will also be developed to capture the results of all&#xD;
      biological assessments. All eCRFs will be completed using only participant identifying&#xD;
      numbers and will not include names, addresses, or other data that could possibly be used to&#xD;
      disclose the identity of the participant. Research staff will be responsible for entering all&#xD;
      data into the secure web-based developed on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap&#xD;
      is designed to comply with HIPAA regulations. Data will be input with secure web&#xD;
      authentication, data logging, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. REDCap allows&#xD;
      multisite access. It allows real-time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range&#xD;
      checks), audit trails, and the ability to set up a calendar to schedule and track critical&#xD;
      study events such as participant visits.&#xD;
