  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among men.&#xD;
      While several new treatment options have recently become available, they are costly and have&#xD;
      a potential for significant, adverse side effects. Many patients diagnosed with HCC also&#xD;
      suffer from underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis. As many as 80-90% of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with HCC also have cirrhosis. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in cirrhosis is as&#xD;
      high as 65-90% and significantly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality as well as&#xD;
      decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has been extensively studied for usefulness&#xD;
      in liver disease, specifically to treat hepatic encephalopathy to and preserve and restore&#xD;
      muscle mass. Maintenance of liver function and prevention of PEM are essential for improving&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with HCC. Branched-chain amino acid supplementation in HCC has been&#xD;
      studied extensively in China &amp; Japan with multiple studies showing improvements in liver&#xD;
      function, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Additionally, patients in&#xD;
      treatment groups have shown improvement in quality of life indicators. However, these results&#xD;
      have yet to be replicated in the United States. Branched-chain amino acid supplementation may&#xD;
      be a safe, low-cost approach to improve survival, liver function indicators, and quality of&#xD;
      life for patients diagnosed with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with primary HCC will be randomized to either a treatment group,&#xD;
      which will receive standard of care and BCAA supplement or to a control group which will&#xD;
      receive standard of care and a maltodextrin placebo. Both groups will receive liver-directed&#xD;
      therapy including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and thermal ablation. All patients&#xD;
      will complete a quality of life survey (FACT-Hep) at each visit.&#xD;

      Products or Devices to be Studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branched Chain Amino Acid anhydrous blend (1250mg valine, 2500mg leucine, 1250mg isoleucine)&#xD;
      Pre-assigned IND number: 140871 Holder of the IND (Richard Marshall, MD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To evaluate the effect of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation on&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival in patients diagnosed with hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common adenocarcinoma affecting the liver.&#xD;
      Approximately 14 million people are affected globally and the number of cases is expected to&#xD;
      increase to 22 million by 2032. In the United States, HCC accounts for 5% of all&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths and has a 1-year survival rate of 41.5% and a 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      16.5%. Although several new treatment options have recently become available, they are&#xD;
      expensive and show a strong potential for adverse side effects. Regardless of treatment&#xD;
      modality, liver function maintenance is an essential component for improving outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver functions as a primary site for macronutrient, enzyme, vitamin, bile acid, and heme&#xD;
      metabolism as well as the breakdown and excretion of toxic waste products of metabolism.&#xD;
      Among the liver's many roles is the production of albumin, a serum protein responsible for&#xD;
      maintaining oncotic pressure and the transportation of nutrients throughout the body. Low&#xD;
      levels of albumin (hypoalbuminemia) are associated with severe malnutrition and can lead&#xD;
      edema due to decreased oncotic pressure. Hepatic tissue damage, tumor formation, and tumor&#xD;
      proliferation decreases the liver's functional capacity for executing these processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic injury to the hepatocytes can lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
      Once developed, tumor cells and stromal cells form a network called the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment which further contributes to tumor proliferation. Treatments to disrupt the&#xD;
      microenvironment (e.g. sorafenib) may be successful in reducing fibrosis, liver damage,&#xD;
      inflammation, and angiogenesis. These treatments are not without serious side effects&#xD;
      including: myocardial infarction, bleeding problems, bowel perforation, and hypertension to&#xD;
      name a few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic approaches to manage symptoms associated with HCC include late evening snacks and&#xD;
      protein supplementation. The rationale purports that improvements in nutritional quality will&#xD;
      alleviate catabolic stress, thereby reducing risks of associated complications of&#xD;
      malnutrition including: protein energy malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy. Further, the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, leucine, and&#xD;
      isoleucine may act on the same signaling pathways of chemotherapeutic pharmaceuticals in&#xD;
      addition to improving nutritional status in patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, BCAA supplementation has been explored as a possible treatment for hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma in conjunction with standard of care in Japan and China. A recent meta-analysis of&#xD;
      clinical studies from China and Japan supports the safety of BCAA supplementation and the&#xD;
      possible benefit of improving liver functional reserves and quality of life. However,&#xD;
      significant differences in study designs and BCAA doses make inferring conclusions from these&#xD;
      studies difficult. Moreover, studies don't adequately control for differences in dietary&#xD;
      intake between treatment groups which may skew results. To date, no clinical trials have been&#xD;
      conducted in the United States that examine the effects of BCAA supplementation in patients&#xD;
      with HCC. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of&#xD;
      BCAA supplementation in patients with HCC who undergo locoregional therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard of care for hepatocellular carcinoma consists of physician monitoring&#xD;
      following liver directed therapy and does not include any nutrition or dietary intervention&#xD;
      beyond meeting basic nutritional needs. The study procedures differ from standard of care&#xD;
      only by the addition of either a BCAA supplement or maltodextrin placebo, administration of a&#xD;
      quality of life survey (FACT-Hep), and a personalized diet prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure protein and energy intake is equivalent between groups, individualized diets will&#xD;
      be calculated by the dietitian based on current height, weight, and stress factors for those&#xD;
      in both arms of the study. The corresponding meal plan will be administered by the research&#xD;
      pharmacist. The intervention group receiving 10g of BCAA daily will receive a meal plan that&#xD;
      reflects a protein deficit of 10g below estimated needs (which will be covered by the BCAA&#xD;
      supplement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects will be enrolled. Patients who are seeking treatment in the interventional&#xD;
      radiology department at University Medical Center (UMC) will comprise the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of the full sample will take approximately 36 months and each participant will be&#xD;
      followed for 12 months after enrollment and initiation of the treatment. This study would&#xD;
      conclude approximately 48 months following first enrollment. Each individual's participation&#xD;
      in the study will be 12-14 months following their enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be educated about the study by an interventional radiologist and oncology&#xD;
      dietitian during their first visit to the interventional radiology clinic at UMC. After&#xD;
      providing informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be immediately started&#xD;
      on their dietary supplement (BCAA or placebo) for two weeks. BCAA supplements will be&#xD;
      dispensed a UMC pharmacist. Patients will then have a brief hospital stay at UMC (typically&#xD;
      ranging 6-24 hours) to receive their TACE and/or ablation procedure. All patients will be&#xD;
      assessed by an interventional radiologist or nurse practitioner prior to discharge, and those&#xD;
      undergoing a TACE procedure will also have a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) drawn. After&#xD;
      discharge patients will have a one month, three month, 6 month, 9 month, and 12 month follow&#xD;
      up in the interventional radiology clinic where they will meet with the physician and&#xD;
      dietitian. A detailed list of procedures is provided below. Patients may require additional&#xD;
      visits if it is determined that they need additional local therapies (repeat TACE and/or&#xD;
      Ablation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branched-chain amino acid supplementation. Risks: Based on data from prior studies,&#xD;
      participants receiving BCAA supplementation protocol may experience nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, diarrhea or hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maltodextrin supplementation. Risks: Maltodextrin is a sugar. Consuming maltodextrin may&#xD;
      cause a temporary rise in blood sugar. However the amounts consumed for this study will be&#xD;
      very small. There are no known risks associated with its use. Maltodextrin is affirmed by the&#xD;
      FDA as GRAS per Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 184.1444.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fact-Hep questionnaire. Risks: there are no known risks to questioning about health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event (SAE): events including death, a life-threatening adverse experience,&#xD;
      inpatient hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, and persistent or&#xD;
      significant disability or incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event (AE): any health-related, unfavorable or unintended medical occurrence that&#xD;
      happens throughout study participation. Examples of adverse events include but are not&#xD;
      limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinically significant laboratory or clinical test result. An event that results in missing&#xD;
      a study visit. An event that requires a visit to a physician. An event that occurs as a&#xD;
      result of a study procedure. Unanticipated or untoward medical events that may be study&#xD;
      related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator as they are collected from the&#xD;
      participant. Adverse event data will be analyzed quarterly, whereas serious or&#xD;
      life-threatening adverse events will necessitate immediate reporting and follow-up. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that most adverse events will be mild and the participant will be able to resume&#xD;
      activities within one to two days of reporting the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be&#xD;
      reported to the IRB and FDA. Unexpected problems involving risks to participants or others&#xD;
      include incidents only if the incident is unexpected, related or possibly related to&#xD;
      participation in the research, and indicated that subjects or others are at a greater risk of&#xD;
      harm than was previously known or recognized. A SAE will result in the unblinding of the&#xD;
      participant and will be reported to the IRB and FDA per CFR § 312.32(c)(5). Any action&#xD;
      resulting in unblinding, and/or a temporary or permanent suspension of this study (e.g., IRB&#xD;
      actions, or actions by the PI and/or co-investigators) will be reported to the appropriate&#xD;
      officials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggregate comparisons of AE and SAE between study arms will occur after 50% of the&#xD;
      participants are enrolled. If there is evidence of a significant, clinically relevant&#xD;
      difference in SAE between groups, the study will be unblinded; and in the event the BCAA&#xD;
      group experiences significantly fewer SAEs, the placebo group will be offered the BCAA&#xD;
      supplement. Conversely, if the BCAA group experiences significantly more SAEs, the&#xD;
      supplementation will be terminated and follow-up will continue as planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 subjects will be recruited (20 in each intervention and control group). Sample&#xD;
      size was determined to achieve a power of 0.8 for a two-sided test (α = 0.05) for a balanced&#xD;
      study design. The results of the power analysis indicate that this can be achieved with a&#xD;
      sample ranging from 13-21 patients in each arm with the assumption that 1 year mortality will&#xD;
      be 41.5% in the control group (mortality rate derived from epidemiological data) and a&#xD;
      mortality rate ranging from 85 - 95% in the intervention group. Progression-free survival and&#xD;
      overall survival will be examined using survival regression analyses while controlling for&#xD;
      relevant covariates (age, demographics, etc.). Quality of life, Child Pugh score, and&#xD;
      biomarkers of liver function will be examined using repeated measures ANOVA with contrasts&#xD;
      between the treatment groups. Tolerability of the BCAA supplement will be assessed by&#xD;
      examining the number of adverse effects reported by participants. The severity of the adverse&#xD;
      events will be assessed by the physician and frequency differences between groups will be&#xD;
      compared using Χ² test statistic.&#xD;
