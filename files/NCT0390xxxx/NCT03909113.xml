  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk protein allergy is defined as an immunological reaction to one or more milk&#xD;
      proteins. A variety of symptoms can be suggestive for cow's milk protein allergy . Cow's milk&#xD;
      protein allergy is suspected clinically in 5-15% of infants, while most estimates of&#xD;
      prevalence of cow's milk protein allergy vary from only 2 to 5 %. Confusion regarding cow's&#xD;
      milk protein allergy prevalence is often due to differences in study populations, study&#xD;
      design and a lack of defined diagnostic criteria. The importance of defined diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria needs to be emphasised. It precludes infants from an unnecessary diet and avoids&#xD;
      delay in diagnosis, which can lead to malnutrition. The treatment of cow's milk protein&#xD;
      allergy is the dietary elimination of cow's milk proteins. In non-breastfed infants and&#xD;
      children less than 2 years of age, a substitute formula is mandatory as prescribed by several&#xD;
      international scientific societies. Extensively hydrolyzed formulas are used as therapeutic&#xD;
      formulas. An extensively hydrolysed formula is often a whey or casein based formula in which&#xD;
      the protein has been chopped up in smaller pieces that are less allergenic. Because of high&#xD;
      cross-reactivity (up to 80%) and nutritional inadequacy, the use of any other animal milk or&#xD;
      soy-based formula is precluded.The infant should be maintained on an elimination diet until&#xD;
      the child is between 9-12 months of age or at least for 6 months, whichever occurs first. In&#xD;
      most cases, symptoms will improve substantially within 2-4 weeks if diagnosis is correct.&#xD;
      According to consensus in literature, a therapeutic formula is a formula tolerated by at&#xD;
      least 90% (with 95% confidence) of cow's milk protein allergy infants. The primary study&#xD;
      outcome will be the evaluation of the hypoallergenicity of a new aminoacid based formula in&#xD;
      children with confirmed immunoglobulin (Ig)E- mediated CMA. According to the American Academy&#xD;
      of Pediatrics (AAP) Subcommittee on Nutrition and Allergic Diseases a hypoallergenic formula&#xD;
      must be tested in infants and children with hypersensitivity to cow's milk proteins, with&#xD;
      findings verified by elimination-challenge tests under double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      conditions (DBPCFC).&#xD;
