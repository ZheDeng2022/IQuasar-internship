  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether allowing ingestion of&#xD;
      sub-threshold amounts of peanut in those with a high threshold (tolerate at least 143 mg&#xD;
      peanut protein on supervised double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge [DBPCFC])&#xD;
      will be associated with attaining even higher thresholds over time in children with high&#xD;
      threshold peanut allergy compared to those avoiding peanut. The secondary clinical objectives&#xD;
      include assessing the development of sustained unresponsiveness (SU, a surrogate term for&#xD;
      tolerance without daily ingestion), effects on quality of life, and safety compared to those&#xD;
      avoiding peanut. Additionally, this study will phenotype the allergic response to peanut&#xD;
      based on threshold and response to exposure. Mechanistic study objectives will determine the&#xD;
      immune and molecular basis of the high threshold endotype, identify predictors of response to&#xD;
      exposure, and determine mechanisms and biomarkers of remission.&#xD;

    <description>The Food Allergy Quality of Life-Parental Burden (FAQL-PB) Scale is a 17-item instrument. It utilizes a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). The number circled for each question is summed to provide a total continuous score with a higher score indicating greater burden on the family. Scores can range from 0 to 102 or can be divided by 17 to obtain a mean total score from 0 to 6.</description>
