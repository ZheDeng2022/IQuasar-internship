  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the germline and somatic mutations underlying the development of&#xD;
      ADPKD in order to better understand the genetic mechanism responsible for the cystic&#xD;
      transformation. Once identified, these mutations could help us understand better the&#xD;
      mechanism leading to the development of this disease and may explain at least in part the&#xD;
      phenotypic variability.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presentation of ADPKD renal and extrarenal manifestations varies widely, even within&#xD;
      families, and has been attributed to numerous genetic factors. One principal explanation came&#xD;
      with the discovery that renal cyst lining cells from ADPKD patients undergo secondary somatic&#xD;
      mutations, selective loss of the second copy of a respective normal polycystic kidney disease&#xD;
      (PKD) gene. These somatic mutations can occur in either polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) or&#xD;
      polycystic kidney disease 2 (PKD2). Furthermore, various cysts in the same patient have been&#xD;
      reported to harbor different somatic mutations. These findings implicated a cellular&#xD;
      recessive mechanism for cyst formation in ADPKD, suggesting the possibility that the observed&#xD;
      intra-familial variation in disease phenotype may, at least in part, be explained by&#xD;
      variation in mutation type, the timing and number of somatic &quot;second-hit&quot; mutations in&#xD;
      individual family members affected with the disease. However, there is currently very little&#xD;
      known about the cellular genetic mechanism leading to cysts development and very few studies,&#xD;
      addressing this issue.&#xD;

      Dr. Rennert's Molecular Genetic Research laboratory personnel at the Pathology and Laboratory&#xD;
      Medicine Department of Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) will coordinate the process of sample&#xD;
      handling with the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be using native kidney tissue from ADPKD subjects received in the Surgical&#xD;
      Pathology Laboratory (Starr 10), at the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. The&#xD;
      kidney tissue will be collected on the day of the native nephrectomy, following examination&#xD;
      and clearance by the surgical pathologist. Immediately after the ADPKD kidney is removed, it&#xD;
      will be collected in the Operating Room (OR) using a sterile container and a co-investigator&#xD;
      will deliver the specimen to Surgical Pathology.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria include patients with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease caused by&#xD;
        ADPKD who are scheduled for native nephrectomy. The clinical indications for native&#xD;
        nephrectomy will be determined by the surgeon prior to enrollment of the subject. These&#xD;
        patients will be identified during the pre-operative evaluation that occurs prior to the&#xD;
        surgery. At the time of this evaluation, subject eligibility will be assessed by a&#xD;
        co-investigator and their willingness to participate will be evaluated. Subjects who agree&#xD;
        to participate will provide informed consent, and blood samples (30 mL) will be obtained&#xD;
        for extraction of nucleic acids, in addition to the routine preoperative blood tests.&#xD;
