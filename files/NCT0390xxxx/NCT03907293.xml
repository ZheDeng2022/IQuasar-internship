  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of a cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme on blood&#xD;
      protein molecules that may improve the function of arteries in coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
      patients who have suffered a heart attack. CAD patients who have either agreed or disagreed&#xD;
      to take part in a CR programme will be recruited. This will allow a comparison of the study&#xD;
      measurements between a group of patients who complete a CR programme and a group of patients&#xD;
      who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other objective of this study is to perform interviews with the study participants and&#xD;
      their significant others (i.e. spouse, family member, or a close friend) to listen to the&#xD;
      reasons why patients agreed or disagreed to take part in a CR programme.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme is an established method of secondary&#xD;
      prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, there is a body of evidence that&#xD;
      supports the ability of this intervention to reduce hospital readmissions and cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality. However, despite the proven benefit, CR programmes are underutilised worldwide.&#xD;
      Moreover, the molecular mechanisms responsible for orchestrating the beneficial physiological&#xD;
      adaptations induced by a CR programme are poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will evaluate the effect of a CR programme on novel molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms and endothelial function in post-myocardial infarction CAD patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews will be conducted with study participants and their significant&#xD;
      others (i.e. spouse, family member, or a close friend) to explore the reasons why patients&#xD;
      may agree or disagree to take part in a CR programme. Altogether, this study will provide&#xD;
      physiological and detailed qualitative information that may help to provoke an increased&#xD;
      participation in CR programmes.&#xD;
