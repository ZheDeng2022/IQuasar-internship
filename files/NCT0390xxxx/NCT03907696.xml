      This study examines the effect of including a novel Anti-stigma Intervention Curriculum&#xD;
      (ASIC) during a clinical rotation in psychiatry during medical school. It addresses stigma in&#xD;
      medical students' perceptions of psychiatric patients, psychiatric illnesses and treatments,&#xD;
      and the knowledge base of psychiatry in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical students from eight hospitals were divided into intervention (one hospital, n=57) and&#xD;
      control (seven hospitals, n=163) arms at the beginning of a 6-week psychiatry rotation&#xD;
      throughout one academic year (2017/18). The students completed the Attitudes to Psychiatry&#xD;
      scale (ATP-30) and the Attitudes toward Mental Illness scale (AMI) at rotation onset and&#xD;
      conclusion. The ASIC was designed to target prejudices and stigma by direct informal&#xD;
      encounters with people with severe mental illness (SMI) during periods of remission and&#xD;
      recovery. Supervised small group discussions followed those encounters in order to facilitate&#xD;
      processing of thoughts and emotions that ensued, and to discuss salient topics, including&#xD;
      psychiatric care, evidence-based medicine in psychiatry, and the neuroscientific&#xD;
      underpinnings of clinical psychiatry.&#xD;

      Design and participants- This study used a controlled trial design. The study population&#xD;
      consisted of medical students during their six-week psychiatry clerkship. The study was&#xD;
      conducted between November 2017 and July 2018 in eight academic hospitals in central Israel.&#xD;
      There were 16 groups of students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm included 3 groups of students (n=57) at a single general hospital, and&#xD;
      the control group was comprised of 13 groups of students (n=163) from six psychiatric&#xD;
      hospitals (n=139) and one general hospital (n=24). All students were informed that the&#xD;
      purpose of the study was to explore their attitudes about people with mental illness and&#xD;
      about psychiatry in general at the beginning (baseline) and at the end (endpoint) of their&#xD;
      rotation. The participants were assured that their responses would remain confidential, and&#xD;
      that they would not influence their rotation grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure - The intervention and control groups received the same lecture and practical&#xD;
      training components. Topics covered in the lectures included psychopathology,&#xD;
      psychopharmacological treatment, psychotherapy, and forensic psychiatry. Practical training&#xD;
      included participation in inpatient rounds, visits at outpatient clinics and&#xD;
      consultation-liaison services, and seminars consisting of patient interviews and discussions&#xD;
      of clinical cases. All students were placed in a psychiatric ward, under the supervision and&#xD;
      responsibility of psychiatric residents and senior psychiatrists. Each ward had a range of 4&#xD;
      to 7 students assigned to it. During the rotation, students assumed supervised clinical&#xD;
      responsibility for at least one clinical case. Although all students were exposed to a&#xD;
      variety of patients in different clinical scenarios, they were exposed mostly to acutely ill&#xD;
      inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention The Anti-Stigma Interventions Curriculum (ASIC) component that was added&#xD;
      to the intervention group was designed to target stigma towards psychiatric patients,&#xD;
      psychiatric treatment, and the knowledge base of clinical practice in psychiatry. A first&#xD;
      part, aimed at reducing stigma towards psychiatric patients, consisted of two forms of direct&#xD;
      encounters with individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) in recovery or rehabilitation:&#xD;
      1) A two-hour panel of three people who shared their personal stories as consumers of mental&#xD;
      health services, followed by an open discussion with the students; and 2) A visit to a&#xD;
      rehabilitation center, which included direct contact with the consumers. The emphasis in both&#xD;
      of those encounters was on exposing students to the competence and strengths of the&#xD;
      individuals, rather than to the symptoms and signs of their underlying illnesses. The second&#xD;
      part, which was designed to target stigma towards psychiatric treatment and the knowledge&#xD;
      base of clinical practice in psychiatry, included small group discussions (20 minutes each)&#xD;
      on the efficacy of different treatments, the clinical utility of admission to inpatient&#xD;
      wards, evidence-based medicine in psychiatry, and the biological pathways underpinning&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted after receiving Helsinki ethics committee approval for a multicenter&#xD;
      study from the University of Tel Aviv Institutional Review Board. Because the ethics&#xD;
      committee approval was contingent on personal information being de-identified, the&#xD;
      investigators only used aggregate, unpaired pre- and post-rotation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study evaluations Participants completed one socio-demographic and two self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires, the Attitudes to Psychiatry (ATP-30)22, and the Attitudes to Mental Illness&#xD;
      (AMI)7, which were administrated through a secured online server (SurveyMonkeyÂ®). The ATP-30&#xD;
      consists of 30 items, and it measures medical students' attitudes towards eight different&#xD;
      attitudinal domains: 1) Psychiatric patients; 2) Psychiatric illness; 3) Psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment; 4) Psychiatric institutions; 5) Psychiatric knowledge base in clinical practice;&#xD;
      6) Psychiatric education; 7) Psychiatry as a career choice; and 8) Psychiatrists. The AMI&#xD;
      consists of 20 items, and it measures medical students' attitudes to mental illnesses and,&#xD;
      more specifically, towards their causes, treatments, and impact on individuals and society.&#xD;
      Each item in both questionnaires is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly&#xD;
      agree to strongly disagree. Some items are negatively phrased in order to minimize the&#xD;
      likelihood of social desirability bias, and higher composite scores indicate more favorable&#xD;
      attitudes (less stigma) toward mental illness. Both ATP-30 and AMI have been shown to have&#xD;
      good psychometric properties, and both have been translated into many languages and used in&#xD;
      many countries worldwide.7,22&#xD;
