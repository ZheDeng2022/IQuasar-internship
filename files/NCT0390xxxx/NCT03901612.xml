  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fast track to Extubation after cardiothoracic surgery is becoming more common after a number&#xD;
      of reports showing it is safe and effective. However, It has introduced new challenges to&#xD;
      pain control. Intubated patients require larger doses of opioids and benzodiazepines for&#xD;
      comfort. In patients who are awake and spontaneously breathing, pain and agitation cannot be&#xD;
      treated with lower doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some centers still administer continuous infusions of opioid and benzodiazepines to extubated&#xD;
      patients. These infusions may not be necessary and may even be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent pilot study (In press in Journal of cardio thoracic vascular anesthesia ) in our&#xD;
      Vinmec hospitals performing open heart surgeries of peri-operative regional analgesia by&#xD;
      Continuous Bilateral Erector Spinae Plane Blocks in adult showed that the pain relief was&#xD;
      efficient and the requirement for opioids was zero in post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It confirmed that the impact of regional anesthesia techniques on main procedure-specific&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes is very important in opioids decreased use in the context of&#xD;
      fast-track programs that are fully suggested after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In April 2017 we introduced the technique of ESP block for open heart surgeries in Adults and&#xD;
      in pediatric. At the beginning we performed single shot block and the patients still needed&#xD;
      during around 30 to 40 hours small doses of opioids to release their pain according to the&#xD;
      evaluation by Comfort-B,FLACC VAS Scales. Since we are performing continuous peri-operative&#xD;
      regional analgesia by Bilateral ESP catheters the requirement for additional opioids to&#xD;
      release the pain is zero based on our practice of 480 ESP catheters for open heart surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to compare the 2 analgesic techniques and analyze the post operative opioid&#xD;
      consumption, the quality of recovery and the quality of life after the surgery.&#xD;

      Methodology With the Approval of Ethical committee of VinMec Healthcare and after Patient's&#xD;
      information and consent from guardian or parents, adults will be randomized via a random&#xD;
      number generator into one of two treatment groups by the person who obtained consent which is&#xD;
      prescribed in the nurse preparation file&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: will receive a single shot dose of local anesthetic Ropivacaine throw ESP catheters&#xD;
      and 6 hours after continuous infusion of Iso saline with a rescue analgesia in case of pain&#xD;
      according to the bellow protocol Group 2 :will received a single shot dose of local&#xD;
      anesthetic Ropivacaine throw ESP catheters and 6 hours after a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      Ropivacaine with a rescue analgesia if needed according to the bellow protocol Catheter&#xD;
      Performance The anesthesia team will perform to all patients without exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (Group I &amp; II) for open heart surgery after the anesthesia induction a bilateral insertion of&#xD;
      an Erector Spinae Plane Block catheter under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient in right lateral decubitus. The anesthesiologist will use an Ultrasound linear probe&#xD;
      at T4 level and identify the T4 transverse process. By hydro-dissection he will identify the&#xD;
      inter-fascial space between the Inter-transverse ligament anteriorly and the Erector Spinae&#xD;
      Muscle posteriorly to insert under ultrasound vision a catheter . The tip of the catheter&#xD;
      should be at T5 Transverse level seen by ultrasound. The anesthesiologist check the right&#xD;
      position of the catheter with a dextrose 5% injection = 1 to 3 mL under ultrasound vision and&#xD;
      see the spread of the dextrose in the inter-fascial space which sign that the catheter is not&#xD;
      intra-vascular. This procedure will be bilateral. The catheter will have a yellow label on&#xD;
      the Huer®-Lock connector to identify clearly that it is regional analgesia catheter to&#xD;
      prevent any errors of miss injection. (Yellow is the international identification of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia analgesia lines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this control an induction low dose is injected. Table 1 Induction dose Patient 30 - 40&#xD;
      kg = 6 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side Patient 40 - 50 kg = 8 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side&#xD;
      Patient 50 - 60 kg = 10 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side Patient 60 - 70 kg = 12 mL of&#xD;
      Ropivacaine 0.5% / side Patient &gt; 70 kg = 14 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side 5h after, the ESP&#xD;
      catheter induction, prepare the solution in the pump The clinical research nurse specially&#xD;
      trained for this study will proceed to the randomization of the patient according to the&#xD;
      randomization table and prepare the solution in the pump as per attached protocol. They will&#xD;
      put the number of patient's randomization on the pump. The nurse receives instruction to keep&#xD;
      strictly confidential the content of the pumps. They will deliver the prepared pumps to the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and anesthesia nurse in charge of the patient. They will connect the pumps&#xD;
      to the patient and start the infusion 6 hours after as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 &amp; Group 2 will have the blinded solution in the pump ♣ Table 2 Intermittent Automatic&#xD;
      bolus For post operative ESP catheter infusion Patient 30 - 40 kg = 6 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5%&#xD;
      / side/ 6h Patient 40 - 50 kg = 8 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side/ 6h Patient 50 - 60 kg = 10&#xD;
      mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side/ 6h Patient 60 - 70 kg = 12 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side/ 6h&#xD;
      Patient &gt; 70 kg = 14 mL of Ropivacaine 0.5% / side/ 6h (The bolus on the second catheter will&#xD;
      be delayed by 1 hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess Pain Level All the participants to this studies were trained to the protocol last&#xD;
           January 2018 and the nurse trained to random performance and data collection. For all&#xD;
           groups . The nurse will assess pain level at rest and mob after extubation and also the&#xD;
           Localization of the pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sternum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drains If pain FLACC &gt; 3 or VAS at rest or at Mob &gt;4&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If Extension problem increase IAB 2 mL/catheter of the solution inside the&#xD;
                     pump (DOUBLE BLINDED neither the patient, the physician in charge of the&#xD;
                     patient and the investigator know what is in the pump .on the side concerned&#xD;
                     (by increasing the volume we will increase the extension of the analgesia&#xD;
                     block. This volume increasing will be limited to only one increase. If still&#xD;
                     pain after the anesthesiologist is not allowed to increase again the volume&#xD;
                     and should shift to rescue analgesia described below)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  IF Not the patient will receive a dose of morphine as follow :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphin 50 mcg/kg/min if patient is still intubated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morphine PCA mode rescue : if patient extubation:&#xD;
&#xD;

                this technique and commonly used in open heart surgeries. Morphine 30 mcg/kg/h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter Removal A Bi-daily inspection of the catheters insertion points will be done.&#xD;
           If redness around puncture point the catheters will be removed and shift to classical IV&#xD;
           analgesia to prevent any infection. It will be declared as a minor incident in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESP catheters will be removed 2 hours after drain removal maximum 56h after insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 h. after Drain removal and ESP catheter removed the analgesia in both group will be with&#xD;
      the following antalgics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paracetamol Systematically 1g/6h&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ketorolac 30 mg IV every 8h ♣ Scales evaluate the pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Before extubation FLACC scale at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After extubation and still drains will remain we will use VAS Scale at rest and at&#xD;
                Mob (sitting in bed rotation of the thorax) Localization of the pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sternum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drains ¬ After drains removal we will use FLACC Scale rest and Mob ( sitting in bed&#xD;
           rotation of the thorax) and pain localization A check list anesthesia protocol will be&#xD;
           provided for each patient and check list for the pump solution will be provided for the&#xD;
           nurse in charge of randomization and preparation of the pump ♣ Statistical analysis and&#xD;
           sample size calculation Based on our prior institutional unpublished retrospective data&#xD;
           of maximal pain scores from 24 - 48 hours post-surgery in patients who received Single&#xD;
           shot ESP bl0cks who underwent open heart surgeries (mean 3 with standard deviation 2.2)&#xD;
           We determine that a total of 18 patients per arm will be needed to achieve A decrease in&#xD;
           mean pain of 1.5 with 80% power with 5% alpha. We will assume up to 10% lost to follow&#xD;
           up and 10% of patients would be non-compliant so we will enroll 25 patients in each&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
