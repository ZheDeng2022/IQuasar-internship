  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the addition of NT-I7 to atezolizumab provides&#xD;
      clinically meaningful outcomes for patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 naive or relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      high-risk melanoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) and cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect of NT-I7 (rhIL-7-hyFc) in combination with atezolizumab (MPDL3280A,&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1) in patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 naïve or relapsed/refractory high-risk skin&#xD;
      cancers including cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC), Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) and&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, including the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), of NT-I7 in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two phases to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1b, a NT-I7 dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD or RP2D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2a, a non-randomized parallel dose expansion phase to confirm the MTD or RP2D in&#xD;
           both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (checkpoint inhibitors, CPI) naïve patients with cSCC and MCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 relapsed/refractory patients with cSCC, MCC and melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients A total of up to 84 patients will be enrolled; Up to 24 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Phase 1b (up to 6 patients per dose level, using 3 + 3 design), and 60&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in the Phase 2a (24 patients in Arm I, i.e., 12 patients for each&#xD;
      indication, and 36 in Arm II, i.e., 12 patients for each indication).&#xD;
