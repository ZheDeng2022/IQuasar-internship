      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a robotic mediated&#xD;
      therapy in a clinical setting and its potential benefit for patients with rotator cuff tear&#xD;
      associated with pseudoparalysis. Ten patients with clinical signs of pseudoparalysis will be&#xD;
      recruited through doctors and physical therapists based on eligibility criteria. Enrolled&#xD;
      patients will conduct a specific trainings program with the MJS Tecnobody (Multi Joint System&#xD;
      614P Tecnobody Srl, IT) three times a week over a period of six weeks. Feasibility assessment&#xD;
      will be performed six and twelve weeks after baseline and secondary outcomes (Oxford shoulder&#xD;
      score, subjective shoulder value, pain level during activity of daily living, active shoulder&#xD;
      flexion and abduction and quality of life EQ-5D-5L)will be assessed at baseline, six and&#xD;
      twelve weeks after the beginning. Statistical analysis will be descriptive and secondary&#xD;
      analysis will be analysed with a univariate paired non-parametric analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears are a common disorder in chronic shoulder pain. Common Complaints are&#xD;
      pain, loss of range of motion and loss of strength. 20% of all tears are massive, in&#xD;
      re-ruptures even 80%, with at least two tendons involved and this could lead to&#xD;
      pseudoparalysis. The recommendation for the initial treatment is non-operative with physical&#xD;
      therapy although people often receive a shoulder endoprosthesis. Robotic mediated therapy in&#xD;
      patients with neurological disorders is already common, in rotator cuff tears it is less&#xD;
      frequent and evidence is rare though. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of a robotic mediated therapy in a clinical setting, in terms of&#xD;
      satisfaction, compliance and tolerance, and its potential benefit for patients with rotator&#xD;
      cuff tear associated with pseudoparalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with clinical signs of pseudoparalysis will be recruited in the Schulthess&#xD;
      clinic in Zurich through doctors and physical therapists of the shoulder and elbow surgery&#xD;
      department based on eligibility criteria. Eligible patient will be enclosed after signing the&#xD;
      informed consent. The patients will conduct a specific trainings program with the MJS&#xD;
      Tecnobody (Multi Joint System 614P Tecnobody Srl, IT) three times a week over a period of six&#xD;
      weeks. The training is guided by a specialised physical therapist and the trainings program&#xD;
      is developed by physical therapists and doctors of the Schulthess clinic based on current&#xD;
      literature. Feasibility assessment will be performed six and twelve weeks after baseline and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (Oxford shoulder score, subjective shoulder value, pain level during&#xD;
      activity of daily living, active shoulder flexion and abduction and quality of life EQ-5D-5L)&#xD;
      will be assessed at baseline, six and twelve weeks after the beginning. Primary analysis will&#xD;
      be descriptive and secondary analysis will be analysed with a univariate paired&#xD;
      non-parametric analysis. All statistical tests will be two-sided and the level of&#xD;
      significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05. All analyses will be exploratory. The author expects,&#xD;
      based on recent literature, that patients will accept well the MJS treatment and show high&#xD;
      compliance and satisfaction, in particular if it is associated with improved active range of&#xD;
      motion, shoulder function and quality of life at final follow-up.&#xD;
