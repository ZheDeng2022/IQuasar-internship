  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that patients on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) have high plasma&#xD;
      chromium level. There is reason to believe that TPN solutions contain chromium and possibly&#xD;
      other trace elements as contaminants. Chromium in particular can lead to kidney damage. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research are 1). to collect discarded TPN samples from patients on TPN for&#xD;
      analysis and compare analyzed concnetrations of trace elements to prescribed concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) analyze small volume parenterals obtained from a TPN supplier for evaluation of trace&#xD;
      elements contcentrations to be compared with what is reported on the label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) retrospectively collect blood levels of chromium from charts of patients on home TPN who&#xD;
      consented to have their TPN samples analyzed (#1 above), as well as prescribed Cr in their&#xD;
      TPN at the time blood levels are recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intestinal Failure (IF) occurs when a person's gut cannot work well enough to absorb enough&#xD;
      nutrients and fluids. In these cases, life-saving nutrition called Parenteral Nutrition (PN)&#xD;
      is given through their veins for months or years. Unfortunately, tubes of certain nutrients&#xD;
      that are added to PN solutions have contaminants such as chromium (Cr). While the body needs&#xD;
      a very small amount of Cr to function properly, too much is unsafe. Patients on PN may&#xD;
      therefore get too much Cr in the PN fluids. Too much Cr can affect kidndy function. In&#xD;
      addition to chromium, it is also possible that other trace elements are present as&#xD;
      contaminants. While optimal nutrition if important for growth in children, too much of any&#xD;
      nutriteint is potenially harmful. The goals of the current study therefore are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure and compare the amount of chromium, cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum,&#xD;
           selenium, vanadium and zinc in a sample of discarded PN bags versus the amount of each&#xD;
           actually ordered in those PN bags to determine the level of contamination for each of&#xD;
           those trace elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the total delivered amounts of the above elements to the current recommended&#xD;
           amounts for age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if in fact patients are receiving greater than recommended amounts of&#xD;
           chromium and other trace elements so that decisions can be made regarding current&#xD;
           practice at SickKids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To obtain small volumePN solutions from a PN supplier for analysis of each of the above&#xD;
           mentioned trac elements for comparios what the information listed on the label of each&#xD;
           of those products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To retrospecitvely review the charts of patients who consented to have their PN analyzed&#xD;
           from goal #1 and record blood chromium levels done over the last 5 yrs (Jan 1/2013 - Nov&#xD;
           30/2018) as well as Cr content of their PN solutions at the time blood Cr levels were&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on PN at Sickkids were eligible to participate. Data will be collected on&#xD;
      patients weight, age, date of birth, and PN order as well as blood levels of Cr of home PN&#xD;
      patients for the retrspective portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be analyzed at London Health Science Centre in their Trace Elements laboratory&#xD;
      using a Thermo Fisher ELEMENT 2 &quot;High Resolution Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass&#xD;
      Spectrometer&quot; (HR-SF-ICP-MS). This analyzer is considered the Gold Standard of&#xD;
      Instrumentation. Samples are assessed against NIST Traceable Standards accompanying&#xD;
      Commercial Controls to maintain as high a degree of accuracy as possible. The report of&#xD;
      analysis will be sent to the Principal Investigator of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed on primary and derived variables using SAS. Student's&#xD;
      t-test will be used to compare the amount of teh trace elements in the PN compared to what&#xD;
      has been ordered. Trace elements recieved pre kg/body weight will abls be compared to the&#xD;
      recommended amount by ASPEN.&#xD;
