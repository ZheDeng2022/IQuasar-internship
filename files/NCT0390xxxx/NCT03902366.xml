  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research project is to compare neuropsychiatric functioning,&#xD;
      cortical activity, white matter integrity, and immune response among Veterans with and&#xD;
      without alcohol use disorder (AUD), before and after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy [a&#xD;
      new treatment for chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV)].&#xD;
      Demographically-matched comparison groups of Veterans without HCV (HCV-, with and without&#xD;
      AUD) will similarly be evaluated to determine the relative contribution of HCV and an HCV&#xD;
      &quot;cure&quot; to outcomes putatively affected by alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two specific aims are proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the impact of DAA therapy and a sustained viral response on central nervous&#xD;
      system (CNS) function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of AUD and unhealthy alcohol drinking on DAA therapy outcomes and&#xD;
      CNS function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information learned will address a critical gap in knowledge concerning the effects of&#xD;
      alcohol use on DAA therapy outcomes and will help inform treatment guidelines that could be&#xD;
      translated to clinical practice, such as targeted interventions to treat AUD in conjunction&#xD;
      with HCV infection and follow-up strategies for patients who successfully complete DAA&#xD;
      therapy but then need care for other potential CNS-related outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of DAA therapy on CNS function in Veterans with HCV and will&#xD;
      test the hypotheses that following DAA therapy and obtaining a sustained viral response [SVR;&#xD;
      i.e., when the virus continues to be undetectable in blood 12 weeks (or more) after&#xD;
      completing therapy], participants will show: i) improved neuropsychiatric outcomes (e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive function, fatigue, mood), as compared to baseline (pre-DAA therapy), ii) restored&#xD;
      functional connectivity and disintegrity within white matter tracks that had been observed at&#xD;
      baseline, and iii) reduced immune activation profiles (e.g., decreased expression of&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers and restored T cell balance), as compared to baseline. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      determine the impact of an active AUD on the neuropsychiatric, neuroimaging, and&#xD;
      immunological outcomes observed in aim 1. Participants will be evaluated at two time points&#xD;
      [i.e., baseline and 12 weeks post-therapy (week 24)]. Evaluations will incorporate brain&#xD;
      imaging methods [i.e., resting state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging] along with clinical and laboratory methods to assess the&#xD;
      interactive effects of alcohol use and HCV on brain function. Clinical and laboratory data&#xD;
      will include: i) demographic and medical information, ii) neuropsychological measures of&#xD;
      attention, memory, and executive function, iii) neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires&#xD;
      (e.g., depression and anxiety), iv) urine and oral fluid collection for medical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and v) blood sample collection for planned experiments (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR,&#xD;
      and multiplex immunoassays) and for contribution to the VA Liver Disease Repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based guidelines for the new DAA therapies are needed (e.g., How much alcohol is too&#xD;
      much?). The VA is at the forefront of treating HCV and is now offering DAA therapy to all&#xD;
      Veterans with HCV treated within VA health care systems. The proposed studies will address a&#xD;
      critical gap in our knowledge concerning the effects of co-morbid HCV and AUD on antiviral&#xD;
      therapy outcomes, particularly CNS function and neuropsychiatric symptoms that contribute to&#xD;
      addiction and relapse.&#xD;
