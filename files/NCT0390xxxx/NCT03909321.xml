  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No studies have investigated the chronic effects of team sports on 24 h ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure and have assessed the effects of a beach tennis intervention in cardiovascular&#xD;
      profile and physical fitness. Based on that, the investigators designed this parallel&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of beach tennis training on 24 h&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure and different physical fitness parameters in individuals with&#xD;
      hypertension. The difference between the intervention arms in mean change from baseline in 24&#xD;
      h, daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure at 12-weeks is the&#xD;
      primary outcome; secondary outcomes are the difference between mean change in office blood&#xD;
      pressure as well as cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and power. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that 12 weeks of beach tennis training will reduce blood pressure when compared to&#xD;
      a non-exercising control group. Additionally, our recreational beach tennis intervention will&#xD;
      improve all physical fitness components in comparison to the baseline values.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, two-arms, parallel randomized controlled trial with concealed&#xD;
      allocation, blinded measurers, with 12 weeks of follow-up analyzed using an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to the beach tennis training intervention (BTT) or to&#xD;
      the control group (Con), which will not be submitted to intervention and will be instructed&#xD;
      not to engage in any kind of structured physical exercise training and to keep the life&#xD;
      activities identified at baseline. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)&#xD;
      will be applied before and after the intervention in order to assess the level of physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In BTT, supervised beach tennis sessions will be performed two times per week. Each session&#xD;
      will be composed of an initial period of 10 min of warm up and technical exercises (i.e.,&#xD;
      serve, volley, forehand and backhand). After that, 3 games of 10-15 min each (weeks 1-4: 3 ×&#xD;
      10 min; weeks 5-8: 3 × 12 min; and weeks 9-12: 3 × 15 min) with an interval of 2 min between&#xD;
      each game will be played in pairs (i.e., 2 versus 2). In case of less than 4 participants are&#xD;
      able to play at the same time, the games can also be played individually (i.e., 1 versus1).&#xD;
      In Con, participants will be advised to not change their daily usual activities and to not&#xD;
      participate in any structured physical exercise program during this period.&#xD;
