  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multi-site, open-label trial of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in&#xD;
      subjects with gastric or gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine and evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade and chemotherapy used in the perioperative period in eradicating micrometastatic&#xD;
      disease; and to compare paired tissue and serum samples (pre-treatment and post-treatment)&#xD;
      from individually treated patients to explore the immune effects of combination therapy and&#xD;
      predictors of response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Surgical resection is the primary&#xD;
      treatment for gastric cancer but most patients present with locally advanced disease and&#xD;
      recurrence is common after surgery. Many patients (35%) will have early recurrence within 6-9&#xD;
      months of surgery indicating the need for more aggressive upfront therapy in these subjects.&#xD;
      In addition, the majority of patients will ultimately have recurrence and 5 year survival&#xD;
      rates are 35-40% despite aggressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to combine immunotherapy with pembrolizumab gives the potential to increase&#xD;
      therapeutic options while continuing standard of care chemotherapy. The particular use of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy may delay or eliminate the growth of residual micrometastatic disease and&#xD;
      lead to durable disease control. Additionally, this study provides the foundation for&#xD;
      substantial correlative work to define tumor and patient characteristics that may predict for&#xD;
      response to pembrolizumab in gastric cancer.&#xD;
