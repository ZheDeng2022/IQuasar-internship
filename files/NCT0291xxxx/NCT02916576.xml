      The user performance evaluation shows whether people with diabetes are able to obtain&#xD;
      accurate measurement results with a blood glucose monitoring system. In this study, user&#xD;
      performance evaluation will be performed for Contour Plus One (Ascensia Diabetes Care GmbH),&#xD;
      Accu-Chek Performa Connect (Roche Diabetes Care GmbH), FreeStyle Optium Neo (Abbott Diabetes&#xD;
      Care Inc.), OneTouch Select Plus (LifeScan Europe) based on ISO 15197:2013; EN ISO&#xD;
      15197:2015, clause 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each BGMS, measurement procedures for user performance evaluation will be performed with&#xD;
      1 test meter and 1 reagent system lot by the study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same meter and an additional test meter will be used for double measurements performed by&#xD;
      study personnel (with the same reagent system lot used by subjects).&#xD;

    <description>This is a user performance study, that is intended to show whether people with diabetes are able to obtain accurate measurement results with a blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS).&#xD;
The subjects' measurement technique (e.g. applying blood onto the system reagent, reading the result) will be observed and documented by study personnel.&#xD;
Immediately after the measurement by the subject, the study personnel will perform a measurement with the same test meter.&#xD;
Measurement results obtained by the subjects with the BGMS will be compared to measurement results obtained with the comparison method.&#xD;
Sample collection for the comparison measurement will be performed by study personnel within 5 min after the subject's measurement with the test meter.&#xD;
The samples will be collected from the subjects' skin puncture (if possible), an additional skin puncture (if required) will be documented.&#xD;
An additional skin puncture will be performed by study personnel with single-use lancing devices.</description>
