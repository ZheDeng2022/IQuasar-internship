  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have high mortality and postoperative complications rate after surgery,&#xD;
      especially postoperative cardiac complications. A meta-analysis revealed haemodynamic&#xD;
      intraoperative events significantly increased the risk of postoperative cardiac&#xD;
      complications.To limit the risk, optimize the intraoperative management of circulation is&#xD;
      essential. Anesthetic drug may effect on the haemodynamic intraoperative, reduction of&#xD;
      postoperative complications should aimed at choosing the optimal anesthetic drug with minimal&#xD;
      effect on haemodynamic.So this study is to explore the comparative efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      anesthetic drug (etomidate or propofol) in elderly patients&#xD;
