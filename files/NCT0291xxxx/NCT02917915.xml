    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease primarily caused by&#xD;
      smoking. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based, interdisciplinary, and&#xD;
      comprehensive intervention for COPD patients that includes patient assessment, exercise&#xD;
      training, and self-management education to promote behavior changes. PR has been shown to be&#xD;
      the most effective strategy to improve clinical health outcomes, and is now considered to be&#xD;
      a standard of care intervention for individuals with COPD who remain symptomatic despite&#xD;
      optimal drug therapies. Despite considerable evidence supporting the effectiveness of PR at&#xD;
      enhancing clinical outcomes, it is unclear if PR influences the behaviors that promote COPD&#xD;
      management (i.e., physical activity, medication adherence, self-managing exacerbations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the local clinical staff as well as national colleagues and the&#xD;
      Canadian Thoracic Society, a new national pulmonary rehabilitation program has been&#xD;
      co-developed that is designed to increase physical activity, medication adherence, and skills&#xD;
      to help manage chronic lung diseases. The new program aims to increase people's confidence&#xD;
      and autonomy for performing disease-management behaviors, and has been designed to be more&#xD;
      effective at increasing physical activity, medication adherence, and disease management&#xD;
      skills than previous pulmonary rehabilitation programs. The program is designed to be&#xD;
      delivered within different settings of practice, including traditional PR centers, satellite&#xD;
      sites (i.e., sites that are remote from the major institutions),with the use of Tele-health&#xD;
      and web-based resources, and primary care medical centers. The effectiveness of the new&#xD;
      Standardized Canadian PR program will be assessed relative to the traditional PR program.&#xD;
      This trial is an important step towards establishing the necessary evidence that will then&#xD;
      enable us to work on dissemination and implementation of this new standardized PR program&#xD;
      across the country.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1: The implementation of the new Canadian Standardized PR program &quot;Real life project&quot;&#xD;
      will be done after evaluating the existing pulmonary rehabilitation program in each of the&#xD;
      four sites (G.F. MacDonald Centre for Lung Health, Mount Sinai Hospital, Montreal Chest&#xD;
      Institute and West Park Health Care Centre). This will serve as pilot testing of the new&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program to identify problems, adapt solution and improve the&#xD;
      program, its content and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: A randomized parallel-controlled trial (RPCT) will also be implemented in one site&#xD;
      at the G.F. MacDonald Centre for Lung Health. Entire PR classes will be block randomized&#xD;
      according to a random numbers table to receive usual care (traditional PR) or the new&#xD;
      Canadian Standardized PR program. Several rural Tele-health sites that participate in PR via&#xD;
      the G.F. MacDonald Centre for Lung Health will also be included and randomized as well. Both&#xD;
      groups will be exposed to the same exercise training component. The two groups will be&#xD;
      exposed to different education components (described in detail elsewhere). The effectiveness&#xD;
      of the new Canadian Standardized PR program (experimental group) will be evaluated relative&#xD;
      to the Traditional PR program (active comparator group) in terms of clinical, behavioural,&#xD;
      and psychological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine if the new Canadian Standardized PR program delivered&#xD;
      in-person and in satellites sites with the support of Tele-health improves and maintains&#xD;
      specific self-management behaviors after rehabilitation more than the traditional PR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Physical activity (in steps-per day as measured by Fitbit®) Secondary&#xD;
      Outcomes: i) Medication adherence (measured by pharmacy refills); ii) exacerbation&#xD;
      recognition and prompt decision-making (diary &amp; phone calls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To determine if the new Canadian Standardized PR program improves&#xD;
      predisposing factors of behavior change (knowledge, self-determination theory constructs such&#xD;
      as motivation, and self-efficacy) following rehabilitation more than the Traditional PR&#xD;
      program and if there is variation according to the method of delivering the program, i.e.,&#xD;
      via Tele-health technology vs in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the new Canadian Standardized PR program results in greater improvement of&#xD;
      clinical outcomes (exercise capacity, health status) and health service use (hospital&#xD;
      admissions) following completion of rehabilitation compared to the Traditional PR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Analysis for determining the potential benefit of the new Canadian&#xD;
      Standardized PR program: Repeated measures ANOVAS will be conducted to evaluate changes over&#xD;
      PR in behavioral outcomes (physical activity, medication adherence, exacerbation adherence),&#xD;
      predisposing behavior change outcomes (self-efficacy, knowledge, self-determination theory&#xD;
      constructs), and clinical outcomes (quality of life, exercise tolerance) between the&#xD;
      Traditional PR group compared to the new Canadian Standardized PR group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' adherence to action plan and regular medication, self-efficacy, symptoms/health:&#xD;
      After carefully examining data for distribution (and transforming if warranted), the&#xD;
      investigators will first calculate the proportion (and 95% CI) of patients who initiate their&#xD;
      action plan, including seeking treatment and increasing medications as appropriate within 48&#xD;
      hours of symptom onset. In the case of multiple exacerbations, only the first instance will&#xD;
      be used. A separate analysis will be done for multiple exacerbations, to account for patient&#xD;
      variables. The investigators will explore secondary objectives by evaluating changes over&#xD;
      time in all patients in adherence to medication, self-efficacy, symptoms and, health related&#xD;
      quality of life. Regression analyses will be used to explore changes in these outcomes while&#xD;
      controlling for the effects of potential covariates and confounders such as baseline&#xD;
      respiratory status, age, sex, disease severity, comorbidities and smoking status. The&#xD;
      investigators will calculate means or proportions for acceptability to providers and resource&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination: The investigators anticipate a sample of 200 COPD patients (100 in&#xD;
      each group), with 40 of those patients participating in rural sites by Tele-health. Sample&#xD;
      size calculations are based on evaluating change in the primary outcome - physical activity&#xD;
      as measured by steps per day - between the Traditional PR and new Canadian Standardized PR&#xD;
      groups. A literature search indicated that Traditional PR seems to have a small to negligible&#xD;
      effect on COPD patients' physical activity levels. Given that the new Canadian Standardized&#xD;
      program is designed to specifically target predisposing factors of behavior change, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate a medium effect size increase in physical activity compared to the&#xD;
      usual care program. In order to detect a medium effect size, with power = .80, and alpha =&#xD;
      .05, the investigators will be recruiting 100 COPD patients per group (G*Power 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling and Record Keeping: Data will be collected and stored in a central Redcap&#xD;
      database. Patients will all have a unique study code number, which will be the only unique&#xD;
      identifier included within the Redcap database.&#xD;
