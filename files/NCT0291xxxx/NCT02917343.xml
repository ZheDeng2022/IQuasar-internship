      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of a combined mirror therapy and task&#xD;
      oriented/repetitive task training on upper extremity function of persons with hemiplegia due&#xD;
      to cerebrovascular accident or stroke.&#xD;

      This case series was designed to to determine the effect of a mirror therapy and repetitive&#xD;
      task training program on the weak arm and hand functioning due to the consequences of stroke.&#xD;
      Mirror therapy is a type of therapy mirror reflection of the stronger arm and hand helps to&#xD;
      promote reorganization of neurons. Studies have shown that mirror therapy is an effective&#xD;
      adjunct to regular exercise and task-oriented therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for this study, participants must meet the following criteria: 1) age 21 years or&#xD;
      more; 2) first-time stroke with onset of at least 3 months; 3) slight movement of the weaker&#xD;
      arm or /and hand; 3) stable physical and mental health; and 4) mentally capable and competent&#xD;
      to make health care-related decisions and carry out a home program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were required to come to Quinnipiac University - North Haven campus to undergo&#xD;
      mirror therapy training, in 45-60 minute sessions, twice a week for one month. They were also&#xD;
      required to complete pre-testing before and post-testing after the mirror therapy program. In&#xD;
      addition, they were required to carry-out a home program that includes the use of a mirror&#xD;
      box and self-selected tasks. The home program required them to exercise and practice the use&#xD;
      of their more affected arm and hand for at least 1-2 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation was strictly voluntary. Participants were informed of the minimal risks&#xD;
      involved as well as their options to continue or withdraw from the study upon initial&#xD;
      consent. The study did not yield physical or mental harm to the participants.&#xD;
