    <textblock>
      Exenatide once weekly (Bydureon) was approved in January 2012 by FDA in USA for the treatment&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evidence from clinical trials suggested that Bydureon improves&#xD;
      glucose control with low risk of hypoglycemia. Bydureon does not require a dose titration as&#xD;
      necessary for other glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and appears to have other advantages,&#xD;
      such as reducing insulin resistance, reducing weight, and improving blood pressure and lipid&#xD;
      profiles. However, the degree to which these advantages of Bydureon lead to improve outcomes&#xD;
      in customary clinical care in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment and in elderly&#xD;
      patients are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Bydureon relative&#xD;
      to basal insulin initiated as first-ever injectable therapeutic regimens among elderly&#xD;
      patients and patients with renal impairment. Patients who initiated treatment with Bydureon&#xD;
      or basal insulin between July 2011 and March 2015 will be recruited into the study cohorts&#xD;
      from Optum's database of electronic health records. The two treatment cohorts will be matched&#xD;
      by propensity score method. Changes in HbA1c, weight, markers for renal function (estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR)), and&#xD;
      incidences of gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycaemia are investigated for patients with&#xD;
      different eGFR categories and with different ages.&#xD;

      Background: In January 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a once-weekly form&#xD;
      of exenatide, Bydureon, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evidence from clinical&#xD;
      trials suggested that Bydureon improves glucose control with low risk of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      Bydureon does not require a dose titration as necessary for other glucagon-like peptide-1&#xD;
      agonists (GLP-1RAs), and appears to have other advantages, such as reducing insulin&#xD;
      resistance, reducing weight, and improving blood pressure and lipid profiles. However, the&#xD;
      degree to which these advantages of Bydureon lead to improve outcomes in patients with renal&#xD;
      impairment or who are elderly is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of Bydureon&#xD;
      relative to basal insulin initiated as first-ever injectable therapeutic regimens among&#xD;
      elderly patients and patients with renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the effectiveness of Bydureon initiation relative to initiation of basal&#xD;
           insulin, on improving:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight (body mass index (BMI))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c simultaneous to reduction in weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and lipid profiles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the tolerability of Bydureon initiation relative to initiation basal insulin,&#xD;
           on the occurrence of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the markers for renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),&#xD;
           serum creatinine, and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), and the stability of liver&#xD;
           function test (AST, ALT) and standard blood counts (WBC, RBC, HCT, Hgb, PLT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine these measures of effectiveness and tolerability within potentially&#xD;
           vulnerable subgroups of Bydureon and basal insulin initiators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2D patients with renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elderly T2D patients Study Population and Design: This retrospective cohort study will&#xD;
           use Optum's EHR data from July 2011 through March 2015 and identify injectable-naive T2D&#xD;
           patients who initiated either Bydureon or basal insulin during the accrual period,&#xD;
           January 2012 and January 2015. Injectable-naive T2D patients will be indetified.&#xD;
           Propensity score methods will be used to match Bydureon initiators with basal insulin&#xD;
           initiators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup Comparisons: Within the EHR data, serum creatinine values will be used to calculate&#xD;
      the eGFR using an equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Epidemiology (EPI)&#xD;
      Collaboration, called the CKD-EPI Equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Impairment: Patients will be stratified by eGFR ranges in baseline indicative of the&#xD;
      renal impairment, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal, eGFR â‰¥ 90.00 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild impairment, 60.00 &lt; eGFR &lt; 89.99 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate and Severe impairment, eGFR &lt; 59.99 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly T2D Patients: Elderly subgroups will be defined as 65+ years of age. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by age on index date, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt; 65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  65 to 74 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  75+ years Outcomes and Analysis: To measure the effectiveness of Bydureon relative to&#xD;
           basal insulin are changes in HbA1c and body weight, as well as changes in HbA1c and&#xD;
           simultaneous reduction in weight. Changes in BMI, lipid profiles, and blood pressure&#xD;
           will be assessed. These variables are part of the clinical and laboratory data in the&#xD;
           EHR. Each outcome will be evaluated for completeness, multiply imputed, and reported&#xD;
           across standardized time intervals. HbA1c, weight and BMI will be summarized in baseline&#xD;
           and quarterly (3-month intervals) in the first year following drug initiation. Lipid&#xD;
           measurements and blood pressure will be summarized in baseline and bi-annually (6-month&#xD;
           intervals) in the first year following drug initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess drug tolerability, incidence of hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation) will be calculated. These outcomes will be&#xD;
      ascertained using an ICD-9 algorithm applied to the structured fields and by extracting&#xD;
      mentions of hypoglycemia using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm developed by&#xD;
      Optum and applied to the free text clinical notes available in the data. In addition the&#xD;
      stability of renal function evaluated by change in eGFR, or albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR);&#xD;
      the change in serum hepatic enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase (ALT)], and hematologic measures [red blood cells counts (RBC), white blood&#xD;
      cell counts (WBC), platelets (PLT), hemoglobin (Hgb) and hematocrit (Hct) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Each of these laboratory values will be evaluated for completeness, multiply imputed, and&#xD;
      reported across standardized time intervals. eGFR and ACR are summarized in baseline and&#xD;
      quarterly (3-month intervals) in the first year following drug initiation. Hepatic enzymes&#xD;
      and hematologic measures are summarized in baseline and semi-annually (6-month intervals) in&#xD;
      the first year following drug initiation.&#xD;

        The study population was drawn from an Optum's Electronic Health Records (EHR) database.&#xD;
        Injectable-naive type 2 diabetic patients who initiated therapy with either Exenatide&#xD;
        once-weekly or basal insulin from January 2012 to January 2015, with follow-up through&#xD;
        March 2015 were identified. The baseline period was defined as the 183 days (6-months)&#xD;
        prior to date of study drug initiation (index date). Patients with Type 2 diabetes were&#xD;
        identified using structured diagnosis fields and International Classification of Disease,&#xD;
        Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Initiations of Exenatide&#xD;
        once-weekly or basal insulin were identified in the EHR data capturing prescribed&#xD;
        medications using National Drug Codes (NDC).&#xD;
