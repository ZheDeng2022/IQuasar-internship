  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IIb trial studies how well ACTOplus met XR works in treating in&#xD;
      patients with stage I-IV oral cavity or oropharynx cancer that are undergoing definitive&#xD;
      treatment. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep oral cavity or oropharynx cancer from&#xD;
      forming or coming back. The use of ACTOplus met XR may slow disease progression in patients&#xD;
      with oral cavity or oropharynx cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether 10-21 days of treatment with ACTOplus met XR will result in a&#xD;
      decrease in proliferation index (Ki-67) expression in oral cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue&#xD;
      as compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare differences in proliferation index (Ki-67) expression from baseline to&#xD;
      post-exposure in visually normal appearing oral cavity/oropharyngeal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare immunohistochemical differences in the apoptosis biomarker cleaved caspase 3 from&#xD;
      baseline to post-exposure in oral cavity/oropharyngeal adjacent visually normal appearing&#xD;
      tissue and tumor tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare immunohistochemical differences from baseline to post-exposure in oral&#xD;
      cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue samples with regard to cyclin D1, p21 and biguanide or PPAR&#xD;
      gamma associated pathway biomarkers; prospective biomarkers on the panel will include&#xD;
      phosphorylated (p)AKT, pAMPK, pS6 (metformin), and PPAR gamma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare immunohistochemical differences from baseline to post-exposure of oral&#xD;
      cavity/oropharyngeal tumor tissue samples with regard to tumor infiltrating immune cells&#xD;
      (effector CD8 [CD8+]), regulatory CD4 T regulatory (Treg) (CD4+Foxp3+), tumor associated&#xD;
      myeloid cells (CD68), PD1 and PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Compare and correlate pre- and post-ACTOplus met XR treatment human ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA)-sequencing (seq) gene analysis on total RNA samples from oral cavity/oropharyngeal&#xD;
      adjacent visually normal appearing tissue and tumor tissue pre-and post-study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine human papillomavirus (HPV) status in pre-treatment tumor tissue using p16&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES I. Compare pre- and post-study treatment fludeoxyglucose F-18&#xD;
      (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans with regard to&#xD;
      standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG and tumor burden using Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1 in those participants with a preintervention standard&#xD;
      of care staging FDG-PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive ACTOplus met XR orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 10-21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue ACTOplus met&#xD;
      XR PO QD for a maximum of 25 days if end of treatment biopsy/surgical treatment is delayed&#xD;
      beyond day 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo PO QD daily for 10-21 days.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, stage I-IV squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the oral cavity or oropharynx and will&#xD;
             be undergoing definitive surgical, radiotherapy, or chemoradiation treatment; patients&#xD;
             who are NOT candidates for localized treatment (surgery, radiation or chemoradiation)&#xD;
             with curative intent (i.e.patients with distant metastasis or contra-indication to&#xD;
             localized treatment) are not eligible OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a lesion in the oral cavity or oropharynx that is not yet biopsied but&#xD;
             is highly suspicious for cancer; (randomization will be placed on hold until the&#xD;
             presence of cancer is histologically confirmed, and a treatment plan is established;&#xD;
             if the presence of cancer is not confirmed, the participant will be considered a&#xD;
             screen failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant's primary tumor is accessible for the collection of 4 mm samples of&#xD;
             tumor and adjacent visually normal appearing tissue for biomarker analysis and the&#xD;
             participant is willing to have these samples collected at baseline and at the end of&#xD;
             study visit. (The protocol requires the collection of fresh tissue for biomarker&#xD;
             analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have not yet had a diagnostic biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The tissue samples for biomarker analysis may be collected in conjunction&#xD;
                       with the patient's standard of care diagnostic biopsy but not until after&#xD;
                       the patient has signed informed consent and it has been determined that they&#xD;
                       meet all of the eligibility criteria for this protocol with the exception of&#xD;
                       normal organ and marrow function as defined by the clinical laboratory test&#xD;
                       results listed for that criterion. In this situation, because the patient&#xD;
                       would be having a biopsy regardless of whether or not they were&#xD;
                       participating in this study, it is not required to obtain these results&#xD;
                       prior to conducting the biopsy. It is however, required to confirm normal&#xD;
                       organ and marrow function prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients who are scheduled for a direct operative laryngoscopy with biopsy&#xD;
                       (DL biopsy) for diagnostic purposes may be candidates for this study&#xD;
                       provided the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  The lesion to be biopsied is within the anatomic confines of the&#xD;
                            oropharynx (i.e. above the epiglottis).&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Tissue samples for biomarker analysis of the required 4 mm size are&#xD;
                            able to be obtained from both the lesion and an area of visually normal&#xD;
                            appearing tissue adjacent to but 1 cm distant from the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In this situation, randomization will be placed on hold until the following criteria are&#xD;
        met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal organ and marrow function is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It has been determined that surgical excision will be the first line standard of care&#xD;
             treatment and the end of study tissue samples will be obtained in conjunction with&#xD;
             that surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because these patient's lesions are not accessible to end of study tissue sample collection&#xD;
        in the outpatient clinic setting, the only way to obtain those samples is in conjunction&#xD;
        with standard of care surgical excision of the lesion. If the first line of treatment will&#xD;
        be non-surgical, the patient will be considered a screen failure. Under no circumstances&#xD;
        will DL biopsy be used for the sole purpose of collecting tissue samples for biomarker&#xD;
        analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have already had a diagnostic biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The baseline tissue samples for biomarker analysis will be collected in the&#xD;
                  outpatient clinic setting as a &quot;for research purposes only&quot; procedure. The&#xD;
                  samples may not be collected until it has been determined that the participant&#xD;
                  meets all eligibility criteria for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  End of study tissue sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If surgical excision will be the patient's first line treatment, the end of study&#xD;
                  tissue samples for biomarker analysis will be collected in conjunction with that&#xD;
                  surgery. If, for any reason, the patient's surgery is delayed beyond Day 26, the&#xD;
                  end of study tissue samples may be collected in the outpatient clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient's first line of treatment will not be surgical excision, the end&#xD;
                  of study tissue samples for biomarker analysis will be collected in the&#xD;
                  outpatient clinic setting prior to initiation of the non-surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participant is able to complete a minimum of 10 days of study agent dosing&#xD;
                       prior to initiation of definitive treatment for their cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Participant is scheduled for an end of study biopsy within 22 days of&#xD;
                       starting study agent and within 52 days of their study screening visit; (if&#xD;
                       the participant is scheduled for surgical excision of the tumor and the&#xD;
                       surgery is delayed for any reason after the participant has started taking&#xD;
                       the study agent, study agent dosing may be extended up to a maximum of 25&#xD;
                       days without compromising the evaluability of the end of study biomarkers)&#xD;
