    <textblock>
      Randomized placebo controlled trial on patients suffering from acute unilateral&#xD;
      vestibulopathy. Patients will be randomized into 3 arms; 1) Placebo only, 2) Short&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment (3days) 3) Longer corticosteroid treatment (11 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular function as well as subjective symptoms will be estimated in the acute stage and&#xD;
      regularly up to one year after the debut.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial in 3 arms to see if a short or a even shorter period of steroid&#xD;
      treatment on patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis can be as effective as the only&#xD;
      comparable study thus far (Strupp et al, NEJM 22, 351(4) 354-61). If a shorter treatment with&#xD;
      a lower dose has the same outcome, then more patients might be eligible for the treatment as&#xD;
      many are excluded due to risk for adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroid treatment in acute unilateral vestibulopathy has recently been the subject for&#xD;
      a Cochrane review with the conclusion of insufficient evidence for treatment effect and&#xD;
      recommend studies with subjective symptom based evaluation together with functional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy diagnosed within 48hrs after debut. The&#xD;
      patients (after acceptance) will be randomized into either of 3 arms and will receive&#xD;
      placebo/short treatment (3days)/standard treatment (in Sweden 11 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will record subjective symptoms according to Liknert scale during the acute stage&#xD;
      and fill out enquiries after 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vestibular function will be assessed with caloric irrigation and video-Head-Impulse-Test&#xD;
      (vHIT) as soon as possible after the debut and again after 1, 3 and 12 months.&#xD;
