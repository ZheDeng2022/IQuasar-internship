      Aim :The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral Gabapentin in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain in females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial.32 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (cases):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group will include (32) women according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and will&#xD;
      receive a card of Gabapentin which will be taken orally by the patient at home three times&#xD;
      daily and maximum dose 2700mg per day by 300 mg increments each week until sufficient pain&#xD;
      relief, or the occurrence of side effects such as dizziness, somnolence, edema and ataxia.&#xD;
      Group B (controls):This group will include (32) women .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the patient's pain during the physical examination will be done using the&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The patient will be asked to place a mark on a drawn 10 cm line&#xD;
      at a point which is corresponding to the intensity of her pain. One end of the line denotes&#xD;
      no pain and the other end of the line indicates that pain is as bad as it can be (the worst&#xD;
      pain).the distance in cm from the low end of VAS to the patient's mark will be used (it gives&#xD;
      a number.Questionnaire: will be given to all participants at randomization (0 months) , at 3&#xD;
      months and at 6 months to assess the degree of pain improvement via VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' overall satisfaction with their pain treatment &amp;Side effect recording (e.g.,&#xD;
      dizziness, somnolence, mood changes, appetite and poor concentration).&#xD;
