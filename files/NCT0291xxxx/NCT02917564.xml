      During glaucoma surgery, a new opening is created that allows fluid to drain out of the eye,&#xD;
      bypassing the clogged drainage channels that are malfunctioning in patients with glaucoma. In&#xD;
      some patients who have had glaucoma surgery too much fluid flows out and this results in a&#xD;
      pressure that is too low. This may cause swelling of one layer at the back of the eye called&#xD;
      the choroid. The formation of this swelling, called a choroidal effusion or &quot;choroidal&quot;,&#xD;
      often makes the eye pressure stay too low, and one of the results is a decrease in vision.&#xD;
      The treatment for a choroidal effusion is to try to raise the eye pressure somewhat to allow&#xD;
      the swelling to subside. In our clinical work, we have found that an injection with an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug called triamcinolone appears to be helpful in speeding up healing. We&#xD;
      plan to compare two groups of patients with choroidal effusions, one group that gets an&#xD;
      injection of triamcinolone and one that gets a &quot;sham&quot; treatment with nothing injected and&#xD;
      compare the length of time it takes the choroidal effusions to disappear. Both groups receive&#xD;
      the standard treatment with eye drops. We will also assess the outcome of the glaucoma&#xD;
      surgery and any other complications that may occur. This research is aimed at studying a new&#xD;
      method of improving the outcomes of surgery for glaucoma patients, and further the treatment&#xD;
      of glaucoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second commonest cause of blindness in our society. The only effective&#xD;
      treatment currently involves lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) by medical, laser, or&#xD;
      surgical techniques. Glaucoma surgery is indicated when further IOP lowering is needed&#xD;
      despite maximal medical therapy and appropriate laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choroid is a pigmented and vascular structure located between the sclera and retinal&#xD;
      pigmented epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choroidal effusions are aberrant collections of fluid within the suprachoroidal potential&#xD;
      space. There are two types of choroidal effusion, serous and hemorrhagic, depending on the&#xD;
      type of fluid that accumulates in the suprachoroidal space. A serous choroidal effusion is&#xD;
      composed of a transudate fluid from increased transmural pressure across the capillaries.&#xD;
      Their development is usually relatively painless. Hemorrhagic choroidal effusion or&#xD;
      suprachoroidal haemorrhage is a sudden and usually very painful accumulation of blood in the&#xD;
      suprachoroidal space. 4 Choroidal effusions can be caused by both low IOP and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory conditions. Causes of concomitant low IOP and inflammation include trauma&#xD;
      and eye surgery, especially glaucoma surgery. Inflammatory causes include scleritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern glaucoma surgery has minimized the incidence of postoperative hypotony and resultant&#xD;
      choroidal effusion but it is still prevalent. 1 The prevalence of choroidal effusions after&#xD;
      glaucoma surgery varies between 10 and 15%, with average of 13% after trabeculectomy (the&#xD;
      standard technique of glaucoma surgery). 5 A complication of low-IOP-induced choroidal&#xD;
      effusion is hypotony maculopathy, which can cause permanent decline in vision, especially if&#xD;
      not resolved in a timely manner. 5 Treatment can be either medical or surgical. Medical&#xD;
      treatment includes cessation of any systemic and topical IOP lowering agents and adding&#xD;
      cycloplegic agents, topical steroids and eventually systemic steroids. If treatments do not&#xD;
      increase the IOP and reduce the choroidal effusion, then surgical management should be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the particular clinical circumstances of each patient, different surgical&#xD;
      approaches can be used, including revision of the trabeculectomy flap, anterior chamber&#xD;
      reformation, and surgical drainage of the effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to systemic steroids, steroids as triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalogâ„¢) can be&#xD;
      injected in the subtenons space. This treatment allows for a high local dose of steroids,&#xD;
      without exposing the patient to systemic treatment. Not every patient requires steroid&#xD;
      injection, and this treatment will be reserved for patients who do not respond to medical&#xD;
      management after a few days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the sham or Kenalog injection participants will receive topical prednisolone&#xD;
      acetate 1% qid for 4 weeks or PRN Topical atropine 1% qid for one week or PRN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several studies in the literature showing the benefit of a triamcinolone injection&#xD;
      for different inflammatory conditions, such uveitis and for the treatment of diabetic&#xD;
      maculopaty and cystoid macular edema. 6-9 Recently Shen et al. published the benefit of&#xD;
      subtenons triamcinolone acetonide in the management of a combination of retinal detachment&#xD;
      and choroidal effusion. 2 However we did not find any studies that assessed the benefit on&#xD;
      triamcinolone subtenons injection for choroidal effusion after glaucoma surgery. In a recent&#xD;
      retrospective study we performed a chart review of the effect of subtenons triamcinolone&#xD;
      injection in patients with choroidal effusions after glaucoma surgery compared to a group of&#xD;
      patients who did not receive the injection as part of their management. We found that&#xD;
      recovery time in the injection group was significantly shorter than in patients with no&#xD;
      injection, 10.6 days versus 27.44 days. (p=0.02). The study showed no difference in final&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP), number of medications and visual acuity.&#xD;
