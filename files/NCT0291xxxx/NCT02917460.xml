  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine (RCI) will collect biological samples (such as&#xD;
      blood), derived genomic sequences (from DNA and RNA), and clinical features in a&#xD;
      Biorepository as a standardized resource for future research studies. The purpose of the&#xD;
      Genomic Institute Biorepository is to provide consented samples and data for basic and&#xD;
      clinical research related to the genomic cause and treatment of childhood disease, and, in&#xD;
      the future, as reference (Quality Control) data to improve the ability to make clinical&#xD;
      diagnoses or clinical decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the Biorepository will provide a mechanism for making a diagnosis of a genetic&#xD;
      disease. That is, once genomic sequences have been derived from biological samples, they will&#xD;
      be immediately analyzed. If a genetic disease is identified that appears to explain an&#xD;
      affected child's clinical features, then those results will be confirmed by the medically&#xD;
      accepted standard, and placed in the electronic health record.&#xD;

      RCI will collect biological samples (such as blood), derived genomic sequences (from DNA and&#xD;
      RNA), and clinical features in a Biorepository as a standardized resource for future research&#xD;
      studies. The purpose of the Genomics Institute Biorepository is to provide consented samples&#xD;
      and data for basic and clinical research related to the genomic cause and treatment of&#xD;
      childhood disease, and, in the future, as reference (Quality Control) data to improve the&#xD;
      ability to make clinical diagnoses or clinical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diverse Biorepository of biological samples and clinical data is essential to allow these&#xD;
      studies to undertake broad and detailed comparisons. In particular, a large Biorepository&#xD;
      will allow Institute-affiliated researchers to identify new causes of diseases or treatment&#xD;
      responses in many of the understudied ethnic and racial groups that Rady Children's Hospital,&#xD;
      San Diego (RCHSD) serves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the Biorepository, via subsequent individual research protocols, will enable&#xD;
      research to improve rates of clinical diagnoses for enrolled subjects and subsequently all&#xD;
      affected patients, improve testing capabilities offered to patients, enhance understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms of disease and treatment responses, and improve clinical management of these&#xD;
      diseases. The Biorepository will enroll affected and unaffected individuals and family&#xD;
      members, or affected and unaffected tissues, for the purposes of analysis and comparison in&#xD;
      order to identify the underlying cause of the disease or treatment in the affected samples.&#xD;
      Samples and data will be stored indefinitely and shared with approved researchers to further&#xD;
      understanding of genomic components of pediatric diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the Biorepository will provide a mechanism for making a diagnosis of a genetic&#xD;
      disease. That is, once genomic sequences have been derived from biological samples, they will&#xD;
      be immediately analyzed. If a genetic disease is identified that appears to explain an&#xD;
      affected child's clinical features, then those results will be confirmed in a manner that is&#xD;
      compliant with the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (CLIA) and College of American&#xD;
      Pathologist (CAP) recommendations, and placed in the electronic health record (EHR). Samples&#xD;
      confirmed by CLIA and CAP methods will be identified as such and retained for future&#xD;
      confirmatory investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To collect biological samples and associated clinical data (Phenome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To create, analyze and store genomic data from the biological samples. Genomic data will&#xD;
           include genome (DNA) sequences, RNA sequences, and/or other related 'omic data&#xD;
           (including pharmacogenomics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and the microbiome). Some&#xD;
           genomic data will be whole genome sequences. For other samples the genomic data will be&#xD;
           panels of specific genes or of all exons of genes (the &quot;Exome&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate and improve genomics technologies and software to enhance understanding&#xD;
           and testing abilities related to childhood diseases and treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To make specimens and data available for qualified researchers and collaborators to&#xD;
           further the understanding of childhood diseases and treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To collect and correlate genomic data from a wide variety of populations and clinical&#xD;
           presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To provide sample and data collections with uniform consent, methods of acquisition,&#xD;
           storage for genome-based research studies with subsequent IRB approvals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To analyze and report clinically-confirmed genomic diagnoses and treatment guidance&#xD;
           through use of new research technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To identify and study novel gene and disease processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will plan to enroll 3000 subjects per year. Following informed consent, the&#xD;
      study team will collect a family history and blood samples. The investigator will collect&#xD;
      clinical information from the medical record at the time of enrollment and longitudinally to&#xD;
      assess changes in the subject's medical condition as well as collect new symptoms. The study&#xD;
      team will scavenge tissue and other biological materials obtained from clinical procedures as&#xD;
      indicated by clinical presentation and for future research testing.&#xD;
