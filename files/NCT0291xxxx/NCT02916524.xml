  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to implement a computational model that can predict and&#xD;
      optimize training and cross-language generalization patterns for bilingual persons with&#xD;
      aphasia (BPA). The proposed work will determine the best possible treatment program for each&#xD;
      individual patient even before they are rehabilitated. In addition, the computational model&#xD;
      allows specification of variables such as age of acquisition, language exposure/proficiency,&#xD;
      impairment and their systematic influence on a range of language rehabilitation outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Accuracy of naming of pictured treated and untreated items in both languages will be assessed in probes conducted separate from treatment. Probes were conducted repeatedly throughout the study, from baseline (prior to treatment) to the end of treatment. All naming responses were scored using as correct or incorrect. A percentage accuracy was calculated for each set of items for every probe session. Baseline probe scores were compared to end of treatment probe scores to obtain individual effect sizes for each sets of items for each participant (i.e., several effect sizes were calculated for each participant).</description>

    <description>SFA training entails having the speech-language pathologist (SLP) guide the participant through generation of pertinent semantic features for pictured treatment items (e.g., category membership, physical description, location of item in context, action associated with item). Treatment is applied to a set of items in the context of single-subject, multiple baseline designs so that replication of treatment effects could be evaluated within and across participants. Treatment will be administered two times per week until prescribed accuracy levels were met during treatment probes or a maximum number of treatment sessions was completed.</description>
