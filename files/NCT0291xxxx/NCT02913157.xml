      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if HCQ in a dose of 400mg daily can&#xD;
      prevent worsening of walking ability in people PPMS. The number of participants in this study&#xD;
      will be 35. A maximum of 42 people with PPMS will be included. The trial is funded through a&#xD;
      private donation to the Hotchkiss Brain Institute MS Translational Clinical Trials Research&#xD;
      Program and the University of Calgary. There is no sponsorship from the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) there is ongoing slow and&#xD;
      continuous loss of nerve cells, which causes damage to the brain and spinal cord. This&#xD;
      ultimately becomes noticeable as slowly and continuously worsening disability. While the&#xD;
      cause of this ongoing damage is unknown, it appears that at least part of the damage may be&#xD;
      caused by cells in the brain called &quot;microglia&quot; (a type of immune cell that reside in the&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord). These microglial cells can have beneficial roles, for instance when&#xD;
      they clear away debris, but they can also cause damage to brain cells. In PPMS, microglial&#xD;
      cells are often found to be in a state of activation, and it is currently believed that this&#xD;
      constant activation of microglial cells is likely an important cause of the ongoing damage to&#xD;
      brain cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for MS only work in relapsing-remitting MS, and can prevent relapses, but&#xD;
      so far there are no treatments that effectively target PPMS. Therapies for PPMS are needed.&#xD;
      The investigators believe that treatments that target and reduce the activation of microglial&#xD;
      cells may be a useful treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a medication that has been shown to decrease the activity of&#xD;
      human microglia in laboratory experiments. Animal experiments have also shown that treatment&#xD;
      with HCQ can reduce the disease activity of an animal model of MS. HCQ, therefore, may also&#xD;
      reduce the activity of microglia in people with PPMS, and hopefully prevent or slow down the&#xD;
      progression of disability in PPMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCQ is currently approved in Canada to treat malaria and the rheumatic diseases Systemic&#xD;
      Lupus Erythematodes (SLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). HCQ is available as a tablet that is&#xD;
      usually taken two times per day. Doses up to 600mg per are used in clinical practice, but the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that a dose of only 400mg daily, given as two doses of 200mg, will be&#xD;
      sufficient to decrease the activity of microglia in patients with PPMS. HCQ is usually well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a MinMax Simon-2-stage design, the study will require 35 patients with complete 18&#xD;
      month follow-up. Presuming 20% drop-out, the investigators anticipate recruiting up to 42&#xD;
      patients. The trial will be conducted as follows: patients will continuously enter into the&#xD;
      study until 35 patients have completed 18 months of follow-up with at least 75% adherence&#xD;
      which will be measured by study drug count.&#xD;
