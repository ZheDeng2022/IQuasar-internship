    <textblock>
      This study aim to observe and compare the change of alarmins such as high mobility group&#xD;
      nucleosome-binding protein-1 (HMGN1), high mobility group proteins b1 (HMGb1), Interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-33 and their soluble receptors including soluble toll like receptor 4 (sTLR4) and&#xD;
      soluble ST2 (sST2) during pulmonary lobectomy for cancer patients receiving volatile&#xD;
      anesthesia or intravenous anesthesia under one-lung ventilation (OLV). By which, this study&#xD;
      will preliminarily evaluate the correlation of alarmins and prognosis as well as the effect&#xD;
      of inhalational and intravenous anesthesia on the prognosis of surgical patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pulmonary lobectomy, as a result of OLV and surgical operation, patients can suffer&#xD;
      from alveolar and systemic inflammatory response. Alarmin is endogenous peptide released by&#xD;
      white blood cells and epithelial cells when the body undergo danger signal stimulation which&#xD;
      can enhance immune response and has a double effect on tumor. Some alarmins and their soluble&#xD;
      receptors such as HMGN1, HMGb1, IL-33 and their soluble receptors including sTLR4 and sST2&#xD;
      can be used as biomarkers for tumor progression. Previous studies have shown that sevoflurane&#xD;
      anesthesia can reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, the latest retrospective study indicated that the mortality of cancer patients&#xD;
      receiving volatile anesthesia was significantly higher than that of intravenous anesthesia.&#xD;
      At this stage, no study aimed to investigate the change of alarmins in broncho-alveoli and&#xD;
      serum during OLV lung surgery and the possible effect of different anesthetics on them.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators plan to enroll 40 patients with lung cancer receiving pulmonary&#xD;
      lobectomy. Patients are randomly divided into sevoflurane volatile anesthesia group and&#xD;
      propofol intravenous anesthesia group (n=20). Perioperative serum and bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
      from ventilated lung are obtained, using ELISA method, to assay and compare the changes of&#xD;
      alarmins such as HMGN1, HMGb1, IL-33 and their soluble receptors including sTLR4 and sST2&#xD;
      between two groups. All the patients will be followed up for 12 months. The correlation of&#xD;
      alarmins and prognosis as well as the effect of volatile and intravenous anesthesia on the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients will be preliminarily evaluated.&#xD;
