  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect additional post-approval clinical data on the&#xD;
      long-term performance of MemoryShape and MemoryGel Breast Implants, as indicated for primary&#xD;
      or revisional breast augmentation and primary or revisional breast reconstruction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The post-approval study will include a maximum of 3500 women undergoing breast augmentation&#xD;
      or reconstruction with MemoryShape or MemoryGel Breast Implants. Four cohorts will be&#xD;
      included: primary augmentation, revision-augmentation, primary reconstruction, and&#xD;
      revision-reconstruction. For the purpose of assessing rheumatological and neurological signs&#xD;
      and symptoms, a control group of 300 women will be selected from the participating&#xD;
      investigators' practices, who are undergoing an aesthetic surgery other than breast implant&#xD;
      surgery. Breast implant patients and the concurrent control group patients will be followed&#xD;
      for 10 years. Baseline and operative data will be collected at the beginning of the study,&#xD;
      and follow-up data will be collected annually for 10 years through online questionnaires.&#xD;
