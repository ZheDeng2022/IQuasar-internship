  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhinovirus (RV) infections represent the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in&#xD;
      children and adolescents. The investigators hypothesize that the immune responses generated&#xD;
      in the nose of allergic rhinitics and asthmatics underlie subsequent systemic modulation of&#xD;
      the immune system, and that - in susceptible individuals (i.e., those with pre-existing&#xD;
      asthma) - this modified nasal milieu is responsible for the asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label single center study in asthmatics as well as allergic rhinitis (AR) and healthy&#xD;
      controls. All subjects will undergo good manufacturing practice (GMP) RV16 inoculation and&#xD;
      responses will be compared between the 3 cohorts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether RV increases expression of interleukin (IL)-25 transcripts by nasal&#xD;
      epithelial cells in the asthma and AR but not control cohorts at the peak of infection (days&#xD;
      3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether RV increases lower respiratory symptoms in the asthma but not AR and&#xD;
      control cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether asthmatics and allergic rhinitics will demonstrate an increased severity&#xD;
      of infection in comparison to control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased IL-25 transcript&#xD;
           expression over the course of RV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether asthmatic and AR cohorts demonstrate increased expression of mRNA&#xD;
           transcripts of a type 2 cytokine-inducing profile (IL-33 and thymic stromal&#xD;
           lymphopoietin (TSLP)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether increased transcript expression of this type 2 cytokine-inducing&#xD;
           profile can be corroborated as increased expression of protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether RV infection in the asthma cohort is associated with increases in&#xD;
           biomarkers of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts&#xD;
           will be associated with more symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine whether increased severity of RV infection in the asthma and AR cohorts is&#xD;
           related to decreased innate immunity.&#xD;
