      Chlorhexidine is the gold standard of dental plaque prevention, but which concentration is&#xD;
      the most effective is not known. The aim of the present study was to compare the plaque and&#xD;
      gingivitis inhibiting effect of commercial products containing 0.2%, 0.12% and 0.06%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine in a modified experimental gingivitis model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In three groups of healthy volunteers, experimental gingivitis was induced and monitored over&#xD;
      21days, simultaneously treated with the commercial solutions containing 0.2%, 0.12% and 0.06%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine. The maxillary right quadrant of each individual received mouthwash only,&#xD;
      whereas the maxillary left quadrant was subject to both rinsing and mechanical oral hygiene.&#xD;
      Compliance and side effects were monitored at days 7, 14, and 21. Plaque and gingivitis&#xD;
      scores were obtained at baseline and day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commercial mouthwash containing 0.2% chlorhexidine resulted in statistically&#xD;
      significantly lower plaque scores than the 0.12 and 0.06% mouthwashes after 21 days use,&#xD;
      whereas no statistically significant difference was found between the effect of the two&#xD;
      latter mouthrinses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A commercial available mouthwash containing 0.2% chlorhexidine proved statistically&#xD;
      significant better effect in preventing dental plaque than 0.12% and 0.06% solutions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was designed as a parallel, double masked, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial. The experimental gingivitis model, with the modifications by Preus and&#xD;
      coworkers was used to induce gingival inflammation under supervised conditions throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population comprised sixty dental, medical, and dental hygienist students who&#xD;
      volunteered to participate in the project. A meeting was arranged for the volunteers prior to&#xD;
      the start of the study, through which the participants received information about oral&#xD;
      rinsing products in general and chlorhexidine containing products as well as information on&#xD;
      the study ahead, in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period was 21 days, not comprising any special academic, religious or ethnic events&#xD;
      that could jeopardize the collective behavior of the study population. All information,&#xD;
      administration and data collection was performed at the Department of Periodontology,&#xD;
      Institute of Clinical Odontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test solutions were the commercially available mouthwash products: 0.2 % chlorhexidine&#xD;
      (no ethanol), 0.12% chlorhexidine with 910 ppm Sodium Fluoride (NaF) without ethanol and&#xD;
      0.06% chlorhexidine 250ppm Sodium Fluoride (NaF). The three commercially available&#xD;
      chlorhexidine solutions were filled in identical, but differently labelled (A,B,C) plastic&#xD;
      bottles for blinding purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was carried out using a computer generated random allocation table, assigning&#xD;
      the participants to the three study groups with 20 test subjects in each. They were all&#xD;
      carefully instructed to rinse for 60 sec. twice a day as recommended by the manufacturers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting the baseline dental plaque score to zero was done by giving all participants a&#xD;
      professional tooth cleaning with rubber cup, pumice paste and dental floss at the start of&#xD;
      the study. The participants were given their test solution and subsequently instructed to&#xD;
      rinse as described above. All information was given verbally as well as in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual plastic tooth guards had been produced to fit the teeth in the upper right&#xD;
      quadrant. Together with this individual tooth guard, the students were given identical&#xD;
      prophylaxis packs containing a medium texture tooth brush, inter-dental floss and dentifrice.&#xD;
      The participants were instructed to substitute their daily oral hygiene remedies with the&#xD;
      ones given to them, and attach the tooth guard to the tooth brush, with a provided rubber&#xD;
      string, before and after use so that the use of this always was remembered when using the&#xD;
      brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were instructed to insert the tooth guard in the first quadrant every time&#xD;
      they brushed their teeth and to perform a mechanical oral hygiene routine twice daily in the&#xD;
      three other quadrants. They should then rinse 30 sec with tap water before and after removing&#xD;
      the tooth guard to remove as much as possible of the remnants of the dentifrice. Following&#xD;
      this procedure, the participants rinsed, as instructed, with the solution they randomly had&#xD;
      been assigned, repeating the procedure for 21 days. Following the scoring at day 21, the&#xD;
      participants received professional tooth cleaning after ending the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A team of five people were trained in the procedure of informing participants, receiving the&#xD;
      test persons for evaluation, questionnaire and clinically monitoring them. The principal&#xD;
      investigator and project managers managed all contact with the participants outside the&#xD;
      scoring room. In between appointments the project team kept in touch with the test persons by&#xD;
      text messaging and e-mail. The success of this service was evident by zero no-shows at the&#xD;
      clinic, as was the case also in the previous studies with this design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the interviews at day 7, 14, 21 the project managers received reports from each&#xD;
      participant about compliance (adherence to protocol) and verbal complaints and descriptions&#xD;
      of subjective side-effects. A special questionnaire had been prepared for these interviews.&#xD;
      Reports of ill- and side effects were carefully registered and categorized for later&#xD;
      statistical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 21, the above mentioned interview was followed by an examination of clinical results.&#xD;
      Before entering the scoring room the project managers advised the participants to refrain&#xD;
      from any conversation with the scoring scientists inside. The recorders had been instructed&#xD;
      likewise. In the scoring room, two researchers obtained the clinical data. The Loe and&#xD;
      Silness plaque - and gingival index were recorded on the mesial, buccal, distal and palatal&#xD;
      aspects of teeth 16, 15, 14, 13 and 23, 24, 25, 26. Adverse events like discoloration&#xD;
      observed during the clinical examination (yes/no) and clinically visible oral mucosal&#xD;
      reactions were registered. In addition, plaque index by Quigley and Hine, the Turesky&#xD;
      modification, was registered. All clinical registrations were performed by the same&#xD;
      experienced periodontist, leaving her colleague to register recordings on specially designed&#xD;
      charts. The clinical crew was kept blind to the group allocation of the participants at all&#xD;
      times, as the only one that had access to the code-book was the statistician who did not&#xD;
      participate in the clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The present experiment aimed at comparing the plaque and gingivitis preventing&#xD;
      effect of the 0.12% - and 0.06% chlorhexidine solutions with the gold standard 0.2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of participants was 60, with 20 participants in each group. The number of&#xD;
      participants was based on the following power calculation. The power analysis was based on&#xD;
      the variable 'average plaque score in each participant'. When comparing average plaque scores&#xD;
      in two groups, a two-sided independent samples t-test was used, with 5% significance level.&#xD;
      Average standard deviation in the 3 groups was 0.40. It may be shown that in order to have&#xD;
      80% test power to detect a mean difference in average plaque score of at least 0.40 between&#xD;
      two groups, at least 15 participants must be included in each group. Because some drop-outs&#xD;
      were expected, it was decided to include 60 subjects in the study. Because 80% test power is&#xD;
      generally accepted as sufficiently high in clinical studies, and the mean difference in&#xD;
      mesial plaque score between group 1 and group 3 was 0.41, the above calculation suggest that&#xD;
      the study had acceptable test power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When comparing mean plaque score in two groups, a two-sided independent sample t-test was&#xD;
      used, with a 5% significance level. When comparing proportion of subjects with a particular&#xD;
      adverse effect, the &quot;linear by linear association chi-square&quot; test was used. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis was conducted using the software of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) for Windows, Version 16.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distributions of the outcome variables were checked, and found to be sufficiently close&#xD;
      to the normal distribution to allow for the use of a t-test.&#xD;
