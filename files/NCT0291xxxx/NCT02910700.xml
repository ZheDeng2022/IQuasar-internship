  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well nivolumab with trametinib and&#xD;
      dabrafenib, or encorafenib and binimetinib work in treating patients with BRAF-mutated stage&#xD;
      III-IV melanoma that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed&#xD;
      by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may&#xD;
      induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Trametinib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and binimetinib may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known if&#xD;
      nivolumab with trametinib and dabrafenib, or encorafenib and binimetinib may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (objective response rates by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) of nivolumab in combination with dabrafenib&#xD;
      and trametinib or encorafenib and binimetinib in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety and tolerability of the nivolumab, dabrafenib, and trametinib triplet combination&#xD;
      (NDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Safety and tolerability of the nivolumab, binimetinib and encorafenib . III. Efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination as measured by the depth and duration of response by RECIST 1.1 and modified&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 (to include intracranial response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Pharmacodynamic evaluation of combination on circulating markers (immune monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Pharmacodynamic evaluation of combination on tumor tissues. VI. Progression- free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (NDT, CLOSED): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1,&#xD;
      dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (NT, CLOSED TO ACCRUAL): Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and 15,&#xD;
      and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 3 years in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C (NEB): Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and 15, encorafenib PO QD&#xD;
      on days 1-28, and binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 3&#xD;
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 3 years.&#xD;

             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); HIV-positive patients on combination&#xD;

             interactions with dabrafenib and trametinib; in addition, these patients are at&#xD;
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy;&#xD;

             patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
             should also be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (requiring IV antibiotic treatment) including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with nivolumab, dabrafenib, and trametinib, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab, dabrafenib, and&#xD;
             trametinib; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
