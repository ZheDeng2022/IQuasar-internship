      This research study is evaluating a drug called Avelumab alone and in combination with&#xD;
      Talazoparib or Axitinib as a possible treatment for recurrent or metastatic endometrial&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that&#xD;
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the&#xD;
      side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of&#xD;
      cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet&#xD;
      approved the drug for use in patients, including people with Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by enabling the activation of the&#xD;
      immune system. Avelumab blocks an immune inhibiting signal that can impair the ability of the&#xD;
      immune system to attack cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talazoparib is a drug that stops the activity of a protein (called PARP) that's involved in&#xD;
      repairing damage to the DNA within your cells. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib in&#xD;
      cancer cells, DNA damage cannot be repaired and leads to the death of the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by blocking certain proteins that&#xD;
      cancer cells use to form new blood vessels, which the cancer needs in order to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether Avelumab, the&#xD;
      combination of Avelumab and Talazoparib, or the combination of Avelumab and Axitinib are&#xD;
      effective in treating recurrent and Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators are looking to see if participants whose tumors contain a&#xD;
      particular genetic make-up will have better response to Avelumab, the combination of Avelumab&#xD;
      and Talazoparib, or the combination of Avelumab and Axitinib.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must be classified into one of the following cohorts of recurrent or&#xD;
        persistent endometrial cancer of any histology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The MSI/POLE cohort includes endometrial cancers that are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --MSI-H as determined by immunohistochemical complete loss of expression (absence of&#xD;
        nuclear immunoreactivity) of at least one of the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and&#xD;
        PMS2. This test is now done routinely for every newly diagnosed endometrial cancer patient&#xD;
        in most centers in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        And/OR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        --POLE-mutated, i.e. endometrial cancers known to harbor mutations in the exonuclease&#xD;
        domain (amino acid residues 268-471) of polymerase e (POLE) as determined by targeted&#xD;
        sequencing or other next generation sequencing assay. Any Clinical Laboratory Improvement&#xD;
        Amendments (CLIA)-approved genomic test documenting mutations in the exonuclease domain of&#xD;
        POLE gene (amino acid residues 268-471) in the tumor will be accepted as proof of presence&#xD;
        of POLE mutations and will lead to classification into this patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The MSS cohorts include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Endometrial cancers that are MSS as determined by normal immunohistochemical nuclear&#xD;
             expression of all the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2. Tumors which&#xD;
             have not been sequenced for POLE mutations (i.e. their POLE mutations status is&#xD;
             unknown) but are MSS, will be included in this cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Measurable&#xD;
                  disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at&#xD;
                  least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt;= 10&#xD;
                  mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm&#xD;
                  when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when&#xD;
                  measured by CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no upper limit of prior therapies but patients must have had one prior&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma. Initial treatment&#xD;
             may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and/or&#xD;
             consolidation/maintenance therapy. Any platinum based chemotherapy (single agent&#xD;
             platinum or any platinum doublet) administered in conjunction with primary radiation&#xD;
             as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen. Furthermore,&#xD;
             patients who have only received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting will be eligible&#xD;
             for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior hormonal therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must NOT have received any class of drugs targeted to the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must NOT have received any prior PARP inhibitor therapy (for patients being&#xD;
             considered for the avelumab/talazoparib cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must NOT have received prior axitinib (for patients being considered for the&#xD;
             avelumab/axitinib cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age of 18 or greater years. Because insufficient dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
                  currently available on the use of Avelumab, talazoparib, and/or axitinib in&#xD;
                  participants &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from the study. Endometrial&#xD;
                  cancer is very rare in the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (reference Appendix A for ECOG performance status&#xD;
                  criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Availability of a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block of cancer tissue&#xD;
                  OR 15 unstained 5-micron slides from the original surgery or biopsy or from a&#xD;
                  biopsy of recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above&#xD;
             institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note: creatinine clearance (CLCR) should be estimated according to the&#xD;
        Cockcroft-Gault formula as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        CLCR={[(140-age) × weight)]/(72 x SCR)} × 0.85 where CLCR (creatinine clearance) is&#xD;
        measured in mL/min, age is expressed in years, weight in kilograms (kg), and SCR (serum&#xD;
        creatinine) in mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Patients with moderate renal impairment (defined as an estimated creatinine clearance&#xD;
        of 30-59 mL/min) will receive a reduced starting dose of Talazoparib at 0.75 mg PO QD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must not be pregnant or breastfeeding given that avelumab is an agent with&#xD;
             unknown effects in pregnancy and breastfeeding and the potential for teratogenesis.&#xD;
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile&#xD;
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or&#xD;
             post-menopausal (defined as ≥ 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical&#xD;
             cause). Serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) negative at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because some immunomodulatory agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toxicities of prior therapy (excepting alopecia and sensory neuropathy) should be&#xD;
             resolved to &lt; grade 2 per the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
             Events (CTCAE) version 4. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy&#xD;
             of the CTCAE version 4. A copy of the CTCAE version 4 can be downloaded from the CTEP&#xD;
             website at: http://ctep.cancer.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for the avelumab/axitinib cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequately controlled blood pressure (BP) with or without&#xD;
             antihypertensive medications, defined as systolic BP that must be ≤140 mmHg and&#xD;
             diastolic BP that must be ≤90 mmHg on two separate BP readings taken at least 1 hour&#xD;
             apart at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have LVEF ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN) as assessed by either&#xD;
             multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to avelumab or any component in its&#xD;
             formulations, or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to avelumab.&#xD;
             Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade ≥ 3 NCI CTCAE&#xD;
             v 4.03), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma (that is, 3 or more&#xD;
             features of partially controlled asthma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4 or&#xD;

             HCV RNA test is not required if the HCV antibody is negative. If Hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             is positive, the confirmatory HCV RNA test should be done and if it is negative, then&#xD;
             participants are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the&#xD;
             steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at doses ≤&#xD;
             10 mg or 10 mg equivalent prednisone per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 7 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
             with the following exceptions to this exclusion criterion:&#xD;

          -  Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
