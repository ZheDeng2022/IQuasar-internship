  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine recent claims regarding the beneficial effect of warming epidural&#xD;
      medications in order to hasten the onset of labor analgesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that warmed epidural medication resulted in a mean analgesic onset of 9.2&#xD;
      minutes as compared to a mean onset of 16 minutes for the same medication at room&#xD;
      temperature. Onset time for pain medication during labor is important to a great many&#xD;
      participants, thus techniques to shorten analgesic onset are relevant to daily clinical&#xD;
      practice. Combined-spinal epidural (CSE) techniques have been used to improve the onset and&#xD;
      reliability of labor analgesia compared to epidural techniques; however, CSEs have risks&#xD;
      associated with their usage. Firstly, is not always possible to administer a spinal dose&#xD;
      despite successful loss-of resistance with CSE techniques, providing less satisfactory labor&#xD;
      analgesia, and secondly, the CSE technique has been associated with a greater incidence of&#xD;
      non-reassuring fetal heart tones (FHT), uterine hyperactivity, maternal pruritis, and greater&#xD;
      incidence of neurologic sequelae compared to epidural analgesia. Further, CSE labor analgesia&#xD;
      is more likely to result in prolonged FHT decelerations if there is FHT abnormalities prior&#xD;
      to the neuraxial procedure. Given these potential limitations of CSE techniques for labor&#xD;
      analgesia, epidural medication warming may represent an effective alternative for safe and&#xD;
      satisfactory labor analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in obstetric and non-obstetric patients undergoing surgery have demonstrated&#xD;
      a more rapid onset of sensory blockade in patients receiving body temperature (37 °C)&#xD;
      epidural medication compared to room temperature medication, though other reports have found&#xD;
      no significant difference in the onset of sensory blockade when comparing body temperature to&#xD;
      room temperature epidural medications. To the knowledge of the investigators, there are few&#xD;
      studies examining the effect of warmed epidural medications for patients receiving epidural&#xD;
      labor analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experience of the investigators' colleagues, the close proximity to the body has a&#xD;
      warming effect on the epidural medication and ultimately leads to quicker onset of pain&#xD;
      relief once administered. Pocket warming does not warm the medications to the same extent as&#xD;
      an incubator, but is certainly less expensive and is readily available to every obstetric&#xD;
      anesthesia practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously measured the temperature of five 10mL syringes of normal&#xD;
      saline at room temperature and at baseline the average was 21.7 °C (range 21.5-21.9 °C), and&#xD;
      increased to an average of 29.7 °C (range 29.1 - 30.2 °C) after 1.5 hours of pocket warming.&#xD;
      It has not been studied and is unknown if this degree of warming would be effective in&#xD;
      enhancing the onset of labor analgesia, but such information is valuable given that an&#xD;
      approximate 30 °C temperature may be accomplished by simple pocket warming and is within&#xD;
      manufacturer recommended storage temperatures of 15-30 °C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also assessed the potential for epidural medication cooling by measuring&#xD;
      the temperature of one of the investigator's 10mL saline syringes for twenty minutes after&#xD;
      removal from the warm pocket environment. The initial temperature of 30.0 °C had cooled to&#xD;
      27.0 °C by five minutes, 24.7 °C by ten minutes, 22.9 °C by fifteen minutes, and had returned&#xD;
      to baseline room temperature by twenty minutes. The time between medication removal and&#xD;
      dosing is important to consider given that significant cooling may occur and negate any&#xD;
      potential benefits of warming the medication. This cooling effect makes use of a centralized&#xD;
      warmer less promising, as it could take 10-20 minutes to position the patient and complete&#xD;
      placement of the epidural catheter prior to dosing the medication. The use of a bedside&#xD;
      incubator or a pocket warming technique would be useful in this regard, because the&#xD;
      medication could be administered immediately after removal from the warm environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pocket warming in the front, upper pocket would be&#xD;
      beneficial in enhancing onset of labor analgesia relative to room temperature medication.&#xD;
