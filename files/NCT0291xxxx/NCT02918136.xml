      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-site, safety and efficacy study in subjects with&#xD;
      rotator cuff injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will fall into two categories: treatment group (12 subjects) and non-treatment or&#xD;
      control group (six subjects). The treatment group will undergo a small liposuction procedure&#xD;
      and receive rotator cuff repair treatment with an ultrasound-guided injection of 5cc&#xD;
      adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into the point of injury. The control group will receive a&#xD;
      5cc cortisone injection into the point of injury&#xD;

      The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety of adult Adipose-Derived&#xD;
      Stem Cell (ADRC) injection into partial thickness rotator cuff tears as indicated through&#xD;
      adverse event rate and efficacy of pain and function through Rand short form-36 questionnaire&#xD;
      and ASES Shoulder Score health questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of adult ADRC injection into&#xD;
      partial thickness rotator cuff tears through MRIs pre-and post-injection for the therapeutics&#xD;
      intent to treat a rotator cuff injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on this study received either ADRC (i.e., investigational treatment group)&#xD;
      or TAU (i.e., control group). The investigational treatment group underwent a small&#xD;
      liposuction procedure and received rotator cuff repair treatment with an ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      injection of 5cc ADRCs into the point of injury. The control group received a 5cc cortisone&#xD;
      injection. All patients, regardless of treatment, were followed up as indicated on the&#xD;
      schedule of events table in the clinical study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two clinical trial sites (Sioux Falls, SD and Fargo ND) enrolled subjects in this study.&#xD;
