      Open label radiolabelled metabolism study of intravenous and oral solution forms of F901318.&#xD;
      Five healthy male subjects will receive IV and five will receive an oral solution. Blood,&#xD;
      urine and faeces will be collected over a period adequate to obtain 90% recovery of parent&#xD;
      compound and to determine the metabolic profile of both IV and oral forms.&#xD;

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before&#xD;
      dosing. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the evening of Day -1&#xD;
      prior to investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration, and will be dosed on the&#xD;
      morning of Day 1. In Cohort 1 (Regimen A), subjects will be dosed after a light breakfast; to&#xD;
      assess tolerability of the IV administration, the first subject will be dosed at least 30 min&#xD;
      prior to dosing the second subject. All subsequent dosing of the IV formulation will be&#xD;
      staggered by at least 15 min. In Cohort 2 (Regimen B), subjects will be dosed following an&#xD;
      overnight fast with an appropriate interval between subjects based on logistical&#xD;
      requirements. Subjects will remain resident in the clinic up to 336 h post-dose (Day 15). It&#xD;
      is planned that subjects will return to the clinical unit for 2 further 24 h residency&#xD;
      periods on Day 21 and Day 28 if discharge criteria outlined in this protocol are not met. It&#xD;
      is planned that subjects will be released from the study as a group when all subjects have&#xD;
      achieved a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90% or &lt;1% of the dose administered has been&#xD;
      collected in urine and faeces within 2 separate, consecutive 24 h periods. If this occurs&#xD;
      earlier than Day 28, collection of all samples (blood, urine and faeces) will be stopped and&#xD;
      the subjects will undergo discharge assessments. If this criterion has not been met by all&#xD;
      subjects following the Day 28 return visit, home collections of urine and faeces may be&#xD;
      requested at the discretion of the investigator for individual subjects.&#xD;
