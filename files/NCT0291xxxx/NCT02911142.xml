  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a rare disease with no standard treatment. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if a drug called lenalidomide along with common chemotherapy drugs may be&#xD;
      effective in treating PEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a new treatment for PEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with PEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with blood tests, imaging studies, a physical exam, and other&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have tests to evaluate their disease. These may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture. Fluid around the spinal cord will be removed with a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow removed with a needle and studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of skin or lymph nodes removed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid removed from around organs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung and eye tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tubes with cameras taking pictures of airways or digestive tract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take lenalidomide pills for 10 days. They will keep a pill diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a catheter (small tube) placed in the large vein in the arm or chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get DA-EPOCH-R as intravenous infusions by catheter over several days. This&#xD;
      will be repeated in 21-day cycles. Most participants will have 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the drug filgrastim by injection under the skin. They will get the drug&#xD;
      methotrexate injected into the spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will have the following tests done at least once:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and stool tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions photographed and measured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits for 5 years. They will repeat the screening tests&#xD;
      plus have urine and stool tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be contacted later by phone to see how they are doing.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an&#xD;
           aggressive B cell neoplasm with clinicopathologic and molecular profiles distinct from&#xD;
           other AIDS-related lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are no prospective studies on these rare lymphomas. Clinical experience is&#xD;
           limited; however, reported prognosis is poor, with median survival estimated at less&#xD;
           than 6 months using conventional CHOP-like chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Novel treatment is urgently needed for KSHV-associated lymphomas, and the therapeutic&#xD;
           approach must take into account concurrent KSHV-associated malignancies which are&#xD;
           commonly seen in this patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide, an immune-modulatory derivative of thalidomide (IMiD drug) has in vitro&#xD;
           direct antitumor effect in KSHV-lymphomas as well as immune modulatory and&#xD;
           antiangiogenic effects that may be beneficial in treating PEL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has recently been shown to be an active&#xD;
           agent in the management of KSHV-MCD. Although PEL is a CD20-negative tumor, advances in&#xD;
           the understanding the biology of KSHV-infection of B-cells, the pathobiology of IL-6&#xD;
           syndromes in KSHV-MCD and KSHV-NHL, and clinical experience using rituximab in the&#xD;
           treatment of KSHV-MCD, support use of rituximab in the treatment of PEL, especially in&#xD;
           patients with concurrent KSHV-MCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
           doxorubicin (DA)-EPOCH is an anthracycline-based regimen that allows for personalization&#xD;
           of dose-intensity showing that inclusion of etoposide and infusional administration&#xD;
           decreases tumor cell resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of DA-EPOCH in combination with rituximab for the treatment of HIV associated&#xD;
           diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
           effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the central role of controlling HIV viremia with combination antiretroviral&#xD;
           therapy (cART) in the management of KSHV-associated malignancies, as well as the likely&#xD;
           contribution of uncontrolled HIV viremia to PEL pathogenesis, cART will be employed as&#xD;
           an important part of the treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate safety and tolerability of lenalidomide in combination with DA-EPOCH-R and&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluate overall survival in treatment-naive patients with primary effusion lymphoma&#xD;
      treated with lenalidomide in combination with, DA-EPOCH and rituximab (DA-EPOCHR^2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years with pathology confirmed primary&#xD;
           effusion lymphoma, including extracavitary variants, and KSHV-associated large cell&#xD;
           lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymphoma that is measurable or assessable&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any HIV status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematologic and biochemical parameters within pre-specified limits at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to use effective birth control, as defined in the full protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither pregnant nor breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Excluded if other serious co-morbid condition that would prohibit administration of&#xD;
           planned chemotherapeutic intervention is present&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I/ II study of lenalidomide in combination rituximab and modified&#xD;
           DAEPOCH (EPOCH-R^2) in patients with PEL and KSHV-associated large cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I of the study will evaluate lenalidomide 25 mg days 1-10 in combination with&#xD;
           modified DA-EPOCH-R to determine safety and tolerability. Dose de-escalation doses of&#xD;
           lenalidomide are 20 mg and 15 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with HIV will generally be prescribed cART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In phase I, with up to 3 dose levels, 6-18 patients will be accrued (3-6 patients per&#xD;
           level).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase II portion of the study, 15 evaluable patients will be enrolled over 48-60&#xD;
           months and 12 months follow-up after the last patient has enrolled, a 1-tailed 0.10&#xD;
           alpha level test would have 80% power to determine if OS curve would demonstrate a&#xD;
           1-year OS consistent with 45% or better and ruling out 20% or worse.&#xD;

             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is a Category X agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. These potential risks may&#xD;
             also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
