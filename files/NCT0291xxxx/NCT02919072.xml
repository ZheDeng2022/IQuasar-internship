      The study evaluate the quality of epidural anaesthesia and the safety of Chloroprocaine HCl&#xD;
      3% compared with Ropivacaine HCl 0.75% in patients with an epidural catheter in situ&#xD;
      undergoing unplanned Caesarean section.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Labouring women who have an epidural catheter in situ and established analgesia, in need of&#xD;
      an unplanned Caesarean section, will be randomly allocated to receive either Chloroprocaine&#xD;
      HCl 3% (T-group) or Ropivacaine HCl 0.75% (R-group) epidurally. Prior to the epidural&#xD;
      injection, the patient will be transferred to the operating theatre. The local anaesthetic&#xD;
      solution will be freshly prepared and 20 mL will be administered by epidural injection,&#xD;
      according to the standard hospital procedures, as detailed in the &quot;Study Schedule&quot; section&#xD;
      below. Time T0 is defined as the start time of the first epidural injection of the&#xD;
      investigational product. In case of pain or discomfort, a 6 mL epidural top-up of the same&#xD;
      anaesthetic, i.e. Chloroprocaine HCl 3% in T-group and Ropivacaine HCl 0.75% in R-group, will&#xD;
      be administered. The anaesthesiologist(s) administering the anaesthetic and collecting the&#xD;
      data will be blinded with respect to the treatment given to each patient.&#xD;
