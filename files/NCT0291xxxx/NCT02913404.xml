      The purpose of this study is to asses functional biomechanical outcomes and patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures following single bundle ACL reconstruction (ACL-R) compared to single bundle&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction and extra articular tenodesis (ACL-R+EAT).&#xD;

      Screening Protocol All participants that express interest in the study will receive a&#xD;
      screening interview that will determine eligibility for participation in the study. The&#xD;
      screening of surgical patients will be performed by one of the clinical research coordinators&#xD;
      in the clinic of Dr. Musahl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants who pass the screening interview will be provided a copy of the&#xD;
      informed consent form (in person or via email). The potential participant will review the&#xD;
      consent form in detail with a member of the clinical team in order to ensure that the&#xD;
      participant understands the information contained in the consent form and to provide an&#xD;
      opportunity for the participant to ask questions about the study. If the potential&#xD;
      participant then agrees to participate, the consent form will be signed by the participant&#xD;
      and a member of the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Protocol Baseline testing before surgery will consist of the IKDC objective and&#xD;
      subjective score, KOOS score, Marx activity level, Lysohm Scale and VR-12. A radiologist will&#xD;
      grade clinical MRI for ACL, meniscus, MCL, LCL, and ALC injury. Quantitative pivot shift&#xD;
      testing will be performed under anesthesia using the PIVOT technology and inertial sensor.&#xD;
      Intraoperative grading of ACL injury and concomitant injuries to the articular cartilage and&#xD;
      meniscus will be performed. If deemed eligible final randomization will occur following&#xD;
      intraoperative grading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard single bundle anatomic ACL reconstruction will be performed for all subjects.&#xD;
      Quadrupled hamstring tendon will be used with cortical fixation on femur and tibia. ACL-R+EAT&#xD;
      will be performed as described by Marcacci with doubled hamstring tendon left attached at the&#xD;
      pes anserinus, an anatomic tibial tunnel, staple fixation in the over the top position,&#xD;
      routing of the graft superficial to the LCL, and staple fixation at Gerdy's tubercle.&#xD;
      Concomitant tears to the menisci and their roots will be repaired as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Scans After surgery, approximately 6 months, subjects will undergo a CT scan on&#xD;
      bilateral knees. The CT scan will be used to create volumetric models. These bone models will&#xD;
      be matched to the dynamic biplane x-rays. Subjects will also undergo a research MRI scan on&#xD;
      bilateral knees. The MRI scan will be used to generate models of the knee articular&#xD;
      cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Protocol Participants who pass the screening interview, consent to participate in&#xD;
      this study and undergo surgical treatment will be scheduled for two test sessions at the&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh Biodynamics Lab, a research CT scan and MRI scan at UPMC&#xD;
      Presbyterian. The participant will then be assigned a study ID number that will be used to&#xD;
      identify all de-identified data associated with the participant. The study ID number will be&#xD;
      recorded and placed with the consent form in a folder that will remain in a locked file&#xD;
      cabinet in the Biodynamics Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female participants will complete a urine pregnancy test at the Biodynamics Lab prior to&#xD;
      X-ray, CT or MRI scans. The results of the pregnancy test will be documented by either the PI&#xD;
      or Research Assistant and retained in a separate folder that is identified only by the&#xD;
      participant's Study ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional biomechanical outcomes will be measured at 6 months and 12 months using DSX at the&#xD;
      Biodynamics Lab. Data will be obtained from the bilateral knees while the subjects perform a&#xD;
      downhill running and a cutting maneuver task to simulate pivoting, each task will be repeated&#xD;
      three times to ensure capture of movement. There will be at most 3 static standing trials&#xD;
      before each movement tasks to image each knee. Participants will be tested within a biplane&#xD;
      X-ray system throughout the study. Biplane radiographic images of each knee will be taken for&#xD;
      20 surgical patients, randomly assigned to ACL-R or ACL-R+EAT .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patient prep-room of the Biodynamics Lab, a member of the research team will place&#xD;
      reflective markers throughout the body. Movement of the reflective markers will be tracked&#xD;
      using conventional optical motion tracking equipment (Vicon MX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel's pedar system will be used to measure pressure distribution under the foot for each&#xD;
      participant during the dynamic movement trials. Each participant will be fitted with an&#xD;
      elastic sensor insole (1.9 mm thickness) which will be connected to a data logging pack via&#xD;
      cables. The cables will be secured around the participant's legs with velcro to minimize&#xD;
      potential interference during the movement trials. The data logging pack will be fitted on a&#xD;
      belt that will sit around the participants hip. The data logging pack will send data to the&#xD;
      computer system via Bluetooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trials will be performed on an instrumented treadmill that will collect ground reaction&#xD;
      forces at 1000 Hz during each movement trial. This system contains two side-by side 30x180 cm&#xD;
      belts. The belts are driven by independent (but synchronized) motor systems, and each&#xD;
      belt/motor is configured on a rigid platform supported by multi-axis load cells. This&#xD;
      configuration enables assessment of three-dimensional foot-ground reaction forces (vertical/&#xD;
      medial/lateral and anterior/posterior), applied torque and center-of-pressure location&#xD;
      independently for each foot. The participants will perform some activities for the ankle on&#xD;
      risers placed on the treadmill belt in order to image the ankle with the DSX machines. The&#xD;
      treadmill belt will not move for the ankle trials, it will just be used to determine ground&#xD;
      reaction forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic questionnaire will then be completed and the PI, Research Assistant or Lab&#xD;
      Manager will place the questionnaire into the folder containing de-identified participant&#xD;
      information. This will include age, sex, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) along with&#xD;
      standard anthropometric measurements used by our Vicon Nexus motion measurement system.&#xD;
      Participants will aslo fill out the following questionnaires: IKDC subjective, KOOS, SAS97,&#xD;
      VAS, Marx activity level, Lysohm Scale and VR-12.&#xD;
