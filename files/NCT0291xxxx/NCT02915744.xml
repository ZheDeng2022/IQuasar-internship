      This is an open-label, randomized, active comparator, multicenter, international Phase 3&#xD;
      study of NKTR-102 versus TPC in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have stable brain&#xD;
      metastases and have been previously treated with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine&#xD;
      in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting (prior anthracycline may be omitted if medically&#xD;
      appropriate or contraindicated for the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group A, NKTR-102 will be administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m2 on a q21d schedule as&#xD;
      a 90-minute intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. In Group B, TPC will&#xD;
      be administered per standard of care. Patients randomized to TPC will receive single-agent IV&#xD;
      chemotherapy, limited to choice of one of the following 7 agents: eribulin, ixabepilone,&#xD;
      vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will randomize approximately 220 patients using a 1:1 randomization ratio and&#xD;
      stratification based on geographic region, tumor receptor status, and Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group (ECOG) status. At Screening, the Investigator must determine which TPC will be&#xD;
      offered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on subsequent anticancer therapies in both treatment groups from the&#xD;
      time patients come off the study treatment until the time of primary data analysis for&#xD;
      Overall Survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will assess interim safety and efficacy data&#xD;
      and determine final number of death events needed to provide 80% conditional power based on&#xD;
      the zone adaptive design.&#xD;

    <description>To compare Overall Survival (OS) of patients who receive 145 mg/m2 NKTR-102 given once every 21 days (q21d) with OS of patients who receive Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC). Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients will be followed until their date of death or until final database closure. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up or are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut-off for OS analysis.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (CNS and peripheral) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest evidence of documented PD in either the CNS or peripheral (using RANO-BM) or death from any cause.

    <description>RECIST criteria for lesions outside the Central Nervous System (CNS); RANO-BM criteria for CNS lesions) based upon the best response as assessed by the central imaging facility. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR is calculated as the sum of CR and PR. Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>Clinical Benefit Rate will be defined as the proportion of patients having a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) for at least 4 months (≥ 120 days). The SD duration of 4 months is selected to reflect the shorter life expectancy of study population. CBR will be calculated based on both the central imaging facility assessment of response, progression and stability of disease, as well as the investigator's assessment of these parameters.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-BN20 Scale has a series of 20 questions each of which involve reporting a scale from 1-4.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L scale is used to measure health by having a patient answer a series of questions. There are a series of 5 questions each of which is scaled from a score of 4-20 in increasing increments of 4. The scale is numbered from 0 to 100 where 100 means the beast health you can imagine and 0 means the worst health.</description>

        <description>RECIST criteria for lesions outside the Central Nervous System (CNS); RANO-BM criteria for CNS lesions) based upon the best response as assessed by the central imaging facility. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR is calculated as the sum of CR and PR. Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study). Stable Disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L scale is used to measure health by having a patient answer a series of questions. There are a series of 5 questions each of which is scaled from a score of 4-20 in increasing increments of 4. The scale is numbered from 0 to 100 where 100 means the beast health you can imagine and 0 means the worst health.</description>

        <population>As the trial progressed, some patients discontinued study treatment as a result of progressive disease, non-PD AE, patient decision, or physician decision.</population>

The fourth question has 6 six sub components each of which are scored with a scale of 1-10.
