  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if our Community Health Worker program can help at-risk&#xD;
      NYC Chinese community members participate in shared decision making and lung cancer screening&#xD;
      (if appropriate) and compare it to the help provided by written materials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study first used qualitative methods to inform the adaptation of a CHW model to&#xD;
      facilitate lung cancer screening completion in an extremely high-risk group, NYC Chinese&#xD;
      livery drivers who smoke or who quit within the past 15 years. A series of focus groups with&#xD;
      Chinese livery drivers who smoke, a series of in-depth interviews with livery base management&#xD;
      and staff, primary care physicians (PCPs), clinic directors, hospital CFOs, heads of&#xD;
      financial services and counseling, and heads of radiology facilities serving the Chinese&#xD;
      community were conducted to explore barriers and factors related to cancer screening.&#xD;
      Findings were used to develop adapted intervention materials, including a CHW Manual for&#xD;
      Facilitating Shared Decision Making and Lung Cancer Screening. Once adaptation is complete,&#xD;
      the researchers will conduct a pre-pilot to refine the adapted CHW intervention materials.&#xD;
      The researchers will then conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the refined CHW model (intervention) versus written materials (control) to&#xD;
      facilitate SDM and LCS (when appropriate) in an extremely high-risk group, NYC Chinese livery&#xD;
      drivers eligible (by USPTSF criteria) for LCS. Feasibility results will be used to inform the&#xD;
      planning and design of large scale RCTs, targeting Chinese drivers, as well as other driver&#xD;
      populations in NYC and throughout the U.S., and other high risk Chinese smoking populations&#xD;
      in other occupations (e.g. restaurant work, construction). The study is currently in the&#xD;
      pre-pilot phase and expects to launch the pilot phase by the summer of 2020. Due to the&#xD;
      effects of the COVID-19 crisis, the researchers have extended the pre-pilot participation&#xD;
      time frame to 12 months. The study population has also indicated concern to attend doctor's&#xD;
      appointments for SDM/LCS during COVID-19. As such, MSK is extending the study time frame to&#xD;
      an additional 6 months.&#xD;
