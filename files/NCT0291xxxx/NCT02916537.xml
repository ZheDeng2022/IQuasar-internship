  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a novel diagnostic Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      imaging agent for safety and biodistribution. The agent binds Prostate Specific Membrane&#xD;
      Antigen (PSMA) and is designed to detect prostate tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor has developed a PET imaging agent, CTT1057, labeled with 18F, that is based on a&#xD;
      small molecule core and targets an extracellular region of PSMA with high affinity. Although&#xD;
      comparable to other inhibitors in terms of affinity for PSMA, this unique class of&#xD;
      phosphoramidate agents are the only known irreversible PSMA inhibitors. Due to its&#xD;
      irreversible binding to PSMA and rapid uptake by PSMA-expressing prostate cancer cells,&#xD;
      accumulation at the cancer target is expected to be rapid, specific and sensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients will be enrolled in parallel in two cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Cohort A) Patients with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy (N = 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Cohort B) Patients with evidence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (N&#xD;
           = 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive a single intravenous (IV) dose (370 MBq, or 10 mCi) of CTT1057 in this&#xD;
      first-in-human trial. Combined PET/MR imaging (prostate + whole body) will be performed&#xD;
      following tracer injection. The 5 patients in the pre-prostatectomy cohort will comprise the&#xD;
      dosimetry/pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort to establish organ dosimetry and PK profile. Patients&#xD;
      in cohort A will undergo planned radical prostatectomy (plus lymph node dissection) within 12&#xD;
      weeks following CTT1057 PET/MR. Patients in cohort B (metastatic prostate cancer) will have&#xD;
      the option for metastatic tumor biopsy following CTT1057 PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-time nominal injected dose will be 370 MBq (10 mCi). Estimated mass dose is 20 µg of&#xD;
      CTT1057. Dose will be in a volume of 3 - 5 mL, and will be injected intravenously as a bolus&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, adverse event assessment, and 12 lead ECGs will be performed on day 1 before and&#xD;
      after dosing.&#xD;
