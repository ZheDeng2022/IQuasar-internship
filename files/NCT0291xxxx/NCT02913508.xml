  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      multiple doses of vedolizumab subcutaneous (SC) compared to vedolizumab intravenous (IV).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to&#xD;
      determine its availability and reaction in the body of people who have moderately to severely&#xD;
      active Ulcerative Colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD). This study will look at the&#xD;
      availability and reaction of vedolizumab in people who are administered the treatment&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) compared people who are administered the treatment intravenously (IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 200 patients with moderately to severely active UC or CD.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the five&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vedolizumab 300 mg IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vedolizumab 300 mg IV and vedolizumab 160 mg SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vedolizumab 300 mg IV and vedolizumab 108 mg SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vedolizumab 480 mg SC and vedolizumab 160 mg SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vedolizumab 324 mg SC and vedolizumab 108 mg SC&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive one of the treatments they are assigned to at various treatment&#xD;
      visits throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America, Europe and Asia. The overall time&#xD;
      to participate in this study is approximately 41 weeks in addition to a follow-up survey that&#xD;
      will be administered every 6 months for 2 years. Participants will make 16 visits to the&#xD;
      clinic, including a safety follow-up assessment 18 weeks after last dose of study drug.&#xD;
