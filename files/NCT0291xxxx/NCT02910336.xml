      Orofacial pain, specially neuropathic orofacial pain, is a challenge of diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment in orofacial pain. It is associated with sensory abnormalities.With increasing life&#xD;
      expectancy of the population is more and more common to find individuals with chronic&#xD;
      diseases however, there is little evidence about the influence of comorbidities and&#xD;
      medications in use on sensory thresholds of neuropathic orofacial pain. Objective: to&#xD;
      investigate the influence of comorbidities and medication in somatosensory function of&#xD;
      patients with orofacial neuropathic pain compared to controls.In this case-control study, 336&#xD;
      orofacial pain patients and controls were recruited from the Hospital das Clinicas da&#xD;
      Faculdade de Medicina da USP were investigated about comorbidities, use of chronic&#xD;
      medication, pain characteristics and a detailed standardized protocol of somatosensory&#xD;
      evaluation at the trigeminal territories for cold, warm, tactile, vibration, deep,&#xD;
      superficial and electric pain thresholds.&#xD;

      Comorbidities The patients were interviewed by the same orofacial pain specialist using a&#xD;
      questioner at the moment of the quantitative sensitive test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orofacial evaluation Instruments for orofacial evaluation. The questionnaires and exams were&#xD;
      performed by one researcher only, a dentist, who ensured the clear understanding of the&#xD;
      content by the participants before starting the protocol. All subjects underwent a&#xD;
      standardized protocol for the evaluation of the orofacial region, including main complaint,&#xD;
      pain characteristics [location, quality, duration, descriptors, intensity by the Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale (VAS), alleviation and aggravation factors], earache, headache, generalized body&#xD;
      pain, sleep disturbances. Masticatory complaints related to parafunctional habits, laterality&#xD;
      and the quality of mastication were also investigated. The intensity of masticatory&#xD;
      discomfort was evaluated with the VAS. The intraoral examination included the evaluation of&#xD;
      teeth, periodontal tissues, oral mucosa, tongue, lips, and facial skin, prostheses, occlusion&#xD;
      and functional aspects, such as mandibular movements (mouth opening, protrusion, laterality)&#xD;
      and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) exam (noises, spontaneous pain, or pain concomitant with&#xD;
      movements). The muscular palpation of the head and neck was performed at the bilateral&#xD;
      masseter, temporalis, digastrics, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, splenius and suboccipitals.&#xD;
      The periodontal exam was performed with adequate probes and the diagnoses made in accordance&#xD;
      to the criteria of the American Academy of Periodontology. All participants underwent this&#xD;
      detailed investigation for differential diagnosis with dental pain etiologies. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that they can be associated with the main diagnosis of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory investigation All subjects were interviewed about their perception of sensorial&#xD;
      abnormalities such as numbness, dysesthesia, taste and smell complaints. The frequency of&#xD;
      these abnormalities (absent, eventual, frequent, or constant) and the intensity (0-10 by VAS)&#xD;
      were analyzed. This protocol is important for neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain diseases&#xD;
      because somatic pain also presents sensitization and chronification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QST. All subjects underwent a standardized protocol of QST which consists of 8 tests grouped&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gustative and olfactory thresholds;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  thermal detection thresholds for cold and warm sensations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mechanical detection thresholds for touch and vibration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mechanical pain sensitivity including superficial and deep pain thresholds. The&#xD;
           somatosensory testing was performed at the 3 trigeminal branches (ophthalmic: fronte2 cm&#xD;
           above the pupil, maxillary: cheek e 1 cm lateral to the nose wing, and mandibular: chin&#xD;
           skin e 1 cm below the lip angle), at the hand dorsum (1 cm lateral to the thumb basis)&#xD;
           and the anterior tibia skin (10 cm below the basis of patella). The evaluation was&#xD;
           performed bilaterally in all subjects. All subjects were evaluated in the sitting&#xD;
           position, with the head resting at a flat surface, and in a silent room with acoustic&#xD;
           protection and the door closed. Only the participant and the researcher were in the&#xD;
           room. All subjects were evaluated by the same researcher. The participants were oriented&#xD;
           to keep the eyes closed during the exam, to be focused on the stimuli, and to their&#xD;
           location (face and mouth) and characteristics. Only the researcher knew the order of the&#xD;
           stimuli. Gustative thresholds: the following four substances, corresponding to the 4&#xD;
           tastes, were tested. For each test, one drop was applied at the tongue, starting with&#xD;
           the low concentration, interleaved with one drop of distillate water, and the&#xD;
           concentrations were tested until the subject had detected and identified the stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sweet: glucose (0.01 M; 0.032 M; 0.1 M; 0.32 M; 1.0 M); Salty: sodium chloride (0.01 M; 0.032&#xD;
      M; 0.1 M; 0.32 M;1.0 M); Sour: citric acid (0.00032 M; 0.001 M; 0.0032 M;0.01 M; 0.032 M);&#xD;
      Bitter: urea (0.1 M; 0.32 M; 1.0 M;3.2 M; 10.0 M). Olfactory thresholds: the subjects were&#xD;
      evaluated with isopropanol solutions in polyethylene bottles interleaved with distillate&#xD;
      water, starting with the lowconcentration until the subject had detected the stimulus;0.09%,&#xD;
      13.0%, 23.0%, 35.0%, 53.0%, 70.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal detection: thermal testing was performed using the MSA thermo test device (Somedic,&#xD;
      Sweden). The baseline temperature was 32°C and the contact square area of the thermode was 9&#xD;
      x 9 mm. Cold detection threshold and warm detection threshold were assessed using ramped&#xD;
      stimuli 1°C/s. The evaluation consisted in 5 measurements for each thermal threshold, and the&#xD;
      means and standard deviations were considered for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical detection threshold: touch perception was assessed using a set of standardized von&#xD;
      Frey filaments with rounded tips of 0.5 mm diameter, applied with an electronic device (IITC,&#xD;
      Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Three measurements in g/mm2 were performed and the means and SDs&#xD;
      were considered for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration detection threshold: vibration testing was was performed using the electronic&#xD;
      Vibrameter device(Somedic, Sweden) with a vibrator of 650 g of weight and a contact area of 1&#xD;
      cm2 perpendicularly applied for the thresholds detection, using ramped stimuli of 1 Hz/s. The&#xD;
      method of calculation of vibration threshold consisted in the mean between the appearance and&#xD;
      disappearance thresholds detected by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain perception: deep pain thresholds were measured with the electronic pressure&#xD;
      algometer (Somedic, Sweden) with a probe area of 1 cm2 which was pressed on the skin with a&#xD;
      ramp rate of 50 kPa/s. Superficial pain perception: superficial pain thresholds were&#xD;
      determined using disposable needles of 8x10x0.5 mm, applied with an electronic device (IITC,&#xD;
      Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Three measurements in g/mm2 were performed and the means and SDs&#xD;
      were considered for the analysis.&#xD;

        The orofacial pain conditions include neuropathic pain, Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD),&#xD;
        headache and fibromyalgia were diagnosed according to IASP (International Association for&#xD;
        the Study of Pain) criteria. TMD were diagnosed following the American Academy of Orofacial&#xD;
        Pain (AAOP). All orofacial pain were diagnoses by a trained orofacial pain specialist.&#xD;
        Finally, patients with headache were diagnosed by a neurologist using the International&#xD;
        Headache Classification (ICHD) criteria. Diabetes mellitus and diabetic neuropathy were&#xD;
        diagnosed by an endocrinologist from our Hospital according to the World Health&#xD;
        Organization (WHO) recommendations and fibromyalgia were diagnosed by a physiatrist using&#xD;
        the American Academy of Rheumatology criteria. All controls were healthy and presented&#xD;
        neither previous diagnostic of orofacial pain nor generalized pain.&#xD;
