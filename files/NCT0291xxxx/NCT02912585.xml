      Infections are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in very low birth weight infants.&#xD;
      Use of mother's own breast milk in feeding these babies is associated with a decreased risk&#xD;
      of acquiring nosocomial infection. This protective effect is assigned to a plurality of&#xD;
      immune components in human milk. However, clinical instability of the preterm newborn in the&#xD;
      first days of life results in delayed initiation of enteral nutrition. Thus, alternative&#xD;
      methods for colostrum administration have been investigated, such as oropharyngeal&#xD;
      administration with evidence that would be safe and feasible to perform in children admitted&#xD;
      to the NICU in the first hours of life. Objective: To evaluate the immune stimulatory effect&#xD;
      of oropharyngeal administration of colostrum in the incidence of sepsis in very low birth&#xD;
      weight preterm infants.&#xD;

      Background: Infections are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in very low birth&#xD;
      weight infants. Use of mother's own breast milk in feeding these babies is associated with a&#xD;
      decreased risk of acquiring nosocomial infection. This protective effect is assigned to a&#xD;
      plurality of immune components in human milk. However, clinical instability of the preterm&#xD;
      newborn in the first days of life results in delayed initiation of enteral nutrition. Thus,&#xD;
      alternative methods for colostrum administration have been investigated, such as&#xD;
      oropharyngeal administration with evidence that would be safe and feasible to perform in&#xD;
      children admitted to the NICU in the first hours of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the immune stimulatory effect of oropharyngeal administration of&#xD;
      colostrum in the incidence of sepsis in very low birth weight preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This was a prospective, randomized and blind study that included infants less than&#xD;
      34 weeks gestational age and birth weight less than 1,500 g, from 15 July 2013 to 15 July&#xD;
      2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The babies were divided initially into two groups for oropharyngeal administration or not of&#xD;
      mother's own milk: Group 1 - underwent oropharyngeal administration of mother's own milk of&#xD;
      and Group 2 - underwent oropharyngeal administration of sterile water, considered an inert&#xD;
      substance. Newborns who were drawn to the Group 1 and it was not possible to obtain&#xD;
      sufficient mother's own milk volume constituted a third group called Group 3 that receive&#xD;
      oropharyngeal administration of donor breast milk. Oropharyngeal administration were&#xD;
      initiated within the first 48-72 hours of life and maintained for 48 hours. Before the&#xD;
      oropharyngeal administration, 24 hours after and 14 days after, samples of blood and urine&#xD;
      were collected from the newborns to IgA and lactoferrin dosage.&#xD;
