      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of the Swank Diet (low saturated fat) and&#xD;
      the Wahls Elimination Diet (modified paleo) on fatigue levels in individuals with&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have documented fatigue. Participants will follow&#xD;
      their usual diet for 12 weeks and then be randomly assigned to follow one of the two diets&#xD;
      for 24 weeks.&#xD;

      their usual diet for 12 weeks and then be randomly assigned to follow one of the two diets&#xD;
      for 24 weeks. Individuals will continue with their current treatments in addition to&#xD;
      following the study diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study requires four visits to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City,&#xD;
      Iowa. Visits will be 12 weeks apart. Study activities include fasting blood draws, weighed&#xD;
      food records, motor and cognitive testing, physical activity assessment, questionnaires, and&#xD;
      daily diet checklists while following the study diet. Some reimbursement available.&#xD;
