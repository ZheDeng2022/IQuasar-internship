  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of regionally-advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) requires a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach with a combination of surgery, radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Due to these aggressive combined modalities, patients undergoing treatment and many survivors&#xD;
      develop toxicities which impact quality of life (QoL) and sometimes lead to mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymph node metastases of HNSCC are frequent and considered one of the most important&#xD;
      prognostic factors, resulting in decreased survival by 50%. More than three decades, the&#xD;
      optimal management strategy of node positive HNSCC was a key subject of debate. In summary,&#xD;
      the current literature provides us two important findings: First, with the contemporary&#xD;
      imaging and treatment modalities, there is no role of a planned neck dissection (ND) added to&#xD;
      (chemo)radiotherapy ((C)RT) in terms of oncological outcome and survival. Second, with modern&#xD;
      RT techniques, a tailored treatment followed after an up-front neck dissection (UFND) allows&#xD;
      a significant reduction of treatment volumes and de-escalation of the dose to the neck,&#xD;
      leading to reduction of treatment related toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study strategies with and without up-front neck dissection prior to&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy will be compared.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that the addition of UFND prior&#xD;
      to (C)RT results in a significant reduction of treatment toxicities and improvement of QoL in&#xD;
      regionally advanced (cN2-3) HNSCC through dose de-escalation and volume reduction of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this trial is to evaluate the toxicity from the beginning of&#xD;
      radiotherapy until 90 days after the end of the treatment. The incidence of acute and&#xD;
      subacute toxicities higher than grade ≥3 (CTCAE v.4, except for Xerostomia, for which&#xD;
      RTOG/EORTC scale will be used) will be compared between study arms. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include the survival endpoints for both treatment modalities; i.e. loco-regional control,&#xD;
      progression-free and overall survival. Assessment of QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 + H&amp;N43), late&#xD;
      toxicity, surgical complications, cost-effectiveness and the need of feeding-tube will be a&#xD;
      part of the final analysis of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: randomized multi-center open-label comparative one-staged phase III trial with&#xD;
      a superiority design and the primary endpoint of highest grade radiation toxicity during and&#xD;
      until 90 days after the completion of the treatment. Interventions in both arms of the trial&#xD;
      are considered as standard treatments. No experimental diagnostic tools will be used during&#xD;
      the trial. In addition to the randomized arms, two identical observational arms will be&#xD;
      opened for the patients who are diagnosed before the activation of the randomized arms, and&#xD;
      subsequently for those who refuse to be randomized. Their aim is to prospectively acquire&#xD;
      high quality data for patients who refuse randomization. The observational and randomized&#xD;
      cohorts will be analyzed separately for the pre-defined endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the sample size, grade ≥3 acute radiation toxicity in the CRT alone&#xD;
      (Arm A) was assumed as 70% based on literature. For the primary endpoint, a follow-up period&#xD;
      of 90 days after the last day of (C)RT is needed after the accrual of the last patient.&#xD;
      However, 2 years of follow-up after (C)RT is needed for the secondary endpoints (exception:&#xD;
      oncological outcome and survival will be calculated from the day of randomization in order to&#xD;
      avoid immortal time bias). On this basis, sample size was calculated based on the Pearson&#xD;
      chi-squared test and performed in Stata. Assuming a toxicity fraction of 70% for any grade 3&#xD;
      or higher toxicity in Arm A, a relative risk of 0.5 (35% in Arm B), a two-sided alpha of&#xD;
      0.05, a power of 80%, a drop-out rate of 5%, and an allocation ratio of 1 we calculated an&#xD;
      overall sample size of 65. Expected accrual time is 3 years.&#xD;

             with cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Women are not breastfeeding. Women with Child-bearing potential and using effective&#xD;
             contraception (see Section 5.6), and not pregnant and agree not to become pregnant&#xD;
             during participation in the trial and 2 years after chemoradiotherapy. A negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test before inclusion (within 28 days) into the trial is required for all&#xD;
             women with child-bearing potential. Men agree not to father a child during&#xD;
             participation in the trial and 2 years after chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
         29. No clinically manifested Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or&#xD;
             immune-compromised patients. Note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry&#xD;
             into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is&#xD;
             necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly&#xD;
             immunosuppressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially&#xD;
        hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions&#xD;
        should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.&#xD;
