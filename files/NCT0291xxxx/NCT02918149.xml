    <textblock>
      Clinicians are often unable to successfully do a spinal tap. Ultrasound has been proposed as&#xD;
      a method to improve success but it is not known if it helps. This study is designed to see if&#xD;
      ultrasound improves the success rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential procedure&#xD;
      in the neonatal/infant intensive care unit (N/IICU) for establishing diagnosis and&#xD;
      determining treatment. The traditional technique for performing an LP involves palpation of&#xD;
      anatomic landmarks followed by a &quot;blind&quot; stick of the appropriate inter-spinous process&#xD;
      space. This technique has a failure rate (defined as the inability to obtain cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid or obtaining a traumatic puncture) of 15-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedside ultrasonography possesses the ability to visualize the anatomic landmarks, including&#xD;
      the subarachnoid space. In the adult literature, ultrasound has been shown to reduce the LP&#xD;
      failure rate. Its utility has also been shown to significantly improve success rates and&#xD;
      accuracy in epidural needle placement in neonates and children undergoing regional&#xD;
      anesthesia. Increasing the proportion of successful LPs in the N/IICU could significantly&#xD;
      reduce patient/family discomfort, sedation exposure, off unit travel, additional&#xD;
      interventional procedures and antibiotic use. However, research on the utility of bedside&#xD;
      ultrasound assisted LPs by clinicians working in an N/IICU is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      undergo LP (performed as part of their standard of care) with ultrasound assisted method or&#xD;
      traditional landmark method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if bedside ultrasound-assisted LP, performed by N/IICU clinicians on neonates&#xD;
      and infants aged ≤6 months, increases the proportion of successful first attempt&#xD;
      non-traumatic LPs when compared to a traditional landmark palpation technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if bedside-ultrasound assisted LPs increases the proportion of overall&#xD;
           successful non-traumatic LPs within 2 attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if bedside-ultrasound assisted LPs is associated with a decrease in the&#xD;
           length of antibiotic exposure in patients undergoing LPs.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of successful first attempt LPs (defined as obtainment of CSF and non-traumatic LP) for patients in the ultrasound-assisted group compared to the traditional landmark palpation group. Providers will have 2 attempts to complete the LP. If CSF cannot be obtained within 2 attempts, any subsequent attempt will be at the discretion of the attending neonatologist and will be performed outside this study by the care team.</description>

    <description>Clinician will follow routine palpation landmark technique procedure for LP, such as identification of anatomic landmarks by palpation (i.e., superior borders of the posterior iliac crest lies in parallel with L4 spinous process). Palpation will be followed by &quot;blind&quot; stick of the appropriate inter-spinous process space. The study member will have 2 attempts to complete the LP. A &quot;successful&quot; attempt is obtaining cerebrospinal fluid.</description>

    <description>Clinician will use an ultrasound-assisted technique to perform the LP. The Phillips CX50 ultrasound machine is an FDA approved device and will be used in accordance with its approved labeling. Spinal ultrasound will be performed using a linear high-frequency transducer to locate and mark the termination of the conus medullaris, the narrowing of the spinal canal, and the midline to delineate a &quot;safe zone&quot;. The study team member will have 2 attempts to complete the LP. A &quot;successful&quot; attempt is obtaining cerebrospinal fluid.</description>
