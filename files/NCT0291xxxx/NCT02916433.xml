      The purpose of this study is to determine whether administration of octreotide (12-25&#xD;
      mcg/hour) for 72 hours in combination with the standard of care treatment is effective in&#xD;
      reducing bronchorrhea (excessive airway secretions) in mechanically ventilated patients. The&#xD;
      use of this drug (octreotide) to manage bronchorrhea has not been approved by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is used as an experimental drug in this&#xD;
      research study. We are anticipating to enroll approximately 30 subjects in this study at&#xD;
      Danbury Hospital, with 15 patients randomly assigned to the &quot;Routine Care&quot; group, which will&#xD;
      serve as the control group, and 15 patients randomly assigned to the octreotide group.&#xD;
      Control group will only receive the standard of care and will not receive this drug. Total&#xD;
      subject participation in this study will be for 4 days (96 hours) or until their breathing&#xD;
      tube is removed (extubation), whichever occurs first.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Octreotide is widely available and has a relatively low cost (about $17/day in our hospital).&#xD;
      In the United States, it has been used widely in outpatient and inpatient settings for over&#xD;
      16 years, mostly for various endocrinopathies and gastrointestinal variceal bleeds but also&#xD;
      for a number of other pathologies. It is considered by clinicians to be an overall&#xD;
      well-tolerated medication, with fewer significant side-effects compared to systemic steroids&#xD;
      and scopolamine. If octreotide is proven to be an effective mucoregulator, it may become an&#xD;
      essential tool used in the intensive care units throughout the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of including parenteral octreotide&#xD;
      (12-25 mcg/hour for 72 hours) in addition to the other standard of care treatments deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the ICU attending physician in managing bronchorrhea in mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients. It is hypothesized that octreotide decreases excessive bronchial secretions and&#xD;
      shortens time to extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups of 15, &quot;Routine Care&quot; group, which will serve as the control group, and&#xD;
      &quot;Octreotide&quot; group. The amount of bronchial secretions is routinely measured in all&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients. Once the Primary Team identifies a patient as a candidate&#xD;
      for the study (based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and an informed consent has&#xD;
      been obtained, the baseline volume of bronchial secretions per 12-hour period will be&#xD;
      recorded and a security envelope containing group assignment will be opened by the ICU&#xD;
      attending. Both groups will continue to receive treatments that have already been initiated&#xD;
      to manage bronchial secretions. In addition, &quot;Octreotide&quot; group will receive parenteral&#xD;
      octreotide, while &quot;Routine Care&quot; group will receive care as deemed necessary by the Primary&#xD;
      Team. The rate of bronchial secretions will be measured and recorded daily; the changes,&#xD;
      relative to the baseline measurements, will be compared between the groups. These&#xD;
      interventions will be continued for 72 hours or until extubation or withdrawal from the&#xD;
      study, whichever occurs earlier. Subsequently, the standard of care management, as determined&#xD;
      by the Primary Team, will be resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Change in the rate of bronchial secretion, as compared to the baseline.&#xD;
