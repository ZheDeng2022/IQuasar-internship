      This study aims to provide National Malaria Control Programs (NMCP), international donors and&#xD;
      other key stakeholders with clear evidence on the impact and cost-effectiveness of using&#xD;
      indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a non-pyrethroid insecticide in a high malaria&#xD;
      transmission area that has universal long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage. This is&#xD;
      an interventional study with IRS serving as the research intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The district of Mopeia, in the province of Zambezia, Mozambique will be the study site. This&#xD;
      is a high transmission area with a malaria parasite prevalence of 54% in children. The&#xD;
      Ministry of Health distributed LLINs in Mopeia in 2014-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NMCP through funding from President's Malaria Initiative Africa Indoor Residual Spraying&#xD;
      Project (PMI-AIRS) was able to cover half a district with indoor residual spraying. A&#xD;
      simplified census took place in mid-2016 to determine the number of children five years of&#xD;
      age and under in the district and enumerate and map the households to assist in&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the 115 villages/bairros existent in Mopeia, 86 clusters were randomized in a government&#xD;
      randomization ceremony to either receive IRS with Actellic or maintain no IRS. The IRS was&#xD;
      implemented through a partnership between the NMCP and PMI-AIRS according to standard&#xD;
      operational and consent procedures. From each cluster, a cohort of 18 children five years of&#xD;
      age and under will be followed monthly to assess malaria incidence at the community level in&#xD;
      both IRS and non-IRS villages. There will be 774 children in the IRS villages and 774&#xD;
      children in the no-IRS villages (total cohort will be 1548). Additionally, the routine health&#xD;
      centre reporting system will be strengthened to assess malaria incidence in children five&#xD;
      years of age and under by passive case detection. Three cross sectional studies in April&#xD;
      2017, April 2018, and April 2019 will assess changes in net use, health seeking behaviour and&#xD;
      malaria prevalence at the community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entomological data will be collected from both IRS and non-IRS areas to assess the vector&#xD;
      dynamics and insecticide resistance pattern of the local vector populations from sprayed and&#xD;
      unsprayed areas. Data on the costs of the implementation as well as health-related&#xD;
      expenditures at health system and household levels will be collected prospectively throughout&#xD;
      the study. These costs will be determined using both health system and societal perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence rate in IRS and no-IRS areas will be combined with the micro-costing data to&#xD;
      calculate the cost per case averted at community and health facility level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings will be disseminated to the NMCP and international donors and stakeholders to&#xD;
      complement the World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on combining indoor residual spraying&#xD;
      and long-lasting insecticidal nets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mopeia is a district in the Zambezia Province. Mopeia borders the district of Morrumbala to&#xD;
      the North, the district of Chinde and the province of Sofala to the South, the districts of&#xD;
      Nicoadala and Inhassunge in the East and the Provinces of Sofala and Tete in the West. It has&#xD;
      an area of 7671 km2. The projected population for 2016 is 162.188 individuals with 31.927&#xD;
      (19.7%) under five years of age (National Institute of Statistics, Mozambique). There are&#xD;
      three administrative posts, eleven localities and 224 villages (Bairros) and approximately&#xD;
      34.603 households. There are 12 health facilities (PMI-AIRS Mozambique, unpublished data).&#xD;
      There is little socio-economic data available from Mopeia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The malaria burden is high in Zambezia with a parasite prevalence of 54% in under-fives [19].&#xD;
      The parasite prevalence in children 1-15 years of age in Mopeia is 47.8% (38.7%-57.1%) [20].&#xD;
      The mean rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positivity rate during a recent enhanced surveillance&#xD;
      exercise at health facilities was 62.8% (range 50-72%) [21]. The same data suggest high&#xD;
      incidence at health facilities, showing 470 cases per 1000 children during the same period&#xD;
      (June-Nov 2014). Mopeia recently received 175.297 LLINs in 2013 and IRS with pyrethroids in&#xD;
      2014 [22]. Residents of Mopeia will receive new LLINs in early 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from February 2015 in the neighbouring districts of Mocuba and Morrumbala show&#xD;
      Pyrethroid resistance in the local Anopheles gambiae s.l. population [23]. Further north, in&#xD;
      the district of Milange, tested Anopheles gambiae s.l. remain susceptible to pyrethroids&#xD;
      [23]. See table 2 below for further details. Mopeia has been selected to receive IRS because&#xD;
      of its high malaria transmission intensity, the presence of LLINs in the district, and the&#xD;
      aforementioned regional indications of reduced pyrethroid susceptibility in the target vector&#xD;
      population, and the existence of IRS infrastructure and capacity from previous campaigns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The villages selected for spraying will receive IRS with Actellic according to standard&#xD;
      operating and consent procedures [24] in addition to existing LLINs. Non IRS areas will have&#xD;
      existing LLINs, but will not receive IRS. In late 2017 (year two), IRS will be repeated using&#xD;
      the same village selection and insecticide. Additionally in 2017, the whole district will be&#xD;
      subject to universal LLIN distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals enrolled in the cohort were recruited independent of their household acceptance&#xD;
      or refusal of spray. IRS status will be confirmed with questionnaires during the monthly&#xD;
      active cohort visits and during the cross-sectional surveys, including questions about wall&#xD;
      replastering/painting and net usage (SSPs COST 001, 002 and 003). Additional information will&#xD;
      be obtained through cone bioassays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of malaria care at community and health center will remain unchanged throughout&#xD;
      the study and stock levels of malaria commodities will be ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study of IRS implementation in Mozambique will provide detailed information of the&#xD;
      impact and cost-effectiveness of adding IRS with an extended release formulation of the&#xD;
      organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos-methyl (ActellicÂ®300CS) in a high transmission area&#xD;
      with high LLIN coverage. This information will be disseminated to the NMCP as well as to&#xD;
      local and international stakeholders and decision makers to inform policy recommendations and&#xD;
      choices regarding the combination of vector control strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simplified census was conducted in June-July 2016 to obtain the total number of children&#xD;
      five years of age and under per household and village. A randomization ceremony for the&#xD;
      intervention took place to randomly assign the villages to receive IRS or maintain their&#xD;
      current status. Participants in both IRS and non-IRS areas were randomly chosen and consented&#xD;
      to participate in cohorts to be followed prospectively. The total population disaggregated in&#xD;
      under five years of age and above five in each village in the district will be used as a&#xD;
      denominator for the passive case detection component of the study. Each house was&#xD;
      geopositioned during the census visit as part of the household enumeration for spraying. This&#xD;
      information can assist in defining the cluster size, core and buffer areas. Each household&#xD;
      will receive a unique permanent ID. This is an interventional study with IRS serving as the&#xD;
      research intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the incidence by active case detection, a cohort of children five years of age&#xD;
      and under will be followed monthly from the core zone of each cluster. During each visit the&#xD;
      care taker will answer a short questionnaire regarding health, net usage and health-related&#xD;
      expenditure. The temperature of each recruited child will be recorded and an RDT performed.&#xD;
      If the child has a positive RDT, irrespective of accompanying clinical symptoms he/she will&#xD;
      receive treatment according to the national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At health facility level, a separate facility-based team will ensure the collection of the&#xD;
      household location (village) of each malaria case to determine the incidence in the different&#xD;
      study clusters by passive case detection. Joint work with the community health workers&#xD;
      (Agentes Polivantes Elementares [APEs]) will also strengthen quality of their data and they&#xD;
      will be asked to include information on the location (village) of each malaria case they&#xD;
      diagnose/treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costing data will be prospectively collected using standardized data collection tools to&#xD;
      determine the cost of interventions (IRS and LLIN distribution) and of care-seeking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional studies will be carried out at the peak of transmission season in 2017, 2018,&#xD;
      and 2019. There is a potential for the monthly visits for active case detection to have an&#xD;
      influence on household behavior and expenditure. Additional data on house expenditure will be&#xD;
      collected during the cross-sectionals to assess societal costs of malaria care that is&#xD;
      independent from study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entomological data including mosquito densities, sporozoite rates, resistance status and&#xD;
      indoor/outdoor biting ratios will be sampled from IRS and non-IRS villages throughout the&#xD;
      study following standard PMI procedures.&#xD;
