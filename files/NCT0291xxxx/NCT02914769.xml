    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present trial is to test the efficacy of Ayahuasca in treatment-resistant&#xD;
      depression. Ayahuasca is a decoction of two plants, long used by Amazonian Amerindians.&#xD;
      Traditionally, it is prepared by decoction of a bush (Psychotria viridis) with a liana&#xD;
      (Banisteriopsis caapi). P. viridis is a rich source of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a&#xD;
      serotonergic agonist, and B. caapi contains potent monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors (MAOi-A),&#xD;
      such as harmine, harmaline. The study is designed as a randomized placebo controlled trial&#xD;
      with two parallel arms, and it will also evaluate changes of different biomarkers of&#xD;
      depression including anatomical and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), serum levels&#xD;
      of BDNF, TNF-a, cortisol, IL-6, and IL-10, polysomnography, neuropsychological, psychiatric&#xD;
      scales and questionnaires.&#xD;

      1) Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic effectiveness of currently available antidepressant is low. Less than 50% of&#xD;
      the patients achieve remission after single treatment, and about 30% after four different&#xD;
      treatments. Besides low response rates, pharmacological treatment are associated with several&#xD;
      side effects and response onset is usually long (~2-3 weeks). Thus, great effort has been&#xD;
      made to the development of alternative antidepressants. For instance, ketamine, a&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has rapid and potent antidepressant effects&#xD;
      in treatment of major depressive and bipolar disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal aims at testing the antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca, traditionally prepared&#xD;
      by decoction of two plants: Psychotria viridis and Banisteriopsis caapi, long used by&#xD;
      Amazonian Amerindians. P. viridis is a rich source of the serotonergic agonist&#xD;
      N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), whereas B. caapi contains potent monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors&#xD;
      (MAOi-A) such as harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common effects of Ayahuasca include sedation, gastrointestinal distress, changes of&#xD;
      spatiotemporal scaling, dissociation, sense of well-being, insights, feelings of&#xD;
      apprehension, increased interoceptive attention and sensory pseudo-hallucinations. Effects&#xD;
      begin at 30-40 min after oral intake, and last up to 4 hours. Previous studies suggest the&#xD;
      absence of psychological, neuropsychological or psychiatric harm caused by prolonged&#xD;
      Ayahuasca consumption, and it is not addictive, on the contrary, it also shows promise in&#xD;
      treating addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two preliminary open label studies have tested tolerability, safety and the&#xD;
      antidepressant effect of Ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression. In the first study, six&#xD;
      patients were recruited, in the second, 17 patients. The results show significant decrease in&#xD;
      depression severity (HAM-D &amp; MADRS scales) already at 2 hours after intake, which lasted for&#xD;
      21 days. Although the results are promising, they must be considered with caution, specially&#xD;
      due to the lack of control of the placebo effect, which is generally high in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the present study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 50 patients with&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression. Besides the Antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca, this study&#xD;
      will also evaluate different biomarkers of depression, including anatomical and functional&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), serum levels of BDNF, TNF-a, cortisol, IL-6, and IL-10,&#xD;
      polysomnography, neuropsychological and psychiatric scales and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 50 patients will undergo routine evaluation, including complete blood testing for&#xD;
      individual glycemic profile, serum cholesterol and triglyceride, plasma sodium and potassium,&#xD;
      urea and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a wash-out period, between 7 and 14 days prior to the experimental&#xD;
      session, depending on the lifetime of the antidepressant in use. Experiments will take place&#xD;
      at the Hospital Universitário Onofre Lopes, a tertiary university hospital affiliated to the&#xD;
      Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment session, 25 patients will drink Ayahuasca, 25 will drink an inert placebo.&#xD;
      Psychiatric scales (HAM-D, MADRS, BPRS, CADSS and YMRS) will be completed during treatment&#xD;
      session, day one before (-D1), one day after (+D1), two days (+D2), seven days (+D7),&#xD;
      fourteen days (+D14), one month (+M1), and up to six months (+M6) following the treatment&#xD;
      session. The following exams will also be conducted at D-1 and D+1: neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      (watch test, trail test, and N-back), structural and functional MRI, polysomnography and&#xD;
      blood testing (BDNF, TNF-a, cortisol, oxytocin, IL-6, and IL-10).&#xD;
