  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A is a rare X chromosome-linked recessive bleeding disorder that concerns one&#xD;
      individual in 5000. In its severe form, hemophilia A is a life-threatening, crippling&#xD;
      hemorrhagic disease. The treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A patients involves the&#xD;
      administration of exogenous human FVIII to restore normal hemostasis. The main complication&#xD;
      of the substitutive treatment of hemophilia A is the development, in 15 to 30% of the cases,&#xD;
      of anti-FVIII antibodies (FVIII inhibitors) that neutralize the pro-coagulant activity of&#xD;
      therapeutically administered FVIII. In 2003, the average annual cost of care for a patient&#xD;
      with hemophilia A was evaluated to be equal to 63,000 euros (2), which, in France (6000&#xD;
      patients), represents an annual budget of 378 million euros.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the cost of treatment and to bypass this complication, different&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies (new products or adjunctive therapeutic options) have been explored,&#xD;
      including platelet infusion, tranexamic acid, amino caproic acid, molecules that block tissue&#xD;
      factor pathway inhibitor, combination of phospholipid -Factor Xa- Factor XIII and antibodies&#xD;
      directed to the Tissue Factor Inhibitor Pathway (TFPI). Recently, Soluble thrombomodulin&#xD;
      (Solulin) have been developed. This molecule may be used to partially correct the premature&#xD;
      lysis defect in Factor VIII deficient plasma through an activated TAFI - dependent mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a long half-life (15- to 30-hour) and effective dose range estimated to range from the&#xD;
      sub-nanomolar to approximately 40nM, Solulin could potentially be administered on a weekly&#xD;
      basis and provide the basis for a factor-sparing regime that would cut costs and make therapy&#xD;
      more widely available. However, before proceeding to advanced trials, safety concerns&#xD;
      stemming from the anticoagulant properties of Solulin must be addressed. The development of&#xD;
      Solulin mutants lacking protein C activation capacity would make this concern redundant. At&#xD;
      the same time, such mutant molecules are likely to possess an effective dose range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project is to compare the behavior of recombinant Solulin and mutants of Solulin lacking&#xD;
      protein C activation capacity with respect to their ability to stabilize fibrin clots in&#xD;
      whole blood of humans with different coagulation factor deficiencies (hemophilia A,&#xD;
      hemophilia B and rare blood coagulation deficiencies (factor X, VII, V).&#xD;
