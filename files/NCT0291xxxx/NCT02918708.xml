      The National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium conducts Department of Health funded trials trials&#xD;
      to provide information to underpin changes to the national immunisation and vaccination&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess how different schedules of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines work in&#xD;
      providing protection to young infants. It is well established that vaccines can behave&#xD;
      differently depending on which order they are given and alongside which other immunisations.&#xD;
      This has been shown for Hib and MenC vaccines, which are similar in structure to the&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccines that will be studied here. The investigators will measure responses to&#xD;
      the pneumococcal vaccines as well as to other routine immunisations, all of which will be&#xD;
      provided by our study team. Infants will be recruited by dedicated study staff through&#xD;
      primary care and will participate from their first vaccinations at 2 months of age, until the&#xD;
      blood sample taken a month after their boosters at a year old, i.e. until 13 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any child found to have antibody levels below that which indicates protection for Hib, MenC,&#xD;
      MenB or pneumococcal in the blood sample taken at 13 months of age will be offered an extra&#xD;
      dose of the relevant vaccine(s).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK Department of Health provides a routine vaccination schedule for children in the UK&#xD;
      which is administered by GP surgeries. The schedule is updated by the addition of antigens&#xD;
      and amendment of products and schedules over time to improve the protection afforded to the&#xD;
      paediatric population and the overall cost-effectiveness of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now well established that the effects of giving different vaccines and antigens&#xD;
      together, as well as the order and numbers of doses given for priming and boosting, can&#xD;
      affect the immunological responses they elicit. For example co-administration of different&#xD;
      polysaccharide conjugate vaccines may enhance responses as shown in a prior study by our&#xD;
      group - the National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium (NVEC). This demonstrated that the&#xD;
      tetanus-toxoid conjugated MCC vaccine enhanced the response to a co-administered Hib&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine if it was also conjugated to tetanus toxoid . In some cases, more than one&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine is available for the same disease, as occurred in the early days of the Hib&#xD;
      programme when vaccines conjugated to tetanus toxoid or CRM - a natural nontoxigenic&#xD;
      diphtheria protein- were both available. NVEC therefore conducted a study to assess the&#xD;
      impact of interchanging the two different Hib conjugate vaccines for the three dose primary&#xD;
      immunisation course. This showed that interchanging the two different Hib conjugates for&#xD;
      primary immunisation did not compromise immune responses and some mixed schedules gave higher&#xD;
      antibody responses than those in which all three doses were given with the same conjugate.&#xD;
      However, when mixed schedules of MCC-TT and MCC-CRM were subsequently studied by NVEC a&#xD;
      MCC-CRM/MCC-TT two dose schedule was shown to be inferior to those in which MCC-TT was given&#xD;
      as the first priming dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, the UK has used pneumococcal conjugate vaccines from Pfizer in the form of seven&#xD;
      or 13 valent PCV, with the current schedule recommending vaccination with PCV13 at 2, 4 and&#xD;
      12 months of age (2+1 schedule). The 13 polysaccharide serotypes in PCV13 are conjugated to&#xD;
      CRM. More recently a 10 valent conjugate vaccine manufactured by GSK (PCV10) has been&#xD;
      licensed for use in the UK as a 2+1 schedule. The 10 serotypes in PCV10 are also in PCV13 but&#xD;
      it lacks serotypes 3, 6A and 19A. No significant protection in vaccinated infants has been&#xD;
      shown by PCV13 against serotype 3 [Andrews et al 2014] and for 6A and 19A PCV10 has been&#xD;
      shown to provide some cross protection against these serotypes. Like PCV13, PCV10 is safe and&#xD;
      efficacious and is in global use. Unlike PCV13, however, the proteins used for conjugation in&#xD;
      PCV10 are a mixture of Haemophilus influenzae protein D, tetanus toxoid and diphtheria&#xD;
      toxoid. As with Hib and MCC conjugate vaccines, having two PCV products that could be used in&#xD;
      the UK schedule would provide reassurance about vaccine supply and could improve cost&#xD;
      effectiveness by reducing vaccine cost. However, if PCV10 vaccine is to be considered for use&#xD;
      in the UK, particularly if a combination of PCV10 and PCV13 is used in the national schedule,&#xD;
      this would require evidence of the adequate immunogenicity of a mixed schedule and this&#xD;
      cannot be inferred from the experience with Hib and MCC conjugates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of a clinical trial in which PCV13 was used for the two priming doses at 2 and 4&#xD;
      months followed by a PCV10 booster dose at 12 months has recently been reported. This showed&#xD;
      that a protective antibody response post-booster (serotype specific antibody level by ELISA&#xD;
      â‰¥0.35ug/mL) to 9 of the 13 PCV31 serotypes was achieved by at least 97% of infants boosted&#xD;
      with PCV10 whereas PCV13 boosted infants achieved at least 97% protective responses to 11 of&#xD;
      the 13 serotypes. For 10 of the 13 serotypes the geometric mean concentrations of antibodies&#xD;
      were significantly higher in PCV13 boosted infants and for 3 serotypes were higher in PCV10&#xD;
      boosted infants. This study suggests that mixed PCV schedules in which the CRM-based vaccine&#xD;
      is given first may not be optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will build on this work, and will assess the alternative combination, which will&#xD;
      be PCV10 for priming followed by PCV13 for boosting. The comparator arm will be the current&#xD;
      standard of care. The study will therefore include two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2+1 : PCV13 at 2, 4 and 12 months of age 2+1 PCV10 at 2 and 4 months of age followed by PCV13&#xD;
      at 12 months of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive all other vaccines as defined under the routine infant&#xD;
      immunisation schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will rapidly provide information to the JCVI on options for the UK schedule for&#xD;
      pneumococcal immunisation of infants and how best the current options could be expanded&#xD;
      whilst retaining appropriate protection as afforded through the current schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded by the UK Department of Health and sponsored by Public Health England.&#xD;
      Following written informed consent from their parent/ guardian, infants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment groups and will receive all their vaccinations to 12&#xD;
      months of age as well as having two blood samples. The first sample will be a month after&#xD;
      completion of the primary series, at about five months of age, and the second a month after&#xD;
      the booster doses, at about 13 months of age. Extra doses of MenB, MenC, Hib and/or&#xD;
      pneumococcal vaccine(s) will be offered where the immune response measured in the&#xD;
      post-booster blood is below the correlate of protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from the study will be presented to the Department of Health to underpin ongoing&#xD;
      evolution of the national vaccination schedule. A manuscript will be submitted for&#xD;
      publication to a peer reviewed journal and all participating families will receive a summary&#xD;
      of the study findings by post.&#xD;
