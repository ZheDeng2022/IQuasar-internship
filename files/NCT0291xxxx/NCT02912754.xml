  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves adding the kinase inhibitor Ruxolitinib to Ibrutinib to treat Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibrutinib is an effective drug that can extend the lives of CLL patients but it is not&#xD;
      curative as a single agent and may eventually select for more aggressive disease. Survival of&#xD;
      CLL cells in the presence of Ibrutinib may be enabled by signals from the microenvironment&#xD;
      where the leukemia cells originate. These signals are transmitted into the cells by Janus&#xD;
      Kinases (JAKs) such as janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and janus kinase 2 (JAK2). According, JAK&#xD;
      inhibitors may overcome the cytoprotective properties of the CLL microenvironment and help to&#xD;
      improve outcomes with Ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib is licensed for use in myelofibrosis and polycythemia rubra&#xD;
      vera and its toxicity and efficacy as a single agent in CLL has been studied in two previous&#xD;
      clinical trials. As a single agent, Ruxolitinib was inferior to Ibrutinib. However,&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib was shown to cooperate with Ibrutinib and increase killing of CLL cells in vitro.&#xD;
      Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that Ruxolitinib will significantly improve&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy of single-agent Ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center phase I/II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib&#xD;
      tablets in CLL patients being treated until progression with Ibrutinib and considered at risk&#xD;
      to progress on the basis of persistent lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy after 1 year of&#xD;
      Ibrutinib or elevated beta-2-microglobulin (b2M) levels after 6 months of Ibrutinib.&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib will be administered for 21 days of a 35-day cycle to be repeated 6 more times.&#xD;

             contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. Incase of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). the vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception Women are&#xD;
                  considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
                  months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
                  (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or&#xD;
                  tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only&#xD;
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors for patients in the phase I component of the trial.&#xD;
