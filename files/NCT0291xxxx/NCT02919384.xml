      During this study, patients will undergo a routine in vitro fertilization cycle as they would&#xD;
      otherwise if not participating in the study. After eggs have been fertilized they will be&#xD;
      cultured as usual until day 3 of embryo development. On day 3 of development, the&#xD;
      embryologist will randomize half of the embryos to be cultured in 2% oxygen concentration and&#xD;
      the other half at 5%, which is currently the standard of care. All other embryological care&#xD;
      procedures will remain the same. On day 5 or 6 of embryo development, the embryos will be&#xD;
      evaluated and each blastocyst stage embryo will be recorded. The primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      blastulation rate (or percentage of embryos that reach the blastocyst stage).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Significant progress has been made in characterizing the optimal environment for a developing&#xD;
      embryo in culture. These efforts have been based on the premise that clinical embryo culture&#xD;
      should mimic the in vivo environment. To this end, investigators have gone to great lengths&#xD;
      to recreate every aspect of the natural setting to which the early embryo is exposed. This&#xD;
      focused approach has led to significant modifications of the embryo culture system in the&#xD;
      modern in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab and ultimately to improvements in pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One area that has been subject to significant scrutiny is the relationship between incubator&#xD;
      oxygen concentration and early embryonic development. Oxygen plays a central role in&#xD;
      embryonic metabolism. The mechanism governing its utilization is dependent on the stage of&#xD;
      embryonic development. During the first 3 days of development, oxygen reaches the embryo via&#xD;
      passive diffusion and its concentration gradient is regulated by oxygen consumption during&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation. Inefficiencies in this process - due to compromised integrity of&#xD;
      the inner mitochondrial membrane or alterations in substrate availability - can result in&#xD;
      excessive production of harmful reactive oxygen species which can cause significant damage to&#xD;
      cellular machinery and ultimately lead to embryonic arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of oxygen that the embryo in culture is exposed to can also impact this&#xD;
      delicately balanced system and alter the metabolic health of an embryo. Historically,&#xD;
      atmospheric oxygen concentration (approximately 20%) was exclusively used in human IVF&#xD;
      laboratories for embryo culture. However, multiple investigations subsequently found that the&#xD;
      physiologic concentration of oxygen within the female reproductive tract is well below&#xD;
      atmospheric levels, being consistently measured at &lt;10%. These observations led to multiple&#xD;
      trials comparing atmospheric oxygen concentrations to 5% oxygen in embryo culture. These&#xD;
      studies demonstrated significant perturbations in gene expression, protein secretion, and&#xD;
      suboptimal utilization of amino acids and carbohydrates in embryos cultured in atmospheric&#xD;
      oxygen. The same comparisons were made in clinical IVF studies and demonstrated that embryos&#xD;
      cultured in 5% oxygen consistently resulted in an increase in clinical pregnancy rate and&#xD;
      live birth rate. A meta-analysis of this topic suggested that a clinic with a baseline live&#xD;
      birth rate of 30% could expect an improvement as great as 13% when culturing embryos at 5%&#xD;
      O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of these compelling data, most modern IVF programs now exclusively culture&#xD;
      embryos at 5% oxygen concentration. However, some have proposed that the oxygen concentration&#xD;
      to which the embryo is exposed after day 3 of development is actually lower than 5%. These&#xD;
      data originate from the idea that the embryo crosses the utero-tubal junction on day 3 of&#xD;
      development in vivo. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the oxygen concentration in the&#xD;
      uterus is actually lower than that in the fallopian tube at approximately 2%. Thus, the most&#xD;
      physiologic embryo culture system would culture embryos in 5% oxygen until day 3 and then&#xD;
      decrease the oxygen concentration to 2% until transfer or cryopreservation on day 5 or 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A change in the optimal oxygen concentration for an embryo on day 3 would fit with a general&#xD;
      shift in metabolic requirements of embryos seen at this stage of development. Activation of&#xD;
      the embryonic genome occurs on day 3 which prompts a significant increase in biosynthetic&#xD;
      activity. The metabolic behavior of embryos also shifts substantially during this time. The&#xD;
      embryo changes its metabolic strategy from oxidative phosphorylation to glucose based&#xD;
      metabolism in the form of the aerobic glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. During this&#xD;
      process, termed compaction, embryos exhibit greatly increased oxygen consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiologic environment of the female reproductive tract tends to mirror the metabolic&#xD;
      needs of the developing preimplantation embryo. As the embryo shifts its metabolic strategy&#xD;
      after compaction and upon entering the uterus, it is certainly possible that a reduced oxygen&#xD;
      concentration in the uterus may best support the energy producing mechanisms of this stage in&#xD;
      embryonic development. Recapitulating this environment in culture may enhance embryonic&#xD;
      development and long term health of pregnancies resulting from IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact a recent pilot study, using embryos donated to research demonstrated improved embryo&#xD;
      development when embryos were cultured in 2% oxygen after day 3 of development compared to 5%&#xD;
      (Kaser et al.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of Proposed Study This study seeks to compare laboratory outcomes of embryos cultured&#xD;
      at 2% oxygen concentration and 5% oxygen concentration after compaction. The primary outcome&#xD;
      under study will be the proportion of day 3 embryos that are ongoing at the blastocyst stage&#xD;
      (known throughout the rest of this document as blastulation rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Location of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at both participating clinical centers. Oocyte retrieval,&#xD;
      embryology, embryo biopsy, and embryo transfer will occur at the clinical facilities of&#xD;
      Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey. All genetic diagnostics will occur at the&#xD;
      Foundation for Embryonic Competence (FEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertile couples attempting conception through in vitro fertilization. 60 couples will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study (see sample size calculation below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES Experimental Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the embryological impact of 2% oxygen versus 5%&#xD;
      concentrations in embryo culture after day 3 of development. As such, the study related&#xD;
      procedures begin only after a patient's embryos reach day 3 of development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design for this study is as follows: (Figure 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All care including oocyte retrieval, fertilization by ICSI, and cleavage stage culture&#xD;
           (days 0, 1, and 2) will be completely per routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is standard protocol in our laboratory to remove embryos from the incubator on day 3&#xD;
           to 1) perform assisted hatching and 2) change embryos from cleavage stage media to&#xD;
           blastocyst media&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At time of assisted hatching, two 5-well extended culture dishes will be brought to the&#xD;
           isolette where changeover into extended culture will take place. The configuration of&#xD;
           this 5-well dish is as follows. One mL of blastocyst media is placed in the center well&#xD;
           of the 5-well dish. This well is only used for washing of cleavage stage embryos prior&#xD;
           to placement into blastocyst media drops. The outer four wells contain small drops for&#xD;
           ongoing blastocyst culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the study, once assisted hatching is complete, all embryos will be placed&#xD;
           into the center well and mixed in the 1 mL of blastocyst media. At low power&#xD;
           magnification and with no ability to perform day 3 grading, half of the embryos will be&#xD;
           placed into the outer drops in one 5-well dish and half will be placed in the outer&#xD;
           drops of the other 5-well dish. These two dishes will then be separated to the left and&#xD;
           right side of the isolette. An embryologist, will then open a sequentially numbered,&#xD;
           opaque sealed envelope from the box marked &quot;oxygen randomization.&quot; The piece of paper in&#xD;
           this envelope will direct the embryologist to place the 5-well dish on the left side of&#xD;
           the isolette to either the 2 or 5% oxygen concentration incubator. The 5-well dish on&#xD;
           the right side of the incubator will go to the opposite condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The number of ongoing day 3 embryos in each condition will then be recorded and given to&#xD;
           data assessors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Embryos will not be examined or manipulated at all until day 5 of development as per&#xD;
           routine protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. On day 5 or 6 of embryo development, the embryos will be evaluated and the number of&#xD;
           ongoing blastocysts will be recorded for embryos cultured in each condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. All ongoing embryos will then undergo a trophectoderm biopsy using the standardized&#xD;
           technique according to standard laboratory protocol without regard to study. Embryos&#xD;
           will then be cryopreserved to allow for results from comprehensive chromosomal screening&#xD;
           to be available and to optimize embryonic-endometrial synchrony, as per standard&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Further decisions regarding the number of euploid embryos to transfer will be up to the&#xD;
           patient. Data will be collected regarding pregnancy outcomes according to the culture&#xD;
           conditions that a transferred embryo was exposed. However, all of this information will&#xD;
           be analyzed as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Pregnancy testing and follow up will not be altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION SCHEMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple randomization will be performed independently at the study site (RMANJ). A random&#xD;
      number sequence will be generated by random.org. Odd numbers will be assigned to A&#xD;
      intervention (2%) oxygen and even numbers will be assigned to B intervention (5%). Pieces of&#xD;
      paper containing the letter dictated by random number sequence will be placed into a box of&#xD;
      sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes labelled &quot;oxygen randomization.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      As noted above, on day 3, after placing half of the embryos into one 5-well dish and half of&#xD;
      the embryos into another 5-well dish, the embryologist will separate those dishes to the left&#xD;
      and right hand side of the incubator. The embryologist, will then open a sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, opaque sealed envelope from this box marked &quot;oxygen randomization.&quot; The piece of&#xD;
      paper in this envelope will direct the embryologist to place the 5-well dish on the left side&#xD;
      of the isolette to either the 2 or 5% oxygen concentration incubator. The 5-well dish on the&#xD;
      right side of the incubator will go to the opposite condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of an odd number of embryos, the extra embryo will always be placed in the left&#xD;
      handed 5-well dish. The numbers are anticipated to even out as the left sided dish has an&#xD;
      equal chance of randomization to 2 or 5% oxygen concentration.&#xD;
