  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, blinded-outcome, randomized, placebo controlled study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of super-selective intra-arterial administration of verapamil and&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate immediately following successful endovascular thrombectomy as a potential&#xD;
      neuroprotective synergistic therapeutic strategy in emergent large vessel occlusion stroke.&#xD;
      This trial represents the first time that magnesium sulfate will be evaluated in human&#xD;
      subjects as a superselectively administered neuroprotective agent administered in an acute&#xD;
      time frame as an adjunct to intra-arterial thrombectomy. Furthermore, it will represent the&#xD;
      first trial to evaluate combinational therapy for acute stroke neuroprotection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from patients evaluated at University of Kentucky Chandler&#xD;
      Hospital for acute ischemic stroke. Participants with impaired capacity may be included, as&#xD;
      the pathology to be studied (stroke) may impair their capacity. Initial contact will be made&#xD;
      by the sub-investigators approved to obtain consent; all sub-investigators are practitioners&#xD;
      who would make contact with potential participants in a clinical manner under standard&#xD;
      clinical procedures. All sub-investigators will have access to stroke patients' medical&#xD;
      information under normal circumstances. No special outreach is necessary to recruit&#xD;
      particular populations. Enrollment goal will be 15 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be compensated or provided any incentives for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following describes all study procedures and evaluations that are to be done as part of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1-Baseline (Day 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history taken from medical record, participant and family to determine&#xD;
           eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication history (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination to include vital signs (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Testing (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH Stroke Scale (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral angiogram with Endovascular Thrombectomy (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse event (AE) collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately following the thrombectomy and study procedure all participants will be&#xD;
      transferred to the Neuro-Intenstive care Unit (ICU) or other similar ICU for at least 24&#xD;
      hours for monitoring and care. Vital signs and neurological assessments will be assessed&#xD;
      every hour. Evaluations of the groin access site will be performed every every 15 minutes for&#xD;
      the first hour, then 30 minutes for the second hour, and finally every hour for the next 4&#xD;
      hours. Thereafter, groin site will be will performed at every shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Within 48 hours of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Non-contrast Postoperative MRI or CT (Standard of Care) The choice of one or the other will&#xD;
      be determined by clinical criteria; CT or MRI may be preferable for different reasons&#xD;
      depending upon the patient's clinical scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - ( By Discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH Stroke Scale (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge Destination (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive Assessment (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic assessment of primary and secondary radiologic endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 - End of Study (90 Days) (+/- 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  UBACC assessment will be used to assess consent capacity at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Rankin Score (mRS; Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit may be conducted over the phone with the participant or their legally authorized&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled Visits. It is unexpected that Unscheduled Visits will be common, especially with&#xD;
      the follow-up within 90 days after the procedure. However, subjects readmitted to the&#xD;
      hospital for any reason will be tracked to determine if an AE occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited Medications, Treatments and Procedures: Participants on therapeutic&#xD;
      anticoagulation will be excluded from the study. If medically necessary for underlying&#xD;
      conditions, therapeutic anticoagulation may be started 72 hours the study drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should not use disopyramide within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil&#xD;
      and intravenous beta-block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following successful completion of the baseline visit, participants will be randomized into&#xD;
      the study. The randomization number will be assigned by the PI/neurointerventionalist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive 10mg of verapamil in 10 cc of normal saline and&#xD;
      1000mg of magnesium sulfate in 20cc of normal saline or matching placebo.&#xD;
