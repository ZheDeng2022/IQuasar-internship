      This is an open label, randomized, multicenter, international phase II study for&#xD;
      premenopausal patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic or locally&#xD;
      advanced breast cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive either palbociclib +&#xD;
      exemestane + OFS (Arm 1) or exemestane +OFS (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is a strong in-vitro and clinical evidence suggesting that the dual inhibition of CDK&#xD;
      4/6 and ER signaling is a highly effective therapeutic strategy in HR+ MBC. With the&#xD;
      unprecedented success of palbociclib in PALOMA-1 trial, several phase 2 and 3 trials are&#xD;
      underway to evaluate this agent (and other CDK4/6 inhibitors as well) in the different&#xD;
      clinical scenarios of HR+ breast cancer [28].The vast majority of these trials -if not all-&#xD;
      are testing these novel agents in postmenopausal patients, which would render the clinical&#xD;
      experience of these agents restricted to postmenopausal women (median age was 62 years in&#xD;
      PALOMA-1 trial) The scarcity of clinical trials addressing endocrinal therapy in&#xD;
      premenopausal women with MBC is, at least in part, related to the fact that the majority of&#xD;
      women in western countries are diagnosed with breast cancer during their postmenopausal life.&#xD;
      However the situation is rather different in many countries, including those in the Middle&#xD;
      East region, where the median age of women diagnosed with breast cancer is below 50 years,&#xD;
      and where approximately 50% of these patients are still menstruating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to explore the therapeutic effects of palbociclib when combined&#xD;
      with exemestane and ovarian function suppression (OFS) in premenopausal with hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive and HER2 negative MBC, and how it will compare to the classic approach of using OFS&#xD;
      plus an aromatase inhibitor.&#xD;
