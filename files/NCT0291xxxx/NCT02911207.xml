  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few studies on emotion management in chronically ill patients. They usually&#xD;
      include small sample size (less than 30 persons) and are not randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
      However, emotion management is an essential coping skill in mental well-being and quality of&#xD;
      life and is the subject of numerous studies in psychology.The investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      a creative and physical activities combination in chronically ill will promote the&#xD;
      strengthening of emotion management skill. The investigators will conduct an innovating study&#xD;
      combining quantitative and qualitative variables in a randomized controlled trial to confirm&#xD;
      our hypothesis.&#xD;

      1. Surveyors will conduct a first interview with patients (within an association &quot;La&#xD;
           Fabrique Créative de Santé&quot; that provides free activities to chronically ill) , in order&#xD;
           to collect data on emotion management and quality of life perception and to assess&#xD;
           expectations regarding the activities. At the end of the interview, patients will be&#xD;
           randomized in two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In arm 1, patients choose one creative activity (evolutive art-therapy, writing&#xD;
           workshop, theatre, singing) and one physical activity (pilates, mindfulness meditation,&#xD;
           shiatsu, ayurvedic massage) that they will practice during the following six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In arm 2, patients will follow the same pattern but will start activities 6 months&#xD;
           later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After 6 months data on patients emotion management and quality of life perception will&#xD;
           be collected again and interviews will be conducted regarding their overall satisfaction&#xD;
           of the activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Every six months during one year, data will be collected by mail or e-mail.&#xD;
