  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if the opioid properties of ketamine are responsible&#xD;
      for its antidepressant effects. Since naltrexone can block opiate actions, the investigators&#xD;
      will determine if naltrexone can effectively block ketamine's effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to determine if the antidepressant effects of Ketamine are mediated by an&#xD;
      opiate mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the opioid properties of Ketamine are responsible for it's antidepressant&#xD;
      effects by potentially blocking the antidepressant effects with a opioid antagonist&#xD;
      naltrexone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure this objective by looking at the response on a scale called the 6- item&#xD;
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-6). Response is defined as a statistically&#xD;
      significant greater decrease on the overall score on this scale, post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This includes comparing a scale called Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale&#xD;
      (CADSS) on both of our patient groups, one group receiving Ketamine plus Naltrexone compared&#xD;
      to the other group receiving Ketamine plus placebeo, to determine if naltrexone has any&#xD;
      effect on CADSS as well as to determine if CADSS is associated with antidepressant response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another secondary objective is to assess ketamine craving using the Visual Analog Craving&#xD;
      Scale for Ketamine (VASK), after infusion and determine if there is a change in level of&#xD;
      craving for the group that receives naltrexone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) 30&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) The subjects will be drawn from an outpatient sample of patients with MDD, diagnosed with&#xD;
      the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders(SCID-I/P), currently&#xD;
      on a stable, adequate dose of antidepressant therapy, as defined by the MGH ATRQ, for at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks or a history of intolerance to at least 2 antidepressant treatments.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion only if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive, at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to read, understand, and provide written, dated informed consent prior to&#xD;
             screening. Participants will be deemed likely to comply with study protocol and&#xD;
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and other clinically important&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single or recurrent, and currently&#xD;
             experiencing a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) of at least eight weeks in duration,&#xD;
             prior to screening, according to the criteria defined in the Diagnosis and Statistical&#xD;
             Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR™). The diagnosis&#xD;
             of MDD will be made by a site psychiatrist and supported by the Structured Clinical&#xD;
             Interview for DSM-IV-TR™ (SCID-I/P) or the M.I.N.I International Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
             Interview a short, structured psychiatric interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a history of TRD during the current MDE, as assessed by the investigator. TRD is&#xD;
             defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50% improvement&#xD;
             of depression symptoms), as perceived by the participant, to at least two &quot;treatment&#xD;
             courses&quot; of a therapeutic dose of an antidepressant therapy of at least 8 weeks&#xD;
             duration. The adequacy of dose and duration of the antidepressant therapy will be&#xD;
             determined as per the Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response&#xD;
             Questionnaire (MGH ATRQ) criteria. Participants must currently be on a stable (for at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks) and adequate (according to the MGH ATRQ) dose of ongoing Selective&#xD;
             serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor&#xD;
             (SNRI) antidepressant therapy, of which total duration must be at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
             Participants may also have a history of intolerance to at least 2 antidepressant&#xD;
             medications. These patients with the intolerance history will not be required to be&#xD;
             currently taking an antidepressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Meet the threshold on the total Hamilton Depression 17-item Scale (HAMD17) score of&#xD;
