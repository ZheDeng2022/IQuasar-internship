      This study is an extension of Reminding Adolescents to Adhere (RATA) (Unique protocol ID:&#xD;
      1R01HD074925-01). Participants for SATA will be recruited during the RATA month 24 exit&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into either one of two intervention group (receiving&#xD;
      the weekly messages and a chance to draw a prize at each clinic visit based on either a fixed&#xD;
      adherence level of 90% or a self-chosen one of at least 80% as further detailed below) or the&#xD;
      control group that receives the existing RATA intervention consisting of weekly motivational&#xD;
      messages and the chance to get mobile airtime rewards conditional on responding. Doing so&#xD;
      will allow the investigators to cleanly evaluate the impact of these additional&#xD;
      adherence-based lotteries, and guarantees that those who have been in the control group&#xD;
      receiving standard of care in the first 24 months of the RATA intervention will also receive&#xD;
      an intervention for reasons of fairness.&#xD;

      -  For Group 1 (lottery reward with fixed target): Study coordinators check participant's&#xD;
           MEMS extraction for last month's adherence. Study coordinators then tell participants of&#xD;
           the participants' adherence in the last month. Participants are also informed that&#xD;
           during the next clinic visit, if they adhere at least 90 percent they have a chance to&#xD;
           enter into a game where they have a chance of winning mobile airtime, by drawing into a&#xD;
           bag and picking a card associated with their airtime winnings. If they do not have 90%&#xD;
           adherence, they will not receive the airtime award game, but there will be another&#xD;
           chance the next time they come for their scheduled clinic visit during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Group 2 (lottery award with own target): Study coordinators check participant's MEMS&#xD;
           extraction for last month's adherence. They inform participants of their adherence in&#xD;
           the last month. In order to be eligible for an airtime reward game, during their next&#xD;
           clinic visit they must reach their own target goal. The target adherence goal must be&#xD;
           greater than 80%. Participants may, for example, choose 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.&#xD;
           Again, if they meet or exceed this target they have a chance to draw into a bag to win&#xD;
           mobile airtime. If they do not have meet this self-imposed target adherence, they will&#xD;
           not be eligible to play the airtime award game, but there will be another chance the&#xD;
           next time they come for their scheduled clinic visit during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each clinic visit, participants will have their MEMS extracted and study coordinators&#xD;
      will check for average adherence between that day and the last clinic visit. For those who&#xD;
      have met the target, coordinators will initiate the lottery, complete the drawing procedure,&#xD;
      or send them the airtime reward without drawing (depending on which group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every Sunday, study investigators will send treatment participants a motivational message to&#xD;
      remind them about the reward. Within each of the two intervention groups, study investigators&#xD;
      will randomly send the message either in a loss-frame or a gain-frame, i.e. an intervention&#xD;
      participant (in either group) will some weeks receive a message telling them to keep up&#xD;
      motivation (as a code-word for adherence) to win a prize, and some weeks telling them to make&#xD;
      sure not to lose their chance to win a prize.&#xD;
