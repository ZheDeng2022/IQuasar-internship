  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teachers are increasingly faced with classrooms of students whose needs require support far&#xD;
      beyond what traditional teacher-training programs prepare educators to provide. The presence&#xD;
      of students with greater challenges in classrooms is due in part to the move to a full&#xD;
      inclusion model of education and also to the rising epidemic of mental health disorders in&#xD;
      youth. Mental health problems affect up to one million Canadian youth and their families.&#xD;
      However, few of these individuals (~20%) receive the support they need (Kirby, 2013; Kutcher&#xD;
      &amp; McLuckie, 2013). The Teacher Help research team along with industry partner, Velsoft, and&#xD;
      key knowledge user, Nova Scotia Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, will&#xD;
      address this barrier by developing, evaluating, and commercializing a sustainable eHealth&#xD;
      resource for teachers. Teacher Help is an online program that assists teachers in providing&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions to students in grades 1-12 with mental health disorders in the&#xD;
      classroom. The program allows teachers in a typical classroom setting to access information&#xD;
      and expert-coach and peer support when they need it, so they can intervene early in order to&#xD;
      reduce the negative consequences of mental health disorders in youth. Currently three modules&#xD;
      (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], and&#xD;
      Learning Disabilities [LD]) are at different stages in the innovation pipeline. The&#xD;
      investigators will test whether teachers make good use of this program and whether it is&#xD;
      effective in improving mental health outcomes among children and youth both at school and at&#xD;
      home. The investigators will also study whether the program changes teacher's attitudes&#xD;
      toward children and youth with these disorders. The investigators will provide information to&#xD;
      the Department of Education on how to use this program. This approach will help ensure that&#xD;
      the program will continue after the research study ends. To the Teacher Help team's knowledge&#xD;
      Teacher Help is the first and only research-validated eHealth program directly targeting&#xD;
      teachers to help them intervene with children and youth who have mental health disorders,&#xD;
      thus allowing Canada to take a lead in eHealth as applied to a school context.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1: Development of the online Teacher Help program. The Teacher Help research team will&#xD;
      develop content for three modules (ADHD, ASD, and LD) so that these are evidence-based and&#xD;
      appropriate for implementation in grade 1 - 12 classrooms across Canada. A Team Lead, in&#xD;
      conjunction with the Principal Investigator, will develop each module with the support of&#xD;
      Research Staff and advice from the larger Teacher Help team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each module will contain 6 sessions which will be made available to teachers as they complete&#xD;
      each session (e.g., after a teacher completes session 1, session 2 will be made available).&#xD;
      Each session should take approximately 1 hour to complete, including all worksheets and&#xD;
      materials. Each session should take approximately one week to implement all activities;&#xD;
      however, teachers can take up to two weeks to complete each session. Each session will&#xD;
      provide factual information, strategies for implementation of best practices to address the&#xD;
      specific mental health disorder in the classroom setting, and access to additional help and&#xD;
      advice. Each module will typically include the following session topics: 1) An informative&#xD;
      overview of the disorder and its treatments; 2) How teachers can help and the team approach;&#xD;
      3) The main intervention and how to implement this in the classroom; 4) Additional classroom&#xD;
      strategies that may be helpful in addressing the core symptoms of the disorder; 5) Additional&#xD;
      needs of students with the disorder and how to help; 6) Wrapping up the program and planning&#xD;
      for the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will provide strategies to help support teachers in their implementation of the&#xD;
      information provided (e.g., confirmation and discussion of the challenges faced in&#xD;
      implementing these strategies, self-help tips). The program contains text and photo&#xD;
      information, selected videos to further explain certain concepts, as well as worksheets and&#xD;
      supplemental materials to further engage teachers in interactive learning. The intervention&#xD;
      program will be conceptually consistent across age groups in terms of the focus of each&#xD;
      session; however, age-specific information will be included for two targeted grade groups:&#xD;
      elementary school (typically grades 1- 6) and junior high and high school (typically grades&#xD;
      7-12; or grades that employ a rotary system where students have more than one teacher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many teachers will use the online information and guidance to implement the strategies&#xD;
      without further support. A review of the literature supports this, and indicates that&#xD;
      internet interventions can be successful without additional support. However, the Teacher&#xD;
      Help program provides extra support whereby teachers can contact a collaborating psychologist&#xD;
      via a messaging system internal to the program to seek direction and guidance during&#xD;
      implementation of the program. Online collaborating psychologists will be psychologists&#xD;
      (e.g., school/educational) working within the same school system/school as the teachers.&#xD;
      Additionally, teachers will have access to peer-support through a Discussion Board function&#xD;
      internal to the Teacher Help online platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Intervention.The goal of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of an online&#xD;
      intervention designed to help teachers intervene with students with mental health disorders&#xD;
      in typical grade 1 - 12 classroom settings. The intervention will be delivered across Canada,&#xD;
      and the RCT will be coordinated through the implementation site at Halifax, NS. Assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted at baseline as well as at 3 and 5 months post randomization. The primary&#xD;
      goal is to assess the immediate impact (baseline vs. 3 months) of the intervention on&#xD;
      teacher's attitudes toward students with these specific mental health disorders (i.e., ADHD,&#xD;
      ASD, LD), as well as on student's mental health outcomes and quality of life as reported by&#xD;
      guardians (e.g., parents) and teachers. Guardians will also be asked to report on how the&#xD;
      intervention has impacted their family overall. Youth will also be asked to report on the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention on themselves. Guardians, teachers, collaborating psychologists,&#xD;
      and youth will be asked to report on their satisfaction with the intervention, and&#xD;
      psychologists will be asked to track their experience with the intervention as well as their&#xD;
      fidelity to the program manuals. The secondary goal is to evaluate the longer-term impact&#xD;
      (baseline, 3, and 5 months) of the intervention on teachers, guardians, psychologists, and&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design. The investigators will use a cluster RCT (chosen to reduce contamination&#xD;
      among participants) design to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention using a&#xD;
      pragmatic RCT approach (i.e., only measures that are necessary to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the intervention rather than the mechanisms of change will be used). For this cluster RCT the&#xD;
      point of randomization will be the collaborating psychologist. However, randomization of a&#xD;
      social unit will occur as the psychologist represents the participating school board, school,&#xD;
      and a minimum of 12 teacher-student-guardian triads. Data collected at 3 and 5 months will&#xD;
      assess the degree of maintenance of any initial intervention effects on teachers, students,&#xD;
      and guardians. Consort 2010 guidelines will be adhered to when reporting the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. After baseline, each collaborating psychologist will be randomized to either&#xD;
      the wait-list group or to the intervention (Teacher Help) group. Randomization to the&#xD;
      wait-list group means that the psychologist and their teacher-student-guardian triads are&#xD;
      free to access other interventions during the study, but will not be given access to the&#xD;
      Teacher Help program right away. Psychologists and their teacher-student-guardian triads&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention arm will be given access to the Teacher Help intervention after&#xD;
      baseline and will also be allowed to access other interventions during the intervention&#xD;
      phase. Therefore participants in the intervention arm could be considered to be receiving the&#xD;
      internet-intervention plus usual services.The investigators will use block randomized&#xD;
      stratification. Stratification and blocking will control for variation in sociodemographic&#xD;
      differences among the sites. Computer-generated block randomization will be developed into an&#xD;
      electronic algorithm using randomize.net. Random allocation will be independent and&#xD;
      concealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project manager will be responsible for ensuring all eligible participants complete their&#xD;
      baseline assessments. After baseline assessment, collaborating psychologists with eligible&#xD;
      participants will be electronically randomized to the wait-list or intervention group.&#xD;
      Psychologists and their teacher-student-guardian triads in the wait-list group will not have&#xD;
      access to any Teacher Help sessions during the cluster RCT, but will have the opportunity to&#xD;
      complete the Teacher Help program in September the following academic year if they so choose.&#xD;
      Collaborating psychologists and their teacher-student-guardian triads assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention group will be automatically directed to the intervention website after&#xD;
      randomization. A Teacher Help team member (e.g., research assistant), who will be blind to&#xD;
      randomization allocation, will contact participants in both groups to encourage completion of&#xD;
      assessments (outcome measures). All teachers, students, and guardians will be asked to&#xD;
      complete assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 5 months. Teachers, students, and guardians&#xD;
      in the wait-list group will be notified to wait until someone contacts them for a 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up and again at 5 months. Psychologists in the intervention group will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a support log throughout the intervention phase, and complete a Client Satisfaction&#xD;
      Questionnaire at 3-month follow-up. Collaborating psychologists in the wait-list group will&#xD;
      not be required to complete any assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wait-list group will be provided access to the program in September the following&#xD;
      academic year due to the timelines of the project (5-month follow-up of the RCT will occur at&#xD;
      the end of the academic year). Additionally, there are several benefits to providing the&#xD;
      intervention to the wait-list group at this time. These benefits include more time for&#xD;
      wait-listed teachers to implement the intervention, intervention for students at the&#xD;
      beginning of the academic year rather than at the end, and increased reach of the program.&#xD;
      Increased reach of the program will be achieved by providing access to the Teacher Help&#xD;
      program to teachers recruited to participate in the cluster RCT the previous academic year as&#xD;
      well as to the new (current academic year) teacher of the students recruited to participate&#xD;
      in the cluster RCT the previous academic year. Wait-listed psychologists will also be given&#xD;
      Teacher Help access codes for 10 additional teachers who may benefit from the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. The investigators will aim to recruit 55 collaborating psychologists across&#xD;
      Canada to partner with them in the cluster RCT. Psychologistss are those psychologists who&#xD;
      work for or within school systems across Canada, and who are willing to act as an online&#xD;
      support for teachers using the Teacher Help program. The investigators will collaborate with&#xD;
      the psychologists to recruit enough participants to have 660 teacher-student-guardian triads&#xD;
      across Canada. The goal will be to have 220 teacher-student-guardian triads per Teacher Help&#xD;
      module (i.e., ADHD, ASD, and LD). Psychologists will be asked to recruit a minimum of 12&#xD;
      classroom teachers within their assigned schools to participate. A student of each teacher&#xD;
      and one of his or her guardians (e.g., parents) need to agree to participate as well. As&#xD;
      such, each psychologist will work with 12 teacher-student-guardian triads. Overall, the goal&#xD;
      will be to recruit approximately 715 participants for the final assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for this study are individualized for each group of&#xD;
      participants. However, all participants need to be within Canada, as well as have access to&#xD;
      an internet connection and an email address. Please see the Eligibility section to see the&#xD;
      criteria pertaining to each different group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment. Utilizing the Teacher Help team's Health Care Innovation Community (HCIC), the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit psychologists to partner with them on the cluster RCT.&#xD;
      Psychologists will be asked to recruit a minimum of 12 classroom teachers associated with&#xD;
      their schools who teach grades 1 to 12. A student of each teacher and one of his or her&#xD;
      guardians (e.g., parents) both need to agree to participate as well. A range of recruitment&#xD;
      strategies, including word of mouth through our Advisory Board and Partners, website&#xD;
      advertisements on our HCIC's websites, particularly our end-user websites (Canadian ADHD&#xD;
      Resource Alliance [CADDRA], Learning Disabilities Association of Canada [LDAC], and Autism&#xD;
      Canada), online and printed newsletters, and social media. The investigators will aim for at&#xD;
      least one collaborating psychologist per province.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments. All assessments will be completed online. Assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, and at 3 and 5 months post-randomization. For guardians and teachers, assessments&#xD;
      at baseline will take approximately 40 minutes to complete and at 3 and 5 months will take&#xD;
      about 30 minutes to complete. For those students who are able to complete assessments,&#xD;
      questionnaires should take approximately 30 minutes at Baseline and 20 minutes at&#xD;
      3-and-5-month follow-up to complete. For collaborating psychologists in the intervention arm,&#xD;
      the support log should take approximately 15 minutes to complete each week, and the Client&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire should take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete at 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up. A Teacher Help team member, blinded to randomization, will send an email to&#xD;
      participants at the appropriate time requesting they complete the assessments and will follow&#xD;
      up by email and/or telephone to answer any questions and encourage completion of the forms.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>There is no plan to make individual participant data available. The team will engage in usual end-of-study knowledge translation, such as presenting at local, national and international conferences, as well as preparing manuscripts for high-impact open journals. We will also prepare a number of social media products (e.g., webinars) that share the results of the study. We will include the voices of our end-users in these materials; however, they will not be identified.</ipd_description>
