      Background: Patients with the sugar metabolism disorder, Glycogen Storage Disease Type V,&#xD;
      have insufficient breakdown of sugar stored as, glycogen, within the cells. The investigators&#xD;
      know from previous studies with McArdle patients, that they not only have a reduced sugar&#xD;
      metabolism, both also have problems in increasing their fat metabolism during exercise to&#xD;
      fully compensate for the energy deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on Triheptanoin diet used in patients with other metabolic diseases have shown that&#xD;
      Triheptanoin can increase metabolism of both fat and sugar. In these patients, Triheptanoin&#xD;
      has had a positive effect on the physical performance and has reduces the level of symptoms&#xD;
      experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate the effect of treatment with the dietary oil, Triheptanoin, in patients&#xD;
      with McArdle disease on exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 20-30 adult patients will be recruited through Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark&#xD;
      and Hopital Pitié-Sapêtrière in Paris, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-experimental testing (1 day): Baseline blood samples are collected to obtain&#xD;
           baseline values of safety parameters: Plasma-acylcarnitines, free fatty acids and&#xD;
           creatine kinase. Subjects perform a max-test to determine their VO2max&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period #1 (2 weeks): Subjects follow a diet consuming a dietary treatment oil.&#xD;
           Neither patients nor members of the study group know who receive which type of oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Washout period (1 week +7 days): Subjects receive no treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment period #2 (2 weeks +7days): Subjects who received Triheptanoin oil in the&#xD;
           first treatment period, now receive placebo oil and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Before and after each treatment periods, subjects perform a 30-minutes exercise&#xD;
      test on a cycle ergometer, comprising of 20-22 minutes of constant load exercise and 6-8&#xD;
      minutes increasing load to peak. Subjects will complete a Fatigue Severity Scale&#xD;
      questionnaire and metabolic products will be measured in blood and urine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the treatment potential of the drug Triheptanoin in patients&#xD;
      with the inborn defect in glycogen metabolism, McArdle Disease. There is currently no&#xD;
      treatment available for this group of patients. The condition leads to intolerance to&#xD;
      physical exercise with a risk of developing severe cramps and contractures followed by muscle&#xD;
      damage and acute kidney failure. Also one third of the patients develop progressive muscle&#xD;
      weakness and wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The McArdle patients have an inherited defect in the enzyme, myofosforylase, an important&#xD;
      link in the glycogenolysis within skeletal muscle. As a consequence, the patients lack&#xD;
      substrates for glycolysis to fuel muscle work (1). The investigators have previously shown&#xD;
      that patients with McArdle disease are unable to increase fat metabolism enough to compensate&#xD;
      for the energy insufficiency that occurs in these patients in response to exercise (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key limitation to exercise in McArdle disease is the reduced production of pyruvate,&#xD;
      causing depletion of intermediates in the Citric Acid Cycle (CAC). Triheptanoin is a&#xD;
      triglyceride of glycerol and three 7-carbon fatty acid chains (heptanoate). The breakdown of&#xD;
      odd-number carbon fatty acids, such as heptanoate, generates CAC-intermediates. Triheptanoin&#xD;
      can therefore potentially boost the flux through the CAC and increase the ATP and energy&#xD;
      generation in the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other patients with inborn errors of metabolism, treatment with daily Triheptanoin&#xD;
      supplement can increase metabolism of both fat and glucose. Triheptanoin treatment has&#xD;
      reduced the symptom frequency and increased exercise tolerance and physical performance in&#xD;
      these patients (3,4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Triheptanoin on exercise performance&#xD;
      and tolerance and frequency of symptoms in patients with McArdle disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be designed as a double blinded placebo controlled cross-over study. During a&#xD;
      5 week trial period each study patient will go through a 2 week treatment period, a 1 week&#xD;
      (+7days) wash-out period without treatment followed by another 2 week treatment period. In&#xD;
      one treatment period, the patient takes a daily dietary oil supplement containing&#xD;
      Triheptanoin and in the other period (2 weeks +7days), the oil contains regular safflower oil&#xD;
      (placebo). Both Triheptanoin and placebo oil is manufactured, packed and handed out by the&#xD;
      manufacturer, Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a way that neither patients, nor the&#xD;
      investigators will know in which period, which treatment is given to which patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will meet at the laboratory for assessments on 5 occasions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit: Patients perform a peak exercise test on a cycle ergometer wearing a mask&#xD;
      that can measure oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange rates. Patients exercise with increasing&#xD;
      workload until exhaustion to find their maximal oxidative capacity and maximal workload Test&#xD;
      days 1-4: On one test day before and one after each treatment period, the patients perform a&#xD;
      30-minutes exercise test on a cycle ergometer working at a constant moderate intensity for&#xD;
      20-22 minutes followed by a 6-8 minutes stepwise increase to peak workload. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken before, during and after exercise to measure concentrations of metabolic&#xD;
      products. Patients report their current feeling of fatigue in a Fatigue Severity Scale&#xD;
      (FSS-questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 21-26 patients will be included in the study across three trial sites. From&#xD;
      the French cohort of McArdle Patients; 10-15 patients will be included and from the Danish&#xD;
      cohort; 11 patients have been already included.&#xD;
