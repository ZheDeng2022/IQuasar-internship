    <textblock>
      This study primarily aims to investigate arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), an underlying&#xD;
      mechanism in patellofemoral pain (PFP), which remain to date understudied. Although, studies&#xD;
      have revealed that AMI needs to be eliminated before improvements in muscle strength can be&#xD;
      achieved, to date quadriceps muscle inhibition in patients with PFP remains understudied. To&#xD;
      date the influence of AMI on functional performance and the direct link to pain in patients&#xD;
      with PFP remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the link between AMI to pain,&#xD;
      functional performance and how an acute treatment can affect functional performance and pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is one of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in patients with&#xD;
      knee complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies investigating the therapeutic effect on PFP revealed that the majority of patients&#xD;
      with PFP were still suffering of knee pain after 5 to 8 years, despite initially received&#xD;
      treatment and education, indicating that the current treatments fail to prevent the&#xD;
      chronicity of symptoms. Considering that current treatment-strategies of patients with PFP&#xD;
      seem to be unable to avoid the development of chronic symptoms, the question arises if the&#xD;
      underlying factors of PFP are understood sufficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrary to the current broad body of literature on weakness, potentially underlying&#xD;
      factors which might influence or even lead to PFP, such arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI)&#xD;
      or the break phenomenon remain understudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in PFP has been proven to be linked to quadriceps strength deficit, gluteal strength&#xD;
      deficits, knee stability, irregularities in the quadriceps torque curve, and functional&#xD;
      performance. Bazett et al. (2011) described that pain &quot;is more than a symptom and might play&#xD;
      a role in the etiology or progression of PFP&quot;. Furthermore, pain seems to play a crucial role&#xD;
      in AMI. However, the correlation between pain and AMI in patients with PFP has not been&#xD;
      investigated currently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No assessment in isolation can provide a full picture of the problem. The combination of AMI,&#xD;
      the break phenomenon with a biomechanical analysis might enable the determination of the&#xD;
      impact of inhibition and strength on biomechanical changes. In addition, it might provide an&#xD;
      answer to whether AMI or weakness cause biomechanical alterations, which would help to&#xD;
      optimise treatment approaches in PFP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PowersTM strap strap was developed with the aim of assisting lower limb kinematics,&#xD;
      decreasing knee varus through supporting femoral abduction and external rotation. This&#xD;
      treatment may potentially also directly improve functional performance. As the functional&#xD;
      performance in participants with PFP after the application of the PowersTM strap has not been&#xD;
      investigated, this study aims to analyse if there is a direct link between the application of&#xD;
      the PowersTM strap to functional performance and pain.&#xD;
