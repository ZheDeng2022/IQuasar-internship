  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, 3+3, dose finding, open label, phase 1b clinical study of&#xD;
      carboplatin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with atezolizumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The starting dose is carboplatin AUC 5mg/ml*min, cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 and atezolizumab&#xD;
      840 mg, all administered intravenously. One cycle is 28 days. On day 1 carboplatin,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and atezolizumab will be administered. On day 15 atezolizumab only will be&#xD;
      administered. Patients will be treated until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. It is expected that 6-12 patients will be enrolled,&#xD;
      depending on safety issues observed.&#xD;
