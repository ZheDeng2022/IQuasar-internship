  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-harm has substantial personal impacts as well as costs on the National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS). Around 13-17% of young people report experiences of self-harm. In Cambridgeshire, this&#xD;
      is a significant issue with the number of admissions to hospital for self-harm in young&#xD;
      people being higher than the United Kingdom (UK) average. Treating underlying mental illness&#xD;
      can lead to a reduction in self-harm, but these are long interventions for complex disorders&#xD;
      and many people who self-harm are not under treatment for mental illness. Moreover, young&#xD;
      people struggle to access traditional mental health services where these therapies are&#xD;
      delivered. No short interventions specifically tailored for young people have been developed&#xD;
      so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Imaginator project aims to address the urgent need for an effective and innovative&#xD;
      short-term therapy for self-harm in young people. The investigators will pilot a new&#xD;
      imagery-based psychological intervention for young people aged 16-25 who experience&#xD;
      repetitive self-harm. Mental imagery (the experience of &quot;seeing through the mind's eye&quot;) can&#xD;
      carry intense emotions (positive and negative), and imagining something can facilitate&#xD;
      behaviour. Imagery-based therapies have proven useful (i) for problems that feature intense,&#xD;
      hard to manage emotions such as those associated with self-harm, and (ii) for promoting&#xD;
      healthy behaviour. Our new intervention called Functional Imagery Training will support young&#xD;
      people to imagine more adaptive behaviours to cope with the emotional distress that triggers&#xD;
      self-harm, and motivate them to reduce self-harm. Imaginator will comprise of just two&#xD;
      sessions followed by phone support over three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will address the challenge of young people accessing and staying&#xD;
      in therapy by using a smartphone app to support the therapy, as apps are widely used and&#xD;
      favoured by this age group. The app will enable participants to continue with the strategies&#xD;
      they have learnt in therapy by themselves, thus ensuring a potential longer-term benefit and&#xD;
      self-empowerment.&#xD;

      The problem of self-harm and the need short interventions for young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-harm, an &quot;act of self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of the apparent purpose of&#xD;
      the act&quot; is a behaviour used to cope with intense emotions and psychological distress. It can&#xD;
      occur in a variety of mental health diagnoses as well as individuals with no diagnosis. Of&#xD;
      concern is that almost one in five young adults report self-harm behaviour. A United Kingdom&#xD;
      (UK) survey in schools described 13% 15-16 years old had self-harmed during their life and 8%&#xD;
      in the last year. Factors associated with self-harm include a disadvantaged socio-economic&#xD;
      background, social isolation and lack of support, negative life events including childhood&#xD;
      emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Although self-harm is different from suicidality, people&#xD;
      who self-harm carry a fourfold risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours within one year, a&#xD;
      risk over and above risk conferred by mental health problems and psychosocial risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-harm has substantial personal impacts and costs on the National Health Service (NHS). In&#xD;
      Cambridgeshire, the number of hospital admissions for self-harm has been higher than the UK&#xD;
      average, making addressing self-harm a significant issue for local primary and secondary&#xD;
      health care National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend offering a&#xD;
      &quot;psychological intervention that is specifically structured for people who self-harm, with&#xD;
      the aim of reducing self-harm. In addition: (i) the intervention should be tailored to&#xD;
      individual need, and could include cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic or problem-solving&#xD;
      elements; (ii) therapists should be trained and supervised in the therapy they are offering&#xD;
      to people who self-harm; (iii) therapists should also be able to work collaboratively with&#xD;
      the person to identify the problems causing distress or leading to self-harm.&quot; A number of&#xD;
      interventions have been developed and have shown some efficacy at reducing self-harm in&#xD;
      adolescents and adults. However these therapies vary between 4 sessions and much longer&#xD;
      duration, and currently are mostly available only to individuals under mental health care&#xD;
      after variable periods of waiting time. Moreover, almost half of young people referred&#xD;
      recommended treatment will not attend any follow-up sessions. There is a lack of short&#xD;
      interventions for self-harm specifically targeted at young people. Short interventions that&#xD;
      engage young people are urgently needed to allow young people to better manage and reduce&#xD;
      self-harm also outside secondary mental health care, and alongside / while waiting for more&#xD;
      longterm problems to be addressed (psychiatric disorders, housing and employment difficulties&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing new treatments for self-harm using imagery-based interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental imagery is the process of 'seeing through the mind's eye'. Intrusive mental images&#xD;
      carrying intense negative emotions are central to several mental disorders. For example,&#xD;
      individuals with social anxiety will experience intrusive images of them sweating and&#xD;
      blushing intensely while they try to speak to someone, these images will fuel their anxiety&#xD;
      about being judged by others and possibly stop them from attending further social situations.&#xD;
      Mental imagery associated with self-harm also appears to be a common phenomenon and&#xD;
      individuals describe that images associated with self-harm can carry many different emotional&#xD;
      meanings (e.g. evoking a sense of relief, or increasing the urge to self-harm), in line with&#xD;
      what drives self-harm in every individual. The characteristics of mental images are related&#xD;
      to the intensity of emotions and this applies to positive emotions too. For example, more&#xD;
      vivid positive imagery has been related to greater excitement during positive mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this suggests that mental imagery is a common phenomenon, which many individuals are&#xD;
      likely to experience in the context of high emotions, and that mental images could be used to&#xD;
      generate helpful emotions. In fact, addressing distressing mental images and promoting&#xD;
      positive imagery has been used for trauma, depression and self-harm in personality disorders.&#xD;
      The investigators have successfully treated cases with self-harm behaviour using a short&#xD;
      course of imagery-focused therapy for Bipolar Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, mental images can promote behaviour. Imagining something makes it more likely to&#xD;
      act, because it simulating the actual event in the mind and it allows individuals to&#xD;
      ''pre-experience'' all aspects the event. Hence, via imagining future scenarios individuals&#xD;
      may feel more ready to engage in the action successfully. For example, in sports adding&#xD;
      mental imagery training (visualising an exercise) to physical practice of an exercise&#xD;
      improves performance. Moreover, imagining an action also involves anticipating how&#xD;
      emotionally rewarding it is likely to be. This may enhance motivation to act. The more vivid&#xD;
      and real-like the mental image of completing a desired action is, the stronger the positive&#xD;
      emotion and motivation to actually do it. This type of imagery of healthy behaviour and&#xD;
      desired actions has been developed into a therapy called Functional Imagery Training (FIT).&#xD;
      FIT encourages individuals to imagine the benefits of working towards their goals, especially&#xD;
      the benefits that are expected to happen right away (e.g. feeling good about oneself).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, FIT has been shown to be a successful approach for interventions to reduce snacking&#xD;
      and in addictive behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, the investigators propose that FIT can train individuals to imagine more&#xD;
      helpful behaviours rather than self-harm when distressed. FIT will train vivid and real-like&#xD;
      imagery of alternative goals to self-harm, which is likely to produce rewarding and positive&#xD;
      emotions. Our FIT protocol will aim to support individuals who self-harm at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) identifying helpful behaviours as an alternative goal when they feel like self-harming&#xD;
      (e.g. going for a run, listening to music); (ii) by practising mental imagery of the&#xD;
      alternative behaviour, boosting the desire to achieve this goal; (iii) succeeding in engaging&#xD;
      in alternative behaviours to self-harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, FIT will consist of two face-to-face sessions plus five brief telephone support&#xD;
      sessions. Therefore it has the potential of offering immediate support for all those young&#xD;
      people who are either excluded from or waiting for more complex interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge of engaging young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imagery-based interventions focus on visual techniques and are easily amenable to be&#xD;
      supported by a smartphone app. Smartphone usage by young people is high. Therefore, enhancing&#xD;
      a psychological intervention via a smartphone app could be a successful strategy to ensure&#xD;
      that young people keep practising the therapy techniques and engaging with what was learned&#xD;
      in therapy once the sessions are over and without the need of face to face follow-up. The&#xD;
      support of a smartphone app following the FIT sessions can aid overcome barriers to&#xD;
      engagement reported in young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the Imaginator study will tailor FIT to young people by adding a smartphone app&#xD;
      support, which can make the intervention more interesting and approachable to this age group.&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a bespoke app called Imaginator. This app was created&#xD;
      collectively via six meetings of a Young People Advisory Group (YPAG: 4 members, 1 male, aged&#xD;
      19 to 22 years old, with a lived experience of self-harm), together with the research team&#xD;
      and John Harper, from App Shine Development company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, self-harm behaviour is a highly prevalent problem among young people in the UK&#xD;
      (and worldwide), and of particular urgency in Cambridgeshire. It represents a major social&#xD;
      and healthcare problem for the community. Currently, there is a lack of short and easily&#xD;
      accessible interventions to specifically help young people reduce self-harming behaviour. As&#xD;
      mental imagery-based techniques have been used to reduce unwanted emotions and support&#xD;
      motivation and helpful behaviour, The investigators propose that Functional Imagery Training&#xD;
      (FIT) could represent a successful strategy to reduce self-harm behaviour. FIT is intended as&#xD;
      a brief and focused intervention for young people aged 16-25 (regardless of any diagnosis)&#xD;
      that can be added to any other pharmacological or psychological therapy. To improve access to&#xD;
      and engagement with the intervention by young people, the investigators will deliver FIT&#xD;
      supported by a smartphone app developed together with a Young People Advisory Group.&#xD;
