      Objective: To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile application to support&#xD;
      decision making for prescription drugs to elderly patients. Method: Firstly, there will be a&#xD;
      two-tier content validation of potentially inappropriate medicines (PIM) for the elderly&#xD;
      based on Beers Criteria and STOPP. For the validation, a modified Delphi consensus technique&#xD;
      will be applied. Twelve national experts will be invited. For each statement contained in the&#xD;
      Beers criteria and STOPP a proposition will be prepared in order to allow each participant to&#xD;
      issue an opinion on each of the propositions by assigning a value according to their&#xD;
      agreement to the statement. Therefore, the Likert scale with established score of 1 to 5&#xD;
      (completely disagree - strongly agree) will be used. Statements with average scores above 4.0&#xD;
      will be considered consensus. All information regarding PIMs will be made available through&#xD;
      an application for tablets. The information on risks and recommendations about the drugs will&#xD;
      be available whenever the users enter the medicines name. The application will be developed&#xD;
      for the Android platform, which is based on the Java programming language. To evaluate the&#xD;
      use of this application 30 doctors working in basic health units and health units of the&#xD;
      family in a municipality from Bahia will be asked to join the study. Upon acceptance, the&#xD;
      proportion of PIMs' prescription by these professionals for a minimum period of two months&#xD;
      will be analyzed. Later, 15 doctors will be randomized into the intervention group and will&#xD;
      receive a tablet with the application installed. They will be trained to use it as well as to&#xD;
      access to the Evidence Based Health Portal of the Ministry of Health. The control group of 15&#xD;
      other physicians will receive the tablet and will be trained to access the Evidence Based&#xD;
      Health Portal. The study will be blind to the participants and to the main investigator. To&#xD;
      continue, the information will be analyzed by sampling the PIMs' prescription in both groups.&#xD;
      To access this information the prescriptions' duplicate original, filed in pharmacies,&#xD;
      patient files or home visit will be required. The PIMs prescription ratios before and after&#xD;
      the intervention will be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Step 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, data of the drugs contained in Beers and STOPP criteria will be reviewed. The&#xD;
      availability of medicines in the Brazilian market will be analyzed through the website of the&#xD;
      National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA). Subsequently, drug data will be placed in a&#xD;
      questionnaire to be sent to national experts in order to establish a consensus on the&#xD;
      information presented. The questionnaire assessment will happen in two rounds. The first&#xD;
      round consists of sending propositions based on information contained in the Beers criteria,&#xD;
      STOPP 2012 and 2006 in order to allow each participant to issue an opinion on each of the&#xD;
      propositions by assigning a value according to their agreement to the statement. Therefore,&#xD;
      the Likert scale with established score of 1 to 5 (completely disagree - strongly agree) will&#xD;
      be used. For the second round, the scores will be analyzed and the propositions in which&#xD;
      there is no consensus will again be sent along with the comments of each specialist. In these&#xD;
      cases, each specialist may review or maintain their position. It is worth noting that during&#xD;
      the application of questionnaires rounds experts do not have access to the identification of&#xD;
      their peers. In the second round, Statements with average scores above 4.0 will be considered&#xD;
      consensus. The final information will be used for the mobile device application development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experts will be selected for convenience. Twelve professionals with experience in geriatrics&#xD;
      will be invited via email to participate as experts in the validation of the Beers Criteria&#xD;
      and STOPP. This call will include a summary of the project and general information about the&#xD;
      Delphi Technique. After acceptance, they will receive a Term of Informed Consent Form (ICF)&#xD;
      and an Authorization to Release Name as Specialist / Senior, which must be signed and&#xD;
      returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application will be developed for the Android platform, which is based on the Java&#xD;
      programming language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial, randomized, single-blind, parallel-group. They will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in this stage 30 physicians working in primary care of a municipality from Bahia. Upon&#xD;
      acceptance to participate in the study and signing of the Informed Consent form (IC), the&#xD;
      proportion of PIMs' prescription by these professionals for a minimum period of two months&#xD;
      will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After, physicians will be randomized and included in one of two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 15 doctors will receive the tablet with the application installed and will be&#xD;
      trained to use it as well as to access the Evidence Based Health Portal of the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: 15 doctors will receive the tablet without the application and will also be&#xD;
      trained to access the Evidence Based Health Portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, the data will be examined again by sampling the proportion of PIM&#xD;
      prescriptions by these professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The author will evaluate the hypothesis that the frequency of PIM orders will be lower in the&#xD;
      intervention group, compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference population: The number of participating physicians was determined by convenience.&#xD;
      Currently the city has twenty health units (primary care) with internet access. The&#xD;
      investigator chose to select two doctors from each unit to ensure the confidentiality of the&#xD;
      professionals randomized into the intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: The random sequence to assign the study groups will be determined by the&#xD;
      principal investigator based on a randomization table, constructed by the randomization&#xD;
      method interchangeable blocks. A sequence of numbers will be generated and stored in sealed&#xD;
      envelopes, individually arranged and marked with serial numbers for each participating&#xD;
      physician. The envelope with the lowest number will be opened by the researcher for the&#xD;
      inclusion of a new doctor in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to calculate the sample of prescriptions that will be verified before and after the&#xD;
      intervention the following factors will be considered: expected proportion of PIM&#xD;
      prescription before intervention 35%, expected difference between the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups after the intervention: 30%. 5% significance level and 80% power of the test.&#xD;
      Two-tailed hypothesis test and loss of 20% of prescriptions. The number of prescriptions per&#xD;
      doctor should also take into consideration the proportion of elderly patients attended (in&#xD;
      the previous three months) per doctor. A sensitivity analysis will be performed to compare&#xD;
      the professional groups that meet different proportions of elderly in order to isolate the&#xD;
      bias of demand. Patient prescriptions will be randomly selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors who meet elderly people in basic health units, family health units or primary care&#xD;
      polyclinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors with residency in medicine-geriatrics or specialization recognized by the Brazilian&#xD;
      Society of Geriatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of orders with at least one PIM prescribed, frequency of PIMs prescribed, types of&#xD;
      PIMs prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome - Frequency of PIMs prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age; gender; training time; medical specialty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the PIM prescription frequency before the intervention, the&#xD;
      prescriptions' duplicate originals stored in pharmacies of health facilities or patient&#xD;
      records will be used. In occasions where this information is not available, home visits will&#xD;
      be carried out to check the first copy of the prescription in the user's possession. In these&#xD;
      situations, the user must sign a consent form. The visits will be carried out preferably in&#xD;
      the company of a community health agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the allocation of doctors, each group separately will receive training on access to the&#xD;
      Evidence Based Health Portal of the Ministry of Health. For this, the investigators will use&#xD;
      one of the computer labs on Universidade Federal da Bahia - Anísio Teixeira campus. In case&#xD;
      of professionals' low compliance, the training will be held in the health clinics, in the day&#xD;
      of the health teams meeting. Then, for doctors in the intervention group, there will be&#xD;
      training to access the application as well as lectures related to PIMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the tablets, each doctor will be visited by a project team member at least&#xD;
      twice a week during the 2 months of intervention. During these visits the struggles regarding&#xD;
      the access to the Evidence Based Health Portal will be checked. It will be checked if doctors&#xD;
      consult the application during the service or at other times, even outside working hours. The&#xD;
      number of hits will be monitored also through a feature available in the application itself,&#xD;
      for this purpose. Those who do not access the application at least once a week will be&#xD;
      considered as a loss in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, a new sample of prescriptions for later analysis will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be posted and reviewed in a database built in SPSS® for Windows version 23.0,&#xD;
      in order to make up the necessary statistical analysis. Statistical analysis will be composed&#xD;
      by descriptive analysis of simple frequency and chi-square test to evaluate the difference&#xD;
      between proportions of PIM prescriptions in both groups before and after the intervention.&#xD;
      The statistical significance level is p &lt;0.05 with 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
