  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is aimed to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and&#xD;
      sustainability of a pediatric-based intervention aimed at reducing families' unmet material&#xD;
      needs (food, housing, employment, childcare, household utilities, education) in pediatric&#xD;
      practices throughout the United States.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators prior work has focused on developing a pediatric primary care-based&#xD;
      intervention, WE CARE (Well-child care visit, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy,&#xD;
      Referral, Education), aimed at addressing poor families' material needs - food security,&#xD;
      employment, parental education, housing stability, household heat, and childcare - by&#xD;
      systematically screening for these needs and referring families to existing community-based&#xD;
      services. To date, the investigators have tested WE CARE primarily in community health&#xD;
      centers (CHCs); their randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated WE CARE's efficacy on&#xD;
      parental receipt of community-based resources. However, over 80% of low-income children&#xD;
      receive care from providers in traditional pediatric practices (i.e. non-CHCs). The&#xD;
      investigators therefore will conduct a large-scale, Hybrid Type 2&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial in eighteen pediatric practices in the US. A stepped wedge&#xD;
      study cluster RCT design will be used to implement WE CARE in all practices using two common&#xD;
      strategies used to integrate systems-based interventions into primary care - a previously&#xD;
      facilitated &quot;on-site&quot; strategy in which content experts provide training sessions and&#xD;
      on-going consultation; and a self-directed &quot;web-based&quot; method modeled after the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics' practice transformation strategy. The proposed study's specific aims&#xD;
      are to: 1) demonstrate the non-inferiority of the self-directed, web-based strategy for&#xD;
      implementing WE CARE, in comparison to the facilitated on-site strategy; 2) demonstrate WE&#xD;
      CARE's effectiveness on increasing parental receipt of community resources; and 3) assess the&#xD;
      sustainability of WE CARE in pediatric practices. The investigators hypothesize that WE CARE&#xD;
      will have equivalent fidelity via the two strategies. Based on prior work, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that WE CARE will significantly increase parental receipt of community resources&#xD;
      three months post-visit compared to usual care. The investigators also expect WE CARE to be&#xD;
      sustained 1.5-, 2-, and 2.5-years post-implementation; they expect to gather data from over&#xD;
      2,700 chart reviews, 2,520 parent-child dyads, and 360 providers and office staff. This&#xD;
      proposal has significant public health implications for the delivery of primary care to&#xD;
      low-income children.&#xD;

    <description>The WE CARE (Well-child care visit, Evaluation, Community Resources, Advocacy, Referral, Education) survey consists of 12 questions used to identify six unmet material needs (education, employment, food security, housing, childcare, household utilities). It will be administered at health supervision visits during the WE CARE phase at each study site. The Family Resource Book will contain resource information sheets for each of these needs listing available community resources. A physician champion will conduct regular booster sessions every 4 months and train new providers should there be staff turnover.</description>
