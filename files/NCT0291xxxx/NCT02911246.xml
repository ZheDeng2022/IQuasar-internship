  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is defined by an energy supply deficit, protein, macro-molecules or&#xD;
      micro-nutrients, resulting from an imbalance between nutrient intakes and metabolic needs of&#xD;
      the body. It concerns 40 to 60% of patients upon entry into resuscitation and influences&#xD;
      their prognosis. Studies over the past decade have shown that nutritional deficiency&#xD;
      increases the morbidity and mortality in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical and biological parameters were evaluated as markers of malnutrition,&#xD;
      including the ratio of urea / urine creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report would identify patients in a state of malnutrition, to optimize their nutritional&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This setting is easy to obtain in all patients by simple urine collection unlike other&#xD;
      clinical and biological criteria of resuscitation malnutrition assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ratio of urea / urien creatinine would optimize energy intake of critically ill&#xD;
      patients, for which nutritional management methods are widely debated.&#xD;

      At present, many clinical studies have shown a link between malnutrition and infectious&#xD;
      complications in intensive care particularly because of immune disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies testing different nutritional strategies used as the main criterion infectious&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So this is a robust standard, well documented in the literature as a reflection of&#xD;
      malnutrition in intensive care, and we also want to use in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study in the surgical ICU of the Hotel-Dieu report the urea / creatinine urine as&#xD;
      a biomarker of poor outcome of nutritional status in the ICU seems extremely discriminating&#xD;
      in predicting the existence of nosocomial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the kinetics of the relationship between the intake and the 5th day of&#xD;
      resuscitation, also appears to be relevant in predicting the occurrence of nosocomial&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical ICU of the Hotel-Dieu proposes to conduct a multicenter study to confirm the&#xD;
      relationship between the ratio of urea / creatinine urine, malnutrition marker, and&#xD;
      nosocomial infections (NI) in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the predictability of the ratio of urea / creatinine urinary J5 on the occurrence&#xD;
      of nosocomial infection in intensive care.&#xD;
