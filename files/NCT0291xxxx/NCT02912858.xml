  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous leg ulcers (VLU) are painful, debilitating wounds that place a significant&#xD;
      burden on the patient, their family, and healthcare resources. Treating VLU can present a&#xD;
      significant challenge to clinicians, who currently have a limited range of treatments at&#xD;
      their disposal. The mainstay of treatment is compression bandaging, ambulation and elevation&#xD;
      at rest. In addition to the aforementioned, intermittent pneumatic compression has also been&#xD;
      utilised1. When applied to the leg or foot intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices&#xD;
      intermittently inflate and deflate to increase venous return. These devices can be&#xD;
      uncomfortable to wear, and compliance can be inhibited because of size, weight and external&#xD;
      power source that limit the patient's mobility. In patients who cannot walk, or in those who&#xD;
      are unable to tolerate compression bandaging, ulcers may deteriorate and never heal.&#xD;
      Accordingly, there is a need for novel, alternative devices or strategies that can be used to&#xD;
      complement or replace compression bandage therapy.&#xD;

      This is a single-centre randomised intra-patient comparison of gekoTM plus R-2 R-2 and IPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow will be measured after each device has been activated for 10 minutes with a 10&#xD;
      minute rest between devices to allow blood flow to return to baseline. The order the devices&#xD;
      will be fitted is determined randomly. Activation of the device for 10 minutes before&#xD;
      measurement is deemed appropriate as previous studies have demonstrated significant increases&#xD;
      in blood flow following as little as five minutes use of the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this short study the standard of care (typically compression bandaging), will be suspended&#xD;
      temporarily to allow the fitting of the gekoTM plus R-2 and IPC devices in order to measure&#xD;
      blood flow. This is not seen as a risk to the patient as the device is only in operation for&#xD;
      30 minutes plus 10 minutes rest within the care pathway.&#xD;
