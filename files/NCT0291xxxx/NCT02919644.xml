      Vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumour homogenate after&#xD;
      curative resection for stage IV colorectal cancer: a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: Safety Immunological efficacy, expressed as number of patients who show&#xD;
      enhancement of the proportion of circulating immune effectors specific for a selected panel&#xD;
      of Colon-Rectal Cancer (CRC)-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Clinical outcome of the patients (OS, RFS, TTR). To evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive role of the development of a positive DTH test after at least three vaccine&#xD;
      administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the persistence of an antitumor immune response after the completion of the&#xD;
      vaccination program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the prognostic or predictive role of the enhancement of a specific immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate a panel of inflammatory cytokines involved in antitumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the predictive role of immune cells in tumour microenvironment. To evaluate the&#xD;
      predictive role of tumour antigen expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-stage, phase 2 clinical trial designed according to Simon minimax design. A 40%&#xD;
      immune response rate would preclude further studies, while a 70% immune response rate would&#xD;
      indicate that further studies would be warranted. Given α and β error of 0.1, the first stage&#xD;
      will require enrolment of 7 patients. If at least 3 patients show an immune response and&#xD;
      toxicity is acceptable, the study will proceed to the second stage and additional 12 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be considered immunologically active if at least 11 patients are&#xD;
      immunological responders.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed stage IV colorectal cancer surgically&#xD;
             treated with radical intent.&#xD;

             pelvis performed within 60 days before enrolment. If the resected lesions had occurred&#xD;
             in other sites, these must be also included in the baseline CT scan and in all the&#xD;
             subsequent evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient must have recovered (grade 1 or less by CTCAE 4.0) from all the adverse&#xD;
             events related to previous surgery.&#xD;

          8. Patients aged 70 years or older must have left ventricular ejection fraction not lower&#xD;
             than 55% as assessed by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients of childbearing potential and all male patients must accept and be&#xD;
             compliant with an highly effective contraceptive method (i.e. with a failure rate of&#xD;
             &lt;1% per year: double barrier method, one barrier method plus spermicidal, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, or oral contraception) from informed consent signature and up to three months&#xD;
             after end of study. For this purpose are considered of childbearing potential all&#xD;
             female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at least two years&#xD;
             or are surgically sterile. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourses is acceptable&#xD;
             if patients' lifestyle guarantees his/her strict compliance with this prescription in&#xD;
             the judgement of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient is willing and able to give written informed consent for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with residual disease after surgery. Marginal resection of any lesion in the&#xD;
             absence of clinically evident residual disease is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who relapsed within 6 months since primary treatment of stage I-III&#xD;
             colorectal cancer. If adjuvant chemotherapy had been administered, the term must be&#xD;
             computed since last chemotherapy dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient who completed surgery more than 60 days before study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of other neoplastic diseases in the previous 5 years, except basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri treated with curative&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including history of organ&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any positivity for the serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (including at&#xD;
             least anti-HBs antibodies and anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies), hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus (HCV), HIV or Treponema pallidum. The serologic tests must have been performed&#xD;
             within 30 days before any GMP-regulated activity (i.e. surgical resection and&#xD;
             leukapheresis). The sole positivity for antibodies against the HBV S antigen (i.e.&#xD;
             with all other HBV markers negative) is indicative of previous HBV vaccination and&#xD;
             therefore is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients undergone surgery after preoperatory chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
             plus oxaliplatin, unless they are not candidate for postoperatory chemotherapy with&#xD;
             the same schedule in the opinion of the Investigator (e.g. for unacceptable toxicity)&#xD;
             or refuse completion of the perioperatory treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational agent within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any active inflammatory or autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids or other&#xD;
             immunomodulatory agents as detailed in section 6.4, or potentially requiring such&#xD;
             treatments during the study treatment in the judgement of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Transfusion&#xD;
             Medicine specialist, is a contraindication to leukapheresis. In addition, all patients&#xD;
             aged 70 or older must be evaluated by a cardiology specialist before the procedure to&#xD;
             exclude any clinically relevant cardiac condition and any grade 3-4 cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, even if asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates the&#xD;
             subcutaneous administration of low-dose IL-2 as per protocol (see section 6.2 for&#xD;
             details).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any uncontrolled serious intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations potentially impacting&#xD;
             patient safety and compliance in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Refusal of giving written informed consent.&#xD;
