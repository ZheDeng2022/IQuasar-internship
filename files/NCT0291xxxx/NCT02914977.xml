      In this pilot study, eligible patients will be treated with 5 days of low dose daunorubicin&#xD;
      for one cycle only. Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for&#xD;
      toxicity. Each patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity at all scheduled&#xD;
      visits (Days 1-5). Following participation on this brief pharmacodynamic trial, patients can&#xD;
      then proceed to other conventional or investigational therapies, as clinically indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease relapse remains the primary challenge in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). There is no standard of care treatment option for&#xD;
      relapsed acute leukemia, and investigational therapies are recommended. Clinically targeting&#xD;
      the leukemia stem cell (LSC) remains an unmet need in both AML and ALL. Therefore, a primary&#xD;
      objective of this trial is to determine the molecular pharmacodynamic effects of low dose&#xD;
      daunorubicin (DNR) on beta-catenin phosphorylation in serial bone marrow samples of patients&#xD;
      with relapsed leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to studying low-dose DNR in complex, multi-agent regimens, it is essential to confirm&#xD;
      that it inhibits p-beta-catenin S552 in humans. This pilot study is designed to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and tolerability of low dose DNR administration to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML and ALL, and obtain preliminary data regarding target engagement. A&#xD;
      second objective is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of low-dose daunorubicin&#xD;
      administration in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-catenin phosphorylation will be measured by immunohistochemistry assay in bone marrow&#xD;
      samples taken from patients at study entry and at Day 8 following study therapy with low-dose&#xD;
      DNR. The investigators will also measure the pharmacokinetics of low dose DNR in these&#xD;
      patients, to enable preliminary PK-PD analyses and because there are essentially no PK data&#xD;
      for DNR at comparable doses using modern analytical methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following participation on this brief pharmacodynamic proof-of-concept trial, patients can&#xD;
      then proceed to other conventional or investigational therapies, as clinically indicated.&#xD;
