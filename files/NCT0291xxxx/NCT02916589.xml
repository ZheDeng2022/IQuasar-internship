      Obesity continues to pose major public health challenges worldwide with cardiovascular&#xD;
      damage, hypertension and diabetes as possible subsequent conditions. The obese are at risk&#xD;
      for mortality and morbidity as they suffer from a high level of immune sensitivity with&#xD;
      consequences related to damage to the circulation and microvasculature. The immune process&#xD;
      itself is modulated by cytokines, which are small proteins which can modulate the spectrum of&#xD;
      the inflammatory process. These proteins may act as biomarkers in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is also a consequence of sustained obesity and this condition can strongly influence&#xD;
      immune status. Diabetes is characterized by the failure to produce the hormone insulin or a&#xD;
      loss of sensitivity to insulin. Without insulin high blood glucose results in the release of&#xD;
      a series of pro-inflammatory factors, which lead to pathological processes in several organs&#xD;
      leading to high mortality and morbidity. Periodontitis, a common complication of diabetes, is&#xD;
      an inflammatory condition of the soft tissue of the periodontium, causing alveolar bone loss.&#xD;
      The accessibility of the oral cavity facilitates the study of early inflammatory processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in diet may reduce inflammation, controlling gingival inflammation as well as&#xD;
      clinical treatment. Since 2004 Igelösa Life Science AB has developed a modified Nordic diet&#xD;
      based on evidence, primarily from the Japanese island of Okinawa, where the world's oldest&#xD;
      and most healthy people live. In this study we will investigate the association between&#xD;
      Igelösa dietary intake and measurements of inflammation in 30 overweight individuals with or&#xD;
      without other systemic diseases.&#xD;

      Obesity and diabetes mellitus Obesity is one of our most serious public health issues&#xD;
      (National Food Agency, 2016). In the Swedish adult (16-84 years) population, about 35% are&#xD;
      overweight and almost 15% are obese (Statistics Sweden). The most commonly used definition of&#xD;
      obesity is based on the body mass index (BMI; overweight 25.0-29.9 kg/m2, obesity 30.0-39.9&#xD;
      kg/m2 and severe obesity &gt; 40 kg/m2) by the World Health Organization. Many studies have&#xD;
      shown an increased risk of all-cause mortality with greater adiposity as measured by BMI. The&#xD;
      share of overweight or obese inhabitants in Skåne has increased gradually over recent&#xD;
      decades. Currently, more than half, (57%) of men are either overweight or obese and the&#xD;
      corresponding figure for women is 41 percent. These obesity rates are somewhat higher than in&#xD;
      the rest Sweden (Regional Folkhälsostrategi för Skåne, 2010). However, physical inactivity&#xD;
      and sedentary behavior has not increased since 2000 (Regional Folkhälsostrategi för Skåne,&#xD;
      2010). The consequences of obesity include increased risk of coronary heart disease, high&#xD;
      blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes Diabetes is a major health problem and is characterized by elevated serum blood&#xD;
      sugar levels (hyperglycaemia). Hyperglycemia can be the result of insulin resistance, as well&#xD;
      as dysfunctional islet β-cells that are unable to secrete adequate insulin to regulate blood&#xD;
      sugar levels. The financial burden to health care systems providing care to individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus is considerable, as is the significant secondary damage to many organs of&#xD;
      the body (Nolan et al., 2011). Recent estimates indicate that 8.3% of adults - 382 million&#xD;
      people worldwide - have diabetes (diabetes mellitus type 1: T1D, or diabetes mellitus type 2:&#xD;
      T2D) and this number may approach 600 million people in less than 25 years (Anonymous IDF&#xD;
      2013). T2D is the predominant form of the condition and accounts for at least 90% of cases.&#xD;
      The excess global mortality in 2000 attributed to T2D, was 2.9 million deaths. In the USA,&#xD;
      diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, as well as causing around 40% of end-stage renal&#xD;
      failure events and 60% of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations (Nolan et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis Periodontitis is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus (Loe, 1993) and is a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease of the gingiva (gum tissues), the teeth, and the supporting bone,&#xD;
      leading to loss of connective tissue attachment to the teeth, and alveolar bone loss. The&#xD;
      disease is a result of a complex interaction between bacteria and the host immune response&#xD;
      (Salvi et al., 2005). Periodontal tissue destruction is caused by a host response to the&#xD;
      development of a complex bacterial biofilm (Thomas et al., 2013). Periodontal infections&#xD;
      trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1β, IL6, IL8 and TNFα, both at the site&#xD;
      of the infection and through the endothelial cell system (Zdarilova et al., 2010; Kocgozlu et&#xD;
      al., 2009). It is generally perceived that periodontitis is preceded by gingivitis, but the&#xD;
      aetiology of the transition from gingivitis to periodontitis remains unknown. Gingivitis&#xD;
      presents with swollen tissues and increased redness but with no loss of attachment of the&#xD;
      teeth. Poor glycemic control in patients often presents with severely inflamed gum tissues&#xD;
      and loss of tooth-supporting alveolar bone. Several studies have reported that chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis is prevalent in patients with diabetes (Kim et al., 2013, Moodley et al.,&#xD;
      2013). In poorly controlled type 2 diabetes pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may&#xD;
      partially explain the greater susceptibility of diabetic individuals to periodontal breakdown&#xD;
      (Duarte et al., 2014). To identify bacterial pathogens responsible for periodontitis, one has&#xD;
      to use both cultivation and molecular identification methods. No single or group of pathogens&#xD;
      has been clearly identified as the causative agent or agents of gingivitis. Indeed, Kumar et&#xD;
      al., (2003) showed 40% of organisms detected to be novel species based on ribosomal 16S&#xD;
      cloning and sequencing. They also concluded that among the bacterial species identified in&#xD;
      samples collected from both healthy and chronic periodontitis patients, about one third were&#xD;
      more prevalent among non-healthy individuals. Treatment of periodontitis is usually focused&#xD;
      on elimination of the infection by lowering the bacterial load using surgical, non-surgical&#xD;
      or antibiotics. These treatments have considerable side effects, limited effect over time and&#xD;
      are usually costly. However, another way to control the inflammation is through a radical&#xD;
      change in diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Okinawa and Igelösa Diet Prevention of high BMI and obesity requires a range of measures&#xD;
      including moderate dietary habits. Research show that those who consume foods rich in fiber,&#xD;
      like whole grain, vegetables, legumes, fruit, berries and nuts, more easily retain a stable&#xD;
      weight (National Food Agency, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Okinawa is an island in Japan that that has been top ranked in the world when it comes to&#xD;
      longevity. The reasons behind the long lives of the original population on Okinawa is a&#xD;
      combination of genetic and life style-related factors and it is impossible to entangle their&#xD;
      separate roles (Steen, 2010). However, the traditional lifestyle in Okinawa is characterized&#xD;
      by low levels of stress, natural exercise and a diet that can be described as mainly&#xD;
      vegetarian with fish as a main source of animal protein and fat. Steen (2010) refers to the&#xD;
      book &quot;the Okinawa program&quot; where the authors Suzuki, Willcox and Willcox describe &quot;eating the&#xD;
      Okinawa way&quot;. According to these authors food should be sourced directly from the nature, and&#xD;
      should be made edible with as little intervention as possible. Comparable to the Swedish&#xD;
      National Food Agency's recommendations vegetables and whole grain constitutes a large part of&#xD;
      the natural diet, which further is characterized by its content of calcium, antioxidants in&#xD;
      the form of flavonoids, omega-3. Another important principle is captured in the statement&#xD;
      &quot;weigh your options carefully&quot; implying that most food can be consumed as long as certain&#xD;
      foods, like animal protein and sweets are not overconsumed (Steen, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2004 Igelösa Life Science AB has developed a modified Nordic diet based on evidence,&#xD;
      primarily from the diets of the Okinawa population. The Igelösa-diet consists of food without&#xD;
      supplements, mainly based on locally produced traditional Nordic ingredients such as intact&#xD;
      grain (oats, rye, barley, and wheat), vegetables, legumes, root vegetables, fish, poultry,&#xD;
      fruit and nuts. At the same time, the diet restricts the intake of sugar, red meat,&#xD;
      delicatessen and dairy products. The diet is nutritious but contains a lower number of&#xD;
      calories than usual recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research within the field Changes in diet can reduce inflammation (Baumgartner et al., 2009),&#xD;
      comparably with clinical intervention in the control of gingival inflammation (Widén et al.,&#xD;
      2015). In 2015, a clinical nutrition study in 30 subjects with T2D was carried out in&#xD;
      Kävlinge. For 12 weeks every individual received Igelösa diet free of charge. This consisted&#xD;
      of two meals a day, ready to heat, including salad, fruit and snacks and breakfasts such as&#xD;
      muesli and porridge. In the following 12 weeks individuals cooked their own food with the&#xD;
      help of some key products. Individualized dietary advice was available. A research team at&#xD;
      Skåne University Hospital in Malmö documented each individual's general condition and&#xD;
      metabolic parameters of glucose, lipids and insulin. Blood, urine and faecal samples were&#xD;
      collected at baseline and after 2, 12 and 24 weeks. The approach was effective and resulted&#xD;
      in that several individuals no longer required insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Periodontitis Since 1963, gingival inflammation has been determined through the&#xD;
      incidence of bleeding on probing (BOP), that is, via a slight pressure of the gums to see if&#xD;
      it causes bleeding (Loe &amp; Silness, 1963). BOP bias can be avoided by using state-of-the-art&#xD;
      laser-based measurement systems which exploit the Doppler Effect to record blood flow. Laser&#xD;
      Doppler flow readings have been shown to be positively correlated with the degree of gingival&#xD;
      inflammation (Gleissner et al, 2006, Patiño-Marín 2005). We will apply the Doppler technique&#xD;
      in comparison with the traditional BOP method. Cytokines (immune system signals) are&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammation and these can be easily measured in fluid collected from the&#xD;
      periodontal pockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study The purpose of the study is to investigate the association between dietary&#xD;
      intake, periodontal status, bacterial populations and measurements of inflammation in 30&#xD;
      obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We wish to determine whether a change of diet leads to weight loss, a lower incidence of&#xD;
           systemic and local inflammation, and less need for medication?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is this correlated with microbial population changes in the mouth?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a correlation between cytokine levels and bacterial numbers in samples of serum&#xD;
           and gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal pockets?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the Laser Doppler blood flow and measurements of pro-inflammatory cytokines better&#xD;
           methods of assessing periodontal inflammation compared with bleeding on probing?&#xD;
