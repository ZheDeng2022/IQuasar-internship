      The study will evaluate the immediate procedure and post-procedure profile of the AGN1&#xD;
      Femoral LOEP™ Kit. All subjects will receive the treatment and be evaluated for any adverse&#xD;
      or serious adverse events that could occur during the procedure or immediately&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;

      This research study will be conducted as a post-CE Mark prospective multi-center study within&#xD;
      Europe. In total 60 patients will be treated with the OSSURE LOEP kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be conducted ten (10) and forty-two (42) days after the procedure. In&#xD;
      addition, all subjects will have the option to consent for a long term follow-up evaluation&#xD;
      at twelve (12) months post-procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject has progressive increase in undiagnosed hip pain over the previous six months&#xD;

             a pre-existing calcium metabolism disorder (e.g. hypercalcemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has severe renal insufficiency defined as an estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;

             investigator*.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has radiological evidence of gross bony or joint pathology, including signs&#xD;
             predictive of atypical femoral fractures (e.g. Cortical beaking) or has been diagnosed&#xD;
             and/or treated for atypical femoral fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject treated with corticosteroids or systemic glucocorticoids for ten (10) days in&#xD;
             the previous six (6) months.&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Subject has known allergies to implanted device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has severe comorbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical study. *AgNovos's recommendation is&#xD;
             &gt;1 pack per day smoking and &gt;3 alcoholic drinks per day&#xD;
