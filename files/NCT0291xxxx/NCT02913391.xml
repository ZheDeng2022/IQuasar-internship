  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery can evolve with complications in the postoperative period, atelectasis and&#xD;
      hypoxemia are the major pulmonary dysfunctions. They can lead to a prolonged length of stay&#xD;
      in the hospital, increasing morbidity and mortality. In order to prevent or reduce such&#xD;
      complications noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used in the postoperative period in a&#xD;
      prophylactic and therapeutic way. The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is&#xD;
      widely practice in intensive care unit (ICU), being used in patients under mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, NIV and exercises with intermittent positive pressure. The recruitment maneuver&#xD;
      (RM) consists of sustained increase of pressure in the airway using PEEP in individuals with&#xD;
      hypoxemia, in order to minimize the deleterious effects from alveolar collapse, providing a&#xD;
      more homogeneous ventilation of the pulmonary parenchyma increasing the pulmonary area&#xD;
      available for gas exchange and, consequently, arterial oxygenation. In recent years the&#xD;
      increase in the application of PEEP in cardiac patients under has shown great benefits and&#xD;
      the use of NIV to improve oxygenation by the reversal of atelectasis is already used and&#xD;
      recommended in hospital routine. Despite NIV being used in great proportion, the relevant&#xD;
      literature is poor in showing studies with NIV associated with RM in postoperative period of&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. Therefore, the aims of this study are to evaluate if the use of NIV&#xD;
      associated with RM improves oxygenation and if it can be safely applied in coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) postoperative patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This work was a controlled and randomized clinical trial, where patients were analyzed in&#xD;
      postoperative period of CABG with CPB. The protocol study was approved by Ethics Committee of&#xD;
      the Faculty of Medicine, University os São Paulo and the Ethics Committee of the Hospital do&#xD;
      Coração. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their surrogates at the&#xD;
      thime of their enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, doctors and nursing team were blinded to which group the patient was allocated,&#xD;
      only the physiotherapy team, responsible for applying NIV therapy in the study, was aware of&#xD;
      group allocation after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients were ventilated in Servo I (MAQUET Critical Care AB™, Sweden) and used the&#xD;
      FitLife total face mask (Philips Respironics™, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed using a computer-based software. Patients eligible to the study&#xD;
      were randomly assigned to the Control Group (CG) or Recruitment Group (RG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CG used NIV for 30 minutes with pressure support for a tidal volume of 6 mL/Kg, PEEP 8 cm&#xD;
      H2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) for a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 95%. RG&#xD;
      used NIV with RM with PEEP 15 cm H2O and afterwards 20 cm H2O remaining 2 minutes in each&#xD;
      level, then being maintained in NIV for 30 minutes with pressure support for a tidal volume&#xD;
      of 6 mL/Kg, PEEP 8 cm H2O, FiO2 for a SpO2 ≥ 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were monitored during the whole NIV session.The RM would be interrupted and medical&#xD;
      staff would be called to check the patient if any clinical instability occurred during or&#xD;
      after RM, such as barotrauma, respiratory instability, hemodynamic instability and&#xD;
      arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical staff would take the required measures for the safety of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety criteria for Interruption of RM:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory rate &gt; 35 breaths per minute;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart rate &gt;120 beats per minute or &lt; 20 points from baseline;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 16 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac arrhythmia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's request. The patients used NIV three times per day until discharge from the&#xD;
           ICU, the arterial blood gas and chest radiograph examinations were collected as sector&#xD;
           routine. The arterial blood samples was collected after 2 minutes in room air and chest&#xD;
           radiograph without NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All postoperative patients of the ICU had NIV therapy once in the morning, once in the&#xD;
      afternoon, once at night and only the physiotherapist applied NIV. All the patients were&#xD;
      guided concerning how their therapy would be and, if they had queries, they were clarified&#xD;
      before the start.&#xD;
