      What are the capacity and training needs in general practice to implement routine spirometry&#xD;
      and eNO testing in children aged 5-16 years?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is the commonest long-term disease of childhood in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;
      Under-diagnosis and under-treatment of childhood asthma in general practice (GP) have been&#xD;
      reported from several European countries including the UK. This can result in poor symptom&#xD;
      control and increased risk of asthma related deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that both under- and over- diagnosis of childhood asthma in general&#xD;
      practice could be improved by routinely using objective lung function testing for diagnosis&#xD;
      and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed objective lung function tests (spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide measurements&#xD;
      - eNO) are already used routinely in UK hospitals, but are not usually available in general&#xD;
      practice where most children are cared for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why is it important? - Availability of these tests will help health professionals in general&#xD;
      practice to look after children with asthma better, and hopefully improve asthma control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will this study achieve? - Though it is believed that providing spirometry and eNO in&#xD;
      general practice would be beneficial, there is little data on how this can be achieved. This&#xD;
      study will employ both qualitative and quantitative measures in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      resources required to implement routine spirometry and eNO testing for children in primary&#xD;
      care; and to investigate the impact this would have on diagnosis in children with suspected&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How? - The investigators will work with general practices in and around Leicestershire, UK.&#xD;
      Firstly, to identify what the barriers are to implementing these tests, and secondly to train&#xD;
      the practices to perform and interpret spirometry and eNO independently in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with suspected or previously diagnosed asthma will be invited for review and lung&#xD;
      function testing. The investigators will record the time it takes to train general practices&#xD;
      to perform and interpret spirometry and eNO independently, and the additional clinic capacity&#xD;
      required to provide these tests.&#xD;
