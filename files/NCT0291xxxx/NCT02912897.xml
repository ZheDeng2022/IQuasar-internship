  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiologic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) are not yet fully understood.&#xD;
      Indeed MS is a multifactorial disease involving genetic and environmental factors and&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) could be one of these factors. However the link between EBV&#xD;
      infection and the immunological mechanisms underlying MS is not clear. Robust&#xD;
      sero-epidemiological evidences support an association between EBV infection and MS, and&#xD;
      immunological data suggest an altered/deficient immune response against this virus. In&#xD;
      healthy individuals EBV produces a persistent infection that is tightly controlled by the&#xD;
      immune system. In patients with MS, cellular and humoral immune studies demonstrate an&#xD;
      altered response against the virus with a T-cell abnormal reactivity against the EBV-infected&#xD;
      autologous B-cells, elevated humoral immune response to Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1, and&#xD;
      in the case of children, an increased EBV shedding, demonstrating frequent EBV reactivations.&#xD;
      Thus, it has been proposed, that patients with MS present a partially inefficient control of&#xD;
      the EBV infection. Some experimental data support the hypothesis suggesting that the presence&#xD;
      of autoreactive EBV-B cells in the meninges of patients, probably due to an insufficient&#xD;
      clearance of these cells by the immune system, lead to the infiltration of autoreactive T&#xD;
      cells. Another hypothesis also suggests a deficient control of the virus, in that case during&#xD;
      the inactive phase of the disease. Together, the above data and hypotheses lead to the notion&#xD;
      that an immune intervention capable of restoring the host-EBV balance could be beneficial to&#xD;
      MS patients In this project, we will assess the feasibility and safety of autologous transfer&#xD;
      of several amounts of CD8 T cells directed against autologous EBV transformed B cell lines,&#xD;
      in order to finally restore an efficient control of EBV in MS patients. The main objective of&#xD;
      the project is to test the feasibility and safety of the process, while efficacy parameters&#xD;
      will be also assessed in secondary objectives.&#xD;
