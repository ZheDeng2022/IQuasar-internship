      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveitis is an inflammation of the eye that can cause vision loss. It is treated with&#xD;
      medications and sometimes surgery. However, in many people, treatment does not always prevent&#xD;
      loss of vision. A new medication, ustekinumab, reduces inflammation in patients with other&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. Therefore, it might be helpful in treatment of uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if ustekinumab is safe and can help people with uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with uveitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and eye disease history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam: The pupil is dilated with eye drops. A machine scans the back of the eye. Pictures&#xD;
      are taken of the inside of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 6 clinic visits over 28 weeks. Visits lasts 2-3 hours and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and eye disease history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and eye exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. A dye is&#xD;
           injected into the tube. The dye travels through the veins up to the blood vessels in the&#xD;
           eyes. A camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the blood vessels in the&#xD;
           eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 - Ustekinumab injections at Weeks 0, 4, and 8: The injection is under the skin&#xD;
           of the upper arm, leg, or abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their uveitis monitored and receive standard uveitis care during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 - Ustekinumab injections via intravenous (IV) injection at first visit,&#xD;
           followed by a single 90 mg injection of ustekinumab under the skin of the upper arm, leg&#xD;
           or abdomen. For the IV injection a needle will be used to guide a thin plastic tube&#xD;
           (catheter) into one of the arm veins. The needle will be removed, leaving only the&#xD;
           catheter in the vein.&#xD;

      Objective: Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of&#xD;
      visual loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause&#xD;
      significant adverse effects and many patients continue to experience disease flare-ups.&#xD;
      Ustekinumab is a human IL-12 and -23 antagonist. The involvement of IL-12 and IL-23 in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of uveitis and other autoimmune diseases known to be associated with uveitis&#xD;
      suggests that ustekinumab could be a potential treatment for uveitis. The study objective is&#xD;
      to investigate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of ustekinumab as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for active intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The first cohort will consist of five participants with active intermediate&#xD;
      uveitis, posterior uveitis or panuveitis who meet the inclusion criteria. The second cohort&#xD;
      will include up to four participants with active intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or&#xD;
      panuveitis who meet the inclusion criteria. Up to eleven participants may be enrolled, as up&#xD;
      to two participants may be accrued in the second cohort to account for participants who&#xD;
      withdraw from the study prior to Week 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled, two-arm pilot study to evaluate&#xD;
      of ustekinumab as a possible treatment for active intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis or&#xD;
      panuveitis. Five participants in the first cohort will receive a 90 mg subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      injection of ustekinumab at baseline and a second and third injection at Week 4 and 8 for a&#xD;
      total of 3 injections. For the second cohort, up to four participants will receive an initial&#xD;
      high, weight-based dose of ustekinumab via intravenous (IV) injection (up to 55 kg, 260 mg (2&#xD;
      vials); greater than 55 kg to 85 kg, 390 mg (3 vials); greater than 85 kg, 520 mg (4 vials)),&#xD;
      followed by a single 90 mg subcutaneous injection at Week 8. In participants who demonstrate&#xD;
      allergic reaction to the first dose, the second dose can also be administered as IV infusion&#xD;
      with pre-infusion desensitization instead of a subcutaneous injection as it allows better&#xD;
      control on the rate of drug administration. Participants will continue in the study for a&#xD;
      total of 28 weeks and will be able to receive standard of care after the first 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: For each cohort, the primary outcome is the number of participants who&#xD;
      experience treatment response by Week 16. Secondary outcomes for each cohort include changes&#xD;
      in visual acuity, the number of participants who experience a recurrence, the number of days&#xD;
      to recurrence, presence or extent of macular edema, the amount of retino-vascular leakage,&#xD;
      changes in retinal thickening, the length of time to quiescence and the ability to taper&#xD;
      concomitant immunosuppressive medications. Safety outcomes for each cohort include the number&#xD;
      and severity of systemic and ocular toxicities and adverse events, the proportion of&#xD;
      participants who experience vision loss of greater than or equal to 15 letters as measured by&#xD;
      Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) and the number of participants who experience a substantial&#xD;
      rise in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP).&#xD;

          <population>All enrolled participants who received at least one dose of Ustekinumab and completed the Week 16 visit. One participant in each cohort is excluded from the analysis as a result of discontinuing the study prior to Week 16.</population>

        <description>Number of participants in each cohort who experience a recurrence of uveitis at each follow-up visit (Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16). Recurrence of uveitis is defined as the presence of one of the following in at least one eye: 1) new active inflammatory chorioretinal lesion and/or retinal vascular leakage; 2) a 2+ increase in anterior chamber (AC) cells relative to Baseline; 3) a 2-step increase in vitreous haze (VH) relative to Baseline; 4) worsening of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by ≥ 15 letters relative to Baseline.</description>

Recurrence of uveitis is defined as the presence of one of the following in at least one eye: 1) new active inflammatory chorioretinal lesion and/or retinal vascular leakage; 2) a 2+ increase in anterior chamber (AC) cells relative to Baseline; 3) a 2-step increase in vitreous haze (VH) relative to Baseline; 4) worsening of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by ≥ 15 letters relative to Baseline.</description>
          <population>All enrolled participants who received at least one dose of Ustekinumab and completed the Week 16 visit. One participant in each cohort is excluded from the analysis as a result of discontinuing the study prior to Week 16.</population>
