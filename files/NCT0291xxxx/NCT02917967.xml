  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, prospective, and open-label interventional study in a single center.&#xD;
      We will investigate the effect of single injection in each patient. This study was designed&#xD;
      to establish the clinical evidence for effect of botulinum toxin type a (Dysport,&#xD;
      abobotulinum toxin A) injection on changes in musculotendinous length and dynamics of&#xD;
      hamstring muscles during gait in children with spastic cerebral palsy walking with excessive&#xD;
      knee flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data such as Modified Ashworth scale (MAS), Modified Tardieu scale (MTS), Gross&#xD;
      Motor Function Measures (GMFM), and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level&#xD;
      will be assessed. Gait analysis will be performed using a computerized gait analysis system&#xD;
      (VICON MX-T10 System with 6 infrared cameras, Oxford Metrics Inc., Oxford, UK) to measure the&#xD;
      kinematic data (angle of each joint) during the gait cycle. A trained investigator will place&#xD;
      14 reflective markers on the anterior and posterior superior iliac spine, the mid points of&#xD;
      the lateral femur, the lateral knee joint axis, the midpoints of the lateral tibia, the&#xD;
      lateral malleolus, and the dorsal foot between metatarsal heads 2 and 3. All subjects should&#xD;
      walk barefoot at a self-selected speed along an 8-meter path with the markers in place and&#xD;
      the motion will be captured with a 100-Hz sampling frequency. Force-plates (AMTI OR 6-5,&#xD;
      Advanced Mechanical Technology, Newton, MA, USA) under the path will record ground reaction&#xD;
      forces during the walking trials with a 1000-Hz sampling frequency, and joint moments will be&#xD;
      expressed as internal moments to counter the ground reaction forces. Data collection will&#xD;
      continue until the subject achieved at least 3 'clean' force-plate strikes. Kinematic and&#xD;
      kinetic data from successful trials will be used for statistical analysis. Video recording&#xD;
      will be done simultaneously from the front, rear, and side, with the 3D gait analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the evaluation including gait analysis, we will select the target muscles and inject&#xD;
      the toxin into the selected muscles of the spastic lower limb under the guidance of&#xD;
      ultrasonography or electrical stimulation. After BoNT-A injection, these children will be&#xD;
      evaluated after 1 month. Clinical data obtained in the baseline measurement will be assessed&#xD;
      again. Motion capture data will also be collected. Finally, clinical data of patients will be&#xD;
      collected 4 months after injection to identify the clinical improvement and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion capture data will be imported to OpenSim. We will generate an inverse kinematic&#xD;
      analysis of each subject using following procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Scale the model to match the anthropometry of each subject. We will scale the dimensions&#xD;
           of the torso, pelvis, thigh, shank, and foot based on the relative distances between&#xD;
           pairs of markers measured experimentally and the corresponding markers in the model. The&#xD;
           muscle attachments will also be scaled with the segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using a least-squares formulation, a set of desired joint angles for tracking,&#xD;
           consistent with each scaled model, based on the marker trajectories, joint constraints,&#xD;
           and joint angles from gait analysis will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The musculotendinous length of each muscle will be calculated based on the &quot;lower limb&#xD;
           model 2010&quot; by Arnold. This model adopted the wrapping surface to calculate the moment&#xD;
           arm and musculotendinous unit passage at each joint. This model is intended to be used&#xD;
           in research-graded kinematic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Objectives &lt;Primary objective&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.To determine the changes of musculotendinous length of hamstrings after a single BoNT-A&#xD;
      injection during walking in children with spastic CP walking with excessive knee flexion&#xD;
      &lt;Secondary objectives&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the efficacy on gross motor function after BoNT-A injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the benefit on gait after BoNT-A injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the efficacy on spasticity after BoNT-A injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the kinematic change after BoNT-A injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the dynamic change after BoNT-A injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the treatment emergent adverse events following BoNT-A injection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects : total 32 children with cerebral palsy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. BoNT-A will be injected into two hamstring and/or gastrocnemius muscles under the guidance&#xD;
      of ultrasonography or electrical stimulation. 2. Maximal total dose and dose regimen for each&#xD;
      muscle would follow the recommendation of international consensus. A. Semitendinosus 5 to 7.5&#xD;
      units/kg of body weight B. Semimembranosus 5 to 7.5 units/kg of body weight C. Gastrocnemius&#xD;
      10 units/kg of body weight D. Maximal total dose per patient : unilateral injection 500&#xD;
      units, bilateral injection 1,000 units E. The dosage of two hamstring muscles will depend on&#xD;
      the severity of spasticity and gait abnormalities of children with CP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies : 3D motion analysis, GMFM (gross motor function measure), GMFCS (gross motor&#xD;
           function classification system), MAS (modified Ashworth scale), MTS (modified Tardieu&#xD;
