  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Movement disorders such as Parkinson Disease, dystonia, and tremor are related to&#xD;
      abnormalities of part of the brain known as the basal ganglia. Recently, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that the basal ganglia works by oscillations (group of neurons cycle between&#xD;
      activation/deactivation when stimulated) of electrical signals. A treatment that involves&#xD;
      insertion of electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for electrical stimulation, known as&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation (DBS), is an established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      However its mechanism of action is still not completely understood. Currently, DBS utilizes&#xD;
      an &quot;open loop&quot; system whereby the stimulation settings are manually adjusted depending on the&#xD;
      patients' clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether the local field potential (LFP) recorded from the STN is stable over a&#xD;
           1.5 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Address whether STN LFP is a suitable control signal, and how it should be used to&#xD;
           change DBS parameters&#xD;

      Study Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are scheduled for bilateral STN DBS will be&#xD;
      recruited. DBS surgery will be performed at the Toronto Western Hospital as per standard&#xD;
      clinical care. The studies will be performed at two sites: Toronto Western Hospital and&#xD;
      London Mobility Laboratory at Western University. Recording of STN LFP using externalized DBS&#xD;
      leads, the effects DBS at different frequencies on PD motor symptoms will be studied at the&#xD;
      Toronto Western Hospital. Gait studies with full body kinematic measurements, recording of&#xD;
      LFP and effects of different stimulation frequencies will be studied at the London Mobility&#xD;
      Laboratory (LML) at Western University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An outline of the study timeline is provided in Table (2, 3 and 4). Standardized tasks&#xD;
      performed are provided in Table 5.Ten PD patients with bilateral DBS in STN will be studied&#xD;
      for six visits to each site (TWH and LML). There will also be a presurgical baseline visit to&#xD;
      LML. Patients will first be studied 1-3 days after DBS electrode implantation and before the&#xD;
      implantation of the pulse generator. Local field potential (LFP) will be recorded from&#xD;
      bilateral STN DBS electrodes using externalized leads. Following internalization of the DBS&#xD;
      leads and insertion of the pulse generator (Activa PC+S, Medtronic), patients will be studied&#xD;
      within 7 days for a second visit. DBS programming will be performed as per usual clinical&#xD;
      practice. Patients will then be studied at 1, 2, 6, 12 and 18 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits at the Toronto Western Hospital (TWH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (TWH V1) This visit will obtain &quot;acute&quot; LFP recording for comparison to chronic&#xD;
      recordings. Patients will be studied 1-3 days after electrode insertion when the leads are&#xD;
      externalized. This is a two day visit, with one day in the off medication state (overnight&#xD;
      withdrawal) and one day in the on medication state in random order. For the on medication&#xD;
      state, 125% of the levodopa equivalent of the first morning preoperative dose will be&#xD;
      administered to increase the chance of recording levodopa-induced dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: LFP will be recorded from bilateral STN DBS electrodes together with scalp EEG. Fig.&#xD;
      3 shows a schematic representation of the recording setup. Surface EMG and accelerometery&#xD;
      will be used to measure the tremor frequencies and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. mUPDRS and&#xD;
      the Rush dyskinesia rating scale (for on medication recordings) assessments will be&#xD;
      performed. Recordings will be made at rest and while the patients perform self-paced wrist&#xD;
      extension movements. The most prominent LFP frequencies in the θ, β and γ band oscillations&#xD;
      at rest and during voluntary movements in both on and off medication states (individualized&#xD;
      frequencies) as well as the electrode contact that shows the most prominent LFP oscillations&#xD;
      will be determined for each patient. This recording will take about one hour. The data&#xD;
      analysis will take one hour during which the patient will have a break.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: This will involve stimulation. The DBS leads will be connected to an external&#xD;
      stimulator and a &quot;filter DBS&quot; device to record LFP during DBS. Four DBS conditions will be&#xD;
      studied in random order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) high frequency (185 Hz), 2) the individualized γ frequency that show maximum peak at rest&#xD;
      (γ rest, determined from stage 1), 3) the individualized γ frequency that show maximum&#xD;
      increase with voluntary movements (γ movement, determined from stage 1), and 4) no&#xD;
      stimulation. The contact will be selected based on location within the STN from postoperative&#xD;
      MRI using methods published by our group and maximum changes in the θ and β bands with&#xD;
      voluntary movements (Stage 1). The selected DBS contact will be the cathode (-ve) and anode&#xD;
      (+ve) will be a surface electrode placed on the chest wall (similar to contact -ve, case +ve&#xD;
      commonly used in therapeutic DBS). Pulse width will be set at100 μs and the current will be&#xD;
      the highest (maximum 5 mA) without inducing adverse effect. LFP will be recorded from the&#xD;
      electrode contacts adjacent to the one used for DBS using a bipolar montage to allow for&#xD;
      maximum cancellation of stimulus artifacts. For example, if contact 2 is used for DBS, LFP&#xD;
      will be recorded from contacts 1 and 3. For each condition, 15 min of DBS while resting will&#xD;
      be followed by mUPDRS assessment while DBS is maintained. Patients will be video recorded to&#xD;
      allow subsequent video scoring of mUPDRS and the Rush dyskinesia rating scale by blinded&#xD;
      raters. DBS for the right and left STN will be studied in random order, with one side in the&#xD;
      morning and one side in the afternoon. Investigators have performed more complex stimulation&#xD;
      protocols in PD patients with STN DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second day of study will occur the next day. The procedure will be the same as Day 1&#xD;
      except that the medication status (on or off medication) will alternate with Day 1 in random&#xD;
      order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (TWH-V2) The purpose of this visit is to obtain early LFP recording from the Activa&#xD;
      PC+S device before DBS programming begins. This visit will be conducted within 4 weeks of&#xD;
      internalization of the DBS leads and insertion of the pulse generator (Activa PC+S), but&#xD;
      before the pulse generator is turned on for programming. The visit will be conducted over two&#xD;
      days, one day in the off medication state (overnight withdrawal) and one day in the on&#xD;
      medication state in random order as in Visit 1. The procedure is identical for Visit 1 with&#xD;
      recording of LFP at rest and during a self-paced wrist extension task, followed by testing of&#xD;
      4 different stimulation conditions. However, LFP will be recorded from the Activa PC+S device&#xD;
      using the real-time uplink mode to provide continuous recording rather than from externalized&#xD;
      leads. Since the device can only record LFP from one pair of contacts from each electrode&#xD;
      (right and left) at a time, for recordings in the resting state to examine the difference&#xD;
      between on and off medications, investigators will use the &quot;montage sweep&quot; mode that will&#xD;
      record alternately from all six possible combinations of bipolar contacts (0-1, 1-2, 2-3,&#xD;
      0-2, 0-3, 1-3) for each electrode. For the wrist extension movements, we will record from the&#xD;
      bipolar contact pair that produced the greatest change in γ oscillations with dopaminergic&#xD;
      medications and voluntary movements based on the results of Visit 1. In addition, we will&#xD;
      record from the adjacent contact pair. For example, if contact 1-2 was found to produce the&#xD;
      maximum γ peak, contacts 1-2 as well as contacts 0-1 and 2-3 will be studied. Each pair of&#xD;
      electrode contacts will be studied in separate runs. Following the LFP recording (stage 1),&#xD;
      the individual γ frequency peaks will be established. Stage 2 will study the effects of DBS&#xD;
      at high frequency, γ rest, γ movement and no stimulation assessed in random order with&#xD;
      recording of STN LFP during stimulation as in Visit 1. The same contact used for DBS in Visit&#xD;
      1 will be used with monopolar montage (contact -ve, case +ve). LFP with be recorded from the&#xD;
      adjacent contacts with bipolar montage as described in Visit 1 but the implanted Activa PC+S&#xD;
      device will be used for LFP recording&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3- 6 (TWH-V3, V4, V5 and V6) After Visit 2, DBS programming will be performed as per&#xD;
      usual clinical practice and takes about 2-4 weeks to complete. Patients will then be studied&#xD;
      at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after surgery. The assessment procedure will be identical to that&#xD;
      for Visit 2 except that the &quot;high&quot; frequency stimulation setting will be the setting normally&#xD;
      used by the patient for clinical benefit (130-185 Hz) instead of 185 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits at London Mobility Laboratory (Western University) Visit 1 will occur before surgery&#xD;
      to obtain baseline gait and kinematic measurements data in the on and off medication states.&#xD;
      For visits 2, 3 and 7, the TWH visits will occur 1-5 days before the London Mobility&#xD;
      Laboratory visits. The γ frequency stimulation to be used in the London Mobility Laboratory&#xD;
      visits will be the &quot;γ movement&quot; frequency determined from the corresponding TWH visit.&#xD;
