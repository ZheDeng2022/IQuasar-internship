      Based on published animal and human studies, ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy can be as&#xD;
      safe and as effective as any of the surgical treatments within the currently accepted&#xD;
      standard of care including radiofrequency lesioning and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). A&#xD;
      unilateral lesion of the subthalamic nucleus has shown reduction of contralateral motor&#xD;
      symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Using ExAblate Transcranial Magnetic Resonance guided&#xD;
      High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MRgHIFU) to create the subthalamotomy has several&#xD;
      potential advantages over current therapies including the fact that transcranial lesioning&#xD;
      can be performed in a precise manner with simultaneous as well as continuous clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic monitoring. If the potential of ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy can be&#xD;
      realized, it could supplant radiofrequency and radiosurgery techniques and provide a viable&#xD;
      alternative procedure for subjects considering DBS.&#xD;

      This ExAblate Transcranial system was built atop the ExAblate Body system technology, which&#xD;
      has received EMA and CE approvals for the treatment of uterine fibroids and bone metastasis&#xD;
      palliation, and is currently being evaluated under various EMA Investigational Device&#xD;
      Exemptions &quot;IDE&quot;. It should be noted that the ExAblate Transcranial/Neuro has received CE&#xD;
      approval (Dec-2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many potential advantages for applying ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy for the&#xD;
      treatment of idiopathic PD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure is transcranial, requiring no incision, no burr hole, and no electrode.&#xD;
           The risk of hemorrhagic complication should be reduced, and this procedure should&#xD;
           eliminate the risk of infectious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unlike stereotactic radiosurgery, ExAblate Transcranial system does not use ionizing&#xD;
           radiation and does not carry a risk of radiation-induced tumorigenesis. The effects are&#xD;
           immediate and not latent as with radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unlike radiofrequency ablation, ExAblate Transcranial system thermal lesioning can be&#xD;
           performed without open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ExAblate treatment can be monitored in real-time with MRI and MR-thermal feedback&#xD;
           which permits immediate confirmation of the targeting process. Additionally, the&#xD;
           treatment can be monitored with clinical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unlike DBS treatment, there is no implanted hardware, no concern of interference with&#xD;
           external sources of electromagnetic noise, no need for extensive follow-up for&#xD;
           programming, and no need for periodic battery replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ExAblate Transcranial treatments may represent a simpler treatment algorithm for a patient&#xD;
      suffering from a complicated disease process like PD. Hours of clinic time will be saved from&#xD;
      DBS device management and replacement and health care costs may be greatly reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Rational for ExAblate Transcranial System subthalamotomy for the Treatment of PD&#xD;
      Conceptually, lesioning the subthalamus seems logical since preclinical studies have&#xD;
      confirmed the role of the subthalamic nucleus in the development of parkinsonism and by the&#xD;
      fact that the experimental Parkinsonian state by MPTP can be relieved by exocytotic or&#xD;
      thermolytic lesions of the STN. Furthermore, clinical studies of deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      targeting the subthalamic nucleus have proven that this nucleus is the most effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a clinical perspective, unilateral subthalamotomy for medication-refractory Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease certainly has proven beneficial in the alleviation of contralateral off-medication&#xD;
      motor symptoms in several series. The largest and best reported experience comes from the&#xD;
      CIREN (La Habana, Cuba) where this project was initiated and directed by Prof. Jose Obeso&#xD;
      over a 10 years period leading to a large accumulated experience. This was described for 89&#xD;
      patients followed for up to 36 months. In these reports, significant improvements were noted&#xD;
      on UPDRS ratings with bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Improvements remained at two years&#xD;
      and were most pronounced for tremor. With regards to the &quot;on&quot; state, contralateral dyskinesia&#xD;
      was reduced during the two-year study and the mean dose of Levodopa was decreased by 34-47%&#xD;
      while the total on time without dyskinesia increased fourfold. In the study significant&#xD;
      reductions in part three of the off-medication UPDRS were noted at 12 (50%), 24 (30%), and 36&#xD;
      months (18%) following unilateral subthalamotomy. In the &quot;on&quot; state, contralateral dyskinesia&#xD;
      improved throughout the 3-year study period although ipsilateral dyskinesia progressively&#xD;
      worsened during this time. In a limited number of patients bilateral staged ( N-7) and&#xD;
      simultaneous ( N-11) subthalamotomy was carried out without major adverse effects and highly&#xD;
      significant motor improvement. Cognitive changes were specifically ascertained prospectively&#xD;
      without evidence of deterioration. More recently, the impact of unilateral subthalamotomy on&#xD;
      inhibitory mechanisms was also reported from the same study group. Unexpectedly, speed of&#xD;
      stopping an initiated action was improved after STN lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subthalamotomy has never been widely accepted because of concerns for hemiballismus primarily&#xD;
      due to observations in humans with stroke in the region of the subthalamus (Purdon Martin&#xD;
      1927) and by the confirmation in the 1940's by Whittier and Mettler who were able to&#xD;
      experimentally reproduce this by subthalamic lesions in primates. Arguments against such&#xD;
      dogma were amply discussed years ago leading to the understanding that the parkinsonian state&#xD;
      modifies the threshold to hemiballism after STN lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate modality permits a very precise focused lesion to be created without disruption&#xD;
      of other motor pathways or nuclei. In order to test the feasibility of using the ExAblate&#xD;
      Neuro system for the ablation of the subthalamic nucleus two patients (University of&#xD;
      Virginia) were active-sham treated using a sublethal dose of energy (50-54⁰C). The subjects&#xD;
      were observed for 30 days without developing any adverse effects like worsening involuntary&#xD;
      movements. Since there were no adverse effects of worsening involuntary movements, the actual&#xD;
      second stage treatment was then performed. Again, no adverse effects of worsening involuntary&#xD;
      movements were observed. The safety profile remains favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the rationale for choosing target temperatures of 50-54⁰C as a '&#xD;
      subtherapeutic/test' lesion was based on the experience acquired during the feasibility study&#xD;
      for Essential Tremor under IDE # G10016969 and preclinical lesioning in a swine model. In 15&#xD;
      patients with ET, the typical onset of neurologic phenomena (ie sensory symptoms) or tremor&#xD;
      suppression is observed when the peak voxel temperatures on MR thermography reached the low&#xD;
      50's ⁰C. It was observed that the tremor effect first occurs during the titrated lesioning&#xD;
      process with transient suppression of postural and rest tremor. Later at higher temperatures&#xD;
      of 55-65⁰C, the tremor effect becomes more lasting. Also T2 signal change on MRI is not&#xD;
      typically visible acutely in human thalamus until peak voxel temperatures approach this&#xD;
      55-65⁰C range. These higher temperatures resulted in thalamotomy volumes comparable to&#xD;
      traditional radiofrequency lesions where the diameter became maximal at 1 week (mean=171 mm3)&#xD;
      and measured 6.8mm in diameter. Soon by one and three months, HIFU thalamotomy volumes&#xD;
      subsided to 55 and 14 mm3, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, small lesions with reversible clinical effects would occurre by confining the first,&#xD;
      subtherapeutic/test lesion to 50-54⁰C. The therapeutic treatment goal must be to perform the&#xD;
      final, peak voxel temperatures of 55-65⁰C which will result in a substantial target ablation&#xD;
      which is analogous to the volume achieved with contemporary RF lesioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for unilateral subthalamotomy for advanced PD is summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A well-placed stereotactic lesion is similarly efficacious to DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stereotactic radiofrequency subthalamotomy has been shown to ameliorate the motor&#xD;
           features of PD .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The risk for involuntary movements like hemichorea-ballism following subthalamotomy in&#xD;
           humans is about 15% but only in the 9% of patients a second procedure (pallidotomy) was&#xD;
           needed to treat the dyskinesias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Studies of DBS in PD have consistently shown equivalent results between the stereotactic&#xD;
           targets: STN and GPi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The subthalamus is amenable to an image-guided ablation because it is small and easily&#xD;
           visualized with contemporary MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. DBS, while effective for advanced PD, has complexities for patients, their caregivers,&#xD;
           and their doctors and potentially carries a higher risk than ExAblate mediated lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Based on published animal and human studies, ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy can&#xD;
      be as safe and as effective as any of the surgical treatments within the currently accepted&#xD;
      standard of care including RF lesioning and DBS. A unilateral lesion of the subthalamic&#xD;
      nucleus has shown reduction of contralateral motor symptoms in PD. Using ExAblate&#xD;
      Transcranial MRgHIFU to create the subthalamotomy has several potential advantages over&#xD;
      current therapies including the fact that transcranial lesioning can be performed in a&#xD;
      precise manner with simultaneous as well as continuous clinical and radiographic monitoring.&#xD;
      If the potential of ExAblate Transcranial subthalamotomy can be realized, it could supplant&#xD;
      radiofrequency and radiosurgery techniques and provide a viable alternative procedure for&#xD;
      subjects considering DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include ten Parkinson's disease patients who will be treated with unilateral&#xD;
      subthalamotomy performed by MRIgHIFU and followed in an open-label fashion for up to 6 months&#xD;
      to demonstrate safety and sustained benefit.&#xD;
