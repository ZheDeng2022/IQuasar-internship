      This observational study will investigate the potential clinical utility of the Pathway Fit®&#xD;
      test by investigating whether patients who successfully lose weight (defined as losing at&#xD;
      least 5% of body weight 8 weeks after initiation) in the MOVE! or TeleMOVE! Weight Management&#xD;
      programs have a distinct nutrigenetic profile over those that were unable to lose a&#xD;
      significant amount of weight. We will use electronic records to identify all individuals who&#xD;
      have successfully completed the MOVE! program (i.e. attended the full 8 week course) or&#xD;
      TeleMOVE! program. In addition we will find age- and gender- matched individuals who attended&#xD;
      and completed the MOVE! or TeleMOVE! programs but did not lose weight. After completion of&#xD;
      the MOVE! or TeleMOVE! programs Veterans will submit a saliva sample for the Pathway Fit®&#xD;
      test. Also, blood will be collected for storage for further studies on metabolomics. The&#xD;
      start and end weight of all participants will be recorded. The nutrigenic profiles of those&#xD;
      with successful weight loss will be compared to those less successful to determine if this&#xD;
      cohort has a particular genetic profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the general US population is estimated to be&#xD;
      22-34.5% with greater prevalence in certain populations (e.g. Mexican and African Americans,&#xD;
      women). These numbers have been consistent with the rise of prevalence of obesity in the US&#xD;
      population to 34.9%, which has remained stable over the last 10 years. Veterans are&#xD;
      particularly predisposed to metabolic syndrome since the prevalence of obesity is much higher&#xD;
      among their ranks. Since the annual medical cost of those who are obese or have metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome is $1429 higher than those at a healthy weight, the impact on the cost of healthcare&#xD;
      for Veterans can be potentially tremendous. This is mainly since obesity is strongly&#xD;
      associated with many chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      some types of cancer (endometrial, postmenopausal breast, kidney, and colon), musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders, sleep apnea, and gallbladder disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to combat the obesity epidemic in Veterans, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      created the MOVE! Weight Management Program (MOVE!) in 2006. MOVE! is an evidence-based&#xD;
      weight-management program designed for patients followed in primary care clinics and who have&#xD;
      a BMI of ≥30kg/m2 or with a BMI of ≥25kg/m2 with 1 or more obesity-related conditions (e.g.&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia). The efficacy of the program is measured by the % of&#xD;
      patients who losing at least 5% of body weight at 8 weeks and 6 months after first session.&#xD;
      In addition, TeleMOVE! is a program recently initiated within the VA system to help&#xD;
      individuals who cannot make it to the VA MOVE! program due to their work schedule or distance&#xD;
      from VA clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will investigate the potential clinical utility of the Pathway Fit®&#xD;
      test by investigating whether patients who successfully lose weight (defined as losing at&#xD;
      least 5% of body weight 8 weeks after initiation) in the MOVE! or TeleMOVE! programs have a&#xD;
      distinct nutrigenetic profile over those that were unable to lose a significant amount of&#xD;
      weight. We will use electronic records to identify all individuals who have successfully&#xD;
      completed the MOVE! program (i.e. attended the full 8 week course) or TeleMOVE! program. In&#xD;
      addition we will find age- and gender- matched individuals who attended and completed the&#xD;
      MOVE! Or TeleMOVE! programs but did not lose weight. After completion of the MOVE! Or&#xD;
      TeleMOVE! programs Veterans will submit a saliva sample for the Pathway Fit® test. The start&#xD;
      and end weight of all participants will be recorded. The nutrigenic profiles of those with&#xD;
      successful weight loss will be compared to those less successful to determine if this cohort&#xD;
      has a particular genetic profile. Also, blood will be collected for storage for further&#xD;
      studies on metabolomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To encourage participation, participants will be reimbursed for their participation in the&#xD;
      study and the Pathway Fit® test results will be provided to all. Comparisons on all pertinent&#xD;
      measures will be made between those achieving at least 5% weight loss and those that did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, the clinical utility of the Pathway Fit® test can be further&#xD;
      investigated to determine if the successful nutrigenic profile can predict clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of the participants in the MOVE! program or other lifestyle management programs.&#xD;
