  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced diarrhea is seen in up to 40-80% of patients receiving this treatment&#xD;
      for HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This diarrhea can&#xD;
      significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to tolerate chemo/anti-HER2&#xD;
      therapy. This study will look at the efficacy of the drug crofelemer in preventing diarrhea&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various anti-diarrheal agents, such as loperamide, codeine, octreotide, are available for&#xD;
      diarrhea management, but few are used in the prophylactic setting and none provide a targeted&#xD;
      approach for treating chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies have suggested that blocking EGFR results in excess chloride secretion&#xD;
      and thus diarrhea. Crofelemer is an extract from the blood red bark of Croton lechleri that&#xD;
      inhibits luminal chloride efflux by blocking the calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC)&#xD;
      and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) chloride channels. Due to its size and&#xD;
      polarity, it acts only luminally and is not systemically absorbed. It is currently FDA&#xD;
      approved for use in preventing diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients on anti-retroviral therapy.&#xD;
