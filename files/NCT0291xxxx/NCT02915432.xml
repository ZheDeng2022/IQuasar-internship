      The purpose of this study is to preliminarily evaluate anti-tumor activity of a Recombinant&#xD;
      Humanized Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody for Infusion (JS001) in treating advanced gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma and to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)&#xD;

      Overall Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase Ib/II clinical study of Toripalimab Injection&#xD;
      (JS001) in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (ESCC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). On&#xD;
      the basis of the results of safety and pharmacokinetic data in the phase I study of JS001, 3&#xD;
      mg/kg is determined as the recommended dose of the 2-week monotherapy regimen, and no study&#xD;
      on the 10 mg/kg cohorts will be conducted any more. And the corresponding 240 mg and 360 mg&#xD;
      are determined as the corresponding exploratory doses of the 3-week combined treatment&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria: subjects&#xD;
      with gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or&#xD;
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (cohort 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively) will receive&#xD;
      treatment at the dose of 3 mg/kg. While subjects with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (cohort 5, 6, 7, 8, respectively), who have not received any treatment before, will&#xD;
      be treated with the corresponding 3-week regimen of standard first-line chemotherapy combined&#xD;
      with JS001 240 mg or 360 mg .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study on the 3 mg/kg cohorts is planned to be conducted first in cohort 1, 2, 3, 4 in&#xD;
      this trial. After enrollment, the subjects will receive study treatment once every 2 weeks&#xD;
      (Q2W) with 4 weeks as a cycle, until absence of further benefits judged by the investigator,&#xD;
      disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, investigator's decision, withdrawal&#xD;
      of informed consent by the subject, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of cohort 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be carried out in the sites designated by the&#xD;
      sponsor. Subjects will receive corresponding regimen of standard first-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      combined with JS001 240 mg or 360 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) (see Section 3.1 Overall Design&#xD;
      for details). JS001 240 mg or 360 mg Q3W can be administrated after the end of chemotherapy&#xD;
      until absence of further benefits judged by the investigator, disease progression, occurrence&#xD;
      of intolerable toxicity, investigator's decision, and withdrawal of informed consent by the&#xD;
      subject, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject experiences disease progression but the subject can still obtain clinical&#xD;
      benefit from the study treatment of JS001 according to the investigator, the subject can&#xD;
      continue the study treatment if an approval is obtained after discussion between the&#xD;
      investigator and the medical monitor from the sponsor or the authorized CRO. If the subject&#xD;
      develops disease progression for a second time, he/she should permanently withdraw from the&#xD;
      study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, for cohort 1, 2, 3, and 4, tumor responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks&#xD;
      in the first year according to RECIST 1.1, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumor responses&#xD;
      will also be evaluated according to irRECIST at the same frequency with that conducted&#xD;
      according to RECIST 1.1 until disease progression, death or loss of follow up (whichever&#xD;
      comes first). For cohort 5, 6, 7, and 8, tumor responses will be evaluated every 6 weeks (± 3&#xD;
      days) in the first year according to RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST, and every 12 weeks thereafter&#xD;
      until disease progression, death or loss of follow up (whichever comes first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiographic data of the subjects will be collected for review by IRC. The IRC will&#xD;
      evaluate the corresponding study endpoints based on tumor responses, but no such evaluation&#xD;
      is planned for cohort 5, 6, 7 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 10 of the subjects (no requirements on indications) in JS001 3 mg/kg cohorts at the&#xD;
      sponsor-designated study sites should complete the pharmacokinetic blood sampling in the&#xD;
      first 3 cycles of study treatment until 60 days after the end of study treatment. If a&#xD;
      subject did not complete the scheduled sample collection in the first 3 cycles of study&#xD;
      treatment due to any reason, another subject should be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corresponding pharmacokinetic blood samplings will also be conducted for cohort 5, 6, 7, and&#xD;
      8, to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of JS001 used in the combined treatment&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. At least 3 patients will be selected for blood sampling in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of Tumor Tissue Specimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma (including&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma at esophageal-gastric conjunction), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma must provide acceptable tumor tissue specimens (fresh tumor tissue&#xD;
      specimens for biopsy before enrollment are preferred) prior to enrollment for future use in&#xD;
      subsequent exploratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any subject with the response confirmed as partial response (PR) and/or progressive disease&#xD;
      (PD) is encouraged to voluntarily participate in the selectable biomarkers study if tumor&#xD;
      tissues can be obtained from him/her. And in the selectable biomarkers study, they will&#xD;
      provide tumor tissues for exploratory study on the correlation between tumor markers and the&#xD;
      level of anti-tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the tumor tissue specimens provided will be sent to the designated central laboratory for&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is ORR. The study will be completed at 12 months after the&#xD;
      last patient in and data analysis will be conducted then. If by that time there are still&#xD;
      some subjects receiving study treatment, these subjects will be transferred to an extension&#xD;
      study to continue the study treatment until absence of further benefits judged by&#xD;
      investigator, disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, investigator's&#xD;
      decision, withdrawal of informed consent by subject, or death.&#xD;
