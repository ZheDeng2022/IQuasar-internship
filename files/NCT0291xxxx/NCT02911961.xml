  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide preliminary data to describe serum&#xD;
      acetaminophen-cysteine protein adduct (APAP-CYS) concentrations following therapeutic doses&#xD;
      of acetaminophen in the setting of non-acetaminophen induced liver injury. This study will&#xD;
      utilize hepatic embolization as a model of hepatic injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen-cysteine protein adducts (APAP-CYS) are formed when acetaminophen is oxidized&#xD;
      by CYP 2E-1. When hepatocytes die, these proteins are released into the serum and can be&#xD;
      detected. APAP-CYS can therefore be an experimental biomarker of acetaminophen exposure. It&#xD;
      is possible that massive necrosis of hepatocytes that contain APAP-CYS from therapeutic doses&#xD;
      of acetaminophen can be misinterpreted as acetaminophen overdose as the cause of liver&#xD;
      injury. This study aims to describe serum APAP-CYS concentrations in patients taking a&#xD;
      therapeutic dose of acetaminophen who develop a liver injury from a cause other than&#xD;
      acetaminophen. This study will seek to enroll subjects undergoing a hepatic embolization&#xD;
      procedure to treat a secondary liver tumor. This procedure is a reproducible model of&#xD;
      non-acetaminophen induced hepatic injury. A small number of subjects who are otherwise&#xD;
      eligible to participate but are unwilling to take acetaminophen will be offered participation&#xD;
      in the observational arm of the study. They will undergo the same assessments with the&#xD;
      exception of acetaminophen dosing. Subjects willing to take acetaminophen will be asked to&#xD;
      take extra strength acetaminophen (4g/day) for the 3 days prior to their embolization&#xD;
      procedure. All subjects will be asked to keep a detailed medication diary for the three days&#xD;
      prior and up to their embolization procedure. Blood samples for the measurement of APAP-CYS&#xD;
      concentrations and markers of liver function will be collected prior to acetaminophen dosing,&#xD;
      prior to the embolization procedure, and at several time points after the procedure.&#xD;
