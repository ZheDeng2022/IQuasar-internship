      This study will examine the benefits of a monitored physical activity program for&#xD;
      participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) using a wearable&#xD;
      activity device (e.g.fitbit). The goals of this pilot study are to examine 1) whether an&#xD;
      incentive is better than no incentive in maintaining an increased level of physical activity&#xD;
      and 2) the benefits of physical activity on patient reported disease activity in inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are chronic, systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      disorders affecting 1-2% of the US population. Ongoing chronic inflammation and lack of&#xD;
      exercise due to arthritis are each associated with pain, fatigue, depression, muscle loss,&#xD;
      obesity, and development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, all&#xD;
      of which impact physical functioning and quality of life. Increases in physical activity can&#xD;
      significantly impact each one of these outcomes and are likely to positively impact a&#xD;
      patients experience of their disease. This study will examine the benefits of a monitored&#xD;
      physical activity program. This study will use a wearable activity device (e.g. fitbit) to&#xD;
      monitor step counts and will incentivize one group to achieve higher step counts than the&#xD;
      control group. The primary goal of this pilot study will be to determine whether one&#xD;
      incentive (loss aversion) is better than no incentive in increasing step counts and&#xD;
      maintaining an increased level of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcomes of interest are patient reported disease activity (using the RAPID3&#xD;
      patient reported outcome) and physician measured disease activity, quality of life&#xD;
      assessments and weight loss.&#xD;
