      To evaluate the efficacy of choral singing in the prevention of dementia and examine the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique and a panel of&#xD;
      peripheral biomarkers in venous blood and urine. The investigators hypothesize that Choral&#xD;
      singing could prevent cognitive decline among community-dwelling elderly who are at high risk&#xD;
      of dementia. The underlying neural mechanisms involve the changes in brain structure and&#xD;
      function that can be quantified using MRI technique. The changes in cognitive outcomes will&#xD;
      be accompanied by observable changes from a panel of carefully selected peripheral&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive function declines with advancing age and the prevalence and incidence of dementia&#xD;
      rises dramatically in later life. Impaired cognitive function limits one's ability to work,&#xD;
      live and socialize, and represent a major obstacle for active aging. Data from Asian&#xD;
      countries showed a clear role of cognitive function in contributing to functional disability&#xD;
      independent of physical health. How to maintain good cognitive health in the later stage of&#xD;
      life is an important and challenging question that requires well-founded research with good&#xD;
      applicability. With no cure for dementia in sight presently, it is vitally important to find&#xD;
      effective preventive measures. Candidates and potential avenues for intervention should be&#xD;
      carefully evaluated in well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT). Here the&#xD;
      investigators propose choral singing as a novel approach for the prevention of cognitive&#xD;
      decline and dementia; the investigators plan to test the hypothesized efficacy in a RCT based&#xD;
      on a selected group of senior Singaporeans from the Jurong Area. This proposed research is&#xD;
      built on a growing body of research evidence on the role of choral singing in health&#xD;
      promotion and psychological wellbeing; and the fact that no trial has tested the potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of choral singing in delaying cognitive decline and the onset of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasticity of the brain forms the scientific basis for the potential efficacy of choral&#xD;
      singing in preventing cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia. It is well known that&#xD;
      participating in various cognitive, social and productive activities is associated with&#xD;
      improved cognitive function and lower risk of dementia. The protective effects on cognition&#xD;
      may be particularly effective for certain subgroups. For example, analysis of local data&#xD;
      showed that among the single and widowed elderly, an increase in social engagement was&#xD;
      associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment: compared with subjects in the lowest&#xD;
      tertile of social engagement scores, the adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) of cognitive impairment was&#xD;
      0.50 for subjects in the second or the third tertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from previous clinical trials support that cognitive training is effective in improving&#xD;
      cognitive function or delaying cognitive decline in the elderly. Functional gains from&#xD;
      cognitive training have been reported to last up to five years, with a meta-analysis&#xD;
      demonstrating that the protective effects of cognitive training on cognition in healthy&#xD;
      elderly can persist years after training. In Singapore, a brain-computer interface based&#xD;
      cognitive training system showed promise in improving memory and attention in healthy&#xD;
      elderly. Specifically, the training led to significant improvement in immediate memory (p =&#xD;
      0.038), visuospatial/constructional (p = 0.014), attention (p = 0.039), and delayed memory&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.001) scores. However, cognitive training based on human trainer or brain-computer&#xD;
      interface are expensive and hence the applicability as a preventive in real world setting for&#xD;
      the general population is largely limited. Participants of such trainings also may not be&#xD;
      able to maintain lasting interest and motivation. Given those considerations, relatively&#xD;
      cost-effective and captivating methods are urgently needed and we believe choral singing is a&#xD;
      promising candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Singapore, there are more than 200 school choirs. Most universities and tertiary education&#xD;
      institutions have choirs developed as an expressive art form. Furthermore, there are numerous&#xD;
      church choirs who sing with spiritual passion, and the professional choruses who are selected&#xD;
      to sing and to perform. The existing resource can be tapped on in the future for large scale&#xD;
      interventional initiative once solid data of its efficacy are produced from rigorously&#xD;
      designed clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this collaborative research project that involves experts from multiple disciplines, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial to examine the clinical efficacy&#xD;
      of choral singing in the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia. As a cognitive&#xD;
      stimulating activity, choral singing involves cognitive processes such as attention, memory,&#xD;
      executive function and language. As a social activity, choral singing consists of group&#xD;
      interactions which cultivate the feeling of being part of a meaningful community. Prior&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that situations and activities involving synchrony with others&#xD;
      induces feelings of closeness and affiliation, and bolsters coordination with synchronization&#xD;
      partners. Increased prosociality and conformity produced by synchrony may also be applied to&#xD;
      other people more generally, even those who were not synchronization partners. Moreover,&#xD;
      synchrony and affiliative orientations also share a bi-directional relationship, such that&#xD;
      individuals who are more prone to prosocial tendencies are more likely to synchronize with&#xD;
      others. As a physical exercise, choral singing requires the involvement of more than 100&#xD;
      muscles; it helps to improve lung function and circulation, promotes superior posture, and&#xD;
      boost balance and resistance. Choral singing also requires the choristers to cooperate with&#xD;
      each other, the discipline of listening to blend with fellow singers and need persistently&#xD;
      hard work to stay on par with the level of other singers. All the above may contribute to&#xD;
      long term cognitive benefits of choral singing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although theoretically plausible, the effectiveness of choral singing in preventing cognitive&#xD;
      decline and dementia has not been studied scientifically. This proposed study will fill an&#xD;
      important knowledge gap. The investigators aim to produce firm data on two year efficacy of&#xD;
      choral singing in preventing cognitive decline and this will form the evidence base for&#xD;
      further research and future interventional initiative.&#xD;
