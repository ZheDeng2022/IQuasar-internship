  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mē Mini is a compact version of the Mē device that was cleared by the FDA for removal of&#xD;
      unwanted hair and for permanent hair reduction for all skin colors (Fitzpatrick skin&#xD;
      photo-types I-VI) based on a series of multi-site clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this post-marketing study is to support the claims for removal of unwanted&#xD;
      hair and for permanent hair reduction in the compact version of the device.&#xD;

      The purpose of this post-marketing study is to determine the efficacy of the mē mini hair&#xD;
      removal device and to compare the extent of hair removal with and without maintenance&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy females, with dark hair in the treatment areas that desire to remove their hair will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Subjects will be provided with the device and will be instructed as to the&#xD;
      method of usage. The subjects will be expected to self-administer the treatment at the clinic&#xD;
      in a &quot;simulated home environment&quot;. Subjects will receive 7 &quot;basic treatments&quot; in weekly&#xD;
      intervals and 3 additional maintenance treatments on 1 side in 1 month intervals&#xD;
      (&quot;Maintenance&quot; vs &quot;No maintenance&quot; side). In the second phase of the study subjects that&#xD;
      consented to and completed the first phase will be offered the option to continue with 9&#xD;
      additional maintenance treatments in 1 month intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow ups will be conducted at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last basic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will include hair clearance, skin safety, tolerability of the procedure, and&#xD;
      subject, satisfaction.&#xD;
