  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      integrating targeted dosing of intranasal oxytocin with a social cognitive skills group&#xD;
      therapy for school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a proof-of-concept, combination intervention designed to address individual&#xD;
      treatment targets presumed to influence social learning in school-aged children with autism&#xD;
      spectrum disorder (ASD). This proposal builds upon prior research on an empirically supported&#xD;
      social cognitive skills training curriculum, NETT (Nonverbal communication, Emotion&#xD;
      recognition, and Theory of mind Training). NETT is a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI)&#xD;
      for nonverbal communication, emotion recognition, and theory of mind deficits in youth with&#xD;
      ASD. In this two-phase, 3 year, single-blind, contact controlled study, school-aged children&#xD;
      with ASD (n=60) will be randomized into a 12-session, parallel group design of Integrated&#xD;
      Oxytocin and NETT (ION) or a control social group condition (facilitated play). The study&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of integrating the neuropeptide,&#xD;
      oxytocin (OT), with the social cognitive curriculum, as well as to identify targets of change&#xD;
      and pre-treatment factors predictive of response to ION-ASD. Maintenance of treatment effects&#xD;
      will also be assessed 1 month and 3 months post-treatment.&#xD;

    <description>This is an integrated pharmacological-behavioral intervention targeting social cognitive skills for school-aged children with ASD. Four doses of intranasal oxytocin (24 IUs/dose) will be delivered each week before weekly homework and group therapy sessions. Social cognitive skills training utilize cognitive behavioral strategies such as problem identification, affective education, performance feedback, and weekly homework activities to target impairments in nonverbal synchrony, emotional expression, and interpretation of intent. The NETT curriculum is manualized and anchored in CBI strategies, such as problem identification, affective education, performance feedback, and weekly homework activities. Parent education sessions run concurrently with child groups to help facilitate generalization.</description>

    <description>The facilitated play therapy group is a manualized treatment designed to tailor play to the interests and abilities of group members. Therapists use general therapeutics strategies such as reflective functioning statements to foster communication with therapists as well as between peers. Standard educational practices for children with ASD such as visual supports, schedules, and short-directed statements are also used. The concurrent parent group is supportive in nature.</description>
