  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are conducting a clinical trial to compare two different treatment schedules&#xD;
      for women who need radiation therapy to their lymph nodes as part of their breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either a traditional radiation&#xD;
      therapy schedule, which takes approximately 6 weeks to complete, or to an innovative, newer&#xD;
      radiation therapy schedule, which takes approximately 4 weeks to complete. The available&#xD;
      evidence suggests that both the traditional and the newer radiation schedules are highly&#xD;
      effective for preventing recurrence. The main purpose of the trial is to see if the newer&#xD;
      radiation treatment schedule will lower the risk of developing arm swelling, also known as&#xD;
      lymphedema, after radiation treatment. We will also be studying the impact of the innovative,&#xD;
      shorter, treatment on patient-reported arm function and quality of life.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the risk of developing lymphedema, defined as a 10% difference in volume&#xD;
      between the affected and unaffected arm, within 24 months of regional nodal irradiation (RNI)&#xD;
      between patients assigned to short versus standard RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the maximum standardized difference in arm volume between the affected arm and&#xD;
      the unaffected arm within 24 months after completion of RNI between the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare maximal acute (within 6 weeks of treatment) and late (more than 6 weeks after&#xD;
      treatment) skin and soft tissue toxicities using the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version (v)4.0 scale between patients&#xD;
      assigned to short versus standard RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare patient-reported arm and shoulder function for the two treatment arms using&#xD;
      the 9-item Disabilities Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare patient quality of life for the two treatment arms using EQ-5D-3L and the&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue SF 6a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the peripheral blood cytokine profile at the end of radiation between patients&#xD;
      assigned to short versus standard RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the effect of the peripheral blood cytokine profile at the end of radiation&#xD;
      on developing lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate the effect of homocysteine levels prior to radiation on developing&#xD;
      lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate time to locoregional recurrence, time to distant metastasis, disease-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival for patients assigned to short versus standard RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To evaluate the effect of lipid profiles prior to radiation on the time to locoregional&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To evaluate if deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair capacity contributes to the presence of&#xD;
      acute radiation related toxicity and patient-reported quality of life decrements including&#xD;
      fatigue and arm and shoulder symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To evaluate changes in echocardiography global longitudinal strain measurements and&#xD;
      cardiac serum biomarkers, based on measurements performed before and after radiation therapy&#xD;
      (RT), in patients assigned to short versus standard RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. In a separate cohort of 30 patients who will receive RNI before surgery, to collect&#xD;
      information on number of patients developing lymphedema within 24 months of RNI on&#xD;
      reconstructive complications, and on patient reported quality of life, in those assigned to&#xD;
      short versus standard RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo hypofractionated RNI in 15 fractions 5 consecutive days a week for 3&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo standard RNI in 25 fractions 5 consecutive days a week for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients undergo additional boost dose of radiation therapy in 5 or 7 fractions&#xD;
      on consecutive days following completion of RNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT EVALUATION: Patients participating in the trial will have their arm measured prior to&#xD;
      radiation, during the final week of radiation and when they return for follow up visits.&#xD;
      Patients will be checked for any arm swelling that may develop. Patients will also fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires before treatment and when they return for follow up visits. Patients return 3&#xD;
      and 6 months after radiation, then every 6 months through two and a half years after&#xD;
      radiation and then on a yearly basis until ten and a half years after finishing radiation. At&#xD;
      some of the follow up visits, we measure arm volume and ask participants to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
