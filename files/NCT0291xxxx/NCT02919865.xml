  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is an important adjunct in the treatment of patients with glioma, although&#xD;
      a common side effect is radiation-induced injury of brain parenchyma. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      conventional MRI is not accurate in differentiating radiation-induced brain injury from&#xD;
      recurrent tumour, both of which may demonstrate progressive contrast enhancement. Recent&#xD;
      studies have suggested that perfusion MRI could improve this differentiation. Perfusion MRI&#xD;
      can be performed with an injection of exogenous contrast using dynamic contrast enhancement&#xD;
      (DCE) or dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC). Perfusion MRI can also be&#xD;
      performed without contrast injection using arterial spin labeling (ASL) or intravoxel&#xD;
      incoherent motion (IVIM). DCE-MRI relies on accurate measurement of T1 values in order to&#xD;
      convert the MRI signal intensity to contrast concentration. Dynamic susceptibility-weighted&#xD;
      contrast enhancement (DSC) perfusion is the most common technique used in clinical practice&#xD;
      but measurement of tumor relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) can be biased by extravascular&#xD;
      contrast leakage and susceptibility-weighted artifacts. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the accuracy of perfusion MR imaging using non-contrast and contrast-based&#xD;
      techniques in differentiating recurrent tumour from radiation-induced brain injury in&#xD;
      patients with known high grade glioma. The investigators will compare the accuracy of IVIM,&#xD;
      ASL, DCE and DSC techniques. A secondary goal of the study is to compare two new different T1&#xD;
      mapping methods used for DCE-MRI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of different MR perfusion&#xD;
      methods in differentiating recurrent tumour from radiation-induced brain injury in patients&#xD;
      with high grade gliomas. The investigators will evaluate perfusion methods which do not use&#xD;
      an exogenous agent (ASL, IVIM) and methods which use gadolinium as a contrast agent (DSC-MRI,&#xD;
      DCE-MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal of the study is to compare two new different T1 mapping methods used for&#xD;
      DCE-MRI. The first T1 mapping method uses a Lock-Locker inversion-recovery acquisition&#xD;
      (MOLLI) that measures apparent T1 (T1*). The second T1 mapping method uses a single-point,&#xD;
      saturation-recovery acquisition that measures true T1 SMART1Map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective study which will involve 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have received chemoradiation for high grade gliomas and who subsequently&#xD;
      developed progressive enhancing lesions on follow-up MR will be asked to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Informed consent by the patient or a legal guardian or authorized representative of&#xD;
      the patient will be obtained before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrollment, MR perfusion imaging (ASL, IVIM, DSC and DCE perfusion sequences) will&#xD;
      be performed in addition to the routine neuronavigational sequence obtained fror&#xD;
      re-operative/ therapy planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this MR examination, the patient may undergo a surgical biopsy or excision as&#xD;
      determined clinically by the neurosurgeon. The location of the biopsy will be saved&#xD;
      intraoperatively which will allow colocalization of histopathology with imaging data.&#xD;
      Histopathological analysis will be performed by the neuropathologist, yielding a visual&#xD;
      quantitative estimate of percent viable tumour and radiation necrosis within the obtained&#xD;
      specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, including those who do not go to surgery, will undergo clinical followup and&#xD;
      imaging follow-up with perfusion imaging. This will allow for assessment of lesion&#xD;
      progression over time, yielding valuable diagnostic information in differentiating radiation&#xD;
      necrosis from tumour recurrence, particularly in those patients who did not undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a routine clinical MR examination, patients with a new lesion or an enlarging&#xD;
      lesion will be seen by the radiation oncologist or neurosurgeon. They will be recruited by a&#xD;
      research nurse who will ask if they are willing to participate in the research study. If the&#xD;
      patient agrees to participate, the investigators will add perfusion sequences in addition to&#xD;
      the clinical MR exam for treatment planning (stereotactic radiation or reresection). The MR&#xD;
      exam performed for clinical and research purposes will last less than 45 minutes. Following&#xD;
      surgery, the investigators will correlate pathological findings with perfusion and diffusion&#xD;
      parameters. If the patient does not undergo surgery, we will use clinical examination and&#xD;
      serial MRIs (including perfusion imaging) to determine if the index lesion is more likely to&#xD;
      represent radiation necrosis or tumor progression. The investigators will follow the patient&#xD;
      clinically for 2 years after the time of progression to determine overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with high grade gliomas are followed routinely with serial MRIs. The patients with&#xD;
      progressive enlarging lesions will be seen by the treating oncologist or neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will electronically put in a request for another MR exam which is needed clinically for&#xD;
      surgical planning and/or follow-up with advanced MR imaging as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient comes to radiology for their exam, they will be asked to participate in the&#xD;
      study by the radiologist and/or the research nurse (if this breaches patient confidentiality,&#xD;
      we can put the radiologist as the person getting consent since he is involved in patient&#xD;
      care). If the patient agrees to participate, the study will be performed according to the&#xD;
      study MR protocol. If not, a standard MRI as per routine clinical practice will be performed.&#xD;
      The investigators do not intend to recruit patients who are unable to give consent themselves&#xD;
      since patients have to have a good Karnofsky score as an inclusion criteria in this study.&#xD;
