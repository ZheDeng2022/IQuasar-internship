  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fixed orthodontic braces are routinely used to straighten teeth and correct the bite of&#xD;
      individuals. Once the braces are fit, the patient is recalled every few weeks to adjust or&#xD;
      tighten the brace. Although convention states that the patient returns every 6-8 weeks to&#xD;
      have the brace adjusted, there is no consensus or evidence to support a specific timeframe.&#xD;
      Indeed some orthodontist see their patients as frequently as every 4 weeks and others as long&#xD;
      as every 10 weeks. The aim of this investigation is to determine whether the amount of time&#xD;
      between brace adjustment appointments has an effect on the overall treatment time. Knowing&#xD;
      which appointment interval will lead to the shortest overall treatment time will be of&#xD;
      benefit to patients as prolonged orthodontic treatment may be associated with an increased&#xD;
      incidence of adverse effects associated with orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are to be treated with fixed orthodontic braces at will be invited to take part&#xD;
      in the study. Consenting subjects will be randomly allocated into one of four groups. The&#xD;
      first will be seen to adjust their brace every 4 weeks, the second group every 6 weeks, the&#xD;
      third group every 8 weeks and the fourth group every 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the total treatment time. The mean treatment time of each of&#xD;
      the four groups will be compared to establish whether or not treatment appointment intervals&#xD;
      affects treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include difference in number of appointments required&#xD;
      throughout the course of treatment between groups, differences in treatment outcomes,&#xD;
      differences in patient compliance.&#xD;

      Patients at Grosvenor House Orthodontic Practice who are to be treated with fixed orthodontic&#xD;
      appliances and fulfil the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented, patients will be randomly allocated to one of four groups, each group&#xD;
      specifying a different amount of time between appointments following brace fitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject has had their fixed orthodontic appliance fit, they will be offered&#xD;
      appointments every 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks or 10 weeks to adjust there brace, depending on&#xD;
      which group they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have both arches bonded simultaneously in a standardized way using 3M&#xD;
      Unitek pre-coated Gemini brackets with MBT prescription. The initial archwire will be 0.014&#xD;
      nickel titanium ligated using standard elastomeric ligation. Patients will then progress to&#xD;
      0.018 nickel titanium followed by 0.019x0.025 heat activated nickel titanium followed by&#xD;
      0.019x0.025 stainless steel. Round stainless steel archwires will be permitted if indicated&#xD;
      for finishing or as a lower working archwire in Class III patients but the original archwire&#xD;
      sequence will be adhered to wherever possible. Progression to the next archwire will only&#xD;
      occur once each archwire becomes passive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Space closure of extraction spaces where indicated will be done with E-Links (TP&#xD;
      Orthodontics, Inc.) running from the hook on the molar tube to a hook crimped onto the&#xD;
      archwire between the lateral incisor and canine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fail to attend or cancel appointments will be offered another appointment within&#xD;
      1 week of the original appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the orthodontic treatment is complete to the satisfaction of the patient and&#xD;
      orthodontist, the brace will be removed. The time in days from brace fit to brace removal&#xD;
      will be noted and a total treatment time will be recorded for each subject. A comparison will&#xD;
      be made on the total treatment time between the four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A basic oral hygiene examination will be done at each appointment. The data will be analysed&#xD;
      following treatment to determine whether appointment frequency has an impact on oral hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A record will also be made of the number of appointments missed or cancelled and a comparison&#xD;
      between groups will be made during the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment outcomes will be determined using the PAR (peer assessment rating) system which&#xD;
      assesses certain features of the occlusion from pre treatment and post treatment plaster&#xD;
      models, quantifying the level of improvement brought about by treatment. The outcome of&#xD;
      treatment, as measured by PAR, will be compared between groups.&#xD;
