      This is a retrospective, observational study which will utilise the Edinburgh Cancer Research&#xD;
      Centre's Tissue Bank to provide samples for IENFD testing in those who have undergone&#xD;
      mastectomy surgery for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators shall identify all those patients in the Tissue Bank database who have&#xD;
      undergone mastectomy surgery for breast cancer. The investigators shall consult the patient's&#xD;
      electronic health record, and general practitioner if required, to ascertain whether the&#xD;
      patient has died, been diagnosed with cognitive impairment or a psychotic disorder, or&#xD;
      receiving ongoing oncological treatment which would exclude them from the study. The&#xD;
      investigators shall also exclude all those patients who received surgery within the last year&#xD;
      as we intend to elucidate the presence of pain in the immediate post-operartive period up to&#xD;
      12 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having identified these patients the investigators shall contact them via post with a pack&#xD;
      containing an information document, a consent form and questionnaires. As this is an&#xD;
      observational study we shall contact all of the identified patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria with the aim of recruiting as many as possible. The investigators would anticipate a&#xD;
      high response rate as has been the experience with previous questionnaire studies of breast&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a signed consent form has been returned the patient's tissue sample would undergo IENFD&#xD;
      testing. Their questionnaire responses will allow participants to be split into two groups&#xD;
      based upon whether they experience CPSP or not. Blinding of this grouping will take place so&#xD;
      that those undertaking the IENFD testing are unaware of the patient's questionnaire&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the two group's IEFD results and questionnaire responses will then be&#xD;
      undertaken with the null hypothesis that the pre-operative IENFD at the site of surgery does&#xD;
      not predict or correlate with CPSP.&#xD;

      Study Design This study will use pre-existing skin samples stored in the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) / SAHSC BioResource (collected from 2006-2012)&#xD;
      from patients who have undergone breast cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators shall firstly identify all samples in the Tissue Bank database that were&#xD;
      taken from those undergoing breast cancer surgery. Before any patient details are provided&#xD;
      the investigators will confirm that the patient has initialled the following section of the&#xD;
      consent form they completed at the time of their surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;I agree to my name and details being made available to other ECMC researchers who might&#xD;
      approach me to invite participation in other research projects. These might include studies&#xD;
      of new treatments or techniques, clinical or genetic studies of the causes of cancer or&#xD;
      cancer outcomes. I understand that that this permission does not commit me to participate in&#xD;
      such studies and I will be able to decide whether I wish to be involved once I have reviewed&#xD;
      any information sheet and consent form.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once this has been confirmed, the investigators shall consult the patient's electronic health&#xD;
      record to ascertain whether anything would exclude them from the study such as death, a new&#xD;
      diagnosis of cognitive impairment or a psychotic disorder, or receiving current oncological&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an exploratory study the investigators shall contact all of the identified&#xD;
      patients who meet the inclusion criteria with the aim of recruiting as many as possible. The&#xD;
      investigators would anticipate a high response rate, as has been the experience with previous&#xD;
      questionnaire studies involving breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will contact the identified patients via post with a pack containing a&#xD;
      cover letter from the principal investigator of the original clinical team, an information&#xD;
      document, a consent form and questionnaires. The information document will include contact&#xD;
      details of the principal investigator and research team to allow patients to discuss the&#xD;
      study, ask questions that they have, or ask for assistance from the research team in any&#xD;
      aspect of completing the documentation. The questionnaires are the only requirement of&#xD;
      participants to complete for the study and should take less than 30 minutes to do so. The&#xD;
      questionnaires include the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS), the EQ-5D, the Brief&#xD;
      Pain Inventory (BPI), the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 and the Short Leeds&#xD;
      Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) which are all commonly used scoring&#xD;
      tools for chronic pain. There is no need for a hospital visit, physical examination,or blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 4-6 weeks, if no response is received from an individual patient we would send a second&#xD;
      letter to ensure that the initial pack had been received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a signed consent form and questionnaires have been returned, a paper Case Report Form&#xD;
      (CRF) will be created with a unique study number which will be added to the questionnaires as&#xD;
      the only identifying information. The unique number currently given to the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) / SAHSC BioResource samples held for the patient&#xD;
      will also be added to the CRF. In this way, both those carrying out the laboratory work and&#xD;
      the questionnaire data entry will only be provided with an identifying number and be blinded&#xD;
      since they have no access to the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edinburgh Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC) / SAHSC BioResource samples shall be&#xD;
      serially cut with a microtome to produce 8 micron thick sections with three sections per&#xD;
      sample created to ensure consistency. The sections shall then be stained with neurofilament&#xD;
      and anti-protein gene product (anti-PGP) 9.5 and examined under bright field microscopy. An&#xD;
      image of the section shall be captured and analysed by the same individual using Image J&#xD;
      software to calculate the IENFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all samples have been analysed the CRF would be used to place the IENFD results into two&#xD;
      groups based upon their questionnaire responses. These two groups would be those with and&#xD;
      those without CPSP symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the two group's IEFD results and questionnaire responses will then be&#xD;
      undertaken with the null hypothesis that the pre-operative IENFD at the site of surgery does&#xD;
      not predict or correlate with CPSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centres Recruitment of all patients will take place from the Edinburgh Cancer Research&#xD;
      Centre (ECRC) at the Western General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timelines and Consent The investigators would expect that reading the cover letter and&#xD;
      information pack, signing the consent form, and completing the questionnaires will take&#xD;
      between 20 and 30 minutes. The investigators aim to recruit patients over a 3 - 6 month&#xD;
      period before moving on to performing IENFD testing over the next 6 - 9 months. A further 3 -&#xD;
      6 months will be required to analyse and present our results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients have already consented for their tissue sample to be used in future research.&#xD;
      Consent will be sought for the patient to complete the questionnaires which are essential to&#xD;
      the study in order to identify those who have developed CPSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no ongoing intervention or follow-up for the patients themselves after they consent&#xD;
      to inclusion in the study. However, if in completing the questionnaire they become aware of&#xD;
      suffering from CPSP we provide details of how to be referred to a pain specialist if they&#xD;
      feel it would be of benefit. To facilitate this we would contact their general practitioner&#xD;
      with details of how to refer a patient such as via the SCI Gateway Advice Service or Lothian&#xD;
      Chronic Pain Service Email Advice Service.&#xD;
