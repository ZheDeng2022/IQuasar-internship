    <textblock>
      This research will help us to learn if the medicine called metformin reduces the risk of&#xD;
      death, heart attacks, and/or strokes in patients who have pre-diabetes and heart or blood&#xD;
      vessel problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and after consultation with the appropriate&#xD;
      research oversight, regulatory and monitoring entities, screening and enrollment has been&#xD;
      placed on temporary administrative hold as of 3/17/2020. When such trial activities resume,&#xD;
      the clinicaltrials.gov record will be updated accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSP #2002 is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, secondary prevention trial&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that treatment with metformin, compared with placebo, reduces&#xD;
      mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with pre-diabetes and established&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Qualifying patients have pre-diabetes defined by&#xD;
      HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and/or oral glucose tolerance test criteria; clinically evident&#xD;
      coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterial atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; and&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; and do not fulfill any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Patients who are eligible and agree to participate are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to treatment with metformin XR (titrated to a maximum dose of 2000 mg daily based on safety&#xD;
      and tolerability) or matching placebo. All patients receive counseling on therapeutic&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations.&#xD;
