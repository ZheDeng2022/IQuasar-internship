      Critically ill patients need intravenous fluid therapy in order to correct or prevent&#xD;
      problems with their fluid and/or electrolyte status and for renal protection. The decision&#xD;
      for the optimal composition and amount of IV-fluids can be difficult and complex. It is well&#xD;
      known that errors in fluid- and electrolyte management contribute to overall morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. For decades, urinary sodium was used to diagnose renal disease. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      renal excretion of sodium is largely impaired in critically ill patients, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with acute kidney injury. Due to the high frequent measurement of renal output, it&#xD;
      would be possible to measure the urinary electrolytes and its relative changes. Urinary&#xD;
      electrolyte measurement may alert for the presence of the development of an akute kidney&#xD;
      injury before occurring increases in creatinine or oliguria. The rationale of this&#xD;
      investigation is therefore to collect data related to fluid- and electrolyte management from&#xD;
      critically ill patients in order to find patterns of fluid- and electrolyte imbalances which&#xD;
      may lead to disturbances and further, may allow an early detection of acute kidney injury.&#xD;

      Critically ill patients need intravenous fluid therapy in order to correct or prevent&#xD;
      problems with their fluid and/or electrolyte status and for renal protection. The decision&#xD;
      for the optimal composition and amount of IV-fluids can be difficult and complex. It is well&#xD;
      known that errors in fluid- and electrolyte management contribute to overall morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the administration of large volumes of normal saline and/or a decreased urinary output&#xD;
      of sodium or chloride iatrogen electrolyte disorders, such as hyperchloremic acidosis or&#xD;
      dysnatremia are common abnormalities in the clinical practice. The common fact that normal&#xD;
      saline has non-physiological levels of chloride and sodium, intensifies this problem with&#xD;
      high volume administration. (Burdett et al. 2003; Adrogué &amp; Madias 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypernatremia is an independent risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients and&#xD;
      increases the length of ICU stay (Lindner et al. 2010; Stieglmair et al. 2013) Hypernatremia&#xD;
      is associated with impaired renal fluid regulation, as well as a lack of thirst mechanisms.&#xD;
      In the ICU this fact requires exact measurement of all fluid- and electrolyte intake and&#xD;
      (non-)renal losses. (Lindner et al. 2009). Therefore, in critical care settings measuring&#xD;
      fluid balance (the difference between infusion input and renal / non-renal losses) is daily&#xD;
      routine. The renal output is measured frequently by the nursing staff. An automated&#xD;
      acquisition of the urinary output combined with the data of the infusion site would reduce&#xD;
      the workload of the staff and would allow visualization of the fluid status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, beyond volume, the concentration and composition of the fluid is an important&#xD;
      parameter. The comparison of urinary electrolytes with the electrolyte input from infusions&#xD;
      allows an early detection of electrolyte disorders (Besen et al. 2015). Sodium and chloride&#xD;
      are the main ions of solutions infused into critically ill patients. The excessive infusion&#xD;
      of fluids lead to sodium and chloride overloads and is associated with higher mortality&#xD;
      (Noritomi et al. 2009). For decades, urinary sodium was used to diagnose renal disease.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, renal excretion of sodium is largely impaired in critically ill patients,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with acute kidney injury. Due to the high frequent measurement of&#xD;
      renal output, it would be possible also to measure the urinary electrolytes and its relative&#xD;
      changes which are likely to be more relevant than the absolute electrolyte concentrations.&#xD;
      Urinary electrolyte measurement may alert for the presence of AKI development before&#xD;
      occurring increases in creatinine or oliguria (Maciel 2013; Maciel et al. 2015; Molitoris&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this investigation is therefore to collect data related to fluid- and&#xD;
      electrolyte management from critically ill patients in order to find patterns of fluid- and&#xD;
      electrolyte imbalances which may lead to disturbances and further, may allow an early&#xD;
      detection of acute kidney injury (AKI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing scheduled cardiac surgery will be included in this trial. The rationale&#xD;
      behind this is on the one hand, that the patient cohort is homogenous and on the other hand,&#xD;
      that the risk for developing an AKI is 30-40% among cardiac surgery patients (Rosner et al.&#xD;
      2006). The aim is to detect characteristic patterns in electrolyte metabolism between&#xD;
      patients who develop an AKI and those who do not.&#xD;
