  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for approximately one-third of Argentina's deaths.&#xD;
      Despite the availability of management and treatment for CVD which is offered to the&#xD;
      uninsured population at government primary care clinics (PCCs), the rates at which those at&#xD;
      risk are screened, identified and referred to the clinics are very low. This study will&#xD;
      determine if providing CHWs with an mHealth application using an integrated, inexpensive and&#xD;
      validated screening tool on cell phones for screening in the community which is linked with&#xD;
      the PCC scheduling system wirelessly allowing the CHWs to make appointments at the time they&#xD;
      identify high-risk individuals, will increase the number of referral and follow-up visits&#xD;
      that patients attend at the PCCs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in Argentina where death rates have&#xD;
      continued to rise along with risk factors for CVD. Challenges to control in low- and middle&#xD;
      income countries (LMIC) include low awareness, shortages of trained health care workers,&#xD;
      overcrowded primary care centers (PCCs), and overall lack of resources in health care&#xD;
      systems. Determining ways to increase screening in community settings and efficient referral&#xD;
      to PCCs is a significant priority in reducing the CVD burden in Argentina. Previous work&#xD;
      funded by the NIH shows that effective low-cost screening tools are available, CHWs can be&#xD;
      trained to use a validated, simple non-lab based screening tool in communities to identify&#xD;
      those at high CVD risk, and use of a mobile phone application for this tool reduced both the&#xD;
      cost of training and screening time for CHWs. What has not been shown is whether persons at&#xD;
      high risk for CVD can be appropriately referred for proper evaluation, treatment, and&#xD;
      effective management of CVD at the PCCs. The Ministry of Health in Argentina has instituted&#xD;
      an incentive system through the REDES Program that has the goal of increasing the number of&#xD;
      uninsured who are at high risk for CVD are screened, identified, referred, and provided with&#xD;
      appropriate care and treatment with essential diagnostics and medicines. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to develop a mHealth tool that integrates the cell phone application for the risk&#xD;
      screening tool to be wirelessly and directly connected with the electronic scheduling systems&#xD;
      at PCCs. This will allow CHWs to access the appointment scheduling system at the government&#xD;
      clinics, allowing them to make appointments for the identified high-risk individuals at the&#xD;
      time of screening to increase the number of referral and follow-up visits that these&#xD;
      individuals attend. This integrated scheduling system will allow for text messaging to be&#xD;
      used to remind patients of their appointments and to schedule followup care. Finally, the&#xD;
      system will be integrated with the electronic record system at the PCC so that ongoing&#xD;
      monitoring and evaluation of the program can be implemented. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      pragmatic cluster randomized trial in which individual PCCs will be randomized to either to&#xD;
      use of the integrated mHealth tool, or usual screening procedures using existing paper based&#xD;
      screening. The objectives will be to determine if use of the mHealth tool increases the&#xD;
      number of high-risk persons who show up for the referral visits, if it increases the rate of&#xD;
      subsequent follow-up care visits for the referred persons, and the cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Community health workers (CHWs) will conduct screening for CVD risk using a mobile phone application to assess risk and to schedule appointments at primary care centers (PCCs). The screening process will be non-invasive and no surgical, pharmaceutical, or other testing procedures will be utilized for screening of CVD risk by CHWs. If the CHW calculates the risk of CVD to be &gt; 10%, s/he will schedule a clinical visit with a health professional at one of the PCCs for further assessment and/or appropriate treatment. An automatic reminder messaging system will send reminder messages about upcoming appointments to the participants.</description>
