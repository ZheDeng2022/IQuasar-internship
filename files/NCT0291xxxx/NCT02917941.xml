  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Japanese participants with relapsed&#xD;
      and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The participants population will consist of adult&#xD;
      men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of&#xD;
      therapy, and who meet other outlined eligibility criteria. Participants will receive study&#xD;
      drug (ixazomib 4.mg) on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Participants may continue&#xD;
      to receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities. Participant with a low creatinine&#xD;
      clearance &lt; 60 mL/min will receive a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1&#xD;
      through 21 of a 28-day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be escalated to 15 mg once daily&#xD;
      after 2 cycles if the participant is not responding to treatment and is tolerating the&#xD;
      treatment. If renal function normalizes (ie, creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min) and the&#xD;
      participant continues to tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be escalated to 25 mg&#xD;
      once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Participant will be seen at regular&#xD;
      treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in the study: four times a treatment&#xD;
      cycle for the first 2 cycles, twice a treatment cycle for the 3rd cycle, and then once a&#xD;
      treatment cycle for the remainder of their participation in the active treatment and, if&#xD;
      applicable, the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) follow-up phases of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be assessed by investigator according to the International Myeloma Working&#xD;
      Group criteria for all participants every 4 weeks until PD. Central laboratory data will be&#xD;
      used for serum M-protein, urine M-protein and serum free light chain. All participants will&#xD;
      be followed for survival after progression. Participants will be contacted every 12 weeks&#xD;
      until death or termination of the study by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be closed at 24 months from the enrollment of the last participant.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to standard criteria either currently or at&#xD;
             the time of initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The initial diagnosis must be symptomatic MM, although the relapsed disease does not&#xD;
             need to be symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3&#xD;
             measurements based on central laboratory data:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum M-protein: &gt;=1 g/dL (&gt;= 10 g/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine M-protein: &gt;=200 mg/24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum free light chain assay: involved free light chain level &gt;=10 mg/dL (&gt;= 100&#xD;
                  mg/L), provided that the serum free light chain ratio is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             This participant population includes the following 3 categories of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who relapsed from their therapy(s) but were not refractory to any&#xD;
                  previous therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who were refractory to all lines of previous therapy(s) (ie,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Participants who were relapsed from at least 1 line of therapy AND additionally&#xD;
                  were refractory to at least 1 line of therapy. For the purposes of this study,&#xD;
                  refractory MM is defined as PD on therapy or PD within 60 days after the last&#xD;

             therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned manner. For&#xD;
             example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by autologous stem&#xD;
             cell transplantation, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy.&#xD;
