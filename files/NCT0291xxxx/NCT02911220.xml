  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intrinsic asthma (atopic or not) is a particular phenotype marked by an early later&#xD;
      symptoms, increased severity, sensitivity associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs), a sinonasal polyposis and eosinophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike allergic asthma, this form does not today demonstrated its genetic character. However,&#xD;
      the existence of familial forms of asthma in this region Pays de La Loire led us to&#xD;
      hypothesize the existence of genetic variations can explain some familial forms of non-atopic&#xD;
      asthma. Corresponding genes may be relevant to understanding the pathophysiological pathways&#xD;
      involved in the more common sporadic forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a study combining genetic linkage analysis and complete sequencing&#xD;
      exomes to identify one or more genetic abnormalities associated with non-atopic asthma. The&#xD;
      clinical stage essential for mutation identification is to identify and recruit large&#xD;
      families with members affected by non-atopic asthma and ensure accurate phenotyping of all&#xD;
      individuals recruited over several generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to create a cohort of families who have more members within them&#xD;
      non-atopic asthma. A high genetic combined exome sequencing throughput analysis in a family&#xD;
      linkage study will then reveal the presence or absence of genetic variations associated with&#xD;
      intrinsic asthma.&#xD;

      Patients with non-atopic asthma will be identified in consultation pulmonology at Laennec&#xD;
      Hospital (CHU Nantes) from the consultant population to severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients will be treated as index case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will conduct a family tree of the index case to identify families where the&#xD;
      number of healthy individuals and those with non-atopic asthma makes relevant a family&#xD;
      genetic study. Before initiating the family screening, it is necessary to have notion of at&#xD;
      least two individuals carrying non-atopic asthma at least two generations in the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Related agreeing to participate in this study will be included.&#xD;
