  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) can lead to adverse drug events (ADEs) among&#xD;
      older adults and especially those classified as frail. ADEs are responsible for nearly 27,000&#xD;
      hospital admissions in Canada annually. Within 30 days of discharge, medications contribute&#xD;
      to two-thirds of adverse events, with nearly 60% being preventable or ameliorable. MedSafer&#xD;
      is software product that guides patients and physicians in the community through the process&#xD;
      of deprescribing. MedSafer electronically cross-references patient comorbidities with the&#xD;
      most recent evidence-based PIMs, as of the study date, in order to generate a&#xD;
      patient-tailored deprescribing care plan. This study will evaluate whether this application,&#xD;
      when applied at hospitalization, leads to a reduction in the proprotion of patients with PIMs&#xD;
      prescribed at discharge, by highlighting harmful medications for deprescription to treating&#xD;
      physicians. This study will take place on the clinical teaching units (CTUs) at four&#xD;
      hospitals. Based on historical records, the investigators estimate enrolling 480 patients&#xD;
      aged 65 or older over three months. A trained research assistant will identify eligible&#xD;
      patients, and will enter their medications, comorbidities, and an estimate of frailty into&#xD;
      MedSafer. A deprescribing plan will be generated for the CTU team containing rationale for&#xD;
      suggested medication changes and strategies for safe and successful deprescription. The CTU&#xD;
      team will then decide in conjunction with the patient or proxy, and with relevant&#xD;
      consultants, which medications can rationally be stopped or tapered at discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deprescribing during hospitalization can be achieved through the concerted effort of expert&#xD;
      clinicians. A single-centre randomized controlled trial (400 patients) demonstrated that by&#xD;
      having a dedicated geriatrician apply the STOPP/START criteria [screening tool of older&#xD;
      people's prescriptions (STOPP) and screening tool to alert to right treatment (START)] to&#xD;
      screen for PIM use on admission could improve prescribing appropriateness by providing&#xD;
      recommendations for medication management; these changes were shown to persist for at least&#xD;
      six months post discharge. Recommendations were made in 58% of intervention patients, and&#xD;
      these were accepted in greater than 90% of cases. At discharge the proportion of patients&#xD;
      taking &quot;unnecessary&quot; therapy was 20% in the control group and 5.2% in the intervention arm.&#xD;
      This study was underpowered to show meaningful differences in ADEs and was entirely dependent&#xD;
      on a dedicated expert physician whose full time job was to provide this service; despite&#xD;
      this, medications were discontinued in nearly 1 in 5 patients with a sustained post-discharge&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This catalyst program will build on the Canadian Frailty Network-funded Catalyst Research&#xD;
      Program Grant (MEdication RAtionalization or MERA) by Co-Investigator James Downar. MERA&#xD;
      identifies medication for deprescribing by combining STOPP/START, the Beers criteria, and&#xD;
      Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations. A multidisciplinary case team then guides elderly&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers through deprescription during their hospitalization. Both the&#xD;
      Gallagher and MERA approaches are intensive in terms of human resources and are challenging&#xD;
      to generalize, implement and sustain nationwide. Furthermore, the current lack of firm&#xD;
      evidence on the risks and benefits of systemic deprescribing has limited the implementation&#xD;
      of these concepts into routine medical practice. A technological solution that facilitates&#xD;
      deprescribing and with proven effectiveness and safety would be a tremendous step forward for&#xD;
      the deprescribing movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives: The investigators will adapt and implement an electronic tool called&#xD;
      MedSafer to identify PIMs within 72 hours of hospitalization and prioritize medications for&#xD;
      deprescription. The tool will use three key criteria for deprescription: the potential for a&#xD;
      drug to improve symptoms, the potential to reduce the risk of future illness, and the&#xD;
      likelihood of causing harm. The recommendations from MedSafer will cue the treating team to&#xD;
      consider deprescribing PIMs after taking into consideration their knowledge of the individual&#xD;
      patient comorbidities, along with an understanding of patient values and goals of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this pilot study is to demonstrate that MedSafer can facilitate&#xD;
      deprescription (beyond usual care) in a diverse population of elderly patients. This pilot&#xD;
      will serve as the proof of concept for a larger multicenter RCT looking at the impact of this&#xD;
      process on adverse drug events. This pilot will facilitate: 1) estimates of the frequency of&#xD;
      PIMs; 2) adverse drug event rates; 3) rates of recruitment, refusal and loss to follow up; 4)&#xD;
      refinement of MedSafer based on real world user feedback; and 6) refinement of the adverse&#xD;
      drug event endpoint adjudication and health-related quality of life interview process. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at the Ottawa Hospital, the Toronto General Hospital and two&#xD;
      hospitals at the McGill University Health Centre, in Montreal (Royal Victoria and Montreal&#xD;
      General Hospitals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients for whom 1 or more PIMs&#xD;
      are stopped at discharge. We hypothesize that MedSafer will facilitate deprescription of PIMs&#xD;
      compared to usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To determine if this intervention leads to demonstrable improvements&#xD;
      in: a) Proportion of PIMs at 30-days post hospital discharge; b) adverse drug events within&#xD;
      30 days of hospital discharge; c) falls in hospital; d) length of stay; e) in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality; f) the overall number of any medications the average patient receives at discharge&#xD;
      and 30 days post; g) post-discharge self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL); h)&#xD;
      emergency department visits and readmissions within 30 days; i) 30-day all cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention is a novel electronic tool that combines the newly refined version of the&#xD;
      STOPP/START criteria, the 2015 Beers criteria, and applicable recommendations from Choosing&#xD;
      Wisely Canada to guide and facilitate deprescribing. To the investigator's knowledge, this is&#xD;
      the first electronic intervention to be implemented among heterogeneous at-risk, frail&#xD;
      elderly, hospitalized patients. This trial will test a tool that could lead to a&#xD;
      transformative change in medication appropriateness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Methodological Approach Study design: The study design is a before-after intervention&#xD;
      study. All hospitals will participate in six weeks of baseline measurement followed by six&#xD;
      weeks of intervention. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who have 1 or more&#xD;
      PIM discontinued at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: This study will take place on the clinical teaching units where patients are&#xD;
      cared for by teams composed of medical students, junior and senior residents in internal&#xD;
      medicine and other specialties, and attending physicians. The CTUs where this study will take&#xD;
      place admits complex elderly patients with multiple comorbidities where the majority are&#xD;
      non-surgical frail elderly and are most likely to benefit from a medication stewardship&#xD;
      intervention. Most medical trainees will spend weeks to months on these units each year,&#xD;
      yielding high exposure to the intervention. The investigators have shown that medication&#xD;
      stewardship projects can be successful on the CTU and that changes taking place on the CTU&#xD;
      can continue after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned trial interventions: Within 72 hours of admission (excluding weekends and holidays)&#xD;
      to both control and intervention units, each patient's documented medical history and&#xD;
      medication list will be manually extracted by a trained research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants in the intervention phase will be electronically screened using&#xD;
      MedSafer which will cross-reference this information to automatically identify and prioritize&#xD;
      &quot;deprescribing opportunities&quot; for further expert evaluation by the CTU team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this intervention, PIMs that are electronically identified will be communicated to the&#xD;
      treating medical team through MedSafer generated evidence-based recommendations including how&#xD;
      to safely deprescribe or taper medications as necessary. In the case of multiple&#xD;
      recommendations, they will be limited and prioritized in order to avoid overwhelming the&#xD;
      treating team. The doctors caring for the hospitalized patient will receive the information.&#xD;
      At that point, based on expert medical judgement, in collaboration with the patient/caregiver&#xD;
      and other relevant physicians (i.e. consultants and the community physician), a decision will&#xD;
      be made to deprescribe if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: all participants will receive medication reconciliation by the unit pharmacist, a&#xD;
      review of medical history and medication use, and identical follow up, but no prioritized&#xD;
      list will be generated for the treating team to systematically trigger deprescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this catalyst study will ideally establish the safety and efficacy of MedSafer&#xD;
      to electronically facilitate the inpatient application of criteria based on STOPP/START,&#xD;
      Beers and Choosing Wisely recommendations to identity and prioritize PIMs for deprescribing.&#xD;
      Based on a positive outcome of this study, the investigators would plan to implement the tool&#xD;
      in a larger study at multiple hospitals across Canada to determine its effectiveness at&#xD;
      reducing ADEs among a similar frail and elderly population.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will represent a consecutive series of persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants include those who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aged 65 years or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  taking 5 or more medications; and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  admitted to the inpatient medical ward at any of the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are cognitively impaired or otherwise unable to provide consent will&#xD;
             still be included as this sub-population of patients may be at greatest risk of ADEs&#xD;
             because of their communication problems. Tri-council ethics guidelines (Canada) deem&#xD;
             that this sub-population should not be excluded from interventions that potentially&#xD;
             provide direct benefit to the participant due to the inability to provide informed&#xD;
             consent (Article 4.5, Tri-Council Policy Statement 2008). For these patients, the&#xD;
             family/proxy will authorize study participation pending the return of patient capacity&#xD;
             to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are ultimately discharged from non-study units during their hospitalization&#xD;
        will be excluded unless that unit is a transitional care, rehabilitation, or post-acute&#xD;
        care unit used to bridge the gap between acute medical hospitalization and community&#xD;
        services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients expected to be transferred to another acute care hospital, a non-medical&#xD;
             unit, or a palliative care unit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who normally live outside of the province of hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients not enrolled in (or eligible for) the provincial drug plans;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients previously enrolled in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients or proxy not able to speak English or French;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no means of contacting patient or proxy post-discharge;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients expected to die within 30 days and whose level of care has been declared to&#xD;
             be palliative will be maintained in the study but will be excluded from select&#xD;
             secondary outcomes.&#xD;
