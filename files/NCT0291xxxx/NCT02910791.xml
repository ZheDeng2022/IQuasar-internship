  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are two skin diseases often associated with bacterial&#xD;
      infections and inflammation. Studies indicate that skin cells from these patients may have&#xD;
      some changes that make these patients more susceptible to bacterial infections. Inflammatory&#xD;
      environment may have an effect on the function of skin cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts)&#xD;
      and how they regulate skin barrier function. To study this we need to establish skin cells&#xD;
      that can be grown in the laboratory. We will use small skin biopsies from patients with&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and healthy people as a source of these cells. Since these skin&#xD;
      cells have a limited lifetime when grown in laboratory as part of the project we would like&#xD;
      to modify them, which allows them to grow for long time in the research laboratory. Some of&#xD;
      the collected skin biopsies and isolated skin cells will be used to examine what gene&#xD;
      products they make.&#xD;

      Visit 1 (if needed). Study subjects will be asked to read and sign the informed consent. At&#xD;
      that time the study inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study will be reviewed. Subject&#xD;
      will be given instructions to stop taking certain medications for 7 days prior to the next&#xD;
      study visit. Alternatively, if Visit 1 will be done over the phone, subjects may be contacted&#xD;
      via phone using a phone script to provide instructions for stopping these medications. In&#xD;
      this case, the informed consent will be obtained by the subject at visit 2 prior to any study&#xD;
      procedures being done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject takes occasional Aspirin (not taken daily), it will need to be withheld for&#xD;
      seven days prior to visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject takes oral antihistamines, it will need to be withheld for seven days prior to&#xD;
      the subject's first appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject takes oral antibiotics, inform the subject the appointment can be scheduled&#xD;
      seven days after their last dose of antibiotic has been taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject takes topical medications including (but not restricted to), cyclosporine,&#xD;
      Elidel, Protopic, topical corticosteroids and topical antibiotics, it will need to be&#xD;
      withheld seven days prior to the subject's first appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject takes any of the following medications, they are not eligible for enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral corticosteroids Any systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulary medication in the last&#xD;
      28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have received immunotherapy in the past year. Patients using anxiolytics or&#xD;
      antidepressants Antiviral therapies Anticoagulants Allergic to lidocaine Daily Aspirin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Will occur approximately 7 days following the screening visit or the phone call. If&#xD;
      the subject was contacted via phone, he/she will be review and sign the informed consent form&#xD;
      during this visit. The following procedures will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Pregnancy Test: All female can be pregnant or become pregnant during the study. The&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test will be administered to all women of child bearing potential. If the&#xD;
      test will be positive, the participation in the study will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Biopsies: The skin biopsies will involve taking a small piece of skin (4 biopsies 2mm in&#xD;
      diameter) generally obtained from the arms or legs, the face is excluded from skin biopsy.&#xD;
      The area will be cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. Biopsies will be collected from&#xD;
      non-lesion skin and acute lesions. The wound will not require a stitch and should be healed&#xD;
      within two weeks. The biopsy site needs to be kept sterile and this will require that the&#xD;
      area not get wet. The skin biopsies will be performed by one of the physician investigators&#xD;
      or nurse practitioners. The subject will be given the name and phone number of a nurse and&#xD;
      told to call if there are any problems. The subject will be given instructions on how to care&#xD;
      for the biopsy site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venipuncture: 7.5 mL of blood will be removed by putting a needle into a vein. The procedure&#xD;
      will be performed by a physician investigator or a nurse in the CTRC. The subject will be&#xD;
      given the name and phone number of a nurse and told to call if there are any problems. There&#xD;
      will not be any follow-up for venipuncture procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA testing: Additional 7.5 ml of blood will be obtained for genetic testing of filaggrin&#xD;
      gene polymorphisms (performed by ADx lab at NJH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin cultures: Skin is rubbed with a cotton swab then cells are placed in a special culture&#xD;
      medium tube for identification of bacteria wabs will be tested for presence of S. aureus by&#xD;
      culture and PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tape Stripping. Adhesive skin sampling discs will be firmly pressed against the skin in a&#xD;
      hairless location (not the face) followed by lifting it free of the skin. Skin tapes will be&#xD;
      collected from non-lesion skin and acute skin lesions. This will be repeated up to 40 times.&#xD;
      These discs will then be used to evaluate RNA, lipids and proteins in the upper layers of&#xD;
      skin. With every 5 tape strips collected from one lesion and one non-lesion area skin barrier&#xD;
      assessment will be preformed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Barrier Assessment. Skin serves as the first barrier against allergens, viruses, and&#xD;
      bacteria that may aggravate your skin disease. A small device will be used to measure the&#xD;
      quantity of water that passes from inside the body through the skin to the surrounding&#xD;
      atmosphere via diffusion and evaporation process. Additionally, the device will measure skin&#xD;
      pH, which is also associated with changes in the skin barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sweat Test. We will measure chemicals in patients' sweat, such as salt, which is known as a&#xD;
      sweat test. To collect the sweat, a sticky pad will be attached to the skin on patients' arm&#xD;
      for 5 minutes. A gel containing a medicine called pilocarpine is put on the pads and causes&#xD;
      the sweat glands to produce more sweat. The pads are then removed and replaced by a disc to&#xD;
      collect sweat for about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sebum Collection. Skin surface will be cleaned with alcohol wipes. After allowing skin&#xD;
      surface to dry sebum collecting tape will be applied to the skin surface. The tape will be&#xD;
      held on the skin surface for one hour. The tape will then be used to evaluate skin sebum&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional Visits: The research team may ask the subject to return every 6 weeks and&#xD;
      participate in additional skin biopsies, tape strips and blood draws (not to exceed 6.5&#xD;
      tablespoons (100 ml)). The subject may choose to participate in some or all optional visits&#xD;
      not to exceed 6 additional blood draws, tape strips and/or biopsies in one year.&#xD;
