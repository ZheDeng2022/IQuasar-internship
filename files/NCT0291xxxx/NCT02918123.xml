      Phase I clinical trial to evaluate safety of FURESTEM-CD Inj. in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe in plaque-type psoriasis injection for 4weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single center, randomized, open label, study of safety of FURESTEM-CD Inj.&#xD;
      in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 9~18 subjects will be administrated FURESTEM-CD Inj.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FURESTEM-CD Inj. is composed of allogeneic hUCB-MSC(human Umbilical Cord Blood&#xD;
      derived-Mesenchymal Stem cell). hUCB-MSCs are mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood. Mesenchymal stem cells are well-known for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory ability&#xD;
      and capable of differentiating into a wide range of cell types. Therefore, FURSTEM-CD Inj.&#xD;
      has huge possibility as cell therapy products for plaque-type Psoriasis patients.&#xD;
