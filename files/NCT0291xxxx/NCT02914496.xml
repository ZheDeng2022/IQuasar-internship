    <textblock>
      For many people living with type 1 diabetes it is a challenge to achieve good glucose&#xD;
      control. Barely 20% reaches the goal level and many people experience self-care as complex,&#xD;
      demanding and stressful. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a&#xD;
      stress-management program on glucose control, self-care and psychosocial factors. The program&#xD;
      is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a specific form of Cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy (CBT). A total of 70 adult patients with type 1 diabetes from Ersta hospital will be&#xD;
      recruited. Half of them will receive the intervention and the other half will continue with&#xD;
      their regular diabetes care. A licensed psychologist specialised in CBT and a diabetes&#xD;
      specialist nurse will be leading the intervention that is given in a group format. The&#xD;
      program consists of seven 2-hour sessions given over 14 weeks. Glucose control, self care and&#xD;
      stress will be measured at inclusion, after session four and seven, at six , 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      and finally after 5 years&#xD;

      ACT-stress management in type 1 diabetes - a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect on glucose control, self-control and psychosocial factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of proposed investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project hypothesis are that the CBT-intervention will a) improve glucose control,&#xD;
      self-care, quality of life and acceptance of diabetes related thoughts and emotions and b)&#xD;
      decrease depression, anxiety, general and diabetes related distress and fear of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background information for the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of diabetes management is to achieve good glycemic control while still&#xD;
      maintaining good quality of life and experiencing as few hypoglycemic episodes as possible&#xD;
      (the Swedish Social Board of Welfare, 2010). Currently only 19% of people with diabetes reach&#xD;
      the goal of 52 mmol/mol for glycemic control (National Diabetes Registry, 2014). Research has&#xD;
      proposed difficulties with behavior change (Knight et al., 2006), diabetes related distress&#xD;
      (van Bastelar et al., 2010, Fisher et al., 2010) and fear of hypoglycemia (Wild et al., 2007)&#xD;
      as important obstacles in achieving the goal. Patient education plays an important role in&#xD;
      diabetes care but may not be sufficient in order to reach the recommended treatment goals.&#xD;
      The association between knowledge and behavior change is weak and research has suggested that&#xD;
      interventions should be more behavior oriented (Knight et al., 2006, Funnell et al., 2008).&#xD;
      It is well known that people with chronic disease have an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      psychological problems, for instance there are studies showing up to four times higher&#xD;
      prevalence of depression in people with type 1 diabetes (Roy &amp; Lloyd, 2012). It is also known&#xD;
      that psychological problems are associated with poorer glycemic control, health and quality&#xD;
      of life in this group (Chiechanowski et al., 2000; Jacobson, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is urgent to quickly discover and treat psychological problems. There is&#xD;
      scientific support for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) to be effective in treating different&#xD;
      types of anxiety (Stewart &amp; Chambless, 2009) and depression (Cuijpers et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of this, different CBT-based interventions have been suggested as promising&#xD;
      alternatives in treating diabetes. Several programs based on CBT have also been scientificly&#xD;
      evaluated. Some of these studies have focused on changing concrete every day behaviors in&#xD;
      order to promote self-care, glycemic control and quality of life (Snoek et al., 2008, Amsberg&#xD;
      et al., 2009a,b) and some to treat co-morbid depression (Lustman et al., 1998). Our previous&#xD;
      intervention study in this field (Amsberg et al., 2009 a, b) was the first one to show&#xD;
      significant positive effects on glycemic control. In recent years a new form of CBT,&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Thearpy, (ACT), (Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999) has received&#xD;
      scientific attention. Of particular interest is that relatively short ACT-interventions in&#xD;
      several studies have shown good results in a wide variety of psychosocial problems, smoking&#xD;
      cessation, work related stress, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, epilepsi (Hayes et al.,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; ACT-stressmanagement&quot; is an intervention originally developed for preventing work-related&#xD;
      stress and illness (Bond &amp; Bunce, 2003) that later has been modified for different groups of&#xD;
      peopel such as high-school students (Livheim, 2004), social workers (Brinkborg et al., 2011),&#xD;
      medical students (Andersson &amp; Waller, 2011). The intervention is designed so that different&#xD;
      types of professionals, not only psychologists, can serve as group-leaders after a short&#xD;
      period of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention &quot;ACT-stress-management&quot; will in this study be given as a course consisting&#xD;
      of seven sessions where each session is two hours long. The course has been modified for&#xD;
      people with diabetes so that the excercises and information will be related to diabetes and&#xD;
      diabetes related problems. The sessions will be held every other week. The groups will&#xD;
      consist of between six to a maximum of ten participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Inclusion criteria will be all adult (18-70 years) type 1 diabetes patients with&#xD;
      HbA1c &gt; 60 mmol/mol registered at Ersta hospital, diabetes- and endochrinology&#xD;
      department/unit. The patient must be able to read, write and speak Swedish. Those with severe&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions such as psychosis, recurrent severe depression or post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder, those with an ongoing cortison treatment, with co-morbid severe illness that&#xD;
      affects glycemic control or are pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power-calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 56 patients (28 in the intervention group and 28 in the control group) are needed&#xD;
      to achieve 80% power to detect the clinically relevant decrease of 6 mmol (The Association of&#xD;
      Physical Activity, 2015) in HbA1c with 5% significance level and an SD of 9 mmol. In order to&#xD;
      take in account of a drop-out rate of 24 % (Amsberg et al., 2008) during the study a total of&#xD;
      70 patients are needed to be included. The power-calculation was done with a web-based&#xD;
      power-caculator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of five main steps: 1. Recruitment of participants 2. The intervention 3.&#xD;
      Psychometric evaluation of the Swedish version of AADQ 4. Data-processing 5. Presentation of&#xD;
      the results&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment of participants We will recruit a total of 70 patients during 2-3 years, of&#xD;
           which half will receive the &quot;ACT-stress-management&quot; program and half will continue with&#xD;
           treatment as usual. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will meet the person&#xD;
           collecting the data at the diabetes-center in order to receive information of the study&#xD;
           and will at the same time be asked to participate in the study. At this time the&#xD;
           participants will be informed orally and in writing about the study, recieve information&#xD;
           about their possibility to leave the study at any time without any consequences, how&#xD;
           data will be handled and finally about receiving a compensation in the form of a gift&#xD;
           voucher of 100 SEK after each time they complete a set of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The intervention The intervention consists of: &quot;The ACT-stressmanagement&quot; intervention&#xD;
           and administrating pre-intervention measurements, processmeasurments, post-intervention&#xD;
           measurements and follow-up measurements. The control-group will only consist of the&#xD;
           pre-, process-, post and follow-up measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention-group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent for the study&#xD;

           base-line measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;the ACT-stressmanagement&quot; is given, including two process-measurements of AADQ&#xD;
