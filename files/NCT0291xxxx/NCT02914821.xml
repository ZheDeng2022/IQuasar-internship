      The study will take place at a cafe managed by university dining services and is located in a&#xD;
      university building adjacent to the psychology building. The cafe sells sugar-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages and a variety of diet drinks. The campus dining services and the manager of the&#xD;
      cafe have given investigators permission to &quot;tax&quot; their sugar sweetened beverages and will&#xD;
      provide their sales data for a 12 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will introduce four arms to the experiment. One arm will be baseline data&#xD;
      where business 'as usual' will be conducted and no price increases will be implemented on&#xD;
      SSBs. In the general tax condition the investigators will introduce a 3 cent/ounce tax on the&#xD;
      five SSB flavors the café offers. In the Pre-K tax condition the investigators will institute&#xD;
      a 3 cent/ounce tax but will label the tax as proceeds going to Pre-K education. This is&#xD;
      designed after the Philadelphia tax that was recently passed where funds were earmarked to&#xD;
      benefit childhood education. In the childhood healthy eating program condition the&#xD;
      investigators will institute a 3 cent/ounce tax but will label the tax as proceeds going&#xD;
      toward childhood healthy eating programs. In all tax conditions the firm will keep the&#xD;
      proceeds, but the research team will make a donation to a Pre-K education non-profit and a&#xD;
      childhood healthy eating non-profit of the amount generated by the tax during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each experimental arm will run for 3 weeks total (for a total study period of 12 weeks). The&#xD;
      conditions will alternate by week (i.e., week 1: business as usual; week 2: general tax; week&#xD;
      3: pre-K tax; week 4: childhood healthy eating tax; week 5: business as usual, etc). A&#xD;
      research assistant will visit the café each week to make any necessary changes to signs that&#xD;
      will label the drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will change the signage of the drinks in the cooler during the study&#xD;
      period. For the baseline period there will be no changes to the signs made. Currently all&#xD;
      beverages are labeled with their name and cost (e.g., Pepsi, $1.89). In the tax conditions&#xD;
      the investigators will change the price of the drink (3 cents/ounce) and add a line notifying&#xD;
      consumers of the soda 'surcharge' (note &quot;surcharge&quot; will be used in the study because no tax&#xD;
      was actually passed by the local government). An example of this sign would be 'Pepsi, $2.29,&#xD;
      includes 40 cent sugary drink surcharge.' In the Pre-K tax condition an added line will say,&#xD;
      &quot;Pepsi, $2.29, includes a 40 cent sugar sweetened beverage surcharge. Proceeds benefit Pre-K&#xD;
      education.&quot; In the childhood healthy eating programs condition the text will say, &quot;Pepsi,&#xD;
      $2.29, includes a 40 cent sugary drink surcharge. Proceeds benefit Childhood Healthy Eating&#xD;
      programs.&quot;&#xD;

      Diet-related diseases, such as diabetes and obesity, have become pervasive global health&#xD;
      challenges, so much so that they are being called epidemics. The problem is particularly&#xD;
      acute in the United States where two-thirds of adults and one-third of children are&#xD;
      overweight or obese. A key contributor to increased dietary intake is the increased&#xD;
      consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), also known as soft drinks, are beverages that are sweetened&#xD;
      with sugar, high fructose corn syrup, or any other caloric sweetener; this excludes&#xD;
      noncaloric (diet) drinks. The average American consumes approximately 47 gallons of SSBs per&#xD;
      year. Americans consume about 278 calories more each day than they did 30 years ago and&#xD;
      nearly half of this increase is attributable to increased consumption of SSBs. The&#xD;
      consumption of SSBs has been cited as a key contributor to obesity and has been linked to&#xD;
      other negative health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and dental cavities.&#xD;
      Therefore, the increase in SSB consumption and the concurrent increase in diet-related&#xD;
      diseases pose significant direct and indirect costs to society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to these problems, health experts, laypeople and legislators alike advocate&#xD;
      policies to reduce the consumption of SSBs. Several municipalities and states have proposed&#xD;
      policies such as taxes, warning labels, and calorie labeling and a few have passed such&#xD;
      policies. For example, Berkeley, CA recently adopted a SSB excise tax which charges an&#xD;
      additional cent for each ounce of SSB sold. In June 2016, Philadelphia passed a 1.5 cent per&#xD;
      ounce tax on sugary drinks and diet sodas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe it is critical to further test the effectiveness of taxes in the&#xD;
      field. In this study, the investigators conduct a field experiment that tests different&#xD;
      framing of taxes, namely whether the money is earmarked for a particular cause.&#xD;
