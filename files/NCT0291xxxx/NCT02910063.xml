      platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This study incorporates multiple&#xD;
      interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample-size re-estimation. In the&#xD;
      phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to IC chemotherapy.The phase 2&#xD;
      component of the study will consist of up to a 28-day screening period, approximately 70 to&#xD;
      112 days of study treatment, a 30-day (+/- 3days) safety follow up, and long-term follow up&#xD;
      that will conclude with the final analysis of the phase 3 component, estimated at 30 months&#xD;
      after initiation of the phase 3 component. For the phase 3 component, the study will consist&#xD;
      of up to a 28-day screening period, a treatment period of up to approximately 168 days, a&#xD;
      30-day safety follow-up visit, and long-term follow up. Long-term follow up will conclude&#xD;
      with the final analysis.In the phase 2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab&#xD;
      monotherapy. In the phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy.&#xD;

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

          <title>Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR)</title>
          <description>DOR was calculated only for participants who achieve a response (CMR or PMR). The duration was calculated from the date a response, CMR or PMR, was first achieved until the earliest date of a disease assessment indicating disease progression or death, whichever occured first. DOR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Phase 3 part of the study was not initiated after Phase 2 data was reviewed. No participants were screened or enrolled for Phase 3.</limitations_and_caveats>
