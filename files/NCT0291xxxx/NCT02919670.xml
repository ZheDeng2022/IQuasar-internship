    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating Enterade, a supplement, as a possible treatment for the&#xD;
      side effects caused by Stem Cell Transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following interventions will be involved in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enterade plus standard supportive care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo plus standard supportive care. The placebo will be a mixture of water,&#xD;
           electrolytes, and sweetener.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease, or in this case, the side effects from a standard treatment&#xD;
      for Stem Cell Transplant side effect. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating Enterade/Placebo plus standard&#xD;
      supportive care for the treatment of the side effects caused by transplant. Enterade works by&#xD;
      rehydrating the intestinal cells, thereby helping to restore normal bowel function. The&#xD;
      ingredients in Enterade are generally recognized as safe by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
      This research study is hoping to learn if adding Enterade to the standard supportive care&#xD;
      regimen for the participant transplant will help reduce the side effects from the transplant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Multiple Myeloma, or&#xD;
             Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and must be undergoing Melphalan conditioning for autologous&#xD;
             HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age equal or greater than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function to proceed to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to tolerate thin liquids by mouth at the time of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Enterade® on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) at the time of study entry and for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or&#xD;
             those who have not recovered from adverse events due to chemotherapy agents&#xD;
             administered during this time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents. Participants who are&#xD;
             receiving standard of care induction therapy on a clinical trial may be eligible after&#xD;
             discussion with the overall principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to Stevia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or antibiotics to treat Clostridium difficile&#xD;
             infection prior to the initiation of the study will be ineligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             Clostridium difficile infection or history of Clostridium difficile infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of diarrhea as defined by three or more loose or liquid&#xD;
             stools per day or loose watery stool (greater volume of stool), that occurs more&#xD;
             frequently than usual and lasting for more than three days prior to admission, history&#xD;
             of inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colectomy or bariatric&#xD;
             surgery, Celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because of teratogenicity and&#xD;
             toxicity risks associated with the conditioning regimen for patients undergoing&#xD;
             autologous HSCT.&#xD;
