      Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy is the &quot;standard&quot; phototherapy for atopic eczema;&#xD;
      ultraviolet A1 is sometimes used but is not a widely available treatment. We do not know the&#xD;
      most important chromophores in treating atopic eczema; in which phototherapy is thought to&#xD;
      work by improving epidermal barrier function, having beneficial effects on skin microbiome&#xD;
      and local immunosuppression. It seems plausible that there are several chromophores and that&#xD;
      'targetting' several at once with different wavebands should help and for severe eczema that&#xD;
      has not responded adequately to narrowband UVB or ultraviolet A1 alone the combination is&#xD;
      sometimes used. This study is to test if the combination is moderately to greatly more&#xD;
      effective than narrowband ultraviolet B monotherapy amongst patients referred for any form of&#xD;
      first-line phototherapy for atopic eczema.&#xD;

      Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy is the &quot;standard&quot; phototherapy widely used for atopic&#xD;
      eczema; ultraviolet A1 is sometimes used but is not a widely available treatment. We do not&#xD;
      know the most important chromophores in treating atopic eczema; in which phototherapy is&#xD;
      thought to work by improving epidermal barrier function, having beneficial effects on skin&#xD;
      microbiome and local immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems plausible that there are several chromophores (the molecules that absorb the&#xD;
      ultraviolet photons to set in chain the effects we are aiming for) and that 'targetting'&#xD;
      several chromophores at once with different wavebands should help. For severe eczema that has&#xD;
      not responded adequately to narrowband UVB or ultraviolet A1 alone the combination is&#xD;
      sometimes used in the few centres where UVA1 is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to test if the combination is moderately to greatly more effective than&#xD;
      narrowband ultraviolet B monotherapy amongst patients referred for any form of first-line&#xD;
      phototherapy for atopic eczema.&#xD;
