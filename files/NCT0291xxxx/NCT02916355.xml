      Role of IL-1 in postprandial fatigue - The Chäschüechli 2 Study It is a randomized, single&#xD;
      dose, placebo-controlled, double blind, cross-over, proof-of-concept study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 healthy young men will be included in this study. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate if severity of postprandial fatigue is driven by IL-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since fatigue is associated with increased cytokine levels, and since fatigue in chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory settings, such as type 2 diabetes, can be reduced by inhibition of IL-1β,&#xD;
      postprandial fatigue might also respond to anti-inflammatory intervention with IL-1&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether postprandial fatigue is, at least in part,&#xD;
      driven by the IL-1 system.&#xD;
