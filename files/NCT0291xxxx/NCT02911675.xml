  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death following injury in civilian&#xD;
      populations and is a major cause of death and disability in combat casualties. While primary&#xD;
      brain injury cannot be reversed, the management of severe TBI focuses on the mitigation of&#xD;
      secondary injury mechanisms which occur as part of the downstream effects of the primary&#xD;
      damage to the brain. Many secondary injury mechanisms are manifested clinically as elevated&#xD;
      intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CCP). This level and duration of&#xD;
      elevated ICP is strongly associated with poor long term patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are two invasive techniques that are used at our facility for monitoring ICP&#xD;
      and CPP. The first method requires the placement of an intra-parenchymal fiberoptic pressure&#xD;
      monitor (IPM), also known as a camino, into the brain tissue that measures and displays ICP&#xD;
      continuously. The second method requires placement of an extracranial ventricular drain (EVD)&#xD;
      which both measures ICP when it is closed or clamped and also allows for therapeutic drainage&#xD;
      of cerebral spinal fluid (CFS) to reduce pressure within the skull when it is open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While clinical practices vary greatly across institutions, current clinical practice at our&#xD;
      institution when using the EVD for ICP management is to allow continuous therapeutic CSF&#xD;
      drainage and to manually close the drain for ICP assessment on an hourly basis. However, in a&#xD;
      retrospective of study of TBI patients at our institution with simultaneous IPM and EVD&#xD;
      placement, a spike in ICP was noted to correspond with the clamping of the EVD which often&#xD;
      remained elevated for 15-30 minutes before returning to baseline. Due to the strong&#xD;
      association between poor patient outcome and elevated ICP, this finding is alarming. These&#xD;
      findings have important implications for procedures to not only treat elevated ICP, but also&#xD;
      prevent potentially harmful intermittent elevations in ICP. Therefore, this study seeks to&#xD;
      prospectively investigate the association between EVD clamping and elevated ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study has 2 main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the need for an optimized device that can simultaneously measure intracranial&#xD;
           pressure and drain CSF without requiring potentially harmful clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide data in support of retaining or modifying current clinical practices regarding&#xD;
           intermittent versus continuous monitoring during periods of therapeutic drainage of CSF.&#xD;

      Investigators plan a single-center, 36 month prospective observational study of 50 patients&#xD;
      presenting with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at R Adams Cowley Shock&#xD;
      Trauma Center who require intracranial pressure monitoring. This is an interventional device&#xD;
      study utilizing the EVD/IVC and the IPM/Camino to provide and evaluate data for optimized&#xD;
      treatment for the control of elevated ICP and CCP in patients with severe TBI. Enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of two study groups listed below following the consent&#xD;
      process. Once a potential participant has consented to the study, we will use the excel&#xD;
      random number generator function (randbetween(0,1)) to generate random numbers between 0 and&#xD;
      1 for each participant. If 0 is generated participants will be placed in Group 1 (Hourly EVD&#xD;
      closures) and if 1 is generated, participants will be placed in Group 2 (EVD closure every 12&#xD;
      hours). There is no placebo or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care (25 patients): Standard EVD management with therapeutic drainage as&#xD;
      appropriate and hourly EVD ICP measurements with simultaneous IPM/Camino ICP measurements&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental (25 patients): Therapeutic CSF drainage as appropriate, with EVD closure and ICP&#xD;
      assessment every 12 hours with simultaneous IPM/Camino ICP measurements collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on age, mechanism of injury, time interval between injury and MRI,&#xD;
      past medical history, admission hemodynamics, admission component GCS, post-resuscitation&#xD;
      component GCS, injury severity score, abbreviated injury score for head injury, blunt carotid&#xD;
      or vertebral artery injury, and therapeutic interventions. Continuous vital signs streams&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, if available, video surveillance from the patient's stay in the Neurotrauma&#xD;
      Critical Care Unit will be collected and be stored with the patients study data.&#xD;
