  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will focus on three cohorts of brain tumor patients aged, 4-18 years, to&#xD;
      answer two critical questions: 1) Can the investigators acquire high quality data relevant to&#xD;
      cognitive function during the peri-diagnostic period and, 2) can the investigators develop&#xD;
      predictive models for cognitive outcomes using serial examination of functional imaging and&#xD;
      cognitive function. Any patient with a newly diagnosed brain tumor aged 4-18 will be eligible&#xD;
      for enrollment in cohort 1. Only patients with previously diagnosed tumors of the posterior&#xD;
      fossa will be eligible for cohort 2. For cohort 3, eligible patients will include patients&#xD;
      with a clinical diagnosis of posterior fossa syndrome with physical impairments that prohibit&#xD;
      completion of the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery. The investigators have decided to expand the&#xD;
      eligible tumor types to better capture the most significant deficit variability that can be&#xD;
      caused by tumors outside the posterior fossa. Thus, this focus will provide a platform to&#xD;
      analyze the impact that different tumor types and different standard treatments have on&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction. The rationale for inclusion of subjects on cohort 3 is that posterior&#xD;
      fossa syndrome is one of the most cognitively devastating diagnoses following a posterior&#xD;
      fossa surgery. The causes of posterior fossa syndrome and unknown and there are currently no&#xD;
      interventions to improve symptoms. RsfcMRI would offer a novel and non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      posterior fossa syndrome patients by assessing connectivity within and outside of the&#xD;
      cerebellum. Expanding the tumor eligibility will allow us to further explore the effect tumor&#xD;
      location will have on cognitive testing and rsfcMRI. Here, repeated evaluations on and off&#xD;
      therapy will provide the necessary data points to establish trajectories of cognitive&#xD;
      development and recovery in this population.&#xD;

    <description>Prior to surgery, subjects will have a complete standard of care history and physical exam by the neurosurgeon and then undergo peri-diagnostic neurocognitive testing utilizing the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery computer testing software for iPad (will take 45 minutes). The peri-diagnostic period will be defined as the period from first presentation to 2 weeks post-diagnosis or two weeks post-op, whichever is later.&#xD;
Participants will also undergo a rsfcMRI during their standard of care MRI imaging which will add 15 minutes to their scan time</description>

    <description>Patients with diagnosis of a posterior tumor will undergo neurocognitive testing utilizing the NIH Toolbox. Testing will be every 6 months for children currently receiving therapy and annually for those that have completed all therapy for a total of 3 sessions. During standard of care MRI images, rsfcMRI imaging will be performed which will add 15 minutes of time. rsfcMRI will be obtained every 6 months for children currently receiving therapy and annually for those that have completed therapy for a total of 3 rsfcMRIs for each patient.&#xD;
Patients in Cohort 1 will also be eligible to continue with the longitudinal assessment as just described. These participants will then undergo repeat neurocognitive testing using the NIH toolbox 6-9 months for an additional 3 testing sessions. rsfcMRI will be obtained during their follow-up imaging at 6-9 month intervals for a total of 3 additional rsfcMRIs (4 total scans).</description>

    <description>The imaging protocols will be a combined version of a standard of care (SOC) protocol with a research portion. The SOC portion of the pre-surgical scans includes a 3D T2-weighted (T2w) scans and 3D pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted (T1w) images, both at high resolution (1.0 mm3) for use in the intraoperative navigation system. This scan also includes a DTI portion for definition of fiber bundles of interest. The SOC portion of the post-surgical scans includes transverse FLAIR and post-contrast T1w images in all 3 planes. The research portion of the scan will be identical at all 3 time points and include 15 min of rsfcMRI during which the non-sedated subjects will be asked to stay still and awake while looking at a fixation cross</description>
