  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial assessing the potential activity of combination PEGPH20&#xD;
      plus Gemcitabine with radiotherapy in ten patients with localized, unresectable pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial evaluating the safety and potential efficacy of PEGylated Recombinant&#xD;
      Human Hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) plus concurrent Gemcitabine and radiotherapy. Recognizing that&#xD;
      PEGPH20 has not been previously delivered with radiotherapy but is unlikely to contribute to&#xD;
      increased toxicities, this trial will have an abbreviated sequential dose escalation schema&#xD;
      for the first three patients. PEGPH20 will be given twice per week for the first 28 days and&#xD;
      then weekly for another 2 weeks during radiotherapy. Gemcitabine will be delivered weekly at&#xD;
      the first day of radiotherapy and continued weekly, per published literature. Patients will&#xD;
      remain on study for three months. The duration of active treatment with PEGPH20 and&#xD;
      Gemcitabine plus radiotherapy will continue for 5-6 weeks. Efficacy outcome will occur 6-8&#xD;
      weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;

Safety will be assessed during the study by evaluation of AEs, clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry (including C-reactive protein [CRP]), coagulation, urinalysis, and PEGPH20 immunogenicity), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations.&#xD;
The severity of AEs will be graded by Investigators using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03</description>
