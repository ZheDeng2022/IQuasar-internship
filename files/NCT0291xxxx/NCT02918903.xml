  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess and compare the possible post-operative pulpal&#xD;
      symptoms (Spontaneous pain, pain on percussion, swelling, sinus or fistula), incidence of&#xD;
      pulp exposure, child acceptance, chair time and radiographic success between two techniques&#xD;
      for managing dental caries: minimal caries removal and complete caries removal in primary&#xD;
      molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimal Caries Removal (MCR) technique was described in 2015 by Chompu-inwai et al., as a&#xD;
      treatment option for primary molars with deep carious lesions or reversible pulpitis where&#xD;
      only soft demineralized dentin around the lateral walls of the carious lesion is removed. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to assess the success of such a technique in managing primary molars&#xD;
      with asymptomatic deep caries in terms of; post-operative pulpal symptoms(spontaneous pain,&#xD;
      pain on percussion, fistula or sinus), incidence of pulp exposure, child acceptance, chair&#xD;
      time and radiographic success.&#xD;
