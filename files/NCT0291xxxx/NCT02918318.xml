    <measure>DB Induction Phase: Percentage of Participants Showing Onset of Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 up to Day 28 (DB induction phase)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was defined as having a clinical response if there was at least 50% improvement from baseline in the MADRS total score with onset by Day 2 that was maintained to Day 28 in DB induction phase. Participants were allowed one excursion (non-response) on Days 8, 15 or 22, provided the score is at least 25% improvement. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60.

    <measure>DB Induction Phase: Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Total Score up to Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 28 (DB induction pahse)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S provides measure of severity of participant's illness including participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior and impact of symptoms on ability to function. CGI-S evaluates severity of psychopathology on scale of 0 to 7. Considering total clinical experience, participant is assessed on severity of mental illness according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among most extremely ill patients. Values of 0 (not assessed) were excluded from analysis. CGI-S permits global evaluation of participant's condition at given time.</description>

    <measure>DB Induction Phase: Change From Baseline in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) up to Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 28 (DB induction phase)</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7 was a brief and validated 7-item self-report assessment of overall anxiety. Participants respond to each item using a 4-point scale with response categories of 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day. Item responses are summed to yield a total score with a range of 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate more anxiety. The recall period is 2 weeks. The severity of the GAD-7 is categorized as follows: None (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14) and Severe (15 -21).</description>

    <description>Time to relapse in participants with remission at the end of the double-blind phase was defined as the time between induction phase and the first documentation of a relapse event during the posttreatment phase. Relapse was defined as any of the following: 1) MADRS total score &gt;= 22 for 2 consecutive assessments. The date of the second MADRS assessment was used for the date of relapse; 2) Hospitalization for worsening depression or any other clinically relevant event determined per clinical judgment to be suggestive of relapse of depressive illness like suicide attempt, completed suicide, or hospitalization for suicide prevention. If hospitalized for any of these events, start date of hospitalization was used as relapse date. If participant was not hospitalized, event date was used. 3) If both relapse criteria were met, earlier date was defined as date of relapse. Remission was defined as MADRS total score &lt;=12.</description>

        <title>Double-Blind (DB) Induction Phase: Change From Baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score up to Day 28</title>
        <description>MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition. Negative change in score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>DB Induction Phase: Percentage of Participants With Remission Based on MADRS Total Score</title>
        <description>A participant was considered in remission at a given time point if the MADRS total score &lt;=12. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>

        <title>DB Induction Phase: Percentage of Participants Showing Onset of Clinical Response</title>
        <description>A participant was defined as having a clinical response if there was at least 50% improvement from baseline in the MADRS total score with onset by Day 2 that was maintained to Day 28 in DB induction phase. Participants were allowed one excursion (non-response) on Days 8, 15 or 22, provided the score is at least 25% improvement. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60.

          <title>DB Induction Phase: Percentage of Participants Showing Onset of Clinical Response</title>
          <description>A participant was defined as having a clinical response if there was at least 50% improvement from baseline in the MADRS total score with onset by Day 2 that was maintained to Day 28 in DB induction phase. Participants were allowed one excursion (non-response) on Days 8, 15 or 22, provided the score is at least 25% improvement. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>
          <population>FAS (DB) included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study agent during DB induction phase. Participants with missed assessments or discontinued early were not considered to have onset of clinical response. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this OM.</population>

        <description>CGI-S provides measure of severity of participant's illness including participant's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior and impact of symptoms on ability to function. CGI-S evaluates severity of psychopathology on scale of 0 to 7. Considering total clinical experience, participant is assessed on severity of mental illness according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among most extremely ill patients. Values of 0 (not assessed) were excluded from analysis. CGI-S permits global evaluation of participant's condition at given time.</description>

        <description>Time to relapse in participants with remission at the end of the double-blind phase was defined as the time between induction phase and the first documentation of a relapse event during the posttreatment phase. Relapse was defined as any of the following: 1) MADRS total score &gt;= 22 for 2 consecutive assessments. The date of the second MADRS assessment was used for the date of relapse; 2) Hospitalization for worsening depression or any other clinically relevant event determined per clinical judgment to be suggestive of relapse of depressive illness like suicide attempt, completed suicide, or hospitalization for suicide prevention. If hospitalized for any of these events, start date of hospitalization was used as relapse date. If participant was not hospitalized, event date was used. 3) If both relapse criteria were met, earlier date was defined as date of relapse. Remission was defined as MADRS total score &lt;=12.</description>

        <description>A participant was considered in remission at a given time point if the MADRS total score &lt;=12. MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>

          <description>MADRS is clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity, and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. Scale consists of 10 items (apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts), each of which is scored from 0 (item is not present or is normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores represent more severe condition.</description>
          <population>FAS (OL) included all participants who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study agent during the OL induction phase.</population>
