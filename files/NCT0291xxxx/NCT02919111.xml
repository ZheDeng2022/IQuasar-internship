  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent&#xD;
      (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in patients&#xD;
      with high risk disease prior to prostatectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.&#xD;
      Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled&#xD;
      PSMA-11 in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data to&#xD;
      obtain further approvals of the Ga-68-PSMA-11 compound, so that this agent will become&#xD;
      available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients. In the pre-prostatectomy&#xD;
      population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity for&#xD;
      detection on nodal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This compound has been shown to be superior to choline based PET agents for the staging of&#xD;
      prostate cancer, both Carbon-11 and Fluorine-18 compounds. But this compound was not patented&#xD;
      and therefore no company or private entity will make the investment required to bring&#xD;
      Ga-68-PSMA-11 to market. In the vacuum of availability, academic groups must take the lead in&#xD;
      order to collect the necessary data for future FDA approval.&#xD;

    <measure>Sensitivity of PSMA PET for the Detection of Regional Nodal Metastases Compared to Pathology at Radical Prostatectomy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity is defined as the ratio of the proportion of the patients who have the condition of interest and whose test results are positive over the number who have the disease. Patients who have a positive node on imaging and on pathology will be considered a true-positive. Patients who have no nodes on imaging and pathology will be considered true-negatives. Patients with positive nodes on imaging and negative on pathology will be considered false positives and those with positive nodes on pathology but negative on imaging will be considered false negatives. Follow-up scans for up to one year can be used in analysis</description>

    <description>Specificity is defined as the number of non-diseased participants correctly classified divided by all non-diseased individuals. Patients who have a positive node on imaging and on pathology will be considered a true-positive. Patients who have no nodes on imaging and pathology will be considered true-negatives. Patients with positive nodes on imaging and negative on pathology will be considered false positives and those with positive nodes on pathology but negative on imaging will be considered false negatives.

    <description>PPV is the proportion of patients with positive test who actually have the disease. Patients who have a positive node on imaging and on pathology will be considered a true-positive. Patients who have no nodes on imaging and pathology will be considered true-negatives. Patients with positive nodes on imaging and negative on pathology will be considered false positives and those with positive nodes on pathology but negative on imaging will be considered false negatives.

    <description>NPV is the ratio of participants truly diagnosed as negative to all those who had negative test results. Patients who have a positive node on imaging and on pathology will be considered a true-positive. Patients who have no nodes on imaging and pathology will be considered true- negatives. Patients with positive nodes on imaging and negative on pathology will be considered false positives and those with positive nodes on pathology but negative on imaging will be considered false negatives.

Ga-68 labeled PSMA-11 PET: Patients will be imaged using Ga-68 labeled PSMA-11 PET to determine if the presence of metastatic disease. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a protein expressed on prostate cancer cells that can be imaged using small molecules that target this protocol.</description>

        <description>Sensitivity is defined as the ratio of the proportion of the patients who have the condition of interest and whose test results are positive over the number who have the disease. Patients who have a positive node on imaging and on pathology will be considered a true-positive. Patients who have no nodes on imaging and pathology will be considered true-negatives. Patients with positive nodes on imaging and negative on pathology will be considered false positives and those with positive nodes on pathology but negative on imaging will be considered false negatives.
