  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard operative approach to pulmonary lesions has been via postero-lateral thoracotomy&#xD;
      and direct vision. This technique has some advantages but its morbidity is significant. Some&#xD;
      surgeons advocate a resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) to reduce the impact&#xD;
      on chest wall and the impairment on respiratory mechanic. However, an evidence for&#xD;
      superiority of the approach minimally invasive is lacking, particularly for the difficult&#xD;
      assessment of the change in pulmonary function. The aim of this study is to compare VATS-&#xD;
      over open lobectomy regarding the differences of chest wall kinematic, analyzed by&#xD;
      optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP).&#xD;

      Rationale: The standard operative approach to pulmonary lesions has been via postero-lateral&#xD;
      thoracotomy and direct vision. This technique has some advantages but its morbidity is&#xD;
      significant. Some surgeons advocate a resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) to&#xD;
      reduce the impact on chest wall and the impairment on respiratory mechanic. However, an&#xD;
      evidence for superiority of the approach minimally invasive is lacking, particularly for the&#xD;
      difficult assessment of the change in pulmonary function and its relation with chest wall&#xD;
      modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to compare VATS- over open lobectomy regarding the&#xD;
      differences of chest wall kinematic analyzed by optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective mono-centre single blind trial. Study population: Adult patients&#xD;
      of either gender candidate for pulmonary lobectomy for non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients are submitted to pulmonary lobectomy by video-assisted technique or by&#xD;
      postero-lateral thoracotomy. This decision follows the usual clinical evaluations, regardless&#xD;
      of whether or not the study enrollment. In particular, they are candidates for&#xD;
      postero-lateral thoracotomy if: tumors were close to the hilum or other relevant anatomical&#xD;
      structures, or the computed tomography demonstrated hilar calcific lymph-nodes or the lesions&#xD;
      were of greater than 4 cm diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint is evaluation of modification of respiratory kinematic after pulmonary lobectomy,&#xD;
      assessed by OEP. In particular, the volume variation of pulmonary rib cage of the treated&#xD;
      side versus the relative untreated side and the differences. Respiratory movements and&#xD;
      thoracic and abdominal volume changes will be recorded continuously by analyzing the&#xD;
      movements of retro-reflective markers using 8 video-cameras connected to an automatic&#xD;
      optoelectronic motion analyzer. Subjects are prepared for OEP (markers). Baseline spirometry&#xD;
      is take prior to exercise test. All exercise take place on an electromagnetically braked&#xD;
      cycle-ergometer. Throughout the protocol heart rate, oxygen saturation and dyspnoea with the&#xD;
      Borg scale are recorded. Ventilatory kinematics are monitored throughout exercise using OEP.&#xD;
      This OEP analysis involves compartmentalization of the chest into three sections: pulmonary&#xD;
      rib cage, abdominal rib cage, and abdomen to determine the contribution of each component to&#xD;
      total chest wall volume.&#xD;

    <description>Pulmonary lobectomy via VATS. VATS starts with a utility incision, approximately 4 cm in length, anterior to the latissimus dorsi muscle at the 4th intercostal space. Muscle fibers are split without cutting and a wound protector is regularly placed in site. The camera port is placed in the 6th or 7th intercostal space at the anterior axillary line and a third 10-mm access is made at the same intercostal space at the posterior axillary line. The hilum is approached anteriorly</description>

    <description>Pulmonary lobectomy via posterolateral thoracotomy (PLT). PLT consists in a standard 10-15 muscle-sparing incision at 4th intercostal space, rib divaricators are utilized and the hilum is approached posteriorly as previously described</description>
