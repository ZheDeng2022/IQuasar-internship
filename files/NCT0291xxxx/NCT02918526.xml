      The purpose of the study will be to record the hemodynamic response measured by traditional&#xD;
      methods (non-invasive blood pressure and ECG) and Pressure Recording Analytical Method in&#xD;
      patients undergoing laryngeal mask placement compared with the hemodynamic response measured&#xD;
      in patients undergoing laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation for performing surgery in&#xD;

      Introduction Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation may cause significant hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      in the patient and induce cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have sought methods to reduce this risk (1-5). The extraglottic not&#xD;
      involving either laryngoscopy or their passage through the vocal cords, have proven&#xD;
      protective of the possible cardiovascular complications resulting from the placement of&#xD;
      respiratory prosthesis (6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of hemodynamic changes resulting from the procedures for airway management with&#xD;
      extraglottic have not previously been carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MostCare (Vytech, Vygon Italia srl, Padova, Italy) is a monitor provided for more than 10&#xD;
      years at the obstetric gynecological anesthesia unit able to evaluate the hemodynamic changes&#xD;
      in a patient based on the Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a measurement method of the cardio-circulatory performance of a patient that does not&#xD;
      require calibration and / or insertion of a pre-estimated data because the method of analysis&#xD;
      of the wave form of the arterial pressure is developed completely a priori (8). The&#xD;
      measurement derives from the simultaneous analysis of the components of a pulsatile flow and&#xD;
      the continuous flow as a ratio between the area under the curve of the pulsatile portion of&#xD;
      the systolic pressure and the characteristic impedance Z (t). The PRAM method has proven&#xD;
      effective in many clinical settings (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Device (DM) will be used in accordance with the indications of use for which it&#xD;
      has acquired the CE mark. A morphology detection system linked to high blood pressure curve&#xD;
      detected through non-invasive Masimo oximetry system supplied to the Hospital will be used&#xD;
      Purpose of the study The purpose of the research will be to record the hemodynamic response&#xD;
      measured by traditional methods (non-invasive blood pressure and ECG) and PRAM method in&#xD;
      patients undergoing placement laryngeal mask compared with the hemodynamic response measured&#xD;
      in patients undergoing laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation for performing surgery in&#xD;
      gynecological area and assess the differences with the two methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a prospective observational study. Data will be collected from all&#xD;
      consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecologic surgery for a period of 3&#xD;
      months or until the minimum number of 94 patients (see section statistical analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room the patient will undergo to active pre-warming with hot air, peripheral&#xD;
      venous cannulation and premedication with midazolam 0,04 mg/kg, and fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg body&#xD;
      weight. After the positioning of the standard monitoring systems (ECG, Non-Invasive Blood&#xD;
      Pressure, Pulseoximetry, Neuromuscular Transmission), the signal from the Pulseoximetry will&#xD;
      also be analyzed by the MostCare monitoring system that allows to apply the measuring method&#xD;
      PRAM noninvasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 minutes of high flows O2, propofol 2 mg/kg body weight and rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg body&#xD;
      weight will be administered sequentially to the patient. Anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      propofol continuous infusion (9-12 mg/kg body weight /hour) and remifentanil continuous&#xD;
      infusion (0.2 mcg/kg body weight /minute ). At the disappearance of the adductor muscle&#xD;
      response to electrical stimulation of the thumb &quot;Train of four&quot; (TOF) applied to the ulnar&#xD;
      nerve the positioning maneuver of the respiratory device will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with direct laryngoscopy in the case of endotracheal intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with direct insertion in the case of laryngeal mask placement. Proper placement will be&#xD;
           evaluated by chest auscultation, spirometry and analysis of the concentration and the&#xD;
           carbon dioxide curve in exhaled gases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from the PRAM and the usual monitoring will be recorded on a special sheet&#xD;
      by an outside observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of failed positioning of the respiratory device, the procedure will be repeated&#xD;
      and in case of further failure will proceed as indicated by national and hospital guidelines&#xD;
      (10), but the patient will still be excluded from the study ..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the respiratory device will depend on the type of intervention scheduled in the&#xD;
      operating program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamic and monitoring data will be recorded every minute for 5 minutes for each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be 3 months (or in any case until reaching the minimum number of 94&#xD;
      cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be divided, retrospectively, in two groups according to the type of device&#xD;
      used for airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be compared on the basis of age and anthropometric parameters. An&#xD;
      analysis of the hemodynamic response of the two groups of patients to the positioning of the&#xD;
      respiratory device will then conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A recent study (11), that analyzed the cardiac index changes in response&#xD;
      to tracheal intubation with laryngoscope Mcintosh in comparison to the video laryngoscope&#xD;
      laryngoscopy, showed a difference of 1 L/min/m2 (from 3.1±0.6 to 4.3±1.4 with laryngoscope&#xD;
      McIntosh vs 3.0±0.3 to 3.2 ± 1.1 with videolaryngoscope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, to test the hypothesis that the cardiac index difference using the airway&#xD;
      management with traditional intubation compared to the use of the laryngeal mask is greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 1 L/min/m2, having fixed the first type error to the 5% and the study power&#xD;
      to 80%, it is possible to calculate that the sample size needed for a one-tailed test is&#xD;
      represented by 47 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average of the data collected in each group of patients will be compared with Student's t&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results To verify, in two of homogeneous population groups for anthropometric and&#xD;
      clinical data, the least impact on the cardiovascular system produced by the placement of&#xD;
      laryngeal mask compared to that induced by endotracheal intubation with conventional&#xD;
      laryngoscopy taking advantage of non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring system of the pulse&#xD;
      oximetry MostCare (methodology PRAM) ever tested in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also to check the hemodynamic impact of any repeated attempts to both of the above maneuvers&#xD;
      for airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ownership of the results will be accredited by the principal investigator on behalf of the&#xD;
      AOU Careggi and the University of Florence as headings of him which has neither received nor&#xD;
      will receive any fee for the conduct of the study.&#xD;
