      This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, Phase I&#xD;
      study in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single oral doses of AKB-4924 will be investigated in up to 6 sequential cohorts of 8 healthy&#xD;
      male subjects. Primarily 6 dose levels are planned; the proposed doses are 20 mg, 60 mg, 120&#xD;
      mg, 240 mg, 360 mg, and 480 mg. Actual doses may be decreased or increased based on the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the drug, as determined by the Investigator and Sponsor.&#xD;
      Additional cohorts may be added as needed to test lower, higher, or repeat doses.&#xD;
