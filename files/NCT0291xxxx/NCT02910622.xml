  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The choice of treatments for cancers by systemic way - chemotherapy, hormone therapy and&#xD;
      targeted therapies - is currently defined by criteria for population groups and not to an&#xD;
      individual. These expensive treatments - in financial terms and quality of life - will be&#xD;
      effective for some and administered unnecessarily for other because there is no predictive&#xD;
      test of response for a given individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For breast cancer, the usual treatment includes the first surgery and adjuvant therapies&#xD;
      (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy ...) whose effectiveness will be assessed after many years as&#xD;
      the occurrence or not of a recurrence or metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These systemic treatments can also be administered before surgery to reduce the tumor volume&#xD;
      and secondarily allow less mutilating surgery: it is the principle of treatment neo adjuvant.&#xD;
      In this case, the efficiency will be evaluated more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, a patient with breast cancer suspicion has a biopsy which confirms the diagnosis&#xD;
      and defined the parameters (hormone receptors, cytological grade, receptor monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies ...) that guide to the most appropriate type of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor size is evaluated in neo adjuvant pre-treatment by imaging: mammography, ultrasound and&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this medication, the evaluation of the response is achieved by radiology and&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological examination evaluates and precise response by the criteria of Chevallier and /&#xD;
      or Sataloff. An ex vivo test for predicting the response of cells to different chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens, the oncogramme, was developed by Oncomedics, a young company whose technology is&#xD;
      derived from the University of Limoges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response and / or histopathological could be compared in a reasonable time (2-6&#xD;
      months), the results of the oncogramme proposed by Oncomedics whether the efficiency obtained&#xD;
      in vivo is that predicted by the ex vivo test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the same in the metastatic setting when there is an available target for biopsy and&#xD;
      assessment of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of ovarian cancer in advanced stages can also benefit from a radiological and&#xD;
      histopathological evaluation strategy before and after systemic treatment to compare the in&#xD;
      vivo results with those predicted by ex vivo by Oncomedics.&#xD;

      A fragment of Breast/Ovarian tumors will be taken from a specimen or a cold biopsy, tissue&#xD;
      from patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ovarian cancer before starting an induction&#xD;
      treatment stage IIIc and IV pleural IFGO operable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Culturing the cells obtained from the tumor fragment by Oncomedics in a defined medium&#xD;
           and provided for enriching tumor cells compared to stromal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintaining the cells in culture for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effects of conventional chemotherapy (corresponding to protocols) on these cells for 72&#xD;
           hours (growth chambers) by Oncomedics (chimio-oncogramme).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each chemotherapy tested, measuring the proportion of dead cells / total cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retained by Oncomedics results, not given to the nursing team. The patient will be&#xD;
           treated and followed up in the usual way.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the study, comparing the in vitro results (chimio-oncogramme) to the&#xD;
           patient response to the same chemotherapy.&#xD;
