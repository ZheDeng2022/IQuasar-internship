  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural changes are commonly used as therapeutic maneuver to enhance or reduce cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion. For instance, in acute stroke, the patient can be positioned in head down tilt&#xD;
      position so as to increase perfusion of cerebral tissues perfusion. In During stroke and in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients and during stroke, varying degrees a various loss of cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation is loss are usually observed. The aim of this study is to assess cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion with ASL perfusion in human subjects in different conditions: healthy, hypertensive&#xD;
      and stroke.&#xD;

      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen stroke patients, eighteen hypertensive patients and eighteen healthy subjects (men&#xD;
      and women) will be enrolled. The investigator will use a 1.5 Tesla MRI device with a large&#xD;
      magnet bore (70 cm) allowing positions change. Two measures will be performed, one in supine&#xD;
      position and the other in head down position (-20°). A 3D FSE ASL sequence will be acquired&#xD;
      and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) maps will be reconstructed. Volume of interest (VOI) will be&#xD;
      placed on cortical grey matter (frontal and posterior gyrus), on subcortical deep grey matter&#xD;
      (caudate nuclei, thalami) and subcortical white matter (semi oval centers). Differences in&#xD;
      CBF values (in mL/100g/min) will be analyzed using SAS 9.3 software for Windows (SAS&#xD;
      Institute, Cary North Carolina, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBF is expected to significantly vary between the supine and head down positions. It is&#xD;
      expected to at least increase in the head down position, for stroke patients. For healthy&#xD;
      subjects and hypertensive patients, cerebral autoregulation may limit CBF increase although&#xD;
      an increasing trend for CBF is expected.&#xD;

    <description>The endpoint is the change in the value of the cerebral blood flow ( ml / 100g / min) depending on the switching position ( 0 ° and -20 °). This development will be assessed in different brain regions . In particular, it will be searched in excess of a threshold of significance .&#xD;
This will be accomplished independently by two experienced readers (knowing that the variation between and within road has been assessed) . If a significant difference between the two players, it will be made a consensual common measure.</description>
