    <textblock>
      The SYNSEQ study intends to assess the positive left ventricular dP/dt max achieved by&#xD;
      MultiSpot LV pacing (either simultaneously or sequentially) in comparison to the response&#xD;
      achieved by the current (standard) BiV pacing configuration in patients indicated/recommended&#xD;
      for cardiac resynchronization therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following pacing configurations will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biventricular pacing (BiV):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacing will be performed on one LV electrode pair, (at 3 different longitudinal locations),&#xD;
      and on the tip of the RV-lead. In total, three different pacing BiV settings will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Configuration 1: RV + LV lateral Apex, Configuration 2: RV + LV lateral Mid,&#xD;
      Configuration 3: RV + LV lateral Base (Reference: Standard CRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MultiSpot simultaneous LV-ventricular pacing (MultiSpot-SYN):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pacing will be performed on 3 electrodes on the LV wall, placed at different longitudinal&#xD;
      locations, and on the tip of the RV-lead simultaneously. Configuration 4: RV + LV lateral&#xD;
      Apex + LV lateral Mid + LV lateral Base&#xD;
&#xD;
      MultiSpot sequential LV-ventricular pacing (MultiSpot-SEQ):&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 electrodes on the LV wall will be paced sequentially. The RV electrode will be paced&#xD;
      simultaneously with last paced LV electrode.The timing-sequence and the amount of spots will&#xD;
      depend on the electrical delays measured during the experiments. Configuration 5: LV lateral&#xD;
      Apex =&gt; LV lateral Mid =&gt; LV lateral Base + RV&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage Change in Positive Left Ventricular dP/dt Max (mmHG/Sec)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed for the time of the EP procedure, which had a median duration of 48 min</time_frame>
    <description>LV dP/dt max is a measurement of the initial velocity of myocardial contraction and is derivative of the LV-pressure. The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median dP/dt max during pacing On] - (median baseline dP/dt max during pacing Off])/[median dP/dt max during pacing Off]. From all percentage changes for a given pacing configuration and subject, a regression analysis is performed to determine the regression predicted highest percentage change. The presented percentage change is the average over all subjects.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between Percentage Change LV dP/dt Max and Percentage Change Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed for the time of the EP procedure, which had a median duration of 48 min</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by invasive arterial blood line connected to a sensitive membrane displacement sensor. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were collected.The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median pressure during pacing On] - (median pressure during pacing Off])/[median pressure during pacing Off]. Correlation will be summarized over all pacing configurations and time points since the interest is in the overall correlation between LV dP/dt max and other measurements, not in the correlation per pacing configuration or per time point. The general linear model as described in Blank &amp; Altman, Biometrical Journal 310 (1995), p 446, was used to determine the correlation.</description>

    <measure>Correlation Between Percentage Change LV dP/dt Max and Q-LV Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed for the time of the EP procedure, which had a median duration of 48 min</time_frame>
    <description>Derived from intra-cardiac leads (invasive) and surface electrodes (non-invasive) respectively. The Q-LV interval is defined as the time from the onset of the QRS width of the surface ECG to the first large positive or negative peak of the LV electrogram (EGM) during a cardiac cycle. The Q-LV ratio will be calculated as Q-LV/QRS duration. Correlation will be summarized over all pacing configurations since the interest is in the overall correlation between LV dP/dt max and other measurements, not in the correlation per pacing configuration. The general linear model as described in Blank &amp; Altman, Biometrical Journal 310 (1995), p 446, was used to determine the correlation between % change LV dP/dt max and Q-LV ratio.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change in Positive Left Ventricular dP/dt Max (mmHG/Sec)</title>
        <description>LV dP/dt max is a measurement of the initial velocity of myocardial contraction and is derivative of the LV-pressure. The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median dP/dt max during pacing On] - (median baseline dP/dt max during pacing Off])/[median dP/dt max during pacing Off]. From all percentage changes for a given pacing configuration and subject, a regression analysis is performed to determine the regression predicted highest percentage change. The presented percentage change is the average over all subjects.</description>

        <population>The analysis population contains all subjects who completed electrophysiological study with analyzable data. For some patients not all pacing configurations were applied. Two patients missed Multispot sequential pacing and one patient missed BiV mid pacing.</population>

        <title>Correlation Between Percentage Change LV dP/dt Max and Percentage Change Blood Pressure</title>
        <description>Measured by invasive arterial blood line connected to a sensitive membrane displacement sensor. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were collected.The percentage changes correspond to a percentage change between a pacing configuration (pacing on, e.g., Multispot pacing) and baseline (LV pacing off). There are several repetitions of pacing off and on for each pacing configuration. For one repetition, the percentage change is determined as ([median pressure during pacing On] - (median pressure during pacing Off])/[median pressure during pacing Off]. Correlation will be summarized over all pacing configurations and time points since the interest is in the overall correlation between LV dP/dt max and other measurements, not in the correlation per pacing configuration or per time point. The general linear model as described in Blank &amp; Altman, Biometrical Journal 310 (1995), p 446, was used to determine the correlation.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Percentage Change LV dP/dt Max and Q-LV Ratio</title>
        <description>Derived from intra-cardiac leads (invasive) and surface electrodes (non-invasive) respectively. The Q-LV interval is defined as the time from the onset of the QRS width of the surface ECG to the first large positive or negative peak of the LV electrogram (EGM) during a cardiac cycle. The Q-LV ratio will be calculated as Q-LV/QRS duration. Correlation will be summarized over all pacing configurations since the interest is in the overall correlation between LV dP/dt max and other measurements, not in the correlation per pacing configuration. The general linear model as described in Blank &amp; Altman, Biometrical Journal 310 (1995), p 446, was used to determine the correlation between % change LV dP/dt max and Q-LV ratio.</description>
