      Registry Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry is a prospective single institution study of MRI examinations in patients with&#xD;
      pacemakers or ICD's who will undergo an MRI that is ordered for routine clinical care. The&#xD;
      purpose of the registry is to accumulate pre-and post-scan device interrogation data for the&#xD;
      purpose of determining the risk of MRI for patients with implantable devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry data will add to existing data on the safety of MRI scans for patients with&#xD;
      pacemakers and ICDs. This safety data may impact physicians' diagnostic choices for this&#xD;
      patient population. Patients with conditions for whom MRI is the best diagnostic modality but&#xD;
      who have not been able to undergo MRI scanning may be able to do so through registry&#xD;
      participation. The diagnostic information obtained from the scan may assist physicians'&#xD;
      treatment decisions and may ultimately affect patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, to our knowledge, previous registries of MRI's in non-conditional cardiac&#xD;
      devices have been limited to academic centers. This registry would be among the first to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility and safety of this approach in a community hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry research involves acquiring and analyzing the data of device function and&#xD;
      adverse events related to the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for MRI will be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the patient's medical&#xD;
      history and treatment plan/goals, independent of the registry and research purposes. Only&#xD;
      patients with implanted devices with orders for clinically indicated MRI scans will be&#xD;
      considered for registry inclusion. Clinical review will be performed and the patient&#xD;
      considered after determination that no other imaging modality would be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriateness of the MRI study must be discussed, in person or via phone call, between&#xD;
      a cardiac radiologist, as determined by Paul Leslie, M.D., and the requesting physician. The&#xD;
      discussion should include consideration of alternative imaging modalities and diagnostic&#xD;
      quality of MRI imaging of requested body region given implanted device(s). The requesting&#xD;
      physician is then responsible for discussing with the patient and/or their medical proxy the&#xD;
      reasoning for the determination, based on the final decision made by a radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be screened prior to enrollment. Any patient with any commercially&#xD;
      available pacemaker or ICD system implanted after 2001 who meet all of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and none of the exclusion criteria, and who require a medically-indicated MRI as described&#xD;
      above will be eligible to enroll in the study. The presence/absence of&#xD;
      capped/abandoned/epicardial leads/subcutaneous coil will be confirmed and documented by&#xD;
      review of the most recent chest x-ray obtained. The x-ray must post-date the most recent&#xD;
      device/lead intervention, as determined by a review of the patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an MRI procedure is deemed absolutely necessary, the MRI will be performed at the&#xD;
      Lancaster General Hospital Lime Street MRI facility. MRI scan sequences, field intensity and&#xD;
      field(s) of exposure will be selected to minimize risk to the patient while gaining needed&#xD;
      diagnostic information for diagnosis or therapy management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI will be performed with a 1.5 T scanner utilizing institutional protocols and the&#xD;
      following settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal operating mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SAR ≤ 2.0 W/kg per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, a pacemaker technologist or manufacturer clinical representative will&#xD;
      interrogate the pacemaker or ICD and record the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's underlying rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P-wave and R-wave amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead impedance (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery voltage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrhythmia history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tachyarrhythmia therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following pacemaker/ICD parameters will be deactivated for the duration of the MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnet response (ICD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVC response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Noise reversion response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ventricular sense response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mode switching&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tachycardia detection/therapies (ICD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGM triggers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are not pacemaker dependent will have their pacemaker/ICD programmed to&#xD;
      AAI/VVI/DDI at 40 beats per minute for the duration of the MRI. Patients who are pacemaker&#xD;
      dependent (pacing at programmed lower rate during the pre-scan interrogation) will have their&#xD;
      pacemaker/ICD programmed to AOO/VOO/DOO at the programmed lower rate for the duration of the&#xD;
      MRI. Emergency equipment, including a MRI compatible defibrillator and transcutaneous&#xD;
      pacemaker, will be available throughout the procedure in the event of an adverse clinical&#xD;
      event. In addition to radiology staff, a pacemaker technologist or manufacturer clinical&#xD;
      representative and an EP tech/RN with current ACLS will be present for the duration of the&#xD;
      procedure. An EP physician/advanced practice provider (APP) must be immediately available&#xD;
      (i.e., in the hospital) to provide medical intervention, such as placement of a temporary&#xD;
      external pacemaker if required. In the event that a code is called by the MRI staff, hospital&#xD;
      protocol indicates that ER staff will respond to the code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiology staff and the electrophysiology (EP) technologist or nurse with current ACLS&#xD;
      certification will monitor the following patient parameters at least every 5 minutes&#xD;
      throughout the MRI scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the following adverse symptoms/events occur during the scan, the test will be&#xD;
      immediately terminated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Burning/pulling sensation in device pocket/chest during MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potentially lethal/previously non-diagnosed arrhythmias during MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spontaneous and unanticipated pacing rate change&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SOB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeling of heat/pulling in the chest or device pocket&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be removed from the scanner to the holding area and the device interrogated&#xD;
      and reprogrammed to original parameters or as indicated by interrogation. If needed,&#xD;
      emergency treatment will be provided as per ACLS protocols or at the discretion of the&#xD;
      monitoring physician. The following parameters will be compared to the pre-MRI results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's underlying rhythm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P-wave and R-wave amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead impedance (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery voltage&#xD;
&#xD;
      All device-related adverse events/symptoms will be documented on the data collection form and&#xD;
      reported to the IRB. The patient will remain in the MRI suite holding area until medically&#xD;
      stable. The need for further treatment will be at the discretion of the monitoring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EP physician/APP will review and compare the pre/post MRI device data prior to the&#xD;
      patient's discharge from the MRI suite. Following testing, the pacemaker or ICD will be&#xD;
      reprogrammed to the pre-procedure parameters. The need for device reprogramming related to&#xD;
      the MRI scan will be based on the clinical judgment of the attending electrophysiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not experience any device related adverse events during the MRI will return&#xD;
      for one follow-up visit 1-6 weeks after the MRI. The follow-up visit will include&#xD;
      pacemaker/ICD interrogation and testing to confirm appropriate function. At a minimum, device&#xD;
      interrogation/testing will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P-wave and R-wave amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead impedance (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery voltage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience one or more device-related adverse events during the MRI will return&#xD;
      1-7 days post-MRI for follow-up pacemaker/ICD testing to confirm appropriate function. At a&#xD;
      minimum, device interrogation/testing will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial and right/left ventricular pacing thresholds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  P-wave and R-wave amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead impedance (atrial, ventricular, high voltage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery voltage&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for further follow-up will be determined by the physician based on testing results&#xD;
      and clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the follow-up device interrogation, including whether MRI-related adverse&#xD;
      events have resolved, will be documented and kept in the device chart and recorded in the&#xD;
      Registry database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the insurance provider does not cover the MRI and device checks, those costs may be the&#xD;
      full responsibility of the patient. The patient will be informed of the status of the&#xD;
      pre-authorization before scheduling the MRI.&#xD;
