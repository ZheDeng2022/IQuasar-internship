      RATIONALE Controlling cardiovascular risk factors has been proven to be effective in&#xD;
      prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Nonetheless, significant treatment&#xD;
      gaps have been demonstrated repeatedly in numerous surveys. A recent study of Canadian adults&#xD;
      filling prescriptions for hypertension or dyslipidemia demonstrated that the majority&#xD;
      remained overweight and sedentary despite being at risk of developing CVD. Medication&#xD;
      adherence has been shown to be poor with up to 50% of patients stopping therapy after one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-centred care can lead to improved clinical management and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
      Adherence with prescribed therapy can also be improved if individuals understand the&#xD;
      importance of their risk factors, are aware of their overall health status and participate in&#xD;
      decision making surrounding pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community pharmacists are frontline healthcare professionals who can identify patients at&#xD;
      risk of CVD, assess their adherence with recommended lifestyle behaviours or drug therapy and&#xD;
      engage them in shared decision making surrounding health promotion strategies. Local&#xD;
      pharmacies could effectively become readily accessible community health centres nationwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives. The primary objective is to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      the impact of a community pharmacy intervention to improve the management of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors vs a basic e-health education program. The intervention will include a&#xD;
      cardiovascular or cardiometabolic risk assessment providing the individual with their&#xD;
      Cardiovascular or Cardiometabolic Age. Individuals at increased risk of CVD and/or with&#xD;
      modifiable risk factors will also be offered a one year subscription to a multidisciplinary,&#xD;
      pharmacy based, e-health promotion program to improve management of CVD risk factors such as&#xD;
      weight loss and increased physical activity and track their progress in managing their risk&#xD;
      factors and reducing their Cardiovascular or cardiometabolic Age. Changes in CVD risk&#xD;
      factors, Cardiovascular/cardiometabolic Age, and uptake or adherence to medications and&#xD;
      lifestyle changes will be examined 3 months, 6 months and one year post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis. Investigators hypothesize that engaging patients in a discussion of their&#xD;
      Cardiovascular or Cardiometabolic Age and management of their risk factors will result in&#xD;
      improved healthy lifestyle habits moreover increased physical activity and weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve hundred subjects will be recruited from 30 to 60 pharmacies across Canada each&#xD;
      providing 20 to 40 study subjects. Recruitment will occur over 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoppers Drug Mart and Sobeys/Lawtons are chain pharmacies that have agreed to participate in&#xD;
      the study and will identify a minimum of 20 and 10 pharmacies from within their chains&#xD;
      respectively. Pharmacy contacts will be sent summary of the research project and will be&#xD;
      invited to participate by senior management through internal company communications.&#xD;
      Additional pharmacies will be included in the study if additional funding to remunerate the&#xD;
      pharmacists becomes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacy will be eligible to participate if it has an automated blood pressure system, a&#xD;
      calibrated weight scale, a consultation area with a computer, internet access and the&#xD;
      pharmacist is willing to recruit and enroll at least 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a pharmacist has agreed to participate, pharmacist will be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      conference call. A one-hour training webinar will be provided to the pharmacists prior to&#xD;
      initiating recruitment. Each pharmacist will have access to the website so that pharmacist&#xD;
      can try the health assessments, read the e-health coaching educational modules and personally&#xD;
      participate in the health challenges. Pharmacist will be given access to a series of online&#xD;
      training modules for cardiovascular/cardiometabolic risk assessments and how to engage&#xD;
      patients to improve lifestyle behaviours such as exercise, weight loss and smoking cessation.&#xD;
      Pharmacists responsibilities will include taking the participant's blood pressure, weight and&#xD;
      waist measurements and enabling the participant to get recent blood lipids. The pharmacist&#xD;
      will also interpret their cardiovascular/cardiometabolic risk profile and provide patient&#xD;
      with the appropriate educational materials. This visit is expected to take 20-25 minutes.&#xD;
      Pharmacists will also be encouraged to have participants return for follow-up visits every 3&#xD;
      months to discuss strategies to achieve their behaviour change goals and review results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited by the pharmacist or pharmacy staff using number of strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study recruitment will be promoted within each pharmacy using flyers and posters. Any&#xD;
           individual at increased cardiovascular risk who is interested in reducing their&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk by losing excess body weight or increasing their fitness level will&#xD;
           be encouraged to view study information and register directly on the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individuals who are sedentary, overweight will be invited to enroll in the study by&#xD;
           registering on website.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruited subjects can promote the program to friends and family members. In such cases,&#xD;
           they will be allocated to the same treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Individuals will be invited to register on myhealthcheckup website. Access&#xD;
      to their account will be limited to the participant, members of the research team and their&#xD;
      local pharmacist. Those who are interested in participating will be asked to sign the online&#xD;
      informed consent form. Participants will be asked to complete a health assessment for&#xD;
      heart/diabetes and fitness. Included in this assessment are two validated questionnaires&#xD;
      including The International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Self-Efficacy for&#xD;
      Lifestyle Behaviour Change Questionnaire and the questions required to determine if the&#xD;
      participant can exercise safely. Additional health assessments will be completed at study&#xD;
      entry and all of the assessments will be repeated at 3 months, 6 months, and one year post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the individuals have registered, signed Informed Consent Form and completed the&#xD;
      myhealthcheckup assessments, participants will select their pharmacist from a list provided&#xD;
      on the website and they will schedule their initial appointment with their pharmacist.&#xD;
      Selecting a health coach or pharmacist is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial visit with the pharmacist will take approximately 20 to 25 minutes. During this&#xD;
      visit, participants will be informed that more than one intervention is being evaluated and&#xD;
      that they have been randomly assigned to only one. More specifically, they have been assigned&#xD;
      to either the comprehensive e-health wellness program or the basic e-health education&#xD;
      program. Randomization will occur at registration. The pharmacist will take the patient's&#xD;
      blood pressure, weight and waist measurements, will interpret the patient's&#xD;
      cardiovascular/cardiometabolic risk profile and discuss a plan of action. Each participant&#xD;
      will be provided with baseline cardiovascular or cardiometabolic risk assessment. Both the&#xD;
      active intervention and the non-active intervention groups will have access to their&#xD;
      cardiovascular or cardiometabolic risk profile, including their calculated&#xD;
      cardiovascular/cardiometabolic age. It provides their estimated 10-year risk of developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and compares this result to Canadians of the same age and gender. The&#xD;
      risk profile will be interpreted by pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the information required for baseline cardiovascular risk assessment will be provided&#xD;
      by the participant. Clinical information will include: age, gender, presence of previously&#xD;
      diagnosed cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
      or lower extremity peripheral arterial disease; previously diagnosed diabetes, family history&#xD;
      of premature cardiovascular disease, smoking status, use of antihypertensive medication and&#xD;
      self-reported weekly exercise. Required clinical information includes resting blood pressure,&#xD;
      height, weight, waist circumference, and non-fasting cholesterol values. Blood pressure will&#xD;
      be measured. When actual lipid values are not known, the Framingham and Cardiovascular Age&#xD;
      risk profiles will be completed using the median lipid values for Canadians of same age and&#xD;
      gender and each participant will be told to ask their doctor for most recent values to update&#xD;
      their record and allow a more accurate risk assessment to be completed by the patient at home&#xD;
      online (intervention group only) or during their next visit to the pharmacy. This initial&#xD;
      visit should take 20-25 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of patients will be asked to return to their pharmacist after 3 months, 6 months&#xD;
      and 1 year for follow-up visit to have their cardiovascular risk profile updated. At each&#xD;
      visit, blood pressure, weight and waist circumference will be measured and any changes in&#xD;
      other risk factors will be noted. Each participant's progress will be evaluated during the&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active Intervention: Comprehensive e-health wellness program Given the primary focus on CVD&#xD;
      risk factors, each subject will be shown by the pharmacist how to update their Cardiovascular&#xD;
      or Cardiometabolic Age on website. Pharmacists will give subjects brief overview of what the&#xD;
      comprehensive e-health wellness program website has to offer them. Patients will be shown&#xD;
      that in addition to the cardiovascular or cardiometabolic risk, diabetes and fitness&#xD;
      assessments, they will be able to complete eight additional health assessments at entry into&#xD;
      the study and as they see fit. All of the assessments employ questionnaires considered the&#xD;
      gold standard for evaluating each of the respective health conditions which include: 1)&#xD;
      smoking and nicotine dependence 2) alcohol abuse and dependence 3) sleep 4) depression 5)&#xD;
      stress 6) fitness 7) nutrition and 8) body weight. Subjects will have access to summary of&#xD;
      health status results and identify where there is room for improvement according to current&#xD;
      disease treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacist will explain that participants have access to ehealth coaching based&#xD;
      educational modules with information relevant to a better understanding of exercise, weight&#xD;
      loss, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes and how to improve other areas such as sleep,&#xD;
      stress management, and smoking cessation. The goal of these ehealth coaching modules are&#xD;
      designed to encourage the individual to remain engaged and to take charge of their physical&#xD;
      and mental health by increasing their physical activity, making healthy food choices and&#xD;
      learning tools to decrease stress and improve sleep habits. Participants will receive daily&#xD;
      health tips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As information alone is often insufficient to promote behaviour change, participants will&#xD;
      have access to online physical activity challenges designed to motivate the user to engage in&#xD;
      regular exercise. The challenges provide tracking tools to facilitate the subject's&#xD;
      monitoring of their progress. Physical activity challenges can be designed to engage the&#xD;
      subject as a member of an online team. Participants can also compete individually in specific&#xD;
      challenges. Individuals participating in a team challenge will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      pseudonym to protect anonymity. Participants will have 24/7 access to their health record and&#xD;
      be encouraged to use the website to evaluate a range of health assessments, receive&#xD;
      information about specific health conditions, or engage in the online activity challenges.&#xD;
      Subjects can review what the pharmacist explained to them concerning the website by viewing a&#xD;
      brief video that will be provided on the website home page.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-active intervention: Basic e-health education program Individuals randomized to the&#xD;
      non-active intervention group will be provided with access to a modified version of the&#xD;
      e-health website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be shown by the pharmacist how to update their Cardiovascular Age or&#xD;
      Cardiometabolic Age on the website. Participants will have access to other health assessments&#xD;
      but not the ehealth coaching based educational modules or the challenges. Instead&#xD;
      participants will be provided on-line support tools including public domain education&#xD;
      material such as handouts on exercise, healthy eating, understanding and managing blood&#xD;
      pressure, diabetes and smoking cessation. These are currently available from the Public&#xD;
      Health Association of Canada. Participants will be asked to see their pharmacist for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit at 3 months, 6 months and one year. During these visits the pharmacist will&#xD;
      update participants' cardiovascular or cardiometabolic risk profile with current clinical&#xD;
      information including a measured blood pressure and weight. At the first follow-up visit and&#xD;
      at 1 year, all participants will be asked to have their blood lipids re-assessed.&#xD;
