    <textblock>
      Axillary lymph node dissection remains an integral part of surgical treatment of primarily&#xD;
      node-positive invasive breast cancer. In order to reduce the incidence of clinically relevant&#xD;
      seroma, a suction drain is routinely placed into the axillary cavity after axillary lymph&#xD;
      node dissection (ALND) by a separate stab incision. The pathogenesis of seroma involves the&#xD;
      collection of lymph fluid caused by dissection of lymph vessels and exudate. All coagulation&#xD;
      and fibrinolytic factors are produced and secreted by lymphatic endothelial cells and are&#xD;
      involved in the sealing of lymphatic capillaries. Local hemostyptic agents may therefore&#xD;
      reduce postoperative secretion from lymphatic fistulas caused by ALND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a multicenter prospective randomized control trial in Switzerland to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of TachoSil®, a ready-to-use, absorbable surgical patch (consisting of an&#xD;
      equine collagen sponge coated with human fibrinogen and human thrombin) on axillary drainage&#xD;
      after ALND for breast cancer. We hypothesize that the use of TachoSil® significantly and&#xD;
      relevantly reduces the volume and duration of axillary drainage after ALND. This has the&#xD;
      potential to increase patients' quality of life, as well as to shorten the length of hospital&#xD;
      stay and reduce hospital costs.&#xD;

      DISEASE BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland, 5'500 women and 30 to 40 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. It&#xD;
      accounts for one third of all cancer diagnoses among women, and causes approximately 1'350&#xD;
      deaths per year. Around 1'200 patients per year need axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as&#xD;
      part of their surgical treatment. ALND is indicated primarily for node-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer. Patients are identified either by pre-operative evaluation of the axilla or by&#xD;
      intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      THERAPY BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      During axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer, standard techniques for prevention&#xD;
      of leakage of dissected lymphatic vessels include the application of suture ligaments and the&#xD;
      use of bipolar electrocautery. Seroma prevention after ALND is achieved by placement of a&#xD;
      closed suction drain through the skin into the axillary cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed axillary suction drains are archaic tools to prevent seroma after ALND by simple&#xD;
      mechanical drainage at the cost of significant patient discomfort and increased length of&#xD;
      hospital stay. The sealing agent TachoSil® (consists of an equine collagen sponge coated with&#xD;
      human fibrinogen and human thrombin) allows a more nuanced approach to the management of&#xD;
      axillary seroma prevention and may support ongoing and decades-old efforts of the&#xD;
      professional breast cancer community to decrease the duration of axillary drainage and&#xD;
      finally, to abandon the drain from routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axillary lymph node dissection remains an integral part of surgical treatment of primarily&#xD;
      node-positive invasive breast cancer. In order to reduce the incidence of clinically relevant&#xD;
      seroma, a suction drain is routinely placed into the axillary cavity after ALND by a separate&#xD;
      stab incision. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials (RCT's) on&#xD;
      axillary drainage versus no axillary drainage and a similar meta-analysis of 6 RCT's on&#xD;
      volume-controlled versus no/short-term drainage demonstrated a significant reduction of&#xD;
      seroma risk with the use of axillary drainage. Importantly, however, the majority of patients&#xD;
      in these trials did not develop seroma even in the absence of axillary drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reduction of seroma risk by axillary drainage in these trials was achieved at the expense&#xD;
      of a prolonged hospital stay and significant patient discomfort caused by the drain. During&#xD;
      the past 4 decades at least 50 RCT's have been performed on various interventions to reduce&#xD;
      axillary drainage with the aim of abandoning the axillary drain from clinical practice. The&#xD;
      interventions ranged from surgical dead space reduction, use of various surgical equipment,&#xD;
      shoulder immobilization, compression dressing, to the application of somatostatin analogons&#xD;
      and other medication. Due to the overall limited success of these trials axillary drainage is&#xD;
      still standard of care after ALND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of seroma involves the collection of lymph fluid caused by dissection of&#xD;
      lymph vessels and exudate. All coagulation and fibrinolytic factors are produced and secreted&#xD;
      by lymphatic endothelial cells and are involved in the sealing of lymphatic capillaries.&#xD;
      Local hemostyptic agents may therefore reduce postoperative secretion from lymphatic fistulas&#xD;
      caused by ALND. However, the results of the trials on the use of fibrin sealant in the&#xD;
      axillary cavity after ALND were conflicting. While some showed no favorable impact of fibrin&#xD;
      sealant, others demonstrated promising results when using fibrin glue. Consequently, a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 11 RCT's with 632 patients showed no impact of the use of fibrin glues after&#xD;
      ALND on the risk of seroma or the length of hospital stay, but revealed a trend toward less&#xD;
      drainage volume (weighted mean difference - 117.7, 95 per cent confidence interval - 259.2 to&#xD;
      23.8 ml). In all these studies, however, the liquid form of fibrin sealant was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of TachoSil®, which is a non-liquid surgical patch, has been shown to strongly reduce&#xD;
      the lymphatic drainage after lymphadenectomy in gynecologic and urologic procedures and&#xD;
      prevented the development of chylothorax in patients who underwent heart surgery with&#xD;
      intraoperative lymphatic leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a multicenter prospective RCT in Switzerland to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      TachoSil® on axillary drainage after ALND for breast cancer. We hypothesize that the use of&#xD;
      TachoSil® significantly and relevantly reduces the volume and duration of axillary drainage&#xD;
      after ALND. This has the potential to increase patients' quality of life, as well as to&#xD;
      shorten the length of hospital stay and reduce hospital costs, and provides the rationale and&#xD;
      the clinical relevance for the proposed RCT. If the proposed RCT shows a minimum of 33%&#xD;
      relative drainage reduction, a follow-up trial is justified. The follow-up trial will be&#xD;
      conducted with all patients receiving TachoSil® and randomization with versus without&#xD;
      axillary drainage. Therefore, the final goal is the omission of axillary drainage after ALND&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
