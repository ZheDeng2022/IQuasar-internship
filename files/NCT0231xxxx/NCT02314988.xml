  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of topical tranexamic acid to reduce&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss, reduction in postoperative drain output and allogenic transfusion&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind (subject, surgeons,&#xD;
      investigators, research coordinators) placebo-controlled study. Patients following high&#xD;
      energy trauma who have sustained thoracic or lumbar spine fractures, dislocations or&#xD;
      ligamentous injury with resultant instability requiring posterior spinal fusion will be&#xD;
      enrolled for this study. Furthermore, patients undergoing elective complex deformity surgery&#xD;
      will also be enrolled. Both populations of patients will be randomized into two groups. Group&#xD;
      I will receive standard of care operative fixation with topical tranexamic acid intervention&#xD;
      (test); Group II will receive standard of care operative fixation with normal saline&#xD;
      (placebo) intervention. This study will have a 2-year follow-up and will consist of three&#xD;
      periods: screening/enrollment phase up to 21 days from the day of injury to the day of&#xD;
      randomization and operative intervention, an inpatient data collection period for 4 days&#xD;
      postoperative, and then a follow-up period for 2-years postoperative (visits occurring at 2&#xD;
      week, 16 week, 1 year, and 2 year) time points.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reducing perioperative blood loss is critically important in the treatment of multiply&#xD;
      injured combat casualties, and major blood loss during complex spine trauma surgery is a&#xD;
      significant concern. Similar to previous studies in dental, cardiac, and total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty procedures, the use of topical tranexamic acid during complex combat related&#xD;
      spine trauma surgery can be a cost-effective and simple route of administration to reduce&#xD;
      blood loss, with no significant systemic effects. Patients would be expected to benefit&#xD;
      immediately by decreasing blood loss and the need for blood transfusion postoperatively,&#xD;
      thereby exposing them to less risk of transfusion reactions or disease transmission. This may&#xD;
      also potentially decrease the rate of surgical site infection because patients have been&#xD;
      found to have a significantly increased risk for surgical site infection after blood&#xD;
      transfusion due to changes in the immune system, and by also decreasing the amount of blood&#xD;
      that collects under the surgical wound, which serves as excellent medium for bacterial&#xD;
      growth. The goal of the investigators study is to determine if the use of topical tranexamic&#xD;
      acid (TXA) in the setting of complex spine trauma surgery reduces blood loss, and&#xD;
      subsequently reduces the rate of allogenic blood transfusion and surgical site infection.&#xD;
