      OVERALL OBJECTIVE In an East African referral hospital, to develop and analyze the effect of&#xD;
      locally agreed and achievable guidelines and a continual in-house training program for&#xD;
      strengthening partogram-based monitoring-to-action during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION Paper partograms (WHO), locally developed labour management guidelines (the&#xD;
      PartoMa guidelines) and continual in-house education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OVERALL DESIGN A quasi-experimental pre-post-study (The PartoMa study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION Labouring women delivering at the study site from October 2014 to January 2016 and&#xD;
      their offspring, as well as health providers. Women and their offspring will be enrolled&#xD;
      at/after unset of labour and followed until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS The primary composite endpoint is stillbirths and birth asphyxia. For further&#xD;
      description and secondary outcomes, please see below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY TIME Data collection from October 2014 to January 2016, supplemented by a post-exit&#xD;
      collection of case file data from October 2016 - January 2017.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      I (a) To analyze in depth current quality of intrapartum care by a mixed methods approach,&#xD;
      including exploration of underlying challenges in care delivery and an association between&#xD;
      suboptimal labour care and perinatal mortality. (b) To conduct a criterion-based audit of&#xD;
      stillbirths investigating direct and indirect causes and related maternal risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop locally achievable and agreed partogram-associated labour monitoring-to-action&#xD;
      guidelines (the PartoMa guidelines) for strengthening the partogram use as a decision support&#xD;
      tool, and study its acceptability by skilled birth attendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To implement the PartoMa guidelines and low cost, low dose, high frequency, in-house&#xD;
      training for strengthening the use of the partogram as a decision support tool, and study the&#xD;
      effect on knowledge, skills, quality of intrapartum care, record keeping, and perinatal&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To conduct a post-exit 2 years evaluation of use and effect of the PartoMa guidelines and&#xD;
      recurring training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To develop an electronic smartphone application (the PartoMa app), which includes the&#xD;
      PartoMa guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions studied (specific objectives&#xD;
      III-V).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      The East African Mnazi Mmoja Hospital (MMH) in Zanzibar is a governmental referral facility&#xD;
      serving the population of Zanzibar. As East Africa in general, the Zanzibarian archipelago&#xD;
      struggles with poverty and a resource constraint health system, and half of the population&#xD;
      live below the basic needs poverty line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the facility's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the yearly number of deliveries is&#xD;
      approximately 12,000. Approximately 50 maternal deaths occur annually (420 deaths per 100 000&#xD;
      live births). While the facility-based neonatal death rate is unknown, our baseline study&#xD;
      revealed a stillbirth rate of 59 per 1000 total births, of which approximately half were&#xD;
      alive at the time of admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this study, maternal and perinatal death audits were not conducted routinely and&#xD;
      little is known about direct and indirect causes for the perinatal deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study presents a quality improvement process of intrapartum monitoring, action and&#xD;
      triage. The overall study design is here presented in relation to the four specific&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The intervention-based study is based on an in-depth baseline quality of care assessment,&#xD;
      which includes criterion-based audit of intrapartum management in cases of stillbirths&#xD;
      compared to cases with Apgar scores of 7-10, and qualitative exploration of contributing&#xD;
      causes to substandard labour management (including participant observations and in depth&#xD;
      interviews).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Together with local doctors and nurse-midwives, international evidence-based guidelines&#xD;
      are adapted to be locally achievable (the PartoMa guidelines). Additionally, they are&#xD;
      internationally peer-reviewed with the aim of representing best possible care with the&#xD;
      limited resources available at the facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. A concept for reoccurring in-house training in monitoring-to-action during labour is&#xD;
      developed, based on the PartoMa guidelines and implemented together with the guidelines. This&#xD;
      PartoMa intervention (guidelines and reoccurring in-house training) is evaluated by comparing&#xD;
      clinical practice and birth outcome (please see the specific outcome measures below) in the&#xD;
      baseline period (October 2014 - January 2015) with the 9th-12th month of the intervention&#xD;
      (October 2015 - January 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. After the first intervention year (February 2016), a local steering group takes over the&#xD;
      continual implementation of the PartoMa guidelines. If the intervention is still running,&#xD;
      clinical practice and birth outcome will be analysed during the 21st - 24th month of the&#xD;
      intervention (October 2016 - January 2017) and compared with previous assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. If the PartoMa guidelines show to be accepted among birth attendants and effective in&#xD;
      improving quality of care, an electronic smartphone application (the PartoMa app) will be&#xD;
      developed, which includes the PartoMa guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention steps is carried out.&#xD;
