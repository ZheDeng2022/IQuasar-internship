  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing is common in patients with stable chronic heart&#xD;
      failure (up to 83%). Basically, the SAS is divided into two categories: central SAS (CSAS)&#xD;
      and obstructive SAS (OSAS). The two can coexist. In patients with CHF, the presence of SAS is&#xD;
      associated with higher mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHF is associated with a high rate of re-hospitalization and significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and is considered as a major medical and economic problem. To date, few studies&#xD;
      have investigated the prevalence, severity, persistence and the role of SAS during cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation. For different pathophysiological considerations, it is assumed that SAS is&#xD;
      exacerbated during AHF. Therefore SAS is not conventionally screened during this phase. This&#xD;
      assumption has been questioned recently by some studies which showed stability of the type of&#xD;
      SAS and its severity between the decompensation episode and the stable HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that SAS during an AHF episode of CHF will remain stable both in terms of&#xD;
      severity and type at three months of decompensation. Thus early polygraphy may be reliable&#xD;
      for identifying HF patients with SAS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is common in stable chronic heart failure (CHF) (60-83%) and is&#xD;
      divided into two main types: central SAS (CSAS) and obstructive SAS (OSAS). Several studies&#xD;
      have shown an association between SAS and HF severity and prognosis (Damy T, et al. European&#xD;
      journal of heart failure 2012, 14(9):1009-1019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the major complications of CHF. It is assumed that during&#xD;
      AHF, the severity of apnea syndrome increases due to increased capillary pressure and blood&#xD;
      volume, reason why it is common to screen for a SAS after but not during the decompensation&#xD;
      phase to avoid its overestimation. Unfortunately, this screening is often performed only in&#xD;
      specialized centers and requires another stay in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assumption that the severity of SAS increases during AHF has been questioned recently by&#xD;
      some studies. These studies suggest that the prevalence of SAS and type are similar in the&#xD;
      acute decompensated phase or after stabilization of HF regarding SAS severity and type.&#xD;
      Interestingly, in the study conducted at Padeletti, including 10 patients who underwent&#xD;
      polysomnography control just before or immediately after discharge from the hospital, all&#xD;
      measured parameters remained stable overall. Padeletti M, et al. Sleep medicine 2009,&#xD;
      10(3):353-360).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Khayat et al (Khayat RN, et al. Journal of cardiac failure 2009, 15(9):739-746) demonstrates&#xD;
      stability of SAS 6 weeks after an episode of decompensation. In this study 395 patients with&#xD;
      AHF were included with a mean LVEF of 33%, 75% (298) had a SAS with 57% as obstructive and&#xD;
      18% as central SAS (ref). 100% of patients diagnosed with an obstructive SAS during the&#xD;
      decompensation phase remained with it 6 weeks later. For central SAS and on the 12 patients&#xD;
      with two polygraphies, 4 were reported to change type of SAS which become obstructive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This raises the question of the importance of early diagnosis of SAS during hospitalization&#xD;
      for AHF to allow a more rapid care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this multicenter study is to assess the prevalence, persistence of SAS at 3 months&#xD;
      following decompensation as well as the prognostic value at 1 year. If SAS is stable between&#xD;
      the episode of the AHF and the return to a stable CHF, treatment of SAS may potentially be&#xD;
      considered during the admission phase. The benefit of the therapeutic management will of&#xD;
      course be validated by a clinical trial.&#xD;
