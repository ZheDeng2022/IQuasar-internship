  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if a standardized nutritional intervention with a&#xD;
      protein and energy enriched milk could help overcome the catabolic state in children&#xD;
      hospitalized with a bronchiolitis and thus creating a better nutritional state during&#xD;
      hospitalization and at outpatient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also want to assess the clinical repercussion on the number of&#xD;
      hospitalization days, the duration of oxygen support and the quality of life at ouptatient&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the effect protein-energy enriched milk to&#xD;
      reverse the catabolic state (weight loss, change in mid-upper arm circumference and tricpes&#xD;
      skin fold) on the short term and failure to thrive (degree of weight recovery, change in arm&#xD;
      circumference) one week after discharge in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The&#xD;
      secondary short term aims are to investigate the effect on the length of hospital stay, days&#xD;
      of oxygen support and the rate of antibiotic use. Secondary long term outcomes are the&#xD;
      re-admission rate, the persistence of wheezing and the number of work days missed by the&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that in those children who received a protein-energy enriched&#xD;
      milk during hospitalization the catabolic state will be reversed more quickly by the&#xD;
      intervention and will need less hospitalisation days, less oxygen support, less antibiotic&#xD;
      use, less re-admission rate, less persistent wheezing and less work days missed by the&#xD;
      parents. The investigators also hypothesize that the effects of the nutritional intervention&#xD;
      on the proposed outcome parameters will be greater in children screened at high nutritional&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

    <description>Children in the intervention group will receive a protein-energy enriched milk (Infatrini®, or in the case of children on a partial or fully hydrolized milk Infatrini Peptisorb®). The volume of milk offered will be the same quantity as they usually drink at home (within the limits of 120-170 ml/kg/day). The intervention will be carried out during the first 7 days of hospitalisation, or until the day of discharge (if hospitalized for less than 7 days).</description>
