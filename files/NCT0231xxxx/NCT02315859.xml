  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that, at the end of the cardiac ejection period, potential energy is stored in&#xD;
      elastic fibers of the heart, which promotes the suction of blood from the atria during early&#xD;
      filling. The investigators have developed a new ultrasound-based method to quantify this&#xD;
      suction effect. Here, it is necessary to reduce the complex 3-dimensional cardiac mechanics&#xD;
      in a 1-dimensional (piston-like) pump system. In the study, several steps of model reduction&#xD;
      will be tested. Each reduction is intended to allow non-invasive measurements to become&#xD;
      increasingly simple and feasible at reduced echo quality. The reference method is the&#xD;
      invasive data obtained from a pressure-volume conductance catheter. To increase the supply of&#xD;
      potential energy in the elastic fibers, a substance (dobutamine) is administered for&#xD;
      transient strengthening of the force of contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There is a good agreement between the new, non-invasive parameters and the&#xD;
      invasive reference method for the quantification of the suction effect of the left ventricle,&#xD;
      and the good correlation persists even with increasing model simplification.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Clinical Background: Heart failure is a widespread cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Despite their similar clinical manifestation, systolic and diastolic heart failure&#xD;
      are two distinct entities that differ with regard to pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis&#xD;
      and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diastolic dysfunction occurs early in the onset of heart failure. In the past, diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction has often been defined per exclusionem as heart failure in the absence of&#xD;
      evidence of systolic dysfunction. This definition may be appropriate for clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      if concentric or eccentric LV hypertrophy co-exists, but it is physiologically misleading,&#xD;
      since diastolic dysfunction continues to persist or even worsens with the onset of systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. It should be considered that symptoms in heart failure are more closely related&#xD;
      to diastolic than to systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, also prognosis of heart failure seems&#xD;
      to be more closely related to the underlying degree of diastolic rather than systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Despite its clinical importance, however, large trials on treatment outcome for&#xD;
      diastolic heart failure (such as the CHARM-preserved and PEP-CHF trials) are scarce and&#xD;
      disappointing. Among numerous others, three important reasons for this data scarcity are:&#xD;
      overestimation of end-point events in the power analyses of the respective trials, lack of&#xD;
      therapeutic agents that specifically target diastolic dysfunction, and lack of simple&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters capable of measuring diastolic function independently from&#xD;
      loading conditions. The latter will be addressed in the study presented here. As will be&#xD;
      detailed below, early-diastolic function is inextricably linked to the end-systolic&#xD;
      conditions of the ventricle. An echocardiographic parameter describing an early-diastolic&#xD;
      mechanical event is therefore very likely to vary with changes in end-systolic conditions.&#xD;
      The present study will investigate new parameters of early-diastolic function by provoking&#xD;
      contractility changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Physiological Background: There is no doubt that the human heart is a suction-pump&#xD;
      capable of aspirating blood before expelling. There is a concept of early-diastolic suction:&#xD;
      systolic myocardial shortening is believed to store potential energy in elastic fibers and&#xD;
      myocyte filaments that are released in early-diastole to produce a suction effect, thus&#xD;
      contributing to quick LV filling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1930, Katz et al. first published a study describing a suction phenomenon in an in-vitro&#xD;
      preparation of an isolated beating turtle ventricle. They showed that the early-diastolic&#xD;
      volume increase of the ventricle coincides with a pressure fall, which is consistent with the&#xD;
      concept of suction. He concluded that contraction and relaxation alters the elastic state of&#xD;
      the ventricle between two limits (end-systolic and -diastolic), and proposed a suction effect&#xD;
      produced by elastic recoil. This view represented a paradigm change, as filling was&#xD;
      previously considered the result of atrial pressure. If suction is defined according to Katz,&#xD;
      i.e. filling during pressure decay, then it is observed in all ejecting hearts, regardless of&#xD;
      contractility, end-systolic volume or filling pressure. This type of suction corresponds to&#xD;
      what early physiologists may have called the ventricular filling 'vis a fronte': a filling&#xD;
      mechanism generated by the heart. It constitutes a suction effect relative to the filling&#xD;
      reservoir. It can occur as a result of both, elastic recoil and relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a physically more stringent concept, suction is defined as filling at negative LV&#xD;
      transmural pressure. According to this definition, the ventricular wall performs work to pull&#xD;
      blood into the cavity. There are two important conditions for such a suction event. First,&#xD;
      the end-systolic volume must be lower than the volume of elastic ventricular equilibrium,&#xD;
      otherwise no elastic energy would be stored. Second, early diastolic relaxation must be quick&#xD;
      enough to allow restoring forces to prevail over the vanishing active forces. The process of&#xD;
      suction lasts until the equilibrium volume is reached. Atrial pressure then stretches the&#xD;
      ventricle to a volume where a force balance between filling pressure and ventricular passive&#xD;
      stress impedes any further flow (diasthasis). Diasthasis volume is probably higher than the&#xD;
      elastic equilibrium volume, which is a ventricular material property. Because LV filling&#xD;
      itself very quickly abolishes any negative transmural pressures, and the equilibrium volume&#xD;
      of the LV is probably small, suction according to this definition has been measured almost&#xD;
      exclusively under particular circumstances, such as in nearly empty ventricles (e.g.&#xD;
      artificially low afterload), during artificial absence of filling, or during inotropic&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Concept of Testing New Parameters: In the current study, several steps of model reduction&#xD;
      will be tested. Each reduction is intended to allow non-invasive measurements to become&#xD;
      increasingly simple and feasible at reduced echo quality. The comparison with the gold&#xD;
      standard will then reveal the costs of model reductions in terms of precision and predictive&#xD;
      power. Since direct pressure measurements are not feasible non-invasively, some&#xD;
      simplifications of the pump model are mandatory. The most useful is to reduce the heart to a&#xD;
      1-dimensional, piston-like pump system moving only in apico-basal direction (longitudinal&#xD;
      function). In such a model, not only contractions, but also flow directions are longitudinal.&#xD;
      The 1-dimensional Euler equation can then be used to calculate instantaneous&#xD;
      atrio-ventricular pressure gradients from Color Doppler M-Mode echocardiograms. Similarly,&#xD;
      apico-basal displacement of the 'piston' can easily be measured by M-Mode echocardiograms of&#xD;
      the mitral annulus (mitral annular plane systolic excursion, MAPSE). When combined, the&#xD;
      suction effect of the ventricle relative to the left atrium can be assessed. A further&#xD;
      simplification consists of replacing MAPSE by the widely used Doppler tissue imaging (DTI)&#xD;
      -parameters of systolic (s') and early-diastolic (e') velocity. The reference method of this&#xD;
      study will consist of invasively measured suction work, against which the new parameters will&#xD;
      directly be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is performed to prospectively test novel, non-invasive parameters of early&#xD;
      diastolic function with respect to their ability to quantify the physiological phenomenon of&#xD;
      LV suction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The following parameters correlate significantly with LV suction work, but in&#xD;
      descending order of magnitude (r2): absolute suction work from pressure/MAPSE, relative&#xD;
      suction work from IVPG/MAPSE, e'/L0, e'/s', (at rest and under Dobutamin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference for LV suction work: conductance-catheter is introduced through the aortic valve&#xD;
      and placed along the longitudinal axis of the LV. Continuous conductance are transformed into&#xD;
      LV volume data and simultaneous pressure measurements are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echo parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVPG (intraventricular pressure gradients)is calculated from Color-Doppler M-Mode&#xD;
      echocardiograms. This imaging modality produces a color-coded, longitudinal forward-flow&#xD;
      velocity profile (y-axis) over time (x-axis). Such velocity maps can then be processed to&#xD;
      retrieve instantaneous pressure gradients between any two points on the longitudinal axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAPSE (mitral annular plane systolic excursion)is performed with M-Mode echocardiogram of the&#xD;
      septal and lateral mitral annulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue velocity: peak systolic velocity (s') and the peak early-diastolic negative velocity&#xD;
      (e')of septal and lateral mitral anulus are measured by pulsed-wave Doppler tissue imaging&#xD;
      (DTI).&#xD;
