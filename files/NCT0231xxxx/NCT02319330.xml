      treatment outcomes of women in India who are affected by HIV and inter-related mental health&#xD;

      The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate that a low cost, cell phone-delivered&#xD;
      intervention is a promising, feasible and acceptable way to improve the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment outcomes of women in India who are affected by HIV and inter-related mental health&#xD;
      and psychosocial risk factors. Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in&#xD;
      HIV prevention and access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Yet, deficits in&#xD;
      adherence to the spectrum of HIV care pose significant barriers to success. Women are at a&#xD;
      particular disadvantage. Gender inequality, physical and situational factors place many women&#xD;
      at increased risk for HIV acquisition and poor mental health and interrelated psychosocial&#xD;
      co-factors (depression, gender-discrimination, violence, lack of social support, etc.) that&#xD;
      are well established correlates of poor adherence and retention in HIV care. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown alarmingly high rates of loss to follow-up for these women, particularly in the&#xD;
      transition after delivery, between PMTCT and lifelong HIV care services. Preliminary work&#xD;
      indicates that a theory-guided adherence phone intervention that can be easily integrated and&#xD;
      sustained as a component of routine ART Centre services is well suited for the target&#xD;
      population, but it needs to be adapted to the sociocultural context. Following initial&#xD;
      formative work to refine the intervention for delivery in India, clinic nurses will be&#xD;
      trained to deliver the intervention, and the feasibility, fidelity and preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      of the novel application of the intervention will be evaluated in a randomized trial. After&#xD;
      baseline assessment, women (n=120) will be randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or&#xD;
      TAU plus the phone intervention (delivered over 16 weeks) and outcomes will be evaluated at&#xD;
      6, 14, 24, 36 weeks post-randomization. If the promising mobile phone intervention developed&#xD;
      and pilot tested in this project shows promise in this Phase 1 study as we expect, the&#xD;
      efficacy and cost of the intervention will then be evaluated in a large scale, multi-site&#xD;
      study. If successful, an extremely practical approach will be available to improve the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment outcomes of women with HIV and co-morbid mental health problems in&#xD;
      India.&#xD;
