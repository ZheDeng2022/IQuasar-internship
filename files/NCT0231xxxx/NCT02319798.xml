  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to two chronic diseases (Crohn's disease and&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis) that affect the intestines. The number of new cases of IBD in people&#xD;
      younger than 16 years old has been increasing in the United Kingdom (UK), and is currently&#xD;
      estimated to be 700 new cases every year. There is no cure for IBD and patients experience&#xD;
      episodes of flareups in between periods of wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, children with IBD are asked to attend regular hospital appointments. This&#xD;
      means that, even if they are well, they have to get to the hospital and this can involve&#xD;
      travelling long distances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone consultations have been shown to be beneficial in some areas of medicine but this&#xD;
      approach has not been well studied in children. The aims of this study are to determine&#xD;
      whether telephone consultations would improve quality of life, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      proportion of consultations attended and whether they would be safe and reduce costs for&#xD;
      patients and the National Health Service (NHS). Investigators plan a randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial involving 92 participants recruited from amongst the 250 children and adolescents aged&#xD;
      between 8 and 16 years who attend the regional paediatric IBD centre in Manchester. Half will&#xD;
      be assigned to telephone consultations, and half to face to face consultations. The study&#xD;
      would have the approval of the local ethics committee and participants would have provided&#xD;
      written consent. Investigators will compare outcomes in the two groups over 2 years. If&#xD;
      telephone consultations prove to be effective, the NHS could offer children with IBD the&#xD;
      choice of either telephone consultation or face to face consultation for their outpatient&#xD;
      followup. Those who are doing well would not have to make unnecessary journeys to the&#xD;
      hospital. This would free up clinic spaces and allow patients who are unwell, and new&#xD;
      patients to be seen more quickly, thus reducing waiting&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS Telephone consultation is effective, safe, and a cost-effective alternative to&#xD;
      traditional routine face-to-face consultation for children and adolescents with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if telephone consultation, compared to face-to-face consultation is&#xD;
           effective for children and adolescents with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hypothesise that compared to face-face-consultations, telephone&#xD;
           consultations would:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. improve patients' health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. have a positive impact on patient/carer satisfaction with consultations&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. reduce out-patient non-attendance rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine any adverse events associated with routine telephone consultations in&#xD;
           children and adolescents with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hypothesise that compared to face-to-face consultations, telephone&#xD;
           consultations will not:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. adversely affect patients' disease course such as the number of relapses, number of&#xD;
                hospital admissions, and number of times they have to visit their paediatrician or&#xD;
                General Practitioner (GP) because of concerns about symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. adversely affect the child's growth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare NHS resource utilisation, costs to the NHS and costs to patients and their&#xD;
           carers in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that telephone consultations, compared to face-to-face&#xD;
      consultations, will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduce NHS resource use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reduce out-patient non-attendance rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. be cost-effective to the NHS and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. reduce IBD-related costs for patients and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The study will be based at the Royal Manchester Children's&#xD;
      Hospital, a regional Paediatric Gastroenterology referral centre. Children and adolescents&#xD;
      with IBD from the North West of England and beyond are referred to this centre. Any patient&#xD;
      who is aged between 8 and 16 years with a diagnosis of IBD will be eligible for entry into&#xD;
      the trial. Eligible patients will be identified through the hospital's paediatric IBD&#xD;
      database. There are currently about 250 eligible patients who attend the centre. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are: patients aged between 8 and 16 years; diagnosis of IBD by established clinical,&#xD;
      endoscopic, histological and radiological criteria; clinical remission defined as an&#xD;
      abbreviated Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (aPCDAI) score of ≤10 (12) for patients&#xD;
      with Crohn's disease or as a Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of&#xD;
      &lt;10 (13) for those with ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis; parental and child's&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria are active disease (aPCDAI&gt;15 or&#xD;
      PUCAI ≥15), and unwillingness to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN A randomised controlled trial comparing telephone consultations with standard&#xD;
      face-to-face out-patient consultations. It will be accompanied by an economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN OF STUDY The investigators will send a letter of invitation to participate in the study&#xD;
      and a research information sheet outlining the nature and importance of the study to eligible&#xD;
      patients and their parents. The invitation letter will explicitly state that if they do not&#xD;
      wish to take part in the study, it will not prejudice the quality of health care provision&#xD;
      from the hospital. Two weeks later, the investigators will telephone all those who have not&#xD;
      already responded, offering an invitation to participate and to answer any queries. Those who&#xD;
      can not be contacted by telephone will be sent a second letter. Those who agree to take part&#xD;
      will be interviewed by an investigator who will provide full information about the trial and&#xD;
      obtain written informed consent. Prior to randomization, the following baseline demographic&#xD;
      and clinical features will be recorded: patient's initials, date of birth, gender, hospital&#xD;
      number, and disease activity (aPCDAI or PUCAI score). Participants will be provided with the&#xD;
      contact details of relevant investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      By means of a computer-generated random number, participants will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group: telephone consultations Control Group: face-to-face consultations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a stratified block randomization with blocks of random sizes, and&#xD;
      stratify by type of disease (i.e.Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis/indeterminate&#xD;
      colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure allocation concealment, the computer-generated assignment schedule will be held&#xD;
      centrally and administered by 2 designated administrators who are not involved in the study.&#xD;
      If a participant meets the inclusion criteria and provides informed consent, he or she will&#xD;
      be entered into the study. Investigators will telephone the designated administrators, who&#xD;
      after recording the patient's identification number, date of birth and disease activity&#xD;
      score, will assign the next number in the series to determine allocation group. The assigned&#xD;
      group will be recorded and implemented. Nobody will be able to alter the assignment.&#xD;
      Participants in the telephone group will, however, retain the option to return to routine&#xD;
      care through non-concordance with the allocated intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Patients in both groups will be offered out-patient appointment dates and times.&#xD;
      Those randomized to face-to-face follow up will attend their appointments in hospital as&#xD;
      usual. Those randomized to telephone consultation will be told to expect a call from the&#xD;
      gastroenterology doctor at the time of their appointment (which will be after school hours).&#xD;
      The consulting doctor will contact the patient and parents via a telephone number (home or&#xD;
      mobile) that the parents and patient had previously supplied as the number they would like to&#xD;
      be contacted on. As much as possible, parents and patients will be advised to be together at&#xD;
      the time of the appointment in order to allow both of them to participate in the consultation&#xD;
      as is usual in practice. Up to 3 attempts within 20 minutes will be made to contact patients&#xD;
      by phone. Details about each consultation including date and time, who was present, duration&#xD;
      of consultations, and failed attempts at phone calls will be recorded. Patients who &quot;DNA&quot; an&#xD;
      appointment in either group will be sent another appointment in accordance with normal&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from being randomised to telephone or face-to-face consultation, routine care will be&#xD;
      the same for patients in both groups. For instance, all patients on treatments such as&#xD;
      azathioprine and methotrexate will continue to have relevant tests such as full blood count&#xD;
      and liver function tests monitored regularly according to current guidelines. In our current&#xD;
      practice, this routine monitoring does not usually take place at the routine out-patient&#xD;
      visits but rather at the child's GP surgery, or local hospital and the results communicated&#xD;
      to our inflammatory bowel disease nurse specialists. This practice will remain the same for&#xD;
      all patients. It will also be emphasized that, as it is in normal practice, if a participant&#xD;
      experiences any symptoms that cause concern at any time during the study, the parent/child&#xD;
      should contact the IBD nurse for advice and an appropriate arrangement for assessment will be&#xD;
      made. A relapse will not require withdrawal but the patient will be seen and treated as&#xD;
      appropriate and will remain in the same study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measure The primary outcome measure will be changes in the&#xD;
      paediatric IBD-specific health-related quality of life (QOL) scores. QOL scores will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, and 6-monthly over the 2-year follow-up period using the validated&#xD;
      paediatric IBD QOL IMPACT questionnaire (Appendix 1). The IMPACT questionnaire was originally&#xD;
      developed for use in paediatric IBD in Canada (14) and with minor adaptations, the&#xD;
      questionnaire was subsequently validated in Canada ((15), the Netherlands (16), and the UK&#xD;
      (17). The questionnaire consists of 35 questions measuring six quality of life domains (IBD&#xD;
      symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional functioning, social functioning, body image, and&#xD;
      treatment/interventions) and utilizes a Likert scale to report the patient's answers.&#xD;
      Responses are scored (from 0 to 4) and summed to give a total score (range 0 to 140). Higher&#xD;
      scores represent better QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relapses For each participant, the number of relapses during the study period will be&#xD;
           recorded. For patients with Crohn's disease, a relapse will be defined as an aPCDAI of&#xD;
           &gt;15. The PCDAI was originally developed and validated in several centres (18) and has&#xD;
           been used widely in paediatric clinical trials. The original PCDAI includes three&#xD;
           history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, general wellbeing), five&#xD;
           physical examination items (abdominal examination, perirectal disease, extraintestinal&#xD;
           manifestations, weight, height velocity), and three laboratory tests (hematocrit,&#xD;
           albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Among other things, the original PCDAI has&#xD;
           been criticized because of the inclusion of blood tests. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
           an abbreviated version of the PCDAI (aPCDAI) which omits laboratory items is accurate&#xD;
           and predicted disease activity as well as the original PCDAI (12,19). The aPCDAI&#xD;
           consists of the three history items (abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, and&#xD;
           general well-being), and the three physical examination items (weight loss, abdominal&#xD;
           examination, and perirectal disease) of the original PCDAI. In order to avoid repeated&#xD;
           blood sampling for research purposes, we will use the aPCDAI (Appendix II). Items in&#xD;
           this index are scored on a three-point scale (zero, 5, or 10 points) and scores range&#xD;
           from zero to 60 with higher scores indicating more active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For patients with ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis, a PUCAI score of &gt;15&#xD;
           will be considered as a relapse. The PUCAI is a validated instrument that includes six&#xD;
           history items (abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency, nocturnal stools and&#xD;
           activity level) (13). PUCAI scores can range from zero to 85 with higher scores&#xD;
           indicating more active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Basic anthropometric measures at every routine follow up visit / consultation Weight and&#xD;
           height will be measured at baseline and during the routine follow up appointments in&#xD;
           both groups. For those allocated to face to face consultations, their height and weight&#xD;
           will be measured at their out-patients visits. For children allocated to telephone&#xD;
           consultations, height and weight will be measured by their local paediatric service,&#xD;
           prior to their telephone appointment. A member of the study team will, prior to each&#xD;
           follow up period, contact those in the telephone consultation group to remind them to&#xD;
           the have measurements done. A study team member will then contact the local service or&#xD;
           the parent / patient to obtain the measurements. Height and body mass index (BMI) z&#xD;
           scores will be calculated based on sex- and age-related UK centile charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction with consultations - to be completed after every Participants or&#xD;
           their carers will be asked to complete a Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)&#xD;
           at the end of each consultation. This CSQ is an 18 item consultation-specific&#xD;
           satisfaction measure that was developed and validated by Baker (20, 21). It has since&#xD;
           been used in other areas/settings including community nursing (22, 23), and has recently&#xD;
           been modified and tested for use in consultations involving patients aged 15 years or&#xD;
           younger (24). After discussions with the originator of this instrument and the&#xD;
           researcher who modified it for paediatric use, the modified version of the CSQ will be&#xD;
           adapted for children aged 15 years and younger (Appendix IIa), and the original version&#xD;
           adapted for patients aged 16 years or older (Appendix IIb) {R Baker and P Kinnersley,&#xD;
           personal communication, July 2008}.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number of hospital admissions for IBD over 24 months. Data will be obtained from the&#xD;
           patient's hospital records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Proportion of out-patient consultations attended For each group, the proportion of&#xD;
           outpatient appointments attended over the 24-month follow-up period will be calculated&#xD;
           by dividing the total number of appointments (telephone or face-to-face) offered by the&#xD;
           number of appointments attended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration of consultations The duration of each consultation will be recorded in the&#xD;
           patient's medical notes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Adverse effects of immuno-suppressive agents such as azathioprine and methotrexate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any adverse effect of immuno-suppressive agents that participants may be receiving&#xD;
           during the study period will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Economic evaluation Investigators will assess the use of health care resources, costs to&#xD;
           the NHS and costs to patients and their carers in the two groups. Data on resource use&#xD;
           in tertiary, secondary and primary care will be collected. Data on resources used for&#xD;
           outpatient consultations (telephone or face-to-face), additional or unscheduled hospital&#xD;
           visits, tests and procedures, drug prescriptions, hospital admissions, and general&#xD;
           practice visits will be identified for every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each outpatient consultation (telephone or face-to-face), the clinician will record&#xD;
      details of the consultation including date of the visit and duration of the consultation.&#xD;
      Abortive telephone calls will be recorded as well as face-to-face appointments missed. For&#xD;
      telephone consultations, it will be noted whether calls were local, national, or made to&#xD;
      mobile phones. Data on inpatient admissions, any investigations or procedures, and treatments&#xD;
      received will be abstracted from the patient's hospital records. A patient/carer diary&#xD;
      (Appendix IV) will be used to collect information on drug utilisation (name, dose, frequency,&#xD;
      and duration), GP visits, and care received at other hospitals. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the diary every time they visited their GP, changed their regular medications, or&#xD;
      were seen at other hospitals. Diary information will be collated 6-monthly. Resource use that&#xD;
      was clearly unrelated to IBD will be excluded from the economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note:Routine follow ups / consultations vary between patients depending on how well they are.&#xD;
      Patients may also be seen for routine appointments in between the scheduled study follow ups.&#xD;
