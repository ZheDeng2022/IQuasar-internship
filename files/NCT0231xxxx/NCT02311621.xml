  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma are resistance to conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained&#xD;
      directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR). The CAR enables the T cell to recognize and kill the neuroblastoma cell&#xD;
      through the recognition of CD171, a protein expressed of the surface of the neuroblastoma&#xD;
      cell in patients with neuroblastoma. This is a phase 1 study designed to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of the CAR+ T cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon meeting the eligibility requirements and enrolling on study, subjects will undergo&#xD;
      apheresis to obtain the T cells for the generation of the CD171 CAR+ T cells. The T cells are&#xD;
      isolated from the apheresis product, the CD4 and CD8 T cells are then selected and grown&#xD;
      separately, transduced with a lentivirus to express the CD171 CAR as well as a truncated EGFR&#xD;
      that has no signaling capacity (noted EGFRt) and expanded in culture over a 4-6 week period.&#xD;
      During the process of cell generation, subjects will continue to be cared for by their&#xD;
      primary oncologist and may undergo additional treatment directed at neuroblastoma during this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the CAR+ T cells have been generated, the subject undergoes a disease assessment and&#xD;
      determination of necessary lymphodepletion therapy. A variety of lymphodepletion strategies&#xD;
      are acceptable and determined on a case by case basis. At least 48 hours after the completion&#xD;
      of lymphodepletion, the subject will receive and infusion of CAR+ T cells at an approximate&#xD;
      1:1 ratio of CD4 to CD8 CAR+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment with the CAR+ T cells, subjects will be followed intensely for 6 weeks&#xD;
      with serial blood testing and re-evaluation of disease status with MIBG scintigraphy, tumor&#xD;
      imaging by MRI/CT and bone marrow aspirates. After 4-6 weeks, the subjects clinical care will&#xD;
      be resumed by their primary oncologist, and it is possible that they would receive additional&#xD;
      chemotherapy or investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some subjects will receive cetuximab for ablation of the genetically modified T cells.&#xD;
      Criteria to receive cetuximab include acute toxicities that are life threatening, as well as&#xD;
      studies indicating lymphoproliferative disorder arising from an infused genetically modified&#xD;
      T cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, subjects will be followed bi-annually for 5 years, and then&#xD;
      annually for 10 additional years with either a medical history, physical exam and blood tests&#xD;
      or a phone call/questionnaire. This follow up will help to determine if the subject develops&#xD;
      any long-term health problems related to the CAR+ T cells including a new cancer.&#xD;
