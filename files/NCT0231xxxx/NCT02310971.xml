  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of CVac, an&#xD;
      investigational cell therapy, in patients with resected stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      pancreas who have completed surgery with or without front-line chemotherapy or radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of non-measurable disease patients will undergo leukapheresis for&#xD;
      manufacture of the study agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 40 patients at up to 30 clinical sites will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility into the study within 6 weeks of completing treatment, including R0 (complete&#xD;
      resection with no microscopic residual tumor) or R1 (complete resection with no grossly&#xD;
      visible tumor but microscopically positive margins) surgery for stage I or stage II&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with or without chemotherapy and radiation. Eligible patients&#xD;
      must have no measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
      version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009) and tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [CA 19-9] not&#xD;
      greater than 2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) following surgery with or without&#xD;
      chemotherapy or radiation. Prior surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and radiation therapy are allowed.&#xD;
