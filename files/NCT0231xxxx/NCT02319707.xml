      To compare the efficacy of three different protocols of third stage management in preventing&#xD;
      PPH.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The third stage of labor refers to the period following the completed delivery of the newborn&#xD;
      until the completed delivery of the placenta. The length of the third stage and its&#xD;
      complications are affected by the uterine contractility and the duration of placental&#xD;
      separation. The normal duration of third stage in nulliparous as well as in multiparous women&#xD;
      is less than 30 minutes. There is strong evidence supporting the routine administration of&#xD;
      uterotonic agents for the prevention of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), in order to enhance&#xD;
      natural uterine contraction in the third stage of labor, thus reducing the occurrence of PPH&#xD;
      by 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a joint policy statement between the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM),&#xD;
      the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), all of which recommend active management of the third stage of labor in&#xD;
      order to prevent PPH. active management led to a reduction in PPH incidence, maternal&#xD;
      Hemoglobin&lt;9g/dL and need for blood transfusion. (4-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active management of the third stage of labor involves prophylactic uterotonic treatment,&#xD;
      early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta. (2) Oxytocin is the&#xD;
      first agent of choice for PPH prophylaxis because of its high efficacy and a low incidence of&#xD;
      associated side effects. (6-9). Cotter et al found that the use of Oxytocin for PPH&#xD;
      prophylaxis in the third stage of labor decreased the rate of maternal blood loss greater&#xD;
      than 500 ml by approximately 50%. (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin route of administration is either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), with&#xD;
      no significant difference in PPH incidence (9). This is based on a pharmacokinetic research&#xD;
      from 1972 which found no difference between the absorption rates in both routes of&#xD;
      administration. Since then no further research targeting this question was preformed.&#xD;
      (11-12). recent guidelines from WHO, FIGO and ICM all recommended the use of 10 IU Oxytocin&#xD;
      IM. (4, 7,13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have investigated the effect of intra-umbilical vein Oxytocin injection in&#xD;
      reducing blood loss during the third stage of labor. This route of administration directs&#xD;
      treatment to the placental bed and uterine wall, resulting in earlier uterine contraction and&#xD;
      placental separation. However, limited published literature is available evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of umbilical vein oxytocin injection in routine practices for active management of the&#xD;
      third stage of labor. A prospective, randomized controlled trial of 412 women found that&#xD;
      intra-umbilical injection of oxytocin alongside active management of the third stage of labor&#xD;
      significantly reduced postpartum blood loss and the duration of the third stage (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other uterotonic agents including Syntometrine (IM), Ergometrine (IM or IV) and Misoprostol&#xD;
      (IM), can be used in active management of the third stage of labor. However, high quality&#xD;
      evidence regarding their efficacy compared to Oxytocin is scarce. (9-10)&#xD;
