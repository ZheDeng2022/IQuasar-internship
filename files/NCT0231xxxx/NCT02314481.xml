    <textblock>
      DARWIN II is a multi-arm non-randomised phase II trial, Eligible patient will be those who&#xD;
      relapse with NSCLC (clinical trials.gov ref. NCT02183883). Patients must have at least two&#xD;
      tissue/DNA samples of their disease available for sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will investigate assess if intra-tumour heterogeneity (clonal vs subclonal&#xD;
      actionable mutation) is associated with PFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without an actionable mutation will receive MPDL3280A (atezolizumab), a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody targeting anti-PDL1, as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, The options&#xD;
      for combination therapy will vary depending on the histology of the NSCLC (i.e. non-squamous&#xD;
      or squamous).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with BRAFV600 mutations, HER2 Amplification, ALK/RET gene rearrangements will be&#xD;
      enrolled into arms treating with vemurafenib, trastuzumab emtansine and alectinib&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DARWIN II will include extensive exploratory biomarker analysis to investigate a number of&#xD;
      genomic and immune markers that may predict response to MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) and help&#xD;
      guide future clinical trial design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      DARWIN II is an exploratory phase II study examining the role of intra-tumour heterogeneity&#xD;
      and predicted neo-antigens on the anti-tumour activity of anti-PDL1 immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will examine how clonal dominance and intratumour heterogeneity influence outcomes after&#xD;
      treatment, offering a unique opportunity to decipher mechanisms of resistance to&#xD;
      immunotherapy with anti-PDL1. These data will help improve future study design by developing&#xD;
      greater understanding of patient selection for immunotherapies in patients with NSCLC. The&#xD;
      relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and cfDNA/CTCs will also be explored in DARWIN&#xD;
      II, which may develop tools for patient selection and monitoring to be examined further in&#xD;
      future studies. Results from DARWIN II will help to identify a biomarker for anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      therapy which could be used for patient stratification in future phase III trials of&#xD;
      molecules targeting this T-cell inhibitory checkpoint. DARWIN II will also provide&#xD;
      preliminary data on efficacy of MPDL3280A, which could be used to design randomised studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre non-randomised phase II study based on patients with relapsed NSCLC,&#xD;
      who have provided a biopsy sample at the time of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Patients without an actionable mutation - MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) monotherapy or&#xD;
           in combination with chemptherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: BRAFV600 - vemurafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: ALK/RET gene rearrangement - alectinib&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Multi-region sequencing data of the primary tumour available. Non-TRACERx patients&#xD;
             must have two tissue/DNA samples of their disease. Non-TRACERx patients may be&#xD;
             recruited to ARM1 pending UCL GCLP MiSeq or equivalent NGS panel if EGFR sensitising&#xD;
             mutations and ALK fusions have been excluded (according to local testing procedures).&#xD;
             Patients with confirmed ALK aberration by local testing are eligible for ARM 3&#xD;
             providing they have two tissue/DNA samples of their Disease. Central testing for ALK&#xD;
             will be performed separately. Patients with a confirmed BRAFV600 mutation by local&#xD;
             testing or other non TRACERx NGS panel are eligible for ARM2, providing they have two&#xD;
             tissue/DNA samples of their Disease. Central testing for BRAFV600 will be performed&#xD;
             separately. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma do not require local testing for&#xD;
             EGFR sensitising mutations and ALK fusions prior to inclusion for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to have a biopsy of relapsed disease. Consent will be&#xD;
             obtained through the TRACERx study (TRACERx patients) or using the DARWIN2 'trial&#xD;
             entry tissue sample' consent form (non-TRACERx patients). Procurement of the biopsy&#xD;
             sample is not necessary at the time of trial registration. However, patients must&#xD;
             undergo a biopsy prior to commencement of any trial treatment. If a patient does not&#xD;
             have a biopsy at recurrence then in exceptional circumstances the patient may still be&#xD;
             eligible to join DARWIN2. Site must contact the CTC to discuss. There will be no other&#xD;
