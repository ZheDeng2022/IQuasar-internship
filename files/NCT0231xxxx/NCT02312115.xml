      This study will be a randomized prospective double-blind placebo-controlled clinical pilot&#xD;
      trial. This will be a single center project that will take place at Loma Linda University&#xD;
      Medical Center. All adult kidney recipients will be informed of the study prior to operation.&#xD;
      The Nephrology fellows or attending physicians will attempt to obtain informed consent from&#xD;
      all eligible patients, pre-transplant. Those patients who consent will be screened post&#xD;
      operation for enrollment. Patients who do not meet all eligibility criteria and/or who meet&#xD;
      some exclusion criteria will be deemed ineligible for the trial, and will be excluded. The&#xD;
      Nephrology and Transplant teams will be blinded of patient assignment and only the pharmacy&#xD;
      will know the patient's assignment.&#xD;

      1. Background/ Rationale Kidney Transplantation is a lifesaving modality in patients with&#xD;
           end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the numbers of transplants have been skyrocketing&#xD;
           since the first successful trials. In 2013 alone, there were over 18,000 kidney&#xD;
           transplants done in the United States of America. Of those, 11,161 were from a deceased&#xD;
           donor (NKUDIC 2011, One Legacy 2014, USRDS 2013). One common complication of renal&#xD;
           transplants is Delayed Graft Function (DGF). DGF is a serious complication, which is&#xD;
           best defined as the need for renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis, within the&#xD;
           first week after renal transplant (Mallon et al. 2013). DGF greatly increases the risk&#xD;
           of acute and chronic transplant rejection, which decreases patient survival and quality&#xD;
           of life, for those patients who do survive (Perico et al. 2004, Weber et al. 2014).&#xD;
           Additionally, the rate of DGF is highest in patients who have received deceased donor&#xD;
           transplants (One Legacy 2014). Therefore, it is crucial to the well-being of this large&#xD;
           population to reduce the incidence of DGF. Our approach is to investigate current&#xD;
           treatment modalities for patients post-deceased donor renal transplant, to understand&#xD;
           how best to prevent DGF before it even starts. Currently, administration of loop&#xD;
           diuretics such as furosemide is a common practice in order to prevent and treat oliguria&#xD;
           in renal transplant patients. However, only animal models have been able to show a&#xD;
           benefit in treating acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in the transplant kidney due&#xD;
           to cold ischemia time, with furosemide. There is a lack of evidence that furosemide use&#xD;
           leads to improved patient outcomes in patients with AKI (Nadeau-Fredette et al. 2013).&#xD;
           Given that side effects of furosemide administration include ototoxicity, hypotension,&#xD;
           electrolyte abnormalities, and hypersensitivity reactions, and the investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize, may not significantly reduce the incidence of DGF from placebo, it is&#xD;
           important to investigate if the benefits of furosemide administration truly outweigh the&#xD;
           harms (Strom et al. 2003). The investigators intend to achieve this by way of a&#xD;
           randomized, double-blinded, pilot clinical trial in adult oliguric patients,&#xD;
           post-deceased donor renal transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.To test the hypothesis that DGF rate is the same in adult oliguric post-deceased donor&#xD;
      renal transplant patients administered furosemide vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.To compare the following within the two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30-day, 90-day and 12-month creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
           (eGFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for RRT (Hemodialysis or Peritoneal dialysis) 30 days, 90 days and 12 months&#xD;
           post-transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time from transplant to DGF development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of DGF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of primary graft non-function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall hospital length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The KDPI score in relation to primary graft non-function&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To quantify the association between furosemide administration and relevant patient&#xD;
      centered outcomes, such as hospital length of stay and acquired complications, in order to&#xD;
      decrease patient morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Study Outline&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients that have been admitted for a deceased donor kidney transplant will be seen by&#xD;
      the Nephrology service for pre-transplant evaluation. The Nephrology Fellow/Attending&#xD;
      physician will go over a checklist that determines if the patient will be eligible for the&#xD;
      study and will obtain the informed consent if the patient is eligible. Informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from all eligible patients. All eligible patients' urine output will be monitored&#xD;
      as soon as they return to the unit from the operating room. If the patient remains oliguric&#xD;
      or anuric for 6 hours, the bedside nurse will alert the on-call study coordinator for&#xD;
      randomization and enrollment per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Patients assigned to the furosemide infusion group will receive furosemide&#xD;
      infusions, as outlined in figure 2. This has been adapted from Ostermann et al. (2007) and&#xD;
      the SPARK study protocol (Bagshaw et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furosemide will be prepared in bags that contain 1000 mg of furosemide per 250 mL of saline&#xD;
      reaching a concentration of 4 mg/mL. All medication and placebo bags will have no identifiers&#xD;
      that show what type of drug is being administered, for blinding purposes. Medication and&#xD;
      placebo bags will have randomly generated study identifier numbers. The protocol in figure 2&#xD;
      will be followed to achieve a total urine output of 1mL/kg/h. The furosemide infusion rate&#xD;
      will not exceed 4mg/min IV as this is the maximum set by the manufacturer.&#xD;
