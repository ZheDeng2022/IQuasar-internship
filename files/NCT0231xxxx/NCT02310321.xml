  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of phase 1 part in this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or recommended expansion dose (RED) of ASP2215 concomitant with cytarabine/idarubicin as&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy based on the status of the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in&#xD;
      newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subjects. Phase 1 part will also evaluate safety&#xD;
      and tolerability and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ASP2215 concomitant&#xD;
      with induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as evaluate the PK parameters of&#xD;
      cytarabine concomitant with ASP2215.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of phase 2 part is to evaluate efficacy of ASP2215 in combination with induction&#xD;
      therapy. Phase 2 cohort will also evaluate safety and characterize the PK parameters of&#xD;
      ASP2215 in combination with induction and consolidation therapy followed by maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is composed of Phase 1 part (the dose-evaluation part and the expansion part) and&#xD;
      Phase 2 part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose-evaluation part of Phase 1 part, at least 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at each&#xD;
      dose (low, middle, and high) for determination of MTD and/or RED. Treatment of AML in Phase 1&#xD;
      part is composed of 3 periods of therapy: remission induction, consolidation, and&#xD;
      maintenance. The decision of whether or not to proceed to the next dose will be made based on&#xD;
      the occurrence of DLT during Cycle 1 of the induction period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion part of Phase 1 part, a maximum of 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at RED&#xD;
      that has been recommended in the dose-evaluation part and the safety will be assessed based&#xD;
      on the onset of DLTs during Cycle 1 of the induction and consolidation periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2 part, Subjects will receive ASP2215 at the recommended dose established in Phase 1&#xD;
      part. The target population will be limited to newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.&#xD;
