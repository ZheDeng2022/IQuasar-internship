  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the Telehomecare (THC) Program offered to patients with heart&#xD;
      failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease across the Central West, Toronto Central and&#xD;
      North East Local Health Integration Networks in Ontario. It will explore the opinions and&#xD;
      experiences of patients, providers, technicians and administrators involved with THC Program&#xD;
      in order to provide stakeholders with information about the processes and organizational&#xD;
      factors impacting the program's adoption, the experiences of its participants, impact on&#xD;
      patient outcomes, costs to the health-care system and who is benefiting the most from&#xD;
      participating. These factors will be determined using semi-structured interviews, surveys,&#xD;
      and observation of practices of everyone involved with THC. The study will also evaluate&#xD;
      patient data to determine changes in patients' utilization of healthcare services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The program evaluation will consist of three components that will employ two research&#xD;
      methods, qualitative and quantitative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative Practice Study (Qualitative) This study will explore how factors related to the&#xD;
      technology, patients, providers and organizational structures and processes influence the&#xD;
      adoption and implementation of THC across selected sites (including micro-, meso- and&#xD;
      macro-systems) in Ontario. Ethnographic study, in-depth semi-structured interviews and&#xD;
      documentation collection and review will be employed to explore, among other factors, the&#xD;
      behaviours, communication patterns, workflows and tasks of health care providers and their&#xD;
      interaction with patients. Interviewees will be selected using purposive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Study (Quantitative) The patterns of THC use will be evaluated by conducting a&#xD;
      descriptive study based on the data routinely collected by the Ontario Telemedicine Newtrok&#xD;
      that tracks all encounters (i.e. telephone calls, remote patient monitoring data&#xD;
      transmission, face to face visits) between patients and THC providers. A randomly selected&#xD;
      subset of THC participants/caregivers will also complete validated structured questionnaires&#xD;
      at up to four time points during program, baseline, one, two, and three months after&#xD;
      enrollment. These are the Quality of Life Profile Measure (SF12), Quality of Life Preference&#xD;
      Measure (EQ5D), Telemedicine Perception Questionnaire (TMPQ), Stanford self-efficacy scale&#xD;
      and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). The providers of THC will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires; physicians will be asked to complete Penn State Physician&#xD;
      Telehomecare Survey, whereas the nurses will be asked to complete a Nurse Satisfaction&#xD;
      Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICES Linkage Study (Quantitative) Primary collected research data will be linked to the&#xD;
      Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) administrative databases. Outcomes (i.e.&#xD;
      hospitalizations, primary care visits) of patients receiving or have received Telehomecare,&#xD;
      will be assessed for a period of 6 months prior to enrolment, during the program and for up&#xD;
      to 6 months after discharge.&#xD;
