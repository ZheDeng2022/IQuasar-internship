    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body and keeps growing even when the amount of&#xD;
      testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels despite previous treatment with&#xD;
      enzalutamide. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways by targeting certain cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure the anti-cancer activity of pembrolizumab in men with metastatic, castration&#xD;
      resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate immunological and genetic parameters to evaluate for possible markers and&#xD;
      functional changes that are predictive of a clinical response or linked to response or&#xD;
      resistance to PD-1 inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To collect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and determine the degree to which tumor&#xD;
      characteristics are shared by the CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Changes in T cell numbers, activation, and phenotype as measured in whole blood at&#xD;
      diagnosis and throughout therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Systemic inflammatory markers: serum interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-1, tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor (TNF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Objective disease response by radiographs. VI. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression&#xD;
      free survival. VII. Overall survival. VIII. Microbiome and correlation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Additional genetic (deoxyribonucelic acid [DNA], ribonucleic acid [RNA]) and protein&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted to further evaluate immunotherapy and profile/characterize&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INITIAL TREATMENT PHASE: Patients who are progressing on enzalutamide will receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      continue to receive standard of care enzalutamide orally (PO) daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING PHASE: After completion of the initial treatment phase, patients continue to&#xD;
      receive standard of care enzalutamide PO daily for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RETREATMENT PHASE: Patients with disease response or stability after the initial treatment&#xD;
      phase will receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for an additional 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients continue to receive standard of care enzalutamide PO daily for the duration of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for 2.5 years.&#xD;

    <description>One-sample binomial test will be used to assess whether the proportion of PSA response (PSA decrease of at least 50%) is significantly greater than 0.05.
