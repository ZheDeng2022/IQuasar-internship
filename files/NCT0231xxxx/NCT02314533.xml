  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has become a major public health problem in China, and a large-scale epidemiological&#xD;
      survey revealed a prevalence of 9.7% approximately 5 years ago [1]. Diabetic nephropathy (DN)&#xD;
      is the most common microvascular complication and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      that requires dialysis and/or renal transplantation [2]. Thus, strategies aimed at the&#xD;
      treatment of DN are as important as those that target diabetes itself. Diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      is associated with mesangial cell expansion, thickening of glomerular and tubular basement&#xD;
      membrane, glomerulosclerosis and tubular necrosis. These structural changes could lead to the&#xD;
      occurrence of albuminuria, elevation of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, and&#xD;
      reduction in glomerular filtration rate[3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite effective interventions such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and&#xD;
      angiotensin-II-type 1(AT1) receptor blockers available to treat diabetic nephropathy[4-5],&#xD;
      hitherto, no promising interventions are in the practice that could satisfactorily improve&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes of diabetic nephropathy. Current treatment protocol for the management&#xD;
      of diabetic nephropathy targets for tight glucose and blood pressure control as hyperglycemia&#xD;
      and hypertension are major risk factors for the disease progression of nephropathy[6-7]. In&#xD;
      addition, dyslipidemia has been suggested to be strongly associated with an induction and&#xD;
      progression of diabetic nephropathy[8-9] While renal lipid accumulation- induced lipotoxicity&#xD;
      could develop diabetic nephropathy[10], peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa)&#xD;
      agonists could have a place in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy[11]. Experimental and&#xD;
      clinical studies suggested that fenofibrate, a fibrate class of hypolipidemic agent, acts as&#xD;
      a PPARa agonist, ameliorated diabetic renal damage by preventing renal oxidative stress,&#xD;
      inflammation and fibrosis. Our previous studies showed that fenofibrate contributes its&#xD;
      beneficial effect to prevent endothelial dysfunction from upregulating level of BH4 and&#xD;
      decreasing production of ROS through the mechanism of increasing the level of intracellular&#xD;
      GTPCH-I. Fenofibrate may help protect against vascular damage potential by promoting the&#xD;
      re-coupling of eNOS with normalizing endothelial disorders[12-13]. Moreover, fenofibrate&#xD;
      significantly reduced the pathological changes in glomeruli by improving the glomerular&#xD;
      capillary size and reducing the mesangial expansion [14-16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few clinical studies have also confirmed the renoprotective potential of fenofibrate against&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy. The 'Fenofibrate Intervention for Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD)'&#xD;
      study suggested that fenofibrate treatment had promising effects in preventing the&#xD;
      progression of diabetes-associated microvascular complications, including diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy [17-18]. In the FIELD study, among all type 2 diabetic patients (9795 patients),&#xD;
      over 5 years, the fell of ACR was greater in participants on fenofibrate (23.7% vs 11.5%),&#xD;
      albuminuria on average progressed 14% less frequently and was reversed 18% more often among&#xD;
      those diabetic patients received fenofibrate as compared to placebo.The investigators of this&#xD;
      trial suggested that fenofibrate could protect against the loss of underlying renal function&#xD;
      seen in patients with T2DM[19].And also in ACCORD study[20], a lower incidence of both micro-&#xD;
      and macro-albuminuria was noted in the fenofibrate compared with the placebo group [38.2 vs.&#xD;
      41.6% (P = 0.01) and 10.5 vs. 12.3% (P = 0.04), respectively]. Unfortunately, during&#xD;
      fenofibrate therapy in FIELD study, the plasma creatinine was noted to be increased, but&#xD;
      quickly reversed on placebo assignment. Though it remained higher on fenofibrate treatment as&#xD;
      compared to placebo, the chronic rise was slower with less loss of estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR). How these short-term increases can affect long-term renal function&#xD;
      was also assessed in a retrospective subanalysis of the ACCORD study[21]. Among&#xD;
      fenofibrate-treated patients, 321 experienced increased SCr levels&gt;20% (cases) within the&#xD;
      first 3 months of treatment. Patients with SCr increases &lt;2% were controls (n = 175). In&#xD;
      these patients as well as in 565 placebo-treated subjects, SCr and cystatin C levels were&#xD;
      measured at baseline and 6-8 weeks after treatment discontinuation. As expected, cases had&#xD;
      significantly higher SCr levels and lower eGFR than controls or placebo treated individuals&#xD;
      at the end of the study. However, SCr levels and eGFR in cases returned to placebo levels 51&#xD;
      days after treatment discontinuation. At the same time, fenofibrate-treated patients with no&#xD;
      initial increases in SCr levels had the lowest SCr levels and the highest eGFR. In the&#xD;
      setting of careful renal function surveillance and reduction of fenofibrate dose as&#xD;
      indicated, no increase in renal disease or cardiovascular outcome was seen in those&#xD;
      individuals demonstrating fenofibrate-associated creatinine increase[22].Taken together,&#xD;
      fenofibrate could delay albuminuria and eGFR impairment in T2DM patients. Of note, in a study&#xD;
      reported by Hottelart et al. [23], fenofibrate associated increase in creatininemia in renal&#xD;
      patients did not reflect an impairment of renal function. Fenofibrate-induced increase in&#xD;
      creatinine production was suggested to be associated with an enhanced metabolic production&#xD;
      rate of creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) with patients of T2DM treated with&#xD;
      micronized fenofibrate for an average of 38 months suggested that fenofibrate significantly&#xD;
      reduced the worsening of albumin excretion, which was associated with reduced progression of&#xD;
      normal albumin excretion to microalbuminuria [24]. The investigators concluded that the&#xD;
      improvement in lipid profile with fenofibrate in patients with T2DM was associated with&#xD;
      reduced progression to microalbuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies collectively suggest that fenofibrate could afford renoprotection and prevent&#xD;
      the induction and progression of nephropathy in diabetic patients who are experiencing&#xD;
      abnormal lipid profile and diabetic dyslipidemia with renal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators design this study to investigate fenofibrate's effect on microalbuminuria&#xD;
      reduction and serum creatinine on top of statin therapy in Chinese hypertriglyceridemic&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
