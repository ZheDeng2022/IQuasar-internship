    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study which is intended to collect data to calculate an adequate sample size&#xD;
      for a larger registered clinical trial. Eleven subjects were enrolled at The Ohio State&#xD;
      University; we intend to enroll 29 more subjects at Indiana University. Due to the small&#xD;
      sample size this study will primarily be a feasibility study that will attempt to measure and&#xD;
      evaluate differences in the relative theoretical costs of the intervention of topical oxygen&#xD;
      therapy on this population and subsequently compare outcomes in areas such as overall health&#xD;
      improvements and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a total of 5 study visits including the initial baseline visit were they will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of the 2 groups (comparison or treatment). At the baseline visit the&#xD;
      following will be collected; history of the patient, physical examination of the patient&#xD;
      including:, digital imaging of the diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) or chronic wound that is input&#xD;
      into the WoundMatrix™ software, and the patient will be asked to complete a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire. Patients will be provided with education regarding diabetes, footwear, and&#xD;
      wound care. They will also be given a diary to log their treatments. Patients will return for&#xD;
      study visits 2-5 on weeks 4, 8, 12, 16. At study visit 2-5 the research staff will collect&#xD;
      digital imaging of the ulcer, review medication, collect previous diary and distribute a new&#xD;
      one, and note any wound or health complications. At study visits 1 and 5, the patient will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the quality of life questionnaire. These visits will be correlated with&#xD;
      their regular scheduled visit at the CWC. If their wound heals before the end of the study,&#xD;
      they will be asked to return for study visit 5 (week 16). The patient will complete the at&#xD;
      home treatments, including the 90 minute treatment, 4 consecutive days a week, 3 day of no&#xD;
      treatment). Study personnel will provide supplies, teach, and give support for the TO device.&#xD;
      The study personnel will contact the subject weekly to give support for the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is expected to add no additional risk to the patient. There is a&#xD;
      low risk of local irritation of the skin from application of the Topical Oxygen device for&#xD;
      those in the Topical Oxygen Therapy group. This issue is anticipated in the protocol, which&#xD;
      specifies appropriate treatment modifications and discontinuation of Topical Oxygen, if it&#xD;
      does not improve. If this problem occurs, is expected to be self-limited and of minor&#xD;
      significance. Oxygen, although not combustible itself, supports combustion of other flammable&#xD;
      materials. The use of oxygen in this protocol is essentially equivalent to that supplied by&#xD;
      nasal cannula to patients in hospital or at home. To minimize the risk of fire, the&#xD;
      investigators will strictly enforce a 'no smoking' and 'no open flame' policy in any room&#xD;
      where Topical Oxygen is utilized. Treatment facilities will comply with local fire ordinances&#xD;
      and study personnel will be familiar with fire safety protocols of each facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may or may not experience directly benefit from participating in this study. The&#xD;
      disease state is highly morbid and typically involves prolonged medical care and multiple&#xD;
      surgical procedures. Participants may experience improved healing of their wound as a result&#xD;
      of their participation in this study, but there is no guarantee of this. Patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the study may also benefit from the close follow-up with study staff and compliance with&#xD;
      wound treatment. In addition, the information learned from this research study may lead to a&#xD;
      better understanding of diabetic wounds and how they heal, which could lead to better&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with diabetic wounds in the future. The application of topical&#xD;
      oxygen to diabetic wounds has the potential to dramatically impact the effectiveness of wound&#xD;
      healing and to therefore improve limb salvage, decrease infection rates and mortality, and&#xD;
      generally improve the quality of life of study participants receiving topical oxygen as well&#xD;
      as the general population if efficacy is proved.&#xD;
