  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the influences of pregnancy on breast milk and the&#xD;
      effects of these on the health of babies during the first 2 months of life. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that overweight and obese mothers will have lower serum n-3 to n-6 PUFA ratios&#xD;
      during pregnancy and postpartum than normal weight mothers and will be positively correlated&#xD;
      with TNF-α, IL-1β, resistin, and negatively correlated ghrelin levels both in serum and in&#xD;
      breast milk in postpartum.&#xD;

      The Mom2Baby Pilot study will last about 4 months. Up to 20 pregnant women who were&#xD;
      considered normal weight prior to pregnancy will be enrolled in the study. The infants born&#xD;
      to these pregnant women will also be enrolled after birth. Archive blood, archive breast&#xD;
      milk, and clinical assessment data from up to 20 participants who were considered overweight&#xD;
      or obese at enrollment in the Expecting Success study conducted at Pennington Biomedical&#xD;
      Research Center (NCT01610752) may be used to test the primary hypothesis as well as&#xD;
      additional hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure levels of LC-PUFAS, pro-inflammatory biomarkers, and regulatory hormones&#xD;
      (resistin, ghrelin) in serum (35,0-36,6 weeks gestation and 4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum) and&#xD;
      breast milk (4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum) in normal weight (n=20) and overweight and obese&#xD;
      (n=20) mothers. Blood serum and plasma and breast milk levels of these measures will be&#xD;
      compared from pregnancy to postpartum within and between normal weight and overweight and&#xD;
      obese women. Additional maternal procedures including questionnaires, anthropometrics, body&#xD;
      composition measurements, energy intake measurement, and physical activity measurement will&#xD;
      be investigated at 35,0-36,6 weeks gestation and 4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum. Infant procedures&#xD;
      including anthropometrics, body composition measurements, stool collection, and energy intake&#xD;
      measurement will be investigated at 0,1-0,6 weeks and 4,0-7,6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
