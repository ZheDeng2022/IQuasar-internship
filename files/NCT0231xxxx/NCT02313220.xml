  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a medical condition which increases the risk of other diseases, such as type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity-related risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      other metabolic diseases include unstable glucose levels and high blood pressure.&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin and exenatide are both approved worldwide for treatment of patients with Type 2&#xD;
      Diabetes. Dapagliflozin works by lowering glucose levels by inhibiting the renal reabsorption&#xD;
      of glucose and thereby promoting its urinary excretion and energy loss and thereby reduction&#xD;
      in body fat. Exenatide exhibits many of the same glucose-lowering actions of that of a&#xD;
      naturally occurring hormone and leads to weight loss mainly via reduced energy intake, most&#xD;
      likely via a central effect on appetite regulation. The purpose of this exploratory study is&#xD;
      to investigate if a combination treatment with dapagliflozin and exenatide have a synergistic&#xD;
      effect on weight loss in non-diabetic obese subjects. Subjects will be treated for 24 weeks&#xD;
      with either active combination treatment or placebo (non-active treatment). Neither study&#xD;
      personnel nor subjects will know what treatment is given. All subjects completing the 24-week&#xD;
      double-blind study and who are willing and eligible will be offered to enter a 28-week&#xD;
      open-label extension study. All subjects entering the extension study will receive unblinded&#xD;
      active study treatment for an additional 28 weeks. Thus the total treatment period for&#xD;
      subjects entering the extension study will be 52 weeks.&#xD;
