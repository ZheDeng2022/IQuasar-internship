      Background and Aims Pacemaker implantation for treating bradyarrhythmias typically involves&#xD;
      placing a pacing lead through the tricuspid valve (TV) into the right ventricular (RV) apex.&#xD;
      It is now known that tricuspid regurgitation (TR) frequently results from this and may lead&#xD;
      to increased morbidity or mortality. Recently, left ventricular (LV) pacing through an&#xD;
      epicardial vein via the coronary sinus has been widely practiced due to the advent of&#xD;
      biventricular pacing. This lead does not cross the TV, potentially reducing the risk of TV&#xD;
      dysfunction and may also reduce the risk of LV dysfunction. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that LV pacing will prevent the onset of new TR or worsening of pre-existing TR in patients&#xD;
      undergoing pacemaker implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients receiving a pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome (n=20) with an LV ejection&#xD;
      fraction &lt;40% will be randomly allocated to receive either conventional RV pacing or LV&#xD;
      pacing via the coronary sinus. Serial 2D and 3D transthoracic echocardiography will be&#xD;
      performed before implantation, one day post implantation, then at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months&#xD;
      and 1 year. The primary endpoints will be new onset TR and the diagnosis of at least moderate&#xD;
      TR. Other endpoints include biventricular function, ventricular dyssynchrony, complications&#xD;
      of device implantation, mortality and major cardiovascular events.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that left ventricular pacing via a coronary sinus approach can reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of significant tricuspid regurgitation after pacemaker implantation in patients&#xD;
      with normal left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the degree of tricuspid regurgitation caused by pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation between the conventional techniques of implanting a ventricular lead implanted&#xD;
      in the right ventricular apex versus implanting a ventricular lead in a left ventricular&#xD;
      epicardial vein via a coronary sinus approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of our study is to evaluate whether left ventricular pacing is also&#xD;
      less likely to cause ventricular dyssynchrony and dysfunction than right ventricular apical&#xD;
      pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single centre randomised clinical pilot study comparing 2 different lead&#xD;
      implantation techniques to be assessed using both imaging techniques and follow up for&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Proposed study interventions The procedures in both arms of the study will be identical&#xD;
      except for where the ventricular lead is placed. All parts of these procedures, including all&#xD;
      the implanting equipment and pacing leads are standard routine clinical practice. The left&#xD;
      ventricular leads used in this study are routinely used for pacing the left ventricle in&#xD;
      patients receiving biventricular pacemakers or defibrillators for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant site will be the left or right prepectoral region and venous access will be via&#xD;
      either an axillary or subclavian vein approach. These choices will be left to the implanting&#xD;
      physician's discretion. Once venous access has been established successfully the patient will&#xD;
      then be randomly allocated to either of the study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to have an LV lead will have a long coronary sinus sheath inserted which&#xD;
      will be used to perform an occlusive venogram of the coronary sinus to determine if there are&#xD;
      veins suitable for left ventricular lead placement. Those in the left ventricular pacing arm&#xD;
      will instead have a left ventricular epicardial pacing lead placed as apically as possible in&#xD;
      a large calibre left ventricular branch of the coronary sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the right ventricular apical pacing arm will have an endocardial active fixation&#xD;
      pacing leads placed in the right ventricular apex in the conventional manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms will then go on to have a right atrial active fixation lead placed in&#xD;
      the right atrial appendage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Methods for protecting against other sources of bias All patients referred to our&#xD;
      Arrhythmia Service will be assessed for suitability to take part in this study. Once&#xD;
      recruited, study subjects will be block randomised in a 1:1 fashion to either conventional&#xD;
      right ventricular lead implantation or left ventricular coronary sinus lead implantation.&#xD;
      They will be blinded to their allocation during the course of this study to remove any bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the echocardiograms will be performed by 2 investigators who are not blinded to&#xD;
      the patient's treatment allocation. This is because the pacemaker lead is nearly always well&#xD;
      visualised during echocardiographic studies making blinding impossible. However, the main&#xD;
      outcomes of this study will be quantitative measures of TR and biventricular function derived&#xD;
      from 3D echocardiography rather than qualitative measures used in previous studies and this&#xD;
      will protect against bias that may be caused by the echocardiogram assessors knowing the&#xD;
      allocation of the patients. The studies will also be assessed for interobserver and&#xD;
      intraobserver variability to look for the likelihood of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Duration of follow up period Patients will be seen post discharge at 1 week for wound&#xD;
      care and at 1 months, 6 months and 12 months for pacemaker checks in the pacemaker clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Frequency and duration of follow-up The scheduled follow up is as follows. Note that all&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography studies will include both 2D and 3D echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre implant: transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pacemaker implantation: randomisation when venous access is achieved. Blood samples&#xD;
           taken for biomarker assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post implant day 1: Pacemaker check, transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post implant week 1: Wound check, pacemaker check, transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;

&#xD;
        6. Post implant month 6: Pacemaker check, transthoracic echocardiography, blood samples&#xD;
