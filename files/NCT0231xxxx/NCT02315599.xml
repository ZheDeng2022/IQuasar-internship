  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Gene therapy involves changing the genes inside the body s cells to stop disease. It is&#xD;
      very closely regulated. People who have had this therapy may have problems months or even&#xD;
      years later. Researchers do not know the long-term side effects, so they want to study people&#xD;
      who have had the therapy. They want the study to continue over the next 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study over time the negative side effects from genetically engineered cellular therapy.&#xD;
      This will be studied in people who have been in Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) gene therapy&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who are currently or were previously in a research study with gene therapy in the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute POB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants blood will be tested right before they get the genetically changed cells.&#xD;
           They will get the cells as part of another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the next year, they will come back to the clinic or see their doctor at home at&#xD;
           least every 3 months. They will answer questions about their health and blood will be&#xD;
           drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the next 5 years, they will go to the clinic or see their own doctor once a year.&#xD;
           They will have physical exam and blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 10 years after that, they will be asked every year for health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep their contact information up to date with researchers. They may&#xD;
           be phoned for more health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the participant was under 18 years old when given the gene therapy and turns 18&#xD;
           during this follow-up, they will be asked to sign a new consent form when they turn 18.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study subjects exposed to gene therapy interventions may be at risk for delayed or&#xD;
           longterm adverse consequences. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued&#xD;
           Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products: Guidance for&#xD;
           Industry and Testing of Retroviral Vector-Based Human Gene Therapy Products for&#xD;
           Replication Competent Retrovirus During Product Manufacture and Patient Follow-up:&#xD;
           Guidance for Industry, which outlines a framework to assess the risk of gene&#xD;
           therapy-related delayed adverse events and the essential elements appropriate for the&#xD;
           conduct of long-term follow up observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accordingly, some vector designs (i.e. use of an adenovirus), based on duration of&#xD;
           persistence accompanied by cumulative preclinical and clinical evidence, may require&#xD;
           shorter periods of observation than other vector designs (i.e. use of a lentivirus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To conduct long term safety evaluations for adverse events associated with genetically&#xD;
      engineered cellular therapy in subjects who have participated in Pediatric Oncology Branch&#xD;
      (POB) clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Subjects who are planned to receive or have received at least one dose of a genetically&#xD;
      engineered cellular therapy on a POB gene therapy clinical trial are eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be evaluated for long term safety and occurrence of adverse events&#xD;
           according to the requirements established by the FDA guidance and the NIH Guidelines for&#xD;
           Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines), to&#xD;
           include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long term follow-up after genetically engineered cellular therapy may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-cell infusion evaluations for T-Cell persistence (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring for replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) or replication-competent&#xD;
                lentivirus (RCL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaire to detect delayed adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical record review related to long term adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure adequate follow up for participants in POB receiving genetically engineered&#xD;
           cellular therapy, a maximum accrual of 500 participants will be allowed on this study.&#xD;
           To accommodate 15-year follow-up of all participants, this study will remain open until&#xD;
