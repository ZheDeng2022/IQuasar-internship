  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast tumors are often detected on mammography but may be harder to see in women with dense&#xD;
      breasts. This is why screening breast ultrasound is sometimes used as another test in women&#xD;
      with dense breasts. Ultrasound has been shown to detect additional cancers that are not seen&#xD;
      on regular mammography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is a FDA approved form of mammography. It is&#xD;
      essentially a routine digital mammogram performed after iodine dye (the same that is used&#xD;
      with CT scans) is injected into a vein in the arm. Like screening ultrasound, CEDM has been&#xD;
      shown to detect breast cancers that are not seen on a regular mammogram. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare whether CEDM or screening breast ultrasound is better at detecting&#xD;
      cancer. Both will be done in this study and compared to one another.&#xD;

    <description>With respect to imaging, a positive test is defined by a recommendation for biopsy (BIRADS 4 or 5). Negative imaging tests are those with BIRADS 1-3. The number of recommendations for short term follow up (BI-RADS 3) will also be recorded.</description>
