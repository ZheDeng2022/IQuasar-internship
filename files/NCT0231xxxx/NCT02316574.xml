  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) is a commonly utilized, evidence-based&#xD;
      psychosocial therapy (talk therapy) for alcohol dependence. By identifying the neural&#xD;
      mechanisms through which CBCST changes drinking behavior, it may be possible to improve its&#xD;
      efficacy. CBCST promotes abstinence by teaching &quot;coping skills&quot; for managing alcohol-related&#xD;
      thoughts and emotions. In this pilot study, the investigators examine the neural systems that&#xD;
      play a role in the learning of coping skills through CBCST, specifically focusing on the role&#xD;
      of emotion regulation systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study combines 1) a 12-week clinical trial of CBCST in currently drinking alcohol&#xD;
      dependent patients (target N=25) who are seeking treatment to reduce their drinking with 2)&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that probe neural activity related&#xD;
      to the utilization of copings skills taught in CBCST. The fMRI studies will be performed both&#xD;
      before and after treatment with CBCST, with the goal of determining 1) the pattern of neural&#xD;
      activity that is related to coping skills utilization prior to undergoing CBCST, with&#xD;
      particular focus on neural systems known to play a role in emotion regulation; 2) how CBCST&#xD;
      changes this pattern of neural activity; and 3) how these changes in neural activity predict&#xD;
      changes in alcohol use during CBCST.&#xD;
