  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare, most often pediatric disease characterized by the&#xD;
      formation of obstructive airway casts primarily composed of fibrin. There is presently no&#xD;
      FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for PB, but acute exacerbations of the illness are often treated&#xD;
      with inhaled tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). To date, this is done somewhat anecdotally&#xD;
      because there has been no safety or efficacy testing of this treatment. In addition, there is&#xD;
      presently no reliable surrogate marker of adverse drug events. Nevertheless, in the absence&#xD;
      of inhaled tPA treatment, PB-induced respiratory distress can be severe, often warranting&#xD;
      urgent or emergent bronchoscopy for cast removal, or can sometimes result in respiratory&#xD;
      failure. As such there is a significant unmet need for safety and efficacy testing of inhaled&#xD;
      tPA and for biomarkers of drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Endpoints: The objectives of this protocol are to: 1) test the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of an inhaled tPA regimen in children with PB; and 2) identify potential candidate&#xD;
      biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response. Safety endpoints will consist of the development of&#xD;
      new, active bleeding that is systemic and/or pulmonary and/or new hematuria (defined as gross&#xD;
      hematuria). Secondary endpoints of efficacy will also be measured (e.g., frequency of cast&#xD;
      production). Urine and blood will also be collected for the development of potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale: Plastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare, disease characterized by the&#xD;
      formation of obstructive fibrin airway casts. Presently, acute exacerbations of the illness&#xD;
      are often treated with inhaled tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), in part, because there are&#xD;
      no FDA approved treatments. To date, there has been no safety or efficacy testing of inhaled&#xD;
      tPA. In addition, there is presently no reliable marker that could be used to assess adverse&#xD;
      drug events. However, in the absence of inhaled tPA treatment, PB-induced respiratory&#xD;
      distress can be severe, often warranting urgent or emergent bronchoscopy for cast removal, or&#xD;
      can sometimes result in respiratory failure. This clinical trial will address the unmet need&#xD;
      for safety and efficacy testing of inhaled tPA and for assessing biomarkers of drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Endpoints: This is an open-label, multi-center clinical trial of inhaled tPA&#xD;
      for the treatment of acute PB. The objectives of this protocol are to: 1) test the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of an inhaled tPA regimen in children with PB; and 2) identify potential candidate&#xD;
      biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response. Safety endpoints will consist of the development of&#xD;
      new, active bleeding that is systemic and/or pulmonary and/or new hematuria (defined as gross&#xD;
      hematuria). Secondary endpoints of efficacy will also be measured (e.g., frequency of cast&#xD;
      production). Urine and blood will also be collected for the development of potential&#xD;
      biomarkers of inhaled tPA drug response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Enrolled subjects will be routinely clinically monitored and blood work will be&#xD;
      assessed for the development of new, active bleeding that is systemic and/or pulmonary or new&#xD;
      gross hematuria. Levels of oxygenation and pulmonary function will be assessed during the&#xD;
      study period. We will also include the incidence of expectorated casts as a measurement of&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: This is an open-label study of 24 subjects with PB that will serve as&#xD;
      their own controls. A group of healthy subjects (n=12), Fontan subjects without PB (n=12),&#xD;
      and Fontan subjects with protein losing enteropathy (PLE) (n=12) will serve as controls for&#xD;
      biomarker assay development. The incidence of new, active bleeding events and the frequency&#xD;
      of airway cast expectoration will be assessed in subjects with PB. PLE is another illness&#xD;
      that is associated with congenital heart disease in children that has been surgically&#xD;
      remedied by the Fontan procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active treatment arm (inhaled tPA) will be conducted across six clinical centers. In&#xD;
      addition, these centers will enroll PLE control patients. All other control subjects will&#xD;
      only be enrolled at the University of Michigan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures only pertain to tPA treated patients. Since the control subjects are not&#xD;
      included in the outcome analysis, recruitment/enrollment status pertains to the PB patients.&#xD;
      The University of Michigan has initiated enrollment of healthy control subjects and there&#xD;
      have been consented subjects.&#xD;
