  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is as painful sensations located to the missing limb and classified&#xD;
      as neuropathic pain. In the United States, an estimated 1.7 million patients have undergone&#xD;
      limb amputation, and 60% to 80% of these patients develop PLP (1-2) and it is usually&#xD;
      resistant to a wide variety of treatments (1-4). Three factors may contribute to the&#xD;
      development of persistent, post-amputation PLP by inducing central sensitization at different&#xD;
      times relative to surgery: pre-amputation pain, noxious intraoperative stimuli, and acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain (5-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesis that pre-amputation period could be important in eliminating Phantom&#xD;
      Limb Pain (PLP) in the patients in whom cortical reorganization is not yet established. The&#xD;
      reduction of pre-operative pain and prevention of formation of pain memories may eliminate&#xD;
      development of PLP by using dual networks treatment strategy. This Phase III, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of pre-operative&#xD;
      pregabalin (lyrica) and ketamine in eliminating phantom limb pain in patients undergoing&#xD;
      lower limb amputation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing unilateral lower extremity amputation (n=30) will be randomized in this&#xD;
      double blind parallel placebo control clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      pre-operative pregabalin (lyrica) and ketamine in eliminating phantom limb pain. Patient will&#xD;
      receive either pregabalin and ketamine treatment (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2) during&#xD;
      pre-operative period approximately 4 days (2-4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified during their anesthesia preoperative clinic or orthopedic&#xD;
      inpatient unit (Parkland Hospital or UT Southwestern University Hospital) for the&#xD;
      eligibility. Data base (EPIC) will also be used for prescreening of potential subject by&#xD;
      reviewing clinic visit daily schedule or operating room schedule. Then patients chart will be&#xD;
      reviewed for initial data collection to determine the eligibility of potential subjects with&#xD;
      the use of a HIPAA waiver form. Eligible subject will be approached by the study PI,&#xD;
      investigators, or research coordinator and written consent obtained prior to any study&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnancy test will be performed before the preoperative treatment start for women in&#xD;
      child-bearing age: exceptions include surgically sterile women or women with medically&#xD;
      confirmed menopause. Women with a positive pregnancy test or who report unprotected&#xD;
      heterosexual sex since their previous menses or not currently using and/or willing to use a&#xD;
      medically approved form of contraception (e.g., birth control pill) will not enrolled to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain will be documented using the visual analog pain score (0=no pain, 10=worst imaginary&#xD;
      pain) during preoperative period before the treatment and daily on pain diary and on the day&#xD;
      of surgery and during postoperative period at PACU, 24 and 48 hrs. and long-term follow-up 1,&#xD;
      3, and 6 months after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total opioid dose over the 48-h study period will be documented as PCA pump morphine&#xD;
      consumption for postoperative first 24 hrs. and postoperative oral opioid usage for 48 hrs.&#xD;
      after surgery. Patients will receive a standard general anesthetic for their surgery and&#xD;
      postoperative standard of care pain treatment similar to all patients. Study does not limit&#xD;
      standard post-operative pain medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term analgesic success will be evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. At&#xD;
      follow-up period, a pain diary will be used for the patients' self-assessment on pain&#xD;
      occurrence, intensity, duration for phantom and stump pain, and documentation of oral&#xD;
      analgesic usage. Analgesic medication use and daily pain scores will be documented on pain&#xD;
      diary for 1 month period following surgery. At first follow-up visit, patient will be seen in&#xD;
      Pain Clinic 1 month after the surgery. Patient will be called from home 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      the surgery for long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all-time points, the Self-Rating Depression Scale will be used to assess depression and&#xD;
      the patients will complete the Pain-Related Self-Statement Scale (PRSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the involvement in the study will be 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial. Investigational Drug&#xD;
      Pharmacy (IDS) will randomize subjects either treatment group or placebo. IDS will dispense&#xD;
      the drugs/placebo.&#xD;
