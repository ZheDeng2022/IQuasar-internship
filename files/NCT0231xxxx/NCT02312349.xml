  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in genetically susceptible individuals&#xD;
      characterized by inflammation of the small intestine due to gluten intolerance. This protein&#xD;
      is found in cereals such as wheat, barley and rye. In Argentina, oats are also considered a&#xD;
      toxic grain since are as highly contaminated as the previous three. For this reason, the&#xD;
      acronym TACC (Trigo, avena, cebada y centono: wheat, oats, barley and centono) is used for&#xD;
      their identification. An effective treatment for celiac disease consists in a gluten-free&#xD;
      diet (GFD). For most patients, a gluten-free intake results in a symptomatic and pathological&#xD;
      complete remission and decreases the risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall prevalence of CD is around 1% in several Western countries. An Argentinian study&#xD;
      shows a 1.167 prevalence of CD in studied patients, being doubled for women than men. Another&#xD;
      study in a closed population of the Health Plan of Hospital Italiano de Bs As estimated a&#xD;
      prevalence of 0.22 CD diagnosis. In developed countries, for each diagnosed case there is an&#xD;
      average of 5-10 cases that have not been diagnosed yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD patients and their families should be properly informed about GFD, since there are many&#xD;
      factors, voluntary and involuntary, which can affect the treatment. Even though a strict diet&#xD;
      is imperative, food handling awareness is equally important in order to prevent&#xD;
      cross-contamination and gluten intake hidden in certain products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, several countries have shown an increasing interest in improving the supply&#xD;
      of gluten-free foods in supermarkets, food factories and restaurants. In turn, a British&#xD;
      study shows that chefs have less awareness about celiac disease than the overall population.&#xD;
      Another Canadian study, which assessed the quality of life of people with CD, revealed that&#xD;
      80% of them avoid eating in restaurants for fear of contamination, causing a decrease in&#xD;
      their social life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Argentina, there are associations that generate lists of marks and gluten-free products&#xD;
      allowing safe intake of processed foods, however, it is unknown the food supply suitable for&#xD;
      consumption for people with CD as well as the staff's knowledge in gluten-free food&#xD;
      preparation in restaurants, pubs, pizzerias and fast food places. U.S. has quality assurance&#xD;
      systems that certify good manufacturing practices and GFD handling in restaurants and selling&#xD;
      local foods, although its application is not mandatory. In our country, there is no such&#xD;
      certification, so food safety on restaurants can not be guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eating behaviors are influenced by the reality in which people live, including food&#xD;
      availability indoors and outdoors. The current lifestyle leads more and more people to make&#xD;
      meals away from home, so that the variety and quality of food sold in restaurants and other&#xD;
      stores conditions the consumption. Thus, the availability of &quot;safe&quot; foods in places where&#xD;
      people with CD carried some of their meals, help improve adherence to the GFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate gluten-free products' supply in elaborated food&#xD;
      stores in Buenos Aires City and to discover the level of information possessed by&#xD;
      manufacturers in the production of food.&#xD;
