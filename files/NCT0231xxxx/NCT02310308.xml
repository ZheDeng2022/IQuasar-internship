      The effect of chewing gums containing MBE and xylitol on different variables related to&#xD;
      caries and gingivitis in a sample of adult volunteers with a high risk for caries will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The main result of that double-blind randomized controlled interventional trial&#xD;
      will be that chewing gum containing MBE was more effective in reducing plaque acidogenicity,&#xD;
      salivary mutans streptococci concentration and gingival bleeding compared to a xylitol and&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental caries incidence in adults is similar to that in children and adolescents, but few&#xD;
      caries preventive agents have been evaluated for effectiveness in adult populations. Magnolia&#xD;
      bark extract (MBE) is a plant extract obtained from the bark of magnolia that has been widely&#xD;
      used in traditional Chinese medicine for 2,000 years, Magnolia officinalis has been used for&#xD;
      the treatment of acute pain, diarrhea, coughs and urinary problems. The two main constituents&#xD;
      of the bark of this medicinal plant are magnolol and honokiol. They are known to possess a&#xD;
      variety of pharmacological properties, including therapeutic-related activities central&#xD;
      nervous system inhibition anti-inflammatory effects, antimicrobial activity, antioxidative&#xD;
      activity and freeradical scavenging activity. Magnolol andhonokiol have also been reported to&#xD;
      inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis,&#xD;
      Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga gingivalis and&#xD;
      Veillonella disper in vitro and reduce the dental caries values in rats. Consequently, the&#xD;
      antimicrobial properties of MBE against cariogenic and plaque bacteria have showed promising&#xD;
      results. The effect of chewing gums containing MBE and xylitol on different variables related&#xD;
      to caries and gingivitis in a sample of adult volunteers with a high risk for caries will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The main result of that double-blind randomized controlled interventional trial&#xD;
      will be that chewing gum containing MBE was more effective in reducing plaque acidogenicity,&#xD;
      salivary mutans streptococci concentration and gingival bleeding compared to a xylitol and&#xD;
      sugar-free chewing gum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods A two-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      sponsored by Perfetti Van Melle that tests the effects on caries lesions development of daily&#xD;
      use of a chewing gum containing Magnolia Bark Extract and xylitol will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will take place in the dental clinics located in the dental schools of the&#xD;
      University of Sassari and Milan. The study will be approved by the Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
      University of Sassari.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Principal inclusion criteria will be age range (30-55 years) and the&#xD;
      presence of at least one cavitated caries lesion, but no more than three. Subjects with&#xD;
      systemic disease that interfered with the oral ecosystem will be excluded. The caries&#xD;
      criterion will be designed to include participants who are at risk of forming new lesions.&#xD;
      Sample size for preliminary screening will be calculated on the basis of previous studies&#xD;
      regarding caries prevalence (about 26%) in adults [Campus et al, 2011] and relative odds&#xD;
      ratio 2.88 of incidence, as reported in literature [Ito et al, 2011]. Thus, the theoretical&#xD;
      sample size for preliminary screening will be set to 1200 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to get statistical comparison results, the number of subjects per group to be&#xD;
      included in the analysis will be calculated. Considering a 35% difference among groups to be&#xD;
      significant, and a 95% probability of obtaining a significant difference among groups at the&#xD;
      5% level, the resulting number of subjects per group will be set 104.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure an adequate quantity of surfaces at risk, participants will be required to have a&#xD;
      minimum of 12 natural teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment The subjects will be randomly assigned to three groups: a Magnolia and Xylitol&#xD;
      group (MX group) using a chewing gum containing MBE and xylitol, a Xylitol group (X group)&#xD;
      using a chewing gum with the same content of xylitol but free of MBE and finally and a&#xD;
      Control group (C group), using a sugar-free chewing gum without MBE and xylitol. Each subject&#xD;
      will be instructed to chew 1 or 2 pellets for 5 minutes, 3 times a day (2 in the morning, 2&#xD;
      after the midday meal and 1 in the afternoon). Thus, the total daily intake of magnolol and&#xD;
      honokiol in MX group will be 11.9 mg/day. The daily use of the three different chewing gums&#xD;
      will be carried out for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three clinical evaluation for caries diagnosis will be performed: one at baseline, a second&#xD;
      at the end of the chewing period (after 12 months from baseline) and a third after 24 months&#xD;
      from baseline assessment. A microbiological evaluation for cariogenic bacteria will be&#xD;
      performed immediately after the clinical assessments. Mutans streptococci and lactobacilli&#xD;
      counts in saliva will be assessed and categorized using the dip-slide technique (CTR&#xD;
      bacteria, Ivoclar Vivadent, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a sugar challenge, measures of interdental plaque pH, using pH indicator strips&#xD;
      (Spezialindikator, pH range 4.0-7.0; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), will be performed at 5&#xD;
      different points: at baseline, after 6 months of chewing gum use, after 12 months of chewing&#xD;
      gum use, 6 months after the end of chewing gum use (18 months from baseline) and finally 12&#xD;
      months after the end of chewing gum use (24 months from baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Eligible enrolees will be randomized to either the active or control arms.&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out using a computer-based program. Staff and participants will&#xD;
      be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes The primary study outcome will be the cumulative D2 or Filled Surface (D2 FS)&#xD;
      increment (root and coronal surfaces combined) cumulated from baseline through the two&#xD;
      follow-up examinations. In addition to the caries increment, data on participant safety and&#xD;
      same risk factors related to caries development will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The results of this RCT should bring some clarity to the effectiveness of&#xD;
      MBE as a caries preventive agent.&#xD;
