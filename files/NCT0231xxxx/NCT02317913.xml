      To investigate the epidemiological pictures of Kawasaki disease (KD) in Shanghai from 2008&#xD;
      through 2012, and illustrate the risk factors of coronary arterial lesions .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A questionnaire form and diagnostic guidelines for KD will be sent to 50 hospitals providing&#xD;
      pediatric medical care in Shanghai, China. All patients with KD diagnosed during January 2008&#xD;
      through December 2012 will be recruited and analyzed. Distribution of age at onset and&#xD;
      seasonal features of disease incidence wil be described. Univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      association analyses will be performed to identify risk factors to Coronary arterial lesions&#xD;
      (CAL) defined as ectasia or aneurysm by using multivariate logistic regression model.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The 5th revised edition of diagnostic criteria for KD, issued by the Japan Kawasaki&#xD;
             Disease Research Committee at the 7th International Kawasaki Disease Symposium in&#xD;
             2002, was adopted. Cases were included in the study if the patients had at least five&#xD;
             of the following six clinical manifestations or at least four signs together with&#xD;
             coronary abnormalities documented by echocardiography or coronary angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. fever persisting 5 days or longer (inclusive of those cases in whom the fever has&#xD;
                  subsided before the 5th day in response to therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. bilateral conjunctival congestion&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. changes of lips and oral cavity, such as reddening of lips, strawberry tongue,&#xD;
                  diffuse congestion of oral and pharyngeal mucosa&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. polymorphous exanthema&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. changes of peripheral extremities, such as reddening of palms and soles,&#xD;
                  indurative edema at initial stage, or membranous desquamation from fingertips at&#xD;
                  convalescent stage&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. acute nonpurulent cervical lymphadenopathy. In addition, the cases of incomplete&#xD;
                  KD, diagnosed with referring to the guidelines for incomplete KD made by American&#xD;
                  Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Heart Association (AHA) in 2004, were&#xD;
                  also included in this investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cases were not in accordance with the recruited criteria&#xD;
