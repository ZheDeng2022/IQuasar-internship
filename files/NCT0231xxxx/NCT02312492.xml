      Specific Aim 1: To compare the metabolic fate (transport, conversion and oxidation) of&#xD;
      labeled 18:0 (13C18:0) and its metabolic product 18:1 (13C18:1) in the fed state after&#xD;
      habituation to diets enriched in the corresponding fatty acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In the fed state, the metabolic fate of 13C18:0 compared to 13C18:1 will be&#xD;
      characterized by similar transport, higher conversion, and similar oxidation rates..&#xD;

      Vegetable oils high in the specific fatty acids of interest - stearic (found in cocoa butter,&#xD;
      meats), palmitic (found in meats, dairy and some plant oils) and stearic acid's metabolic&#xD;
      product, oleic (found in olive and corn oil) - will be used to displace each other in a&#xD;
      standardized diet and fed to mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women using a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled crossover design. Six women who are enrolled in 10150 - Study A will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study. Each of the phases will be 5 weeks in length with a 2-4&#xD;
      week break between phases. All food and drink will be provided to study volunteers. Blood&#xD;
      pressure and body weight will be monitored once per week and adjustments made, if necessary,&#xD;
      to maintain a stable weight. During week 1 of the 18:0 and 18:1 dietary phases, a fasting&#xD;
      blood sample will be drawn. A single stool sample will be collected on any of the study&#xD;
      visits after week three. On Day 1 of week 5, following a 12 hour fast, each volunteer will&#xD;
      receive their usual diet divided into 15 hourly small meals. A purified tracer dose (1 mg/kg&#xD;
      bodyweight [BW]) of 13C fatty acid will be incorporated into the 1pm meal. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be collected from a catheter inserted into the subcubital vein just before consuming the&#xD;
      first hourly meal and then 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 15 hours thereafter. Breath samples will&#xD;
      be collected before the first hourly meal as well as at various time-points after. Additional&#xD;
      fasting blood samples will be collected on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the 18:0 and 18:1 diet&#xD;
      phases. At the end of Day 1, volunteers will have the option of returning home or staying&#xD;
      overnight at the Jean Mayer Human Nutrition Research Center.&#xD;

This was accomplished by formulating a diet containing 10%E fat and then adding the experimental oils (oleic) to 30%E total fat by incorporating them into various food items intended for consumption throughout the day. The actual food items comprising the 3 diets will be similar, only differing in the experimental oils.</description>
