  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate control of immunosuppression is critical in preventing graft failure after solid&#xD;
      organ transplantation (SOT) and in avoiding life-threatening viral and malignant&#xD;
      complications. Prolonging patient and graft survival and delaying re-transplantation as&#xD;
      children reach adulthood is critical to optimal use of a scarce resource. This requires&#xD;
      tailoring post-transplant management to the unique needs of the child. Immunosuppression&#xD;
      management is challenging in infants, children and youth. The interval from birth to young&#xD;
      adulthood sees profound changes in physiological processes, body size and immune maturation;&#xD;
      infancy and adolescence are the periods of most rapid and dramatic change. Three pivotal&#xD;
      factors affect immunosuppression control in the child: 1) age-dependent variation in drug&#xD;
      metabolism; 2) developmental changes in immune function with increased childhood&#xD;
      susceptibility to infections, including those caused by viruses; and 3) behavioural changes&#xD;
      in adolescence and young adulthood linked with poor treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will identify the most important factors influencing immunosuppression control&#xD;
      across the pediatric age range, from infancy to young adulthood, including age-related&#xD;
      changes in drug metabolism, immune function, and susceptibility to viral infections, as well&#xD;
      as health care system factors affecting treatment adherence. This is the first comprehensive,&#xD;
      multi-organ transplant study to identify age-related biologic and health care systems&#xD;
      determinants of variability in immunosuppression control in children and youth. Results will&#xD;
      inform personalized age-appropriate strategies to improve immunosuppression control and&#xD;
      reduce the unacceptably high graft failure and viral complication rates in this vulnerable&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The POSITIVE Study brings together researchers across Canada and is one of 6 projects and 3&#xD;
      cores that constitute the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) funded&#xD;
      interdisciplinary research program called the Canadian National Transplant Research Program&#xD;
      (CNTRP). The CNTRP is a national program designed to increase organ and tissue donation in&#xD;
      Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants. As&#xD;
      a national program, CNTRP provides robust power for pediatric studies that would not&#xD;
      otherwise be possible. While primarily focused on issues unique to a pediatric and young&#xD;
      adult population, this study will interact closely with all other CNTRP projects. These&#xD;
      reciprocal interactions will accelerate new discovery that can be cross-applied in different&#xD;
      populations outside of pre-specified age groups. Interactions will ensure rapid knowledge&#xD;
      transfer, uptake and dissemination into practice. This is the largest national cohort study&#xD;
      of pediatric transplant patients to date in Canada, and it will create a longitudinal dataset&#xD;
      with clinical and biological specimens linkable to transplant registries and provincial&#xD;
      administrative datasets.&#xD;

      The overall objective of this project is to analyze physiological factors that impact immune&#xD;
      response and effect of immunosuppression across different pediatric age groups, to develop&#xD;
      age-appropriate medical and health care strategies that can improve graft survival and reduce&#xD;
      complications in a pediatric and young adult population. There are 3 primary aims of this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop age-appropriate calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dosing for pediatric SOT patients:&#xD;
      We hypothesize that physiologically-based (PB) modeling will enable personalized CNI dosing&#xD;
      for infants, children and youth based on age, pharmacogenotype and immune maturity. Aim 1&#xD;
      deliverables include 1) a personalized physiologically-based CNI dosing algorithm in SOT; 2)&#xD;
      validation of pediatric sensitive immunosuppression monitoring tools and their therapeutic&#xD;
      targets; and 3) validation of immunologic assays for assessing age-specific immune responses.&#xD;
      We anticipate that personalized CNI dosing will result in early attainment and maintenance of&#xD;
      therapeutic drug concentrations, reduce the frequency of out-of-range concentrations&#xD;
      post-transplant, improve safety and efficacy of immunosuppression, and reduce dependence on&#xD;
      therapeutic drug monitoring to guide drug dosing. Standardized assessment of immune function&#xD;
      may also monitor immunosuppression more reliably and eventually reduce the need for invasive&#xD;
      monitoring like biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Develop risk prediction tools based on viral-host interactions that predispose young&#xD;
      SOT and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients to Epstein-Barr virus&#xD;
      disorders/post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV disorders/PTLD): We hypothesize&#xD;
      that susceptibility to EBV disorders/PTLD is influenced by the interaction of high-risk EBV&#xD;
      subtypes with host factors like age, immune maturation and intensity of immunosuppression. In&#xD;
      the above context, &quot;EBV disorders&quot; refers to non-malignant EBV disease as well as sustained&#xD;
      elevation of viral loads in the absence of PTLD. We will identify high-risk viral subtypes&#xD;
      and age-related differences in host immunity that interact to increase susceptibility to EBV&#xD;
      disorders/PTLD in young patients. Important clinical applications are: 1) knowledge of host&#xD;
      susceptibility factors (age and immune maturation) at the time of transplant may assist&#xD;
      choice of less intensive immunosuppression to reduce risk of developing EBV (e.g., avoidance&#xD;
      of T cell depletion therapies, primary prevention) and promote use of EBV prophylaxis in at&#xD;
      risk patients (secondary prevention); 2) an EBV genotype panel will be developed as a&#xD;
      clinical tool for detecting high risk subtypes in patients with EBV. This will help identify&#xD;
      patients exposed to EBV who should receive aggressive therapy for EBV and/or PTLD&#xD;
      (personalized therapy). This innovative risk stratification will enable personalized&#xD;
      immunosuppression strategies and strategies to prevent and treat EBV/PTLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Develop health care systems strategies to enhance medication adherence in adolescents&#xD;
      and young adults: Medication adherence is determined by factors at a variety of different&#xD;
      &quot;levels&quot;: patient-level (patient-, condition-, and therapy-related factors), &quot;micro&quot;-level&#xD;
      (social factors and interactions with the care team), &quot;meso&quot;-level (organization and&#xD;
      expertise of the healthcare team and care processes), and &quot;macro&quot;-level (high-level&#xD;
      healthcare systems factors, including care and medication cost coverage, and overall care&#xD;
      environment). We hypothesize that there are significant differences in modifiable meso- and&#xD;
      macro-level systems factors between pediatric programs, between adult programs, and between&#xD;
      pediatric and adult programs. Furthermore, we hypothesize that modifiable meso- and&#xD;
      macro-level systems factors are independently associated with medication adherence. This aim&#xD;
      has two primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To characterize differences between Canadian solid organ transplant programs in&#xD;
      potentially modifiable meso- and macro-level systems factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To identify potentially modifiable meso- and macro-level factors that are&#xD;
      determinants of adherence, adjusting for potential confounders.&#xD;
