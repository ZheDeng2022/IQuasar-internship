  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed trial in assessment of effects of Kalydeco™ treatment on sinonasal&#xD;
      involvement in CF patients with at least one mutation of G551D receiving a new therapy with&#xD;
      the CFTR potentiator. The focus will be given on changes in epithelial lining fluid&#xD;
      inflammatory markers from CF upper airways sampled by nasal lavage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is subdivided into a part A assessing inflammatory markers in NL and sinonasal&#xD;
      symptoms longitudinally from pre-treatment to months with the new therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will only be performed in a smaller subgroup and assess inflammatory markers in NL&#xD;
      every second day in the first month of treatment and then every week until the end of month 3&#xD;
      with Kalydeco™ therapy.&#xD;

      Enrollment of Patients In this longitudinal trial, 10 CF patients with a G551D mutation,&#xD;
      newly receiving ivacaftor 150 mg bid, as approved (1), were included in the Jena (Germany)&#xD;
      and Innsbruck (Austria) University CF centers. Inclusion criteria were: CF patients' age ≥ 6&#xD;
      years with a diagnosis confirmed by two positive sweat tests and/or detection of two&#xD;
      disease-causing CFTR mutations; one of them being G551D. Patients were required to strictly&#xD;
      follow the procedures defined in the SOPs and they and/or their parents gave informed written&#xD;
      consent prior to enrolment. Exclusion criteria were: inability to perform NL in a&#xD;
      standardized manner as described below, contraindication for ivacaftor, pregnancy or&#xD;
      breast-feeding, and participation in another clinical study within 30 days prior to study&#xD;
      drug administration. Nasal Lavage Patients were thoroughly trained to perform NL in&#xD;
      standardized home-based conditions (Figures 1A-C) by using the instructionvideo from our&#xD;
      publication in Journal of Immunological Methods 2014 (14) and an illustrated SOP sheet. The&#xD;
      pooled native NLF was transferred into disposed reaction tubes containing 15 μL of protease&#xD;
      inhibitor (Figures 1D, E) and, within 30 minutes after sampling, stored in a freezer below&#xD;
      -18°C until transfer on ice to the centers. Here, the vials were directly stored at - 80°C&#xD;
      until performance of laboratory analyses. Prior to the initiation of ivacaftor therapy, NL&#xD;
      was collected at least once a week (mean: 5.5 ± 3.9 samplings/patient) during a mean time of&#xD;
      30.3 ± 19.7 days. During the first month of therapy (days 0-30), NL was collected every&#xD;
      second day and once/week from month two onward (mean: 25.9 ± 4.1 samplings/patient).&#xD;
      Follow-up range after initiation of ivacaftor: 2.3-16.1 months, (median: 5.7 months).&#xD;
      Assessment of Inflammatory Mediators Concentrations of IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured in&#xD;
      undiluted NL fluid using Milliplex® MAP Kits (Human High Sensitivity HS TCMAG-28K, Merck&#xD;
      Millipore; Darmstadt, Germany) and a Bio-Plex® 200 system (Bio-Rad; Hercules, California,&#xD;
      USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements of Neutrophil Elastase (NE)&#xD;
      were performed using Human PMN Elastase ELISA (DEH3311, Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH; Kiel,&#xD;
      Germany) and read by a FLUOstar Galaxy spectrometer (BMG LABTECH GmbH; Offenburg, Germany).&#xD;
      As specified by the manufacturer, lower detection limits were 0.12 pg/mL (IL-1b), 0.13 pg/mL&#xD;
      (IL-6), 0.12 pg/mL (IL-8), and 0.2 ng/mL (NE). Statistical Analyses Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      were used to describe clinical characteristics of the study population. Linear mixed-effects&#xD;
      models were performed to analyze overall trends of inflammatory markers. To smooth effects&#xD;
      caused by outliers in inflammatory marker values, individual changes regarding cumulative&#xD;
      periods for each patient were determined by calculating medians for the time periods before&#xD;
      and after treatment initiation (i.e. regarding periods of 4, 8 and 12 weeks during treatment&#xD;
      as shown in Figure 2). The resulting individual patients' medians were used to calculate&#xD;
      medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) of the entire cohort at the end of the above-mentioned&#xD;
      time periods. Wilcoxon signedrank test (two-tailed) was applied to determine changes in the&#xD;
      aforementioned inflammatory mediators, sweat test, FEV1 and their statistical significance&#xD;
      (using p&lt;0.05) during the new therapy. All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS&#xD;
      19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA); figures were created with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software&#xD;
      Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).&#xD;

At the start of the study, patients were aged 7-45 years (mean age: 16.55 ± 13.42 years). Results of sweat tests and lung function FEV1 were available only from 8 patients. Lung function at baseline, as obtained from those patients, ranged from 0.96 to 4.07 L (mean FEV1: 99.7 ± 20.3% predicted, median: 103.6% predicted, IQR=20.4% predicted).</description>
