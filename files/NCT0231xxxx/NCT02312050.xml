      A phase 2b, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study of GCS-100 in&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease caused by diabetes. The study will enroll approximately&#xD;
      375 patients at multiple centers located in the United States. Study duration is 6 months.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to treatment with placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride&#xD;
      Injection, USP), 1 mg, 3 mg, or 9 mg GCS-100. All doses of study drug will be administered&#xD;
      via intravenous (IV) push injection once weekly for 2 months (8 weeks), then every other week&#xD;
      for an additional 4 months (16 weeks).&#xD;

      Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,&#xD;
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate&#xD;
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,&#xD;
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin- 3&#xD;
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of&#xD;
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at&#xD;
      treating patients with CKD caused by diabetes.&#xD;
