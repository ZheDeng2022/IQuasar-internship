    <textblock>
      Prolonged labour is a cause of maternal mortality and morbidity and perinatal mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. Prolonged labour is most often defined as onset of regular , rhythmical painful&#xD;
      contractions accompanied by cervical dilatation where labour is longer than 24&#xD;
      hours.prolonged active phase should not last longer than 12 hours without full assessment in&#xD;
      a facility able to offer management and treatment of complications.Causes of prolonged labour&#xD;
      usually due to poor or uncoordinated uterine action , fetal head malposition , and or&#xD;
      abnormal pelvis either due to bone or soft tissue obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrested or prolonged labor is a frequent indication of cesarean delivery.Prolonged labor is&#xD;
      also associated with increased pain and negative birth experience. Women with a prolonged&#xD;
      first stage of labor have experienced a higher rate of postpartum hemorrhage,&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis and neonatal admission to the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caesarean section rates are over 20% in many developed countries and have increased nearly&#xD;
      four-fold relative to the 5% rate observed in the early 1970s. The main diagnosis&#xD;
      contributing to this increase is dystocia or prolonged labor.Data obtained from local&#xD;
      hospital records showed that Caesarean section rate in Assiut University Women's Health&#xD;
      Hospital is 47.96% at 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dystocia is a term used for delay of labor progress and usually refers to abnormally slow&#xD;
      cervical dilatation.It has been proposed that the partogram should include, as a diagnostic&#xD;
      criterion, a 1 cm/hour line originating at admission. The World Health Organization has&#xD;
      proposed a modified partogram that recommends that active phase be diagnosed only at 4 cm or&#xD;
      more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin augmentation of uterine contractions with or without amniotomy is widely used in the&#xD;
      modern obstetric practice to treat a slow labour, although the timing of oxytocin initiation&#xD;
      and amniotomy may vary widely.This intervention is based on the hypothesis that the most&#xD;
      frequent cause of dystocia is inadequate uterine contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which amniotomy speeds up labour remains unclear it is thought that when the&#xD;
      membranes are ruptured ,the production and release of prostaglandins and oxytocin increases&#xD;
      resulting in stronger contractions and quicker cervical dilatation. I has been found that&#xD;
      early intervention (augmentation versus routine care ) with amniotomy and oxytocin to be&#xD;
      associated with a modest reduction in the risk of caesarean section. Moreover, amniotomy&#xD;
      found to be associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery compared with women&#xD;
      without amniotomy for shortening of spontaneous labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 methods ( Amniotomy, Oxytocin or both) used for augmentation of labor in different&#xD;
      settings without a real conclusion which is better.&#xD;
