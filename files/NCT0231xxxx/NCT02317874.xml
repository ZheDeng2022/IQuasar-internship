      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib when given together&#xD;
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (advanced) or cannot be removed by surgery. Talazoparib is an&#xD;
      inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes&#xD;
      damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing&#xD;
      them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such&#xD;
      as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving talazoparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      talazoparib (BMN 673) seven day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      talazoparib (BMN 673) three day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of talazoparib (BMN 673) in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of talazoparib (BMN 673) when given&#xD;
      in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel correlate with thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of talazoparib (BMN 673) alone after the&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and talazoparib (BMN 673).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To observe the safety and tolerability of talazoparib (BMN 673) in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin and talazoparib (BMN 673) alone after the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To serially evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters and use indirect&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models to correlate with tumor response and resistance to&#xD;
      the combination talazoparib (BMN 673), carboplatin, and paclitaxel therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore mechanisms of resistance to the combination of talazoparib (BMN 673) with&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talazoparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      dosing schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE A: Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, paclitaxel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4-6 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE B: Patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-3, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days&#xD;
      for 4-6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time after 4-6 cycles of treatment, patients may continue combination study therapy&#xD;
      with talazoparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, talazoparib and carboplatin, talazoparib alone&#xD;
      (continuous dosing), or observation without therapy at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0 until March 31, 2018. CTCAE version 5.0 will be utilized beginning April 1, 2018. Toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of types and severities for each schedule and dose level separately. The number and severity of toxicity incidents will be analyzed descriptively in tabular format. Comparisons between dose level arms will be performed using Fisher's exact test. Ninety percent confidence intervals for dose-limiting toxicity rates will be constructed for dose levels with 6 or more patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anti-tumor response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease, stratified by treatment schedule. 90% confidence intervals for the proportions of subjects with a confirmed anti-tumor response will be computed for dose levels with 6 or more patients. Exact logistic regression analysis will be performed to evaluate the dose-response relationship. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare responses between treatment schedules.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the curve and concentration) in plasma samples</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 4 hours after talazoparib administration on days 1 and 3 or 7 (depending on assigned schedule) of cycle 1 and 0 and 4 hours on day 1 of all subsequent cycles</time_frame>
    <description>All pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized by treatment schedule dose level using standard descriptive statistics: means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit). The Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test will be performed to determine the significance of the association between increasing dose level and each of the pharmacokinetic parameters within each treatment schedule. A Spearman rank correlation analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between actual dose administered and the pharmacokinetic parameters.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 2 hours, and 4 hours after talazoparib administration on days 1 and 3 or 7 (depending on assigned schedule) of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum concentration levels will be summarized in terms of means, standard deviations and ranges. Linear mixed effects modeling with subject specific random effects will be performed to evaluate maximum concentration and plasma concentration collected on day 1 and day 3 predict changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, the empirical Bayesian approach will be utilized to incorporate pharmacokinetic data from other phase I studies of the agent to construct a pharmacokinetic population model.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 day 1 to cycle 2 day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell levels from the cycle 1, day 1 (prior to first talazoparib dose) assessment to the cycle 1, day 3 or 7 and cycle 2, day 1 assessments will be evaluated using a two-sample t-test.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mutation status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to time of progression (up to 4 weeks after last dose of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The number and frequency of mutation status changes from the baseline biopsy assessment to the biopsy obtained at the time of progression will be summarized in tabular format. The frequency of mutation status changes will be analyzed using a paired t-test or nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. A negative binomial regression model will be utilized to account for the dose effect. The presence of individual mutations will be compared between the baseline and time of progression assessment using a paired McNemar's test. The Benjamini-Hochberg method will also be utilized.</description>

               -  These agents may be permitted if discontinuation is not feasible and no&#xD;
                  acceptable alternatives are available as determined by the treating physician;&#xD;
                  however, caution should be used; consider monitoring with labs or drug levels or&#xD;
                  by symptoms and consider dose adjustments of the medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because talazoparib (BMN 673) is a PARP&#xD;
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with talazoparib (BMN 673), breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with talazoparib (BMN 673); these potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for interactions with study treatment;&#xD;
             in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated&#xD;
             with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant bleeding (i.e. gastrointestinal [GI] bleed, intracranial&#xD;
             bleeding) within 6 months or major surgery within 4 weeks; minor surgeries (i.e. port&#xD;
             placement, cataract surgery) are allowed within 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapies are not permitted (this includes coumadin,&#xD;
             low molecular weight heparins, factor Xa inhibitors, aspirin and non-steroidal&#xD;
             anti-inflammatory drug [NSAIDS] or other medicines with similar effects)&#xD;
