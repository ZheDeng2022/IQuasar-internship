      Background of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An anterior cruciate ligament rupture is a serious injury to the knee with high probability&#xD;
      of the occurrence of dynamic instability, accompanying lesions and early post-traumatic&#xD;
      arthrosis. Despite conservative treatment through rehabilitation or ACL reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery not all patients do return to their previous activity levels. Moreover degenerative&#xD;
      changes, especially early posttraumatic arthrosis, are not counteracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to optimize the clinical results after ACL surgery, a renewed interest has emerged&#xD;
      in healing the patient's own ruptured ACL after attaching. Literature suggests that with the&#xD;
      current innovations in surgical repair techniques of (natural) healing of a ruptured ACL may&#xD;
      result in similar clinical outcomes in comparison to the gold standard, the ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction. In addition, it may even reduce degenerative changes occur in relation to the&#xD;
      gold standard. Moreover, the return to daily activities and sports level seems significantly&#xD;
      faster than after ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a suture (suture repair) of a ruptured ACL, combined with a dynamic&#xD;
      intraligamentary stabilization, as well as microfracture of the femoral notch, passes, at&#xD;
      least equal efficacy in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using&#xD;
      autologous hamstrings in terms of functional recovery 1 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DIS bonding technique will be applied in the current study to surgically repair (suture)&#xD;
      the ruptured ACL. DIS is an abbreviation and stands for intraligamentary dynamic&#xD;
      stabilization (DIS). DIS has been used in humans and seems to provide a high patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, favorable clinical and radiological results. However, to our knowledge, to&#xD;
      date, no randomized comparative study has been conducted yet in which the DIS technique is&#xD;
      compared with the gold standard, the ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the hypothesis that suture repair of a ruptured vkb, combined with a dynamic&#xD;
      intraligamentary stabilization and microfracture of the femoral notch, results in at least&#xD;
      equal effectiveness compared with an ACL reconstruction using autologous hamstring in terms&#xD;
      of functional recovery one year postoperatively in terms of a patient self-reported outcome&#xD;
      related to be able to conduct daily and sporting activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of clinical outcomes, self-reported by the patient outcomes, osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      rehabilitation time required for return to daily and sporting activities and levels of&#xD;
      sporting activity which has returned in patients with status after an ACL rupture and suture&#xD;
      repair augmented with a dynamic intraligamentary microfracture and stabilization of the&#xD;
      femoral notch in comparison with an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the&#xD;
      ipsilateral hamstring graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center stratified block randomized controlled trial. Patients with ACL&#xD;
      rupture, confirmed by an orthopedic surgeon based on the outpatient history and radiographic&#xD;
      images, will be randomized into an experimental ('repair' / DIS) group after inclusion and a&#xD;
      control (reconstruction, regular care) group. Patients will be stratified on the level of&#xD;
      sport/physical active practice, on the basis of the Tegner score. The Tegner score is an&#xD;
      evaluative and inventory questionnaire on which the patient indicates the gravity of his work&#xD;
      and/or sports activities. A higher score is associated with a higher level of physical&#xD;
      strain/activity . On the basis of the Tegner score patients will be stratified into a&#xD;
      'moderate' physically active stratum (group Tegner score 5-6-7) and 'highly' physically&#xD;
      active stratum (group Tegner score 8 -9-10). Stratification based on the degree of physical&#xD;
      activity is considered to be important because the extent and severity of physical&#xD;
      activity/strain in daily life poses a potential (difference) in risk of re-rupture between&#xD;
      the two study arms. In order to minimize potential differences in 'exposure' or 'risk of&#xD;
      re-rupture' between the two study groups stratification is relevant.Measurements take place&#xD;
      at baseline, peri-operative / immediately after surgery, 6 weeks, 3,6,9 months and 1, 2, 5&#xD;
      and 10 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: (Physically) active patients from 18 untill 30 years, who has visited the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the orthopedic surgeon because of a knee injury resulting in a ACL&#xD;
      rupture, for whom surgery indication for an ACL reconstruction exists and who can be operated&#xD;
      on within three weeks after the onset of the ACL rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      n=48 patients will participate in the current study. Patients will be assigned to a suture&#xD;
      repair of the ruptured vkb complemented by a dynamic intraligamentary stabilization (DIS) and&#xD;
      microfracture of the femoral notch or the gold standard, a ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported functional outcome at one-year follow post surgery measured by the IKDC 2000&#xD;
      subjective scale.&#xD;
