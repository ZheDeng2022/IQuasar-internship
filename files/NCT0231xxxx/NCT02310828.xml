      The purpose of this study is to validate the novel hypothesis that daily use of L-cysteine&#xD;
      (Acetium® capsules) is an effective means to decrease the frequency of (or completely abort)&#xD;
      the attacks of cluster headache.&#xD;

      Background: Cluster headache belongs to a group of idiopathic headache entities, the&#xD;
      trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs), all of which involve short-lasting, unilateral,&#xD;
      severe headache attacks and typical accompanying autonomic symptoms. The life-time prevalence&#xD;
      of cluster headache for adults of all ages is around 125/100,000, or approximately 0.1%, with&#xD;
      clear male dominance (4:1). Prophylactic treatment is an important part of the total&#xD;
      management of cluster headache patients, having twofold goals: i) to reduce the frequency,&#xD;
      painfulness, and/or duration of headache attacks, and ii) to increase the effectiveness of&#xD;
      abortive therapy. During the past several decades, a large number of optional modalities have&#xD;
      been tested as preventive measures of cluster headache. Not unexpectedly, the effects of any&#xD;
      such preventive therapies are highly variable, and in many patients, the attack frequency is&#xD;
      not under satisfactory control. Many of these drugs also have untoward side effects that&#xD;
      offset their potential benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, spontaneous case testimonials were received by Biohit Oyj from migraine patients&#xD;
      (and one with cluster headache) reporting that our new medical device, Acetium™ capsule&#xD;
      (containing 100mg l-cysteine, developed for inactivation of acetaldehyde in the stomach&#xD;
      contents after alcohol intake), proved to be highly effective against their headache attacks.&#xD;
      Their attacks disappeared almost immediately after onset of L-cysteine administration, all of&#xD;
      them remaining in complete remission for several months up to several years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These spontaneous testimonials prompted us to formulate a novel study hypothesis that could&#xD;
      possibly explain this dramatic effect of L-cysteine in prevention of headache attacks, to be&#xD;
      tested in this RCT. This novel hypothesis is starting from the fact that, in cluster headache&#xD;
      (a vascular-type of headache), swelling and dilatation of the blood vessels is necessary to&#xD;
      provoke the attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that Nitric Oxide (NO) is the final trigger of vascular headache attack,&#xD;
      operating through phosphorylated protein kinase G (PKG) and Ca2+ channels, slowing the influx&#xD;
      of calcium into the cell, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Histamine&#xD;
      is a potent inducer of NO Synthase, making NO available locally on the vasculature, acting&#xD;
      through endothelial H1-receptors. Histamine is synthesized from histidine in tissue mast&#xD;
      cells, which are ubiquitous cells and their activation e.g. in the meninges has long been&#xD;
      suspected to be involved in generating migraine headaches. Finally, one of the potent&#xD;
      liberators of histamine from the mast cells is acetaldehyde, which, in turn, is effectively&#xD;
      inactivated by L-cysteine (Acetium capsule). This led us to rational that by eliminating&#xD;
      acetaldehyde in the stomach, L-cysteine could block (or reduce below the threshold levels)&#xD;
      histamine liberation from the tissue mast cells and ECL cells in the stomach, thus arresting&#xD;
      its multitude of functions, of which vasodilatation is critically involved in the cluster&#xD;
      headache attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To validate the novel hypothesis that daily use of L-cysteine (Acetium capsules,&#xD;
      100mg twice a day) is an effective means to decrease the frequency of (or completely abort)&#xD;
      the headache attacks in patients suffering from cluster headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial comparing&#xD;
      Acetium capsules (100mg L-cysteine, twice a day) and placebo in prevention of headache&#xD;
      attacks during a 1-month trial period. In brief, a cohort of 60 (up to100) voluntary subjects&#xD;
      (women and men, with periodic or chronic cluster headache) are invited through the Finnish&#xD;
      Migraine Association (FMA). To be eligible for the study, the subjects should: i) have the&#xD;
      frequency of typical attacks up to 5 per day; ii) age between 18 and 65 years; and iii) have&#xD;
      a minimum of co-morbidity. There are no restrictions on duration since the diagnosis, or the&#xD;
      age at the onset of cluster headache. They should discontinue other prophylactic medication&#xD;
      prior to study entry. Before enrolment, all subjects are requested to sign a written consent.&#xD;
      The study protocol will be subjected for approval by the Committee on Medical Research Ethics&#xD;
      (HUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study setting is triple-blinded (participant-blind, investigator-blind,&#xD;
      sponsor-blind). Placebo preparation with design and package identical to the test preparation&#xD;
      will be used. Parallel group design instead of cross-over design is used. Randomization will&#xD;
      be performed using a random number generator, with block size of 4, and stratified by gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period in both study arms will be 1 month. The participants should use (but&#xD;
      accurately report) their usual symptomatic or acute treatment, because not anticipated to&#xD;
      interfere with the study medication. During the 1-month treatment period, participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated at weekly intervals by the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the baseline assessment of attack frequency, each subject will be requested to&#xD;
      fill in a structured Questionnaire recoding their detailed headache history and other&#xD;
      pertinent data on potential triggers. The headache diary is the main research tool used to&#xD;
      monitor the efficacy of the test preparations, recording all predefined assessment measures&#xD;
      (efficacy, tolerability and safety), and submitted to the study monitor on each FU visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In statistical analysis, both conventional techniques (e.g. non-parametric paired-samples and&#xD;
      non-paired samples t-test), and more sophisticated methods will be used. The latter include&#xD;
      i) life-table methods like Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression, as well as&#xD;
      ii) generalized linear models (GEE and panel Poisson) and as a new technique in cluster&#xD;
      headache RCTs, a competing risks regression to model the natural outcomes of the headache&#xD;
      during the intervention. This study (n=60; the most modest scenario) is adequately powered&#xD;
      (Type II error 0.80, type I error 0.05) to detect a true difference in attack frequency&#xD;
      between 15 attacks/week in the placebo and 13.1 attacks/week in the Acetium arm. Given that&#xD;
      the study subjects are enrolled among patients with typically 1-3 attacks/day, i.e., 7-21 (up&#xD;
      to 35) attacks per week, and assuming a 10% reduction by placebo, there figures seem&#xD;
      reasonable estimates for these power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: The null hypothesis of the study implicates that l-cysteine is no better than&#xD;
      placebo in prophylaxis of cluster headache during the 1-month intervention period. Rejection&#xD;
      or not of the null hypothesis is based on comparison of the two arms for the primary study&#xD;
      endpoint and (to lesser extent) for a series of secondary endpoints. The primary study&#xD;
      endpoint (efficacy measure) is the number of attacks per week. Potentially useful secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include: i) intensity of headache (4-tier nominal scale); ii) drug consumption for&#xD;
      symptomatic or acute treatment; and iii) patients' preferences and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study execution and time table: Meanwhile the final protocol is under evaluation for ethical&#xD;
      approval by HUS, preparatory measures have been taken by informing the FMA about the planned&#xD;
      study and asking their co-operation in encouraging the interested migraine patients to&#xD;
      contact the study coordinator. Given the preliminary interest shown by the FMA, we are&#xD;
      optimistic that the required cohort of volunteers can be enrolled within a short time, most&#xD;
      likely by the end of 2013. However, because the subjects with episodic cluster headache must&#xD;
      be enrolled during their on-going cluster episodes that typically follow a seasonal pattern,&#xD;
      the enrolment of the total cohort (even n=60) inevitably needs to be completed over several&#xD;
      months (up to one year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of the study: Given that L-cysteine is a natural (semi-essential) amino acid,&#xD;
      converted to inert substance (MTCA) in the alimentary tract, it would comprise an ideal means&#xD;
      to conduct prophylaxis of cluster headaches for years, without concern about the side effects&#xD;
      that are inherent to many of the current treatment modalities. If the efficacy is proven in&#xD;
      this formal RCT, the concept of using Acetium capsules in prophylactic treatment of cluster&#xD;
      headache would represent a major step forward in a better clinical control of these&#xD;
      frequently excruciating headaches.&#xD;
