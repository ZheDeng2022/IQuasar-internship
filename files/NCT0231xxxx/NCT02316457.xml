    <textblock>
      The Mutanome Engineered RNA Immuno-Therapy (MERIT) study introduces a novel concept for&#xD;
      Individualized Cancer Immunotherapy (IVAC®) to treat each patient with the relevant and&#xD;
      immunogenic RNA vaccines for a given patient's tumour. The TNBC-MERIT trial uses two&#xD;
      complementary strategies, the WAREHOUSE and the IVAC® MUTANOME concept, resulting in two&#xD;
      custom-made IVAC® investigational medicinal products (IMPs) (IVAC_W_bre1_uID and IVAC_M_uID)&#xD;
      for each individual patient.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The WAREHOUSE concept is based on RNA drug products shelved in a warehouse and targeting&#xD;
           shared tumour-associated antigens (TAAs). The BioNTech Group (henceforward the&#xD;
           &quot;company&quot;) has identified a set of target antigens commonly expressed in TNBC. The&#xD;
           selected breast cancer-associated antigens have been shown by immunogenicity testing to&#xD;
           constitute suitable targets for immunotherapy and form the basis for the development of&#xD;
           a novel RNA-based immunotherapy approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IVAC® MUTANOME concept is based on the identification of tumour-specific mutations&#xD;
           by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and on-demand RNA manufacturing for use in single&#xD;
           patients to target multiple neo-antigens derived from mutated epitopes. The novel&#xD;
           therapeutic concept is supported by a series of research projects and high level&#xD;
           publications that have led to a broad acceptance that mutation-specific T cells bear&#xD;
           enormous potential to confer anti-tumoural activity in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The TNBC-MERIT study will introduce the novel therapeutic concept for the individualized&#xD;
           treatment of breast cancer that is based on (i) treatment with a patient-specific&#xD;
           liposome complexed RNA tailored to the antigen-expression profile of any given patient's&#xD;
           tumour (WAREHOUSE immunotherapy - IVAC_W_bre1_uID) and (ii) on treatment with de novo&#xD;
           synthesized RNAs targeting up to 20 individual tumour mutations (IVAC® MUTANOME&#xD;
           immunotherapy - IVAC_M_uID) following optional treatment with WAREHOUSE. The scientific&#xD;
           rationale for the combination of the two IVAC® approaches is based on the assumption&#xD;
           that immunotherapies that (1) acknowledge tumour heterogeneity on a single-patient level&#xD;
           and (2) target the whole range of antigens selectively expressed on tumours (&quot;cancer&#xD;
           antigenome&quot;), including immunogenic shared and unique antigens, bear the highest&#xD;
           potential to constitute an effective treatment of tumours.&#xD;
