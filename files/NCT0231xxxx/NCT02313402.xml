      Eighteen ALS patients will be trained to control a new communication device (Eye On Line:&#xD;
      EOL) that permit over smooth eye movements to generate digits, letters, words or drawing at&#xD;
      will. The intervention consists in a training program during six visits over 3 weeks on site&#xD;
      allowing a gradual acquisition of the eye-writing. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of the use of EOL device in ALS patients. The EOL device potentially&#xD;
      offers a creative and personal means of linguistic and emotional expression in subject with&#xD;
      motor disability.&#xD;

      Background: Motor weakness progression in ALS challenges communication modalities such as&#xD;
      writing or speech with a marked impairment of quality of life. In recent years the&#xD;
      development of appropriate communication tools played a key role to maintain patients in an&#xD;
      efficient interaction with environment and caregivers. However there is a need for tools to&#xD;
      customize communication and provide a creative space. Eye on-line (EOL) is a new&#xD;
      communication device with which the user is presented with an illusion inducing visual&#xD;
      stimulus resulting in the perception of illusory movement that can be followed by the eye, so&#xD;
      that smooth pursuit eye movement can be sustained in arbitrary directions.(1) After an&#xD;
      appropriate training participants gain volitional control over smooth eye movements and can&#xD;
      generate digits, letters, words or drawing at will.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of the use of EOL&#xD;
      device in ALS patients. The secondary objective is to assess its clinical safety in subjects&#xD;
      with ALS. We added exploratory objectives to evaluate eye movements in ALS patients, to study&#xD;
      factors (neuropsychology, eye movements) that may influence the use of the apparatus and to&#xD;
      evaluate a Bayesian computational model for online character recognition.(2) Methods:&#xD;
      Eighteen subjects with ALS and motor impairment impairing normal writing will be recruited&#xD;
      with a duration of participation of four weeks per patient. The intervention will consist in&#xD;
      a training program to the device during six visits on site allowing a gradual acquisition of&#xD;
      the ability to perform an eye-writing. The primary endpoint is the recognition by an outside&#xD;
      observer of the digits 0-9 produced by the patient with the device. The secondary criteria is&#xD;
      the record of adverse events and serious adverse events occurred during the study other than&#xD;
      those directly related to ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion/Conclusions: EOL device potentially offers a creative and personal means of&#xD;
      linguistic and emotional expression in subject with motor disability. The study is open to&#xD;
      patients recruitment since June 2014. Results are expected in mid 2015.&#xD;
