  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for tick borne encephalitis increases in Sweden. Together with an increased&#xD;
      awareness of the possibility to acquire protection by vaccination, this has led to an&#xD;
      increase in the number of doses of the vaccine distributed in Sweden each year - now being&#xD;
      approximately 400.000. The first year, two doses with an interval of 1 month is recommended&#xD;
      for the general population, followed by a third dose approximately one year later and an&#xD;
      additional booster dose three years after the third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results from a previous study showed a higher percentage protected (=titer at&#xD;
      least 10) after 3 doses than after 2 doses (Rombo et al. EUDRA CT 2011 001348-31, unpublished&#xD;
      information). In the same study, there were no differences between those who were vaccinated&#xD;
      0+7+21 compared to 0+30+90. The investigators were surprised to find marked differences&#xD;
      between 2 and 3 doses also in the younger control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore aim to confirm results in a new study and to add a group with a&#xD;
      double dose at day 0 and then a single dose at day 30 and 360&#xD;

      The risk for tick borne encephalitis increases in Sweden. Together with an increased&#xD;
      awareness of the possibility to acquire protection by vaccination, this has led to an&#xD;
      increase in the number of doses of the vaccine distributed in Sweden each year - now being&#xD;
      approximately 400.000. The first year, two doses with an interval of 1 month is recommended&#xD;
      for the general population, followed by a third dose approximately one year later and an&#xD;
      additional booster dose three years after the third.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The manufacturer of Encepur recommended a total of three doses to this age group using the&#xD;
      same regimen as with &quot;accelerated vaccination schedule (0+7+21 days). Unfortunately,&#xD;
      geometrical mean of titers after 3 doses with the accelerated schedule is not superior to 2&#xD;
      doses given at 0+30 days The manufacturer of FSME-immune instead recommended that serology&#xD;
      should be checked one month after the second dose and that a third dose should be given if&#xD;
      titers are not sufficient (0+30+60 days). Unfortunately, determinations of titers in a large&#xD;
      number of samples put severe strain on logistics and is not feasible in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to try to improve immunity in the age group 60+ , the Department of Communicable&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention in Stockholm therefore recommends a third dose two months&#xD;
      after the first two doses to the age group 60+ (= 0+30+90 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results from a previous study showed a higher percentage protected (=titer at&#xD;
      least 10) after 3 doses than after 2 doses (Rombo et al. EUDRA CT 2011 001348-31, unpublished&#xD;
      information). In the same study, there were no differences between those who were vaccinated&#xD;
      0+7+21 compared to 0+30+90. The investigators were surprised to find marked differences&#xD;
      between 2 and 3 doses also in the younger control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To study whether any differences remain before and one month after an additional&#xD;
      dose at the following season Secondary aim: To study whether an additional dose of TBE&#xD;
      vaccine 2 months after the second dose will improve protection in an age group 50+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Serum concentration of neutralising antibodies against tick borne&#xD;
      encephalitis one month after an additional dose the following year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Serum concentration of neutralising antibodies against tick borne&#xD;
      encephalitis one month after two or three doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of power: Depend on whether the aim is to determine differences in geometric mean&#xD;
      titers or differences in seroconversion rate. The investigators prefer the former but have&#xD;
      not settled for the least difference which would be interesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion critera: Age 50 years or more. Exclusion critera: previous tick borne encephalitis&#xD;
      infection. Previously immunized with tick borne encephalitis vaccine. Anaphylactic reac tion&#xD;
      to egg protein. Any disease or therapy which might suppress the immune response. Vaccination&#xD;
      should be delayed if a participant has fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. The investigators intend to give FSME-immune to 4 groups with varying&#xD;
      vaccination schedules (see below) 50 participants will be randomized to each Group. A younger&#xD;
      age group (50 participants between 18-49 years) will serve as controls and will be given&#xD;
      FSME-immune according to standard recommendations (0+30 days)&#xD;
