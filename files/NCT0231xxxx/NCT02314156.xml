    <textblock>
      This randomized trial studies transdermal or oral telapristone acetate in treating patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery to remove the breast (mastectomy). Telapristone acetate may help prevent&#xD;
      breast cancer from forming in premenopausal women. Giving telapristone acetate transdermally&#xD;
      may be safer and have fewer side effects than oral administration.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate that mean levels of telapristone (telapristone acetate) in breast tissue&#xD;
      following gel application will result in levels that are not more than 50% lower than those&#xD;
      following oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess whether plasma concentrations of telapristone are significantly lower with&#xD;
      transdermal than oral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare within-breast variation of breast tissue concentration in transdermal and oral&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure changes in cell proliferation (marker of proliferation Ki-67 [Ki67] labeling&#xD;
      index) and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate [dUTP]&#xD;
      nick end labeling [TUNEL]) in breast cancer samples obtained at diagnostic core needle biopsy&#xD;
      (of cancer) or research core needle biopsy (of unaffected breast) with tissue samples&#xD;
      obtained at mastectomy. Measure protein expression of related targets in the following order&#xD;
      of priority: progesterone receptor isoforms (progesterone receptor [PR]A and PRB), and&#xD;
      estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and TUNEL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) at baseline and&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore changes in gene expression in breast tissue related to telapristone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess change in serum progesterone associated with telapristone therapy. VI. Assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of oral and transdermal administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (TRANSDERMAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE): Patients receive telapristone acetate transdermally&#xD;
      and placebo orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (ORAL TELAPRISTONE ACETATE): Patients receive placebo transdermally and telapristone&#xD;
      acetate PO QD for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 60.&#xD;
