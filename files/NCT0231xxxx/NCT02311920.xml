      This phase I trial studies the safety and best dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab, or both in&#xD;
      combination with temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma or&#xD;
      gliosarcoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may block tumor growth&#xD;
      in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet&#xD;
      known which combination is a better treatment for glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum safe dose of single-agent treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab and&#xD;
      the combination when given with temozolomide during maintenance treatment for newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collect and record the side effect profiles for single-agent treatment with ipilimumab,&#xD;
      nivolumab, and the combination when given with temozolomide during the maintenance phase for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Perform pilot studies of immune cells within tumor samples, e.g. phenotyping tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by interrogating tumor tissues from diagnostic tumor blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Report the number of patients alive at 1 and 2 years after the start of single-agent&#xD;
      treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab, and the combination when given with temozolomide during&#xD;
      the maintenance phase for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Within 5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive temozolomide&#xD;
      orally (PO) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ipilimumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 4 weeks for 4 courses and then beginning 3&#xD;
      months after course 4 once every 3 months for 4 courses in the absence unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Within 5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive temozolomide PO&#xD;
      on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks for 16 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 48 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Within 5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation, patients receive temozolomide PO&#xD;
      on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes&#xD;
      once every 4 weeks for 4 courses and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for 64&#xD;
      weeks in the absence unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
