  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In February 2013, 44 healthy adults was recruited and randomized to daily intake of lozenges&#xD;
      with or without Lactobacillus reuteri strains DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 for 12 weeks. The effect&#xD;
      of these Lactobacillus reuteri strains on the oral microbial composition was monitored&#xD;
      before, after 4, 8 and 12 weeks and after 1 and 6 months after exposure was completed. For&#xD;
      this purpose saliva and tooth plaque was collected. Of 44 included subjects, 41 completed the&#xD;
      study. The used Lactobacillus reuteri containing lozenges are commercially available and&#xD;
      identical placebo lozenges was obtained from the manufacturer. The study product was well&#xD;
      tolerated with no observed side effects. Compliance was excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary outcome was to determine whether daily intake of Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri strains DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 for 12 weeks alters the tooth colonizing bacterial&#xD;
      plaque composition determined by a multiplex sequencing technique. Effects are put in&#xD;
      relation to general knowledge on bacterial profiles associated with risk to develop dental&#xD;
      caries and periodontitis.&#xD;

      Ethics statements The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Umeå, Sweden&#xD;
      (Dnr 2011-380-31M) and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and study design Healthy adult volunteers, aged 20-66 years, among students and&#xD;
      employees at the Faculty of Medicine, Umeå University, Sweden were recruited to a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through advertisements. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were a self-reported healthy status and no use of antibiotics or probiotic products during 3&#xD;
      months prior to the study. Based on previous studies regarding the persistence of probiotic&#xD;
      strains [31,32], the recruitment goal was at least 15 people per study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-four volunteers, none of whom used tobacco products, were recruited and randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either a test (n = 22) or placebo group (n = 22; Figure S1). Participants were&#xD;
      asked to allow 2 lozenges per day to slowly melt in the mouth and to circulate the dissolved&#xD;
      tablet contents around their mouths. One lozenge was taken in the morning and 1 in the&#xD;
      evening for 12 weeks. The test lozenges contained L. reuteri (DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; 108 CFU&#xD;
      per strain; BioGaia AB, Stockholm, Sweden), isomalt, hydrogenated palm oil, peppermint and&#xD;
      menthol flavoring, peppermint oil, and sucralose&#xD;
      (http://www.biogaia.com/product/biogaia-prodentis-oral-lozenges). The placebo lozenges were&#xD;
      identical to the test lozenges in appearance, taste, and composition except the lactobacilli.&#xD;
      Compliance was monitored as the percentage of lozenges consumed of the total assigned number.&#xD;
      The remaining lozenges were counted when the containers were returned for monthly refills to&#xD;
      assess this factor. Compliance was considered acceptable if ≤15% of the lozenges remained.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to abstain from oral hygiene for 48 h and to not consume any food for&#xD;
      at least 4 h before sampling. Participants were also instructed to not eat probiotic products&#xD;
      throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva and biofilm sampling Saliva and tooth biofilm samples were obtained immediately before&#xD;
      (baseline) and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of L. reuteri supplementation (Figure S1). Follow-up&#xD;
      samples were collected 1 and 6 months after supplementation was terminated. Furthermore,&#xD;
      whole stimulated saliva (~5 mL) was generated by chewing 1 g of paraffin and collected into&#xD;
      ice-chilled sterile test tubes. One milliliter of saliva was used for cultural analysis, and&#xD;
      the remaining saliva was centrifuged at 3,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellets were stored&#xD;
      at -80°C until DNA extraction for strain-specific PCR reactions. For the pyrosequencing&#xD;
      analysis, pooled supragingival plaque was collected with sterilized toothpicks and&#xD;
      transferred to Eppendorf tubes (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) containing 200 µL of TE-buffer&#xD;
      (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6). The samples were stored at -80°C until DNA extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of lactobacilli by culture and PCR Aliquots of saliva were plated onto Rogosa&#xD;
      agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to obtain Lactobacillus counts and on selective agar for&#xD;
      tentative identification of the L. reuteri (DSM 17938 and PTA 5289) strains [33]. All plates&#xD;
      were anaerobically incubated at 37°C for 48-72 h, except L. reuteri PTA 5289, which was&#xD;
      anaerobically incubated at 40°C for 72 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA was extracted from saliva pellets as described [34]. L. reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA&#xD;
      5289-specific PCR were identified using KAPA2G Robust HotStart PCR Ready Mix (2×) (Kapa&#xD;
      Biosystems, Boston, MA, USA) and strain-specific primers [31]. Briefly, 2 µL of DNA extract&#xD;
      was added to a total reaction volume of 25 µL (containing 12.5 µL of master mix and each&#xD;
      primer pair at a concentration of 0.5 µM). PCR conditions were 95°C for 3 min; 40 cycles of&#xD;
      95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were then&#xD;
      verified by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels allowed to run for 80 min at 120 V in 0.5× TBE&#xD;
      (Tris/Borate/EDTA) buffer, pH 8.3, followed by ethidium bromide (0.2 µg/µL) staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyrosequencing analysis For the 454 pyrosequencing analysis, 16 subjects were randomly&#xD;
      selected among the test (n = 8) and control (n = 8) subjects (Figure S1). DNA was extracted&#xD;
      from the baseline, 12-week exposure, and 1-month follow-up tooth biofilm samples as&#xD;
      previously described [34]. The V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified&#xD;
      via PCR using the forward primer 347F and reverse primer 803R [35]. For sample&#xD;
      identification, fusion primers were created from these primers and unique barcode sequences&#xD;
      according to the Roche guidelines for experimental amplicon design (www.454.com). DNA was&#xD;
      amplified under the following running conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min; 30&#xD;
      cycles of 94ºC for 15 s, 58ºC for 15 s, and 72ºC for 30 s; and a final extension at 72ºC for&#xD;
      8 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amplicon processing and 454 sequencing were conducted at the Lund University Sequencing&#xD;
      Facility (Faculty of Science, Lund, Sweden). After amplicon cleaning to remove short&#xD;
      fragments (Agencourt AMPure XP; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and inspection (DNA 1000 kit&#xD;
      on a 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), amplicons were quantified&#xD;
      (Quant-iT ds DNA assay kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA and Quantifluor fluorometer;&#xD;
      Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and diluted to obtain a total of 107 copies/μL. Titration and&#xD;
      library production (target: 10%-15% enrichment) were performed using emulsion PCR and the&#xD;
      Lib-A kit (Roche Diagnostics, Branford, CT, USA). DNA-positive beads were enriched, counted&#xD;
      (Innovatis CASY particle counter; Roche Innovatis, Bielefeld, Germany), processed (XLR70&#xD;
      sequencing kit; Roche Diagnostics), and loaded onto a picotiter plate for pyrosequencing on a&#xD;
      454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer FLX+ machine (Roche Applied Sciences; Penzberg, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing Subject characteristic, compliance, and culture data were processed using&#xD;
      SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics, such as means&#xD;
      [95% confidence intervals (CI)] and proportion distributions were calculated. Differences&#xD;
      between groups were tested with parametric or non-parametric tests depending on the data&#xD;
      measurement and distribution levels. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequences with a minimum length of 300 base pairs after primer sequence removal, correct&#xD;
      barcode sequences, a maximum of 1 incorrect base pair in the primer sequences, and compliance&#xD;
      with the default quality criteria for homopolymers and quality scores in the Quantitative&#xD;
      Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) [36] software package (version 1.8.0) were retained&#xD;
      for analysis. Any sequence beyond the reversed primer were removed. Sequences beginning with&#xD;
      the reverse primer were reverse complemented. Sequences were then clustered into operational&#xD;
      taxonomic units (OTUs) at a sequence similarity of 97% in the 16S rRNA chimera-checked&#xD;
      Greengene database (dated May 2013) [37] using USEARCH [38]. OTUs with a single sequence were&#xD;
      removed. One representative sequence per remaining OTU was taxonomically assigned as a named&#xD;
      or unnamed cultivable species or uncultivable phylotype at ≥98.5% identity using HOMD 16S&#xD;
      rRNA RefSeq, version 12.0 (http://www.homd.org) [28].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rarefaction curves were calculated to compare microbial richness [39]. Principal coordinate&#xD;
      analysis (PCoA) was applied to evaluate the phylogenetic beta diversity [40] of the bacterial&#xD;
      profiles at different time points. Multivariate partial least-square analysis (PLS) modeling&#xD;
      (SIMCA P+, version 12.0; Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) was performed to search if microbiota&#xD;
      structures were related to L. reuteri consumption (y-variables) [41,42]. Tested models&#xD;
      included those with pyrosequencing data only and those to which lactobacilli and streptococci&#xD;
      culture and PCR data had been added. Variables were autoscaled to unit variance and&#xD;
      cross-validated Y predictions were calculated. Subject clustering was displayed in score&#xD;
      loading plots, and the importance of each x-variable was displayed in loading plots.&#xD;
      Variables, where the 95% CI of the PLS correlation coefficient did not inlude zero were&#xD;
      considered statistically significant [42]. The Q2 value yielded the capacities of the&#xD;
      x-variables to predict the outcome (test or placebo group allocation). Univariate analyses of&#xD;
      single taxa were not applied because of the combination of small groups and a high number of&#xD;
      repeated tests.&#xD;
