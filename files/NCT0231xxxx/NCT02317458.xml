    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy being on standard of&#xD;
      care will be screened per the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients&#xD;
      will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either standard of care and C3BS-CQR-1 injection&#xD;
      (treatment group) or standard of care undergoing a sham procedure (control group). Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the treatment group, for which C3BS-CQR-1 production met release criteria, will&#xD;
      undergo endoventricular injection of the C3BS-CQR-1 using injection catheter.&#xD;
