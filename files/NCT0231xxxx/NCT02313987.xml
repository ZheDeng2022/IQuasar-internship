  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to test the hypothesis that compared to conventional treatment;&#xD;
      endothelial function-guided treatment reduces adverse cardiovascular events in patients with&#xD;
      non-obstructive coronary artery disease documented at clinically indicated coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with chest pain and non-obstructive coronary artery disease (20-70% luminal diameter&#xD;
      narrowing) documented by coronary angiograms will be enrolled in the study 2 - 30 days&#xD;
      following the coronary angiograms. Only subjects who have signed an Informed Consent Form and&#xD;
      meet all of the eligibility criteria will be qualified for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline EndoPAT testing subjects will be divided into two groups by their&#xD;
      EndoPAT (EndoScore) results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A - normal EndoScore: Logarithmic value of RHI (Ln_RHI) &gt;0.7&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B - abnormal EndoScore: Ln_RHI ≤ 0.7 The subjects of Group B will be randomized in&#xD;
           1:1 ratio (by envelopes with randomization numbers at each site) to Group B1 who will be&#xD;
           treated conventionally i.e., &quot;usual care&quot; by the site study team; and Group B2 who will&#xD;
           be treated with &quot;enhanced care&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff prescribing treatment regime for subjects in group A and B1 (&quot;usual care&quot;) along with&#xD;
      the subjects in these groups, will be blinded to the EndoScore value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects of all groups will return for 4 follow-up visits: 180±14days, 360±14days, 720±14days&#xD;
      and 1080±14days (study end).&#xD;
