      This project studies the impulsive side effects of common treatments for Parkinson's Disease.&#xD;
      By learning how parts of the brain involved in Parkinson's encode information related to&#xD;
      reward and motivation, the investigators will better understand the reasons why Parkinson's&#xD;
      patients often suffer from compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and repetitive tinkering&#xD;
      (&quot;punding&quot;). These results may lead to the design of better methods of deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      (DBS) that minimize the behavioral side effects of Parkinson's treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While the typical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD), dopaminergic drugs and deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS), are proven to be effective in mitigating the motor deficits associated&#xD;
      with the disease, these same methods also give rise to behavioral side effects including&#xD;
      compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and complex, purposeless stereotyped behavior&#xD;
      (&quot;punding&quot;). And while much work has investigated the underlying patterns of neural activity&#xD;
      giving rise to tremor, rigidity, and other motor effects of D, little is known about the&#xD;
      neural genesis of impulsive side effects in humans. The investigators propose to characterize&#xD;
      the patterns of neural activity underlying these failures of impulse control in an actual PD&#xD;
      patient population undergoing surgery for the implantation of DBS electrodes. Such procedures&#xD;
      offer a unique opportunity to collect data at the single neuron level in humans, since&#xD;
      surgeons rely on intraoperative electrophysiology to identify the anatomical boundaries of&#xD;
      the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the typical target of DBS in PD. Using multi-channel Ad-Tech&#xD;
      microwire arrays, the investigators will simultaneously record multiple channels of single&#xD;
      unit activity (both spikes and field potentials ) in STN and nearby structures while subjects&#xD;
      perform cognitive tasks with validated links to impulsivity in human populations. In the&#xD;
      balloon analogue risk task (BART) participants must balance risk and reward as they decide&#xD;
      when to stop inflating a computerized balloon whose point value and risk of popping both grow&#xD;
      with size. In the stop signal reaction task (SSRT), participants must respond as quickly as&#xD;
      possible when a &quot;go&quot; cue appears, but countermand this response when a &quot;stop&quot; tone is played.&#xD;
      At the neural level, the BART allows us to elucidate correlates of risk, outcome (both&#xD;
      rewarding and aversive), and anticipation, while the SSRT, a well-studied model of&#xD;
      impulsivity in both animal models and humans with strong links to computational models, will&#xD;
      allow us to determine not only single unit but network-level patterns of activity underlying&#xD;
      failures in impulse control. Through these experiments, as well as computational modeling,&#xD;
      the investigators will characterize neural correlates of impulsivity in PD patients that will&#xD;
      allow for the design of DBS protocols that mitigate impulsive side effects. The R21 mechanism&#xD;
      will be used to further develop and streamline the process of multichannel recording and&#xD;
      cognitive testing in the intraoperative setting and validate the hypothesized link between&#xD;
      single neuron activity and models of behavior in the stop signal task.&#xD;
