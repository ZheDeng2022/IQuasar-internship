  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume overload is a leading risk factor for death and cardiovascular events in end stage&#xD;
      renal disease patients maintained on chronic dialysis, particularly in those with myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia and heart failure which represent a substantial fraction of this population. Early&#xD;
      identification of volume overload may prevent cardiovascular sequel in these patients but&#xD;
      clinical signs of volume expansion are unsatisfactory to reliably identify patients at risk&#xD;
      and to monitor them over time. On the other hand, however reliable, standard techniques for&#xD;
      measuring extracellular or circulating (blood) volume do not convey information on&#xD;
      fundamental heart function parameters that determine the individual haemodynamic tolerance to&#xD;
      volume excess and the response to ultrafiltration, i.e. left ventricular (LV) filling&#xD;
      pressure and LV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra-vascular lung water is critically dependent on these parameters and represents a proxy&#xD;
      of both, circulating volume and LV filling pressure and function, and may therefore be a&#xD;
      better criterion to identify patients at a higher risk of volume-dependent adverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and to monitor the effect of therapy aimed at preventing these outcomes. A fast (&lt; 5&#xD;
      min.), easy to learn, simple and non-expensive technique which measures extra-vascular lung&#xD;
      water by using standard ultrasound (US) machines has been validated in dialysis patients.&#xD;
      Whether systematic measurement of lung water by this technique may translate into better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients has never been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial is that of testing a treatment policy guided by&#xD;
      extra-vascular lung water measurements by ultrasound to prevent all-cause death,&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure and non-fatal myocardial infarction in high risk dialysis&#xD;
      patients with myocardial ischemia (a history of myocardial infarction with or without ST&#xD;
      elevation or unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome documented by ECG recordings and&#xD;
      cardiac troponins or stable angina pectoris with documented coronary artery disease by prior&#xD;
      coronary angiography or ECG) or overt heart failure (NYHA class III-IV).&#xD;

      Randomization procedure: After enrollment, patients will be randomized in 2 groups: treatment&#xD;
      and control. The randomization will be performed by centre, with a 1:1 allocation ratio, and&#xD;
      it will be communicated by the coordinating centre in Reggio Calabria. An allocation&#xD;
      concealment will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warning: based on the principle &quot;once randomized, always randomized&quot;, if a patient drops out&#xD;
      the study he cannot simply be replaced by a new one. New patients must be randomized as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of core lab data: The core data to be collected in the LUST project/subprojects&#xD;
      should be validated by the following validation centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CORE LUST STUDY DATA Echocardiographic data and US-lung data: Dr. Rosa Sicari and Dr.&#xD;
           Luna Gargani, CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology of Pisa, Italy (rosas@ifc.cnr.it).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANCILLARY LUST PROJECTS Pulse Wave Velocity data (PWV): Prof. Gerard London, Service&#xD;
           d'Hémodialyse, Hôpital F.H. Manhès, Fleury-Mérogis, France (glondon@club-internet.fr).&#xD;
&#xD;
           24 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) data: Prof. Francesca Mallamaci,&#xD;
           Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Unit and IFC-CNR, Reggio Calabria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary training on US-B lines measurement is a pre-requisite for Nephrologists and&#xD;
      Cardiologists of each participating centre. After training (Skype meeting) an online&#xD;
      certification will be released to certify the level of expertise about US-B lines&#xD;
      measurements of all LUST study nephrologists and cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant centre will upload pertinent studies (echocardiography, 24h ABPM and PWV&#xD;
      data) into the LUST website and will timely receive a feedback by the validation centres,&#xD;
      whenever needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US Lung Scan technique A standard (3.0-MHz) echocardiography probe can be used for this&#xD;
      purpose. Examinations should be performed in the supine position. To detect lung water, both&#xD;
      sides of the chest should be scanned both in the anterior and lateral part from the second to&#xD;
      the fourth (on the right side to the fifth) intercostals spaces, at parasternal, mid clavea,&#xD;
      anterio-axillar and mid-axillary lines, as previously described (Am J Cardiol&#xD;
      2004;93:1265-70). An US-B line is a hyperechoic, coherent US bundle at narrow basis going&#xD;
      from the pleura to the limit of the screen. These extended lines (also called comets) arise&#xD;
      from the pleural line and should be differentiated from short comets' artifacts that may&#xD;
      exist in other regions. US-B lines starting from the pleural line can be either localized or&#xD;
      scattered to the whole lung and be present either as isolated US-B lines or in groups (with a&#xD;
      distance &gt;7 mm between 2 extended comets). The sum of US-B lines produces a score reflecting&#xD;
      the extent of LW accumulation. If you do not detect any US-B line, the score is 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators warn the physicians participating in the trial about fixed US-B lines, due&#xD;
      not to lung water but to fibrosis or inflammatory processes. These comets should be&#xD;
      registered but not counted as US-B lines. The cause that underlies these artefacts should be&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients allocated to the active arm of the study, any decision about weight reduction&#xD;
      will be taken by Nephrologists only on the basis of pre-dialysis US-scans. However, also&#xD;
      post-dialysis US-B lines measurement must be performed and registered. In the active and in&#xD;
      the control arm as well, US-scans will be performed by the local cardiologist in coincidence&#xD;
      with the echocardiographic study. It is crucial for the purpose of this study that&#xD;
      cardiologists keep nephrologists involved in the LUST study blinded with respect to the&#xD;
      number of US-B lines of patients of the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients allocated to the control and the active arms, US-B lines should be performed&#xD;
           at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months by the local cardiologist, in a non-dialysis day&#xD;
           either on a Thursday or on a Friday, depending on the dialysis schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients allocated in the treatment arm, the application of US-B scans should be&#xD;
           performed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with less than 15 US-B lines, ultrafiltration (UF) will not be modified and&#xD;
           the US-B lines monitoring will be performed by the nephrologist at monthly intervals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with more than 15 US-B lines (either at baseline or at any of the monthly&#xD;
           US-B Lung scans) UF will be performed by scheduling longer and/or additional dialyses&#xD;
           (see below). In these patients, monitoring of US pre-dialysis and post-dialysis -B lines&#xD;
           will be repeated at least once a week, until the goal is achieved (see next section).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Furthermore, in patients in the active arm, pre- and post-dialysis US-lung scans can be&#xD;
           repeated at discretion of the nephrologist, i.e. whenever he/she believes that it can be&#xD;
           useful applying this technique for monitoring the volume status of the patient, for&#xD;
           example in a patient with &lt;15 US-B lines who subsequently manifests a rise in body&#xD;
           weight or in a patient who develops hypotension or frank hypotensive episodes during&#xD;
           dialysis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, in the treatment group, monitoring is scheduled once a week (before and after&#xD;
      dialysis), or even more frequently if the nephrologist believes that a more frequent&#xD;
      monitoring may be useful to track the desired UF goal. When the number of US-B lines falls&#xD;
      below 15, the measurements will be repeated at monthly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight reduction in patients with more than 15 US-B lines&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients randomized to the treatment arm and with a number of US-B lines &gt;15, a decrease&#xD;
      of dry weight is required to reduce lung water, according to the following scheme derived by&#xD;
      a pilot study at the coordinating centre and at the Iasi Nephrology Unit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  15-30 US-B lines: decrease dry weight by 300 g over the following week (about 100 g per&#xD;
           session)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  31-40 US-B lines: decrease dry weight by 450 g over the following week (about 150 g per&#xD;
           session)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt; 40 US-B lines: decrease dry weight by 600 g over next week (about 200 g per session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to lower dry weight according to the previous scheme should continue until the US-B&#xD;
      lines goal (&lt;15) is attained. If the patient does not tolerate attempts to decrease dry&#xD;
      weight for 2 weeks (i.e. if he/she develops hypotension, cramps and other symptoms) extra&#xD;
      haemodialysis sessions should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the goal (&lt;15 pre-dialysis US B-lines) is not achieved after 4-6 weeks, or in case the&#xD;
      patient does not tolerate UF, drug treatment (carvedilol, ACEi, ARB) intensification or&#xD;
      introduction should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the goal is achieved, it is recommended to confirm it by repeating the measurement of&#xD;
      US-B lines at least once, for example before the following dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warnings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients in the active arm with initial pre-dialysis US-B lines &lt;15 and in those who&#xD;
           achieve this goal thanks to body fluids subtraction who develop cramps and/or symptoms&#xD;
           of extracellular volume depletion (low dry weight) the decision of increasing dry weight&#xD;
           should be accompanied by close US-B lines monitoring (i.e. every dialysis session until&#xD;
           the patient stabilizes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In patients with &gt;15 pre-dialysis US-B lines who do not tolerate dry weight decrease due&#xD;
           to hypotension and who are on hypotensive/cardioprotective drugs treatment&#xD;
           (carvedilol/ACEi) the dose of these drugs should be down-titrated and stopped, if&#xD;
           needed. These drugs in these patients should be always given after dialysis (before&#xD;
           going to bed, at night) rather than pre-dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical (pre-dialysis) evaluation of volume status In both groups (treatment and control&#xD;
      group), a standard pre-dialysis clinical evaluation of volume status should be done, as it is&#xD;
      recommended in good clinical practice. This evaluation should consider blood pressure and&#xD;
      change of blood pressure over time, pedal edema, presence/absence of dyspnea, crackles on&#xD;
      lung auscultation (see below), body weight gain inter-dialysis and body weight trajectory&#xD;
      over time. In the active arm of the study these data should also be formally registered&#xD;
      whenever US-B lines measurements are done. In the control group, evaluation of volume status&#xD;
      needs to be formally registered only in coincidence of the echocardiographic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following scale will be used for the evaluation of Crackles :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No crackles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. I am uncertain about the presence of fine crackles&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Definite fine crackles at lung bases&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Moderate crackles&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bilateral, diffuse crackles&#xD;
&#xD;
      For clinical edema, the following scale will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No clinical edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Slight pitting (2 mm depth) with no visible distortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Somewhat deeper pit (4 mm) with no readily detectable distortion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Noticeably deep pit (6 mm) with the dependent extremity full and swollen&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Very deep pit (8 mm) with the dependent extremity grossly distorted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic measurements In both the intervention and control arm, cardiologists&#xD;
      involved in the LUST study will perform the echocardiographic measurements at baseline, 6, 12&#xD;
      and 24 months, in a non-dialysis day on a Thursday or on a Friday, depending on the dialysis&#xD;
      schedule. These echocardiogram are &quot;research echocardiograms&quot;. For this reason, it is&#xD;
      fundamental to keep nephrologists blind about the results of these echocardiographic&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, nephrologists are allowed to consult a cardiologist (be him the LUST&#xD;
      cardiologist or another one) for a &quot;clinical echocardiogram&quot; if and when clinical problems&#xD;
      arise which demand the application of echocardiographic studies for diagnostic reasons or for&#xD;
      monitoring any underlying cardiac problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information about standardization of echocardiographic study has been prepared by&#xD;
      echocardiography validation laboratory (Dr. Rosa Sicari and Dr. Luna Gargani, IFC CNR, Pisa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan A total sample size of 500 patients (250 per group) will be&#xD;
      expected to provide approximately 80% power to detect a difference in the primary end point&#xD;
      with an assumed type I error rate of .05, 2-sided.Investigators estimate that the 2 year&#xD;
      event rate for the composite end point would be 45% in the usual care group and 30% (a 33%&#xD;
      risk reduction) in the arm with the lung US-guided intervention. According to protocol, all&#xD;
      patients will be followed for 24 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival analysis will be performed by the Kaplan-Meier and the Cox regression methods.&#xD;
      Missing baseline categorical variables will be replaced with the mean or median value, as&#xD;
      appropriate. The effect of the allocation arm on the number of US-B lines will be&#xD;
      investigated by Linear Mixed Models (LMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The between arms differences in echocardiographic data (secondary end point) will be compared&#xD;
      by T-Test, Mann-Whitney test and Linear Model Analysis, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary analysis of the longitudinal evolution of US B lines and the time to the first&#xD;
      event and to repeated events will be performed by the Joint Models. All analyses will be&#xD;
      based on the principle of intention to treat and will be performed using the SPSS version 24,&#xD;
      STATA version 13. The threshold for statistical significance will be 2 sided with a type I&#xD;
      error rate of .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term effect of the intervention In order to capture any long-term effect of the study&#xD;
      intervention, data on vital status and cardiovascular events occurred to all patients alive&#xD;
      after the intervention period will be collected for additional 24 months after the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>It is widely agreed that the high prevalence of patients with LV dysfunction and heart failure and the lack of simple, non-expensive, bedside techniques that may serve to estimate and monitor parameters of central hemodynamics for guiding the prescription of ultrafiltration (UF) and drug treatment is a factor of major clinical relevance. So,in patients allocated to the active arm, nephrologists register pre- and post-dialysis US-B lines whenever considered useful for volume monitoring.</description>
