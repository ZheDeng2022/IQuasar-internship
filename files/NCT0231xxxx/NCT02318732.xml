    <textblock>
      This study evaluates exposure to California's Armed and Prohibited Persons System (APPS) and&#xD;
      risk of future violence and other important outcome events among individuals who legally&#xD;
      purchased firearms in the past but have since become prohibited from owning them. The main&#xD;
      hypothesis is that APPS will be associated with a significant reduction in risk for future&#xD;
      violence among individuals who are directly affected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Violence remains an important public safety and public health problem. Prior research has&#xD;
      shown that denying firearm purchases by individuals who are at high risk for committing&#xD;
      violent crimes, thereby restricting their access to firearms, is an effective violence&#xD;
      prevention strategy. The Armed and Prohibited Persons System (APPS) is a new violence&#xD;
      prevention initiative undertaken by the California Department of Justice (CalDOJ). APPS is&#xD;
      used by law enforcement to systematically identify persons who, having legally purchased&#xD;
      firearms in the past, have become prohibited persons in the present-usually as the result of&#xD;
      a criminal conviction. Such individuals are at increased risk for future violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPS uses existing data to identify firearm owners among persons who have become prohibited&#xD;
      from owning or possessing firearms under California or federal law. CalDOJ then uses this&#xD;
      information to contact and attempt recovery of firearms in the possession of prohibited&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This controlled prospective longitudinal evaluation of APPS relies principally on data&#xD;
      collected by CalDOJ in the course of APPS operations or on data in the public domain, such as&#xD;
      community characteristics published by the U.S. Census Bureau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximize fairness during the implementation of APPS, approximately 1,000 California&#xD;
      communities will be stratified by region, population, and violent crime rate and randomized&#xD;
      into two groups that will be exposed to APPS at different times during the study period.&#xD;
      Hierarchical analysis will examine outcomes for individuals clustered at the community level.&#xD;
      The principal analysis will be on an intent to treat basis. A secondary per protocol analysis&#xD;
      will also be conducted.&#xD;
