      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People respond differently to life events and how those events make them feel. They also&#xD;
      respond differently to information about the how their actions affect their lives and health.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about these differences. In this study, researchers will look&#xD;
      at how people respond to an event in their life. Researchers will also look at how people&#xD;
      respond to information about how their actions can affect their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how people respond differently to life events and information about alcohol and&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women 18 and older who have never been diagnosed with cancer and who drank 5 or more&#xD;
      alcoholic drinks in the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will take place online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 10 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will ask participants to take part in 2 small studies, 1 about Life Events&#xD;
           and 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      about Alcohol and Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the Life Events study, participants will write briefly about a time they felt very&#xD;
           happy, fearful, angry, or surprised, or they will write about a room in their house.&#xD;
           Then they will answer questions about that event. They also will write about a value&#xD;
           that is or is not important to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the Alcohol and Breast Cancer study, participants will read a health message about&#xD;
           the link between alcohol and breast cancer. Then they will answer questions about what&#xD;
           they read and give their thoughts about alcohol and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both studies should take about 30 minutes.&#xD;

      This study aims to examine whether emotional state moderates the effect of selfaffirmation on&#xD;
      intentions to engage in proactive behavior following a message about a health threat.&#xD;
      Specifically, we propose to examine whether selfaffirmation a process by which individuals&#xD;
      reflect on cherished personal values differentially affects the persuasiveness of a message&#xD;
      about the link between alcohol and breast cancer depending on whether individuals are in a&#xD;
      particular emotional state. Previous evidence suggests that self-affirmation may reduce&#xD;
      defensiveness to threatening health information, increasing openness to the message and&#xD;
      resulting in increased disease risk perceptions, disease-related worry, and intentions to&#xD;
      engage in preventive behavior. However, self-affirmation may be differentially effective&#xD;
      depending on the prior emotional state of the individual. Human subjects (women who report&#xD;
      having consumed five or more alcoholic beverage in the past week) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to write about an emotional event (something that made them happy, fearful, angry, or&#xD;
      surprised) or to a neutral emotion condition (writing about a room in their house). Then,&#xD;
      they will be randomly assigned to selfaffirm (write about why a particular value is important&#xD;
      to them) or to be in a control condition (write about why a particular value might be&#xD;
      important to someone else). Following the autobiographical emotion task and self-affirmation,&#xD;
      subjects will read about the link between alcohol and breast cancer. Finally, they will be&#xD;
      asked a series of questions about their intentions to reduce drinking, their perceived risk&#xD;
      of breast cancer, and their worry about breast cancer. Drawing on previous research, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that self-affirmation will be most effective for those asked to recall a happy or&#xD;
      angry experience, and least effective for those asked to recall a fearful or surprising&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who have never been diagnosed with cancer and who drank 5 + alcoholic beverages in&#xD;
        the past week will be eligible to participate. All men, and women who report a lower&#xD;
        threshold of alcohol consumption, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have completed prior self-affirmation studies through GfK (e.g., the one&#xD;
        conducted under 12-C-N162-B) will also be excluded; these participants will be identified&#xD;
        by GfK (based on records of study participation kept for panel members), and will not be&#xD;
        invited to participate in the current study.&#xD;
