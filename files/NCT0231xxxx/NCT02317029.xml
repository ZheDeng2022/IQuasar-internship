      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac arrhythmias can be terminated by electrical current applied by an external&#xD;
      defibrillator. This treatment, named cardioversion, has been used for decades in the&#xD;
      treatment of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several kinds of defibrillators exist, though the relative efficacy and safety of these&#xD;
      defibrillators is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cardioversion, oxygen is being administered, and it has been a long-held belief that&#xD;
      oxygen is always beneficial for the patient. This is now being challenged by recent studies&#xD;
      suggesting excessive oxygenation to be potentially dangerous for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the efficiency and safety of two different defibrillators&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effects of excessive oxygen on injury of the heart following&#xD;
           cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic at the Department of Cardiology, Regional&#xD;
      Hospital of Randers, Denmark as a part of the pre-cardioversion check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to cardioversion using one of two defibrillators and randomized&#xD;
      to treatment with room air or 100% oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiac condition will be measured by blood samples before cardioversion, 4 hours after&#xD;
      cardioversion and 3 months after cardioversion. Heart rhythm will be measured by ECG before&#xD;
      cardioversion, 1 minute-, 30 minutes- and 4 hours after cardioversion.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of cardiac arrest includes effective chest compressions, ventilation using high&#xD;
      flow oxygen and the delivery of electric shocks (cardioversion). Prompt termination of&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias and sufficient airway handling including oxygenation are crucial factors&#xD;
      for patient outcome. Studies suggest that cardioversion itself may induce myocardial injury;&#xD;
      however it is currently unknown whether hyperoxia exacerbate this injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, several different biphasic waveforms are in use for cardioversion.The comparative&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of these waveforms has not been compared in clinical studies.&#xD;
      Commercially available defibrillators use different electrical waveforms that may affect the&#xD;
      efficacy of external defibrillation. Although the superiority of biphasic over monophasic&#xD;
      waveforms is well established, the relative efficacy and safety of the available biphasic&#xD;
      waveforms is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long held belief that oxygen (O2) is always beneficial for ill and injured patients is&#xD;
      being challenged by recent studies suggesting that excessive oxygenation may result in&#xD;
      free-radical mediated tissue damage, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Recent&#xD;
      guidelines suggest that O2 should be 'titrated' to achieve an appropriate target saturation&#xD;
      of 94-98% rather than being administered in an all-or-nothing fashion, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with myocardial ischemia or those following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. The&#xD;
      Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), British Thoracic Society, National&#xD;
      Institute of Health Care Excellence (NICE), European Resuscitation Council and other&#xD;
      respected bodies all restrict O2 use to those with hypoxemia, pulmonary oedema or continuing&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia, based on expert opinion and pathophysiological reasoning rather than&#xD;
      hard evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies using patients presenting with shockable life-threatening arrhythmias (e.g.&#xD;
      ventricular fibrillation) are difficult to perform for ethical and practical reasons. This&#xD;
      study will therefore use patients requiring elective cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias,&#xD;
      who are able to give consent and also present a more controlled population. Elective&#xD;
      cardioversion is a standard treatment for patients with atrial arrhythmias and is performed&#xD;
      as a day case procedure under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare a standard biphasic waveform with a newer pulsed biphasic waveform on which&#xD;
           there is little published data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effect of hyperoxia and room air on myocardial injury following&#xD;
           cardioversion on which there is no published data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted for cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter will be&#xD;
      potentially eligible for the study. Patients will be recruited at the Regional Hospital of&#xD;
      Randers as a part of the pre-cardioversion check. This is the first contact to patients, and&#xD;
      they will receive oral and written information. The oral and written information will be&#xD;
      given by a doctor and/or the primary investigator. The information will be given in a quiet&#xD;
      setting, and the patients may ask questions about the study. It will be possible for the&#xD;
      patient to have a companion present. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants&#xD;
      during the pre-cardioversion check or alternatively prior to cardioversion allowing the&#xD;
      patient to have a companion present before consent is given. Patients declining to&#xD;
      participate in the study will receive treatment according to the standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter for ≤48 hours may be cardioverted immediately.&#xD;
      Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter for &gt;48 hours will be required to have a&#xD;
      documented weekly international normalized ratio (INR) ≥2.0 (including within 48 hours of&#xD;
      cardioversion) or treatment with dabigatranetexilat for three weeks or longer. Alternatively,&#xD;
      a transoesophageal echocardiogram documenting absence of intracardiac thrombi is accepted and&#xD;
      cardioversion can be performed on treatment with low molecular weight heparin. All patients&#xD;
      will be discharged with a recommendation for therapeutic anticoagulation according to current&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consulted prior to cardioversion; standard blood test will be taken, blood&#xD;
      pressure, height and weight will be measured. Information from patient chart (age, gender,&#xD;
      morbidity, co-morbidity and medication) will be used to define baseline values. In addition&#xD;
      New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA), European Heart Rhythm&#xD;
      Association AF-related symptoms (EHRA), American Society of Anaesthesiologists Score (ASA)&#xD;
      and Canadian Cardiovascular Society Grading System (CCS) will be recorded during history&#xD;
      taking. In addition, information from the patient chart regarding comorbidities, medication&#xD;
      etc. will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardioversion protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples, ECG, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and heart rate will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline and all patients will receive 0.5 mg Rapifen i.v. All patients will be treated with&#xD;
      100 % oxygen or room air, 10-15 L/ minute for 3 minutes before administration of Propofol.&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with Propofol 1 mg i.v./kg bodyweight with subsequent 20 mg&#xD;
      boluses as needed. Before cardioversion PaO2 will be measured by arterial blood gas (1 mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up All patients will be seen at the outpatient clinic after 3 months. Echocardiography&#xD;
      will be performed and biomarkers will be measured. Patients will be classified after NYHA,&#xD;
      EHRA, ASA and CCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding waveforms: Assuming the cumulative efficacy, defined as success rate after all&#xD;
      delivered shocks, for one of the waveforms is 95%, and for the other waveform ≥80%, a sample&#xD;
      size of 75 patients in each group is needed to achieve a power of 80% in rejecting the null&#xD;
      hypothesis (that the difference in cumulative efficacy is ≥15%). Continuous variables (number&#xD;
      of shocks, delivered energy etc.) are expressed as mean ± SD or median values and compared&#xD;
      with Students t-test or equivalent non-parametric test. Categorical variables (e.g.&#xD;
      successful cardioversion) are expressed as percentages and compared using the Chi-square or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test (where appropriate). P ≤ 0.05 is considered statistically significant for&#xD;
      all comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding oxygen treatment: It is estimated that 150 patients will be sufficient for the&#xD;
      study. After treatment of 60 patients, an interim futility test will be performed. Biomarker&#xD;
      data will be analyzed using parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. P ≤ 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval from The Danish Research Ethics Committee and Danish Data Protection Agency has been&#xD;
      obtained. The project will be performed in accordance with the Danish Health Act.&#xD;
