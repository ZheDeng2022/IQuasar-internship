    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are widespread in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and protective efficacy of a dengue vaccine (called TV005)&#xD;
      against viremia and rash induced by a DENV-2 vaccine virus (called rDEN2∆30-7169) in healthy&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four types of dengue viruses (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each of which&#xD;
      can cause mild to life-threatening illness. This study will evaluate the protective efficacy&#xD;
      of TV005 (a dengue virus vaccine) administered at Day 0 against viremia and rash induced by&#xD;
      rDEN2∆30-7169 (a live attenuated candidate DENV-2 vaccine) administered at Day 180. The&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the TV005 and rDEN2∆30-7169 vaccines will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous infection with a dengue&#xD;
      virus or a flavivirus. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single injection&#xD;
      of TV005 or placebo at study entry (Day 0). All participants will receive a single injection&#xD;
      of rDEN2∆30-7169 on Day 180. For at least 30 minutes after each vaccination, participants&#xD;
      will remain in the study clinic to be monitored for any adverse effects of the vaccines.&#xD;
      Participants will record their temperature three times a day for 16 days after the first and&#xD;
      second vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to study visits at Day 0 and 180, participants will attend study visits at Day 4,&#xD;
      6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, 150, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236,&#xD;
      270, and 360. At select study visits, participants will undergo a physical examination,&#xD;
      medical history review, blood collection, and a pregnancy test for female participants.&#xD;
