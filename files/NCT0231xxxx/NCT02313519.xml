    <textblock>
      Based on the need of large-scale, trials to explore the use of probiotics to reduce&#xD;
      post-operative complication rate, a randomized controlled trial is designed to investigate&#xD;
      the impact of a probiotics treatment protocol on postoperative morbidity in an open elective&#xD;
      colonic surgery cohort. The major objective is reduction of post-operative complications&#xD;
      after 30 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major colorectal surgery, i.e. surgery involving a wide colon resection and/or a very low&#xD;
      anastomosis, remains problematic, despite great advances in medico-pharmaceutical treatment,&#xD;
      improvement in surgical techniques, and sophisticated postoperative management. Such surgery&#xD;
      is still accompanied by an unacceptably high morbidity of 15% to 23.2% leading to an increase&#xD;
      in the number of ventilatory support days, prolongation of total hospital stay, significantly&#xD;
      higher medical costs, patient suffering, and, unfortunately mortality. Worse than this,&#xD;
      nowadays, infections and sepsis are by far the most common morbidities, either as initial&#xD;
      cause or as a consequence of another complication, such as anastomotic leakage. Ongoing&#xD;
      clinical studies have reported probiotic therapies to be beneficial in elective surgery&#xD;
      cases, since they have been shown to successfully modulate the GI flora in a plethora of&#xD;
      medical settings and in critically ill and trauma patients. More precisely, recent randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies and meta-analyses in elective surgery and abdominal surgery patients have&#xD;
      demonstrated that the perioperative use of probiotics is safe and reduces both the incidence&#xD;
      of postoperative wound infections, sepsis, post-operative pneumonia and other infections, and&#xD;
      the necessary duration of hospital stay and length of antibiotic therapy. However, there&#xD;
      exist few controlled, large-scale, trials comparing the current standard treatment with the&#xD;
      probiotic concept and showing the superiority of the latter in colonic surgery with regard to&#xD;
      a reduced complication rate. Therefore, the investigators decided to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate the impact of a probiotics treatment protocol on&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity in an open elective colonic surgery cohort. The major objective is to&#xD;
      evidence a reduction in 30-day infectious, surgery-related morbidity: any surgical site&#xD;
      infection; organ specific infections; systemic infections and anastomotic leakage. Minor&#xD;
      objectives related to the reduction in other non-infectious complications, as well as the&#xD;
      assessment of outcome indicators such as the number of days in postoperative ileus, on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, stay in ICU, total hospitalization and mortality in the 30-day&#xD;
      post-operative period.&#xD;
