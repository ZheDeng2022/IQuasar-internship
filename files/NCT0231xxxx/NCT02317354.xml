      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is an inherited eye condition. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about how people with XLRS choose to take part in research studies. They hope to find ways to&#xD;
      help other people make decisions about joining early phase trials&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To learn more about how people think and feel about taking part in early phase research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Adults age 18 or older with diagnosed XLRS. They must be eligible to be screened for a Phase&#xD;
      I/II ocular gene transfer clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened for the XLRS gene transfer study. They will be&#xD;
           interviewed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants who join the study - before the gene transfer procedure, then 3&#xD;
           months and 12 months after it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants who do not join the study - after their screening visit and 3&#xD;
           months and 12 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Participants who are screened but ineligible - after their screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Participants who choose not to be screened - at the time they make the decision and 1&#xD;
      year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews will ask for the participants thoughts about the clinical trial and why they&#xD;
           chose to take part or not. The interviews will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the day of interview 1, participants will fill out a survey about their mood and&#xD;
           personality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the days of interviews 2 and 3, participants will fill out a survey about their mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews may be done in person or by phone. Surveys can be done online or through the&#xD;
           mail. Or they can be done in person at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

      Objective: The objective of this study is to understand the factors that influence patient&#xD;
      expectations when enrolling in an early-phase RS1 ocular gene transfer clinical trial and to&#xD;
      assess the psychological impact of patient expectations over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 50 adults with X-linked retinoschisis who are eligible to be screened&#xD;
      for a Phase I/II ocular gene transfer clinical trial will be included in this study. We hope&#xD;
      to capture the experience of those actively engaged in the decision-making process who may&#xD;
      choose not to participate in the clinical trial or who may receive gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective qualitative interview study with quantitative questionnaires.&#xD;
      Participation will involve up to three interviews with questionnaires over one year.&#xD;
      Interviews may take place in person at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH&#xD;
      CC) or by telephone and will focus on how the interviewee came to the decision to participate&#xD;
      (not to participate) in the early-phase ocular gene transfer trial. Interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim, coded by two independent coders, and analyzed thematically.&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire that measures dispositional&#xD;
      optimism, resilience, and general mood states using instruments that have been shown to be&#xD;
      valid and reliable in both the general population and in clinical samples. Information&#xD;
      collected from these surveys will supplement information collected during the qualitative&#xD;
      interview and will provide information about constructs that are difficult to assess during a&#xD;
      brief interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes of this study include a description of what research&#xD;
      participants expect when choosing to enroll in an early-phase clinical trial and a&#xD;
      description of the psychological impact, over time, of having high expectations&#xD;
