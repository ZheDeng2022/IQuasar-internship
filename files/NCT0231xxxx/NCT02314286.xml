      Prospective randomized single blind trial. Study population are women diagnosed with severe&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia during singleton pregnancy, between 24+0 weeks and 41+6 weeks gestational age.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Rosuvastatin on the severe preeclampsia&#xD;
      resolution at 48 hours after delivery. After screening and signing an informed consent form,&#xD;
      before entering delivery room, a randomization 1:1 will be carried. 50 women will be in the&#xD;
      treatment arm while 50 will be in the control arm. Both groups will be treated according to&#xD;
      ACOG (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has the following clinical&#xD;
      guidelines related to deliveries before 39 weeks) guidelines. In addition, following&#xD;
      randomization experimental group will be treated with Rosuvastatin 40mg that will be&#xD;
      administrated orally with or without food. Treatment will be carried within the first hour&#xD;
      following delivery. Another dose will be given 24 hours after first administration. Control&#xD;
      group will be treated with placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a disorder of widespread vascular endothelial malfunction and vasospasm that&#xD;
      occurs after 20 weeks' gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks' postpartum. It is&#xD;
      clinically defined by as blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic and ≥90 mmHg diastolic diagnosed&#xD;
      for the first time after 20 weeks' gestation together with &gt;300mg proteinuria/24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global incidence of preeclampsia has been estimated at 5-14% of all pregnancies.&#xD;
      Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 6-8% of all pregnancies worldwide. Pre-eclampsia affects&#xD;
      3-5% of all first time pregnancies, but early severe pre-eclampsia occurs in only 1:200&#xD;
      pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant risk factors for pre-eclampsia are as follows: Nulliparity, age &gt;40 years, black&#xD;
      race, family history, chronic renal disease, chronic hypertension, antiphospholipid syndrome,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus , multiple gestation and high body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild preeclampsia is defined as the presence of hypertension (BP ≥140/90 mm Hg) on 2&#xD;
      occasions, at least 6 hours apart, but without evidence of end-organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe preeclampsia is defined as the presence of 1 of the following symptoms or signs in the&#xD;
      presence of preeclampsia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      marked elevation of blood pressure (&gt;160/110 mmHg), severe proteinuria (&gt;5 g/24 hours), or&#xD;
      evidence of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (headaches, blurred vision, seizures,&#xD;
      coma), renal dysfunction (oliguria or creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL), pulmonary edema,&#xD;
      hepatocellular injury (ALT &gt; 2-fold the upper limits of normal), hematologic dysfunction&#xD;
      (platelet count &lt; 100,000/L or DIC), or placental dysfunction (oligohydramnios or severe&#xD;
      intrauterine growth restriction). The HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low&#xD;
      platelets) syndrome is a special subgroup of severe preeclampsia and is a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eclampsia is defined as seizures that cannot be attributable to other causes in a woman with&#xD;
      preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal management of a woman with preeclampsia depends on gestational age and disease&#xD;
      severity Management of preeclampsia is challenging because it requires the clinician to&#xD;
      balance the health of the mother and fetus simultaneously. Patients with mild preeclampsia&#xD;
      are often induced after 37 weeks gestation. Before this, the immature fetus is treated with&#xD;
      expectant management with bed rest, close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function,&#xD;
      and careful fetal surveillance. For women with severe preeclampsia, induction of delivery&#xD;
      should be considered after 34 weeks gestation unless the patient is eligible for expectant&#xD;
      management in a tertiary hospital setting. The definitive treatment of preeclampsia is&#xD;
      delivery of the fetus and placenta. Anti-hypertensive drugs are essential for severe&#xD;
      hypertension (≥160 mmHg systolic or ≥110 mmHg diastolic) for reducing the risk of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accidents. Intravenous Labetalol, Nifedipine or hydralazine are the drugs&#xD;
      most commonly used to manage preeclampsia but there is insignificant evidence to indicate&#xD;
      which drug is preferable..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclamptic&#xD;
      seizures Where immediate child-birth is not essential, a delay of 24 hours will allow&#xD;
      steroids to be given to mature the baby's lungs, although a shorter duration may still be of&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia is associated with short-term and long-term maternal and fetal complications.&#xD;
      For the mother, it may lead to eclamptic seizures, stroke, intracranial bleed, uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension, renal failure, and hemolysis. For the fetus, it may lead to intrauterine growth&#xD;
      restriction, placental abruption, and the short-term and long-term complications of&#xD;
      prematurity, as well as predisposition to adult cardiovascular and metabolic disorders.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no effective therapy to preeclampsia, and delivery remains the only&#xD;
      approach to preventing maternal morbidity and mortality. However, this is usually achieved at&#xD;
      the expense of premature delivery and its associated morbidities. Moreover, following the&#xD;
      delivery, preeclampsia resolved slowly within days, exposing the mother to late complications&#xD;
      and increasing treatment cost significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the exact etiology of preeclampsia remains unknown. However, evidence obtained in&#xD;
      recent years, supports the theory that angiogenic imbalance is the end common pathway that&#xD;
      leads to clinical preeclampsia. During normal pregnancy, vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PlGF) promote pro-angiogenic state that regulates&#xD;
      vascular tone and glomerular capillary health. In preeclampsia, these proteins are&#xD;
      antagonized by excessive placental production of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1),&#xD;
      thereby creating angiogenic imbalance. After delivery, this imbalance resolves within hours&#xD;
      to days correlating with the resolution of the disease. One of the observations that marked&#xD;
      sFlt-1 as key player in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia was made in an animal model. It was&#xD;
      demonstrated that preeclampsia can be induced in animal model by over expressing sFlt-1&#xD;
      alone. In their model hydrophilic statins treatment decreased sFlt-1 levels and up-regulated&#xD;
      VEGF and PlGF levels. Most importantly, statins ameliorated preeclampsia symptoms by&#xD;
      improving hypertension and proteinuria in the preeclamptic mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and used successfully in the&#xD;
      primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Additionally, statins are known&#xD;
      to mediate pleiotropic effects via improving endothelial function and attenuating&#xD;
      inflammatory responses. Rosuvastatin is a hydrophilic statin, characterized by low&#xD;
      permeability through membranes, as the placenta and blood-brain-barrier. In addition, Short&#xD;
      treatment (hours to days) with this type of statin improved the outcome of patients during&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, contrast-induced nephropathy, hepatic&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion injury, emphasizing its preferential pleiotropic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the food and drug administration classiﬁes all statins as pregnancy category X and&#xD;
      discourages their use during pregnancy due to higher abortion rate and teratogenicity that&#xD;
      were observed in animals exposed to hydrophobic statins during pregnancy. Evidence for&#xD;
      teratogenicity of the hydrophilic statins was never reported probably due to their limited&#xD;
      permeability across membranes. Since the use of statins after delivery is allowed, the&#xD;
      present study will aim to evaluate whether Rosuvastatin may accelerates preeclampsia&#xD;
      resolution following delivery and potentially reduce postpartum preeclampsia complications.&#xD;
