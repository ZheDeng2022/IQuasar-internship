  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm delivery (PTD) is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and continues to be a major&#xD;
      public health concern, reaching 12.9% in 2006, despite intense research to reverse this&#xD;
      trend. Currently, fetal fibronectin (fFN) screening and cervical length determined by&#xD;
      ultrasound are two tests which are proven to have benefit in the identification of those at&#xD;
      greatest risk for preterm delivery. However the benefit of these tests is limited to&#xD;
      situations where a negative result can avoid unnecessary interventions. Currently, maternal&#xD;
      fetal monitoring is limited, as it is difficult to &quot;see&quot; what is going on in the placenta&#xD;
      (maternal-fetal interface) without invasive measures such as placental biopsy or&#xD;
      amniocentesis. Our goal for this study is to identify a group of biomarkers in non-invasive&#xD;
      compartments (such as saliva, blood, urine, and/or cervical and vaginal secretions) that are&#xD;
      associated with preterm labor and birth. We hypothesize that preterm labor will display an&#xD;
      inflammatory profile, which consists of unique inflammatory biomarkers from different&#xD;
      non-invasive bodily fluid compartments (such as Il-10 in urine, VEGF in cervical secretions,&#xD;
      and IP-10 in saliva), that correlates with a high incidence of preterm birth.&#xD;

      Preterm delivery (PTD) is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and continues to be a major&#xD;
      public health concern, reaching 12.9% in 2006, despite intense research to reverse this&#xD;
      trend. Currently, fetal fibronectin (fFN) screening and cervical length determined by&#xD;
      ultrasound are two tests which are proven to have benefit in the identification of those at&#xD;
      greatest risk for preterm delivery. However the benefit of these tests is limited to&#xD;
      situations where a negative result can avoid unnecessary interventions. The first goal of&#xD;
      this study is to identify non-invasive predictor(s) that will increase the clinician's&#xD;
      ability to identify patients who present with second trimester preterm labor (PTL) at risk&#xD;
      for preterm delivery (PTD) ≤ 32 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, maternal fetal monitoring is limited, as it is difficult to &quot;see&quot; what is going on&#xD;
      in the placenta (maternal-fetal interface) without invasive measures such as placental biopsy&#xD;
      or amniocentesis. Our preliminary study from term pregnancies has shown that a specific&#xD;
      correlation of an intrauterine cytokine may be reflected in one noninvasive site but not&#xD;
      another, depending upon the type of cytokine and the compartment from which it is secreted.&#xD;
      Therefore, our second goal for this study is to identify inflammatory markers in non-invasive&#xD;
      maternal compartments (such as saliva, blood, urine, and/or cervical and vaginal secretions)&#xD;
      that have a strong association with placenta/fetal membranes at the time of preterm birth ≤&#xD;
      32 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women, under 32 weeks gestation, who are admitted to Winthrop University Hospital&#xD;
      for evaluation of preterm labor will be eligible for this study. Women with indicated preterm&#xD;
      births (i.e. pre-eclampsia), multiple pregnancies, known major fetal abnormality (ex. those&#xD;
      that are known to be incompatible with life) and premature rupture of membranes will be&#xD;
      excluded from this study. After consent is obtained, samples (blood, urine, saliva, vaginal,&#xD;
      and cervical secretions) will be obtained and biomarkers will be identified using a Bio-Plex&#xD;
      cytokine concentration assay. These women will than be followed until they deliver. Women who&#xD;
      deliver after 32 weeks gestation will form our control group and women who deliver before 32&#xD;
      weeks gestation will form our preterm birth group. Concentration of the biomarkers in the&#xD;
      various maternal-fetal compartments will be analyzed and compared between the two groups. For&#xD;
      all women who delivery ≤ 32 weeks gestation, non-invasive samples will also be collected&#xD;
      around delivery and these cytokine levels will be compared to placenta/fetal membranes to&#xD;
      access how well non-invasive fluids reflect the intrauterine environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that preterm labor will display an inflammatory profile, which consists of&#xD;
      unique inflammatory biomarkers from different non-invasive bodily fluid compartments (such as&#xD;
      Il-10 in urine, VEGF in cervical secretions, and IP-10 in saliva), that correlates with a&#xD;
      high incidence of preterm birth.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Maternal Blood - Blood samples will be collected during routine blood draws and into&#xD;
           serum separator tubes, spun, and the serum stored at -80°C.&#xD;
