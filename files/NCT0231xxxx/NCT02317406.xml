    <description>GI tract flora include Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Bacteroides. Modulatory effect of GI tract flora composition was defined as two definitions. The first definition is that Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium increases significantly, Clostridium perfringens decreases or has no change and Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Bacteroides has no obvious change. The other is that Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium increases significantly, Clostridium perfringens decreases or has no change, Enterobacter and/or Enterococcus, Bacteroides increases significantly, but the amplification less than Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium.</description>
