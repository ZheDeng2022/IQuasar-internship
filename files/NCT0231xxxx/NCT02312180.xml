      ProMetic is intiitating a first-in-man study entitled &quot;A Phase 1, Dose Escalation, and&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Study of ProMetic Plasminogen Administered as Intravenous Infusion in Adults&#xD;
      and Children with Hypoplasminogenemia&quot;. The general objectives of this clinical study,&#xD;
      (Protocol #2002C005G), are to determine the optimal dose and interval required to support the&#xD;
      planned Phase 2/3 study and to investigate initial safety and tolerability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 study will be a single center study, the subjects will be from across country. It&#xD;
      is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study in patients with hypoplasminogenemia aged&#xD;
      12 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose cohorts are planned to achieve a target sample size of 12 evaluable subjects. This&#xD;
      will ensure a minimum of 4 evaluable subjects in each cohort. Due to the challenges of&#xD;
      patient availability and burden of cross country travel, each cohort will enroll no more than&#xD;
      6 subjects. Any subject may participate in multiple cohorts, as judged appropriate by the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, each subject must be diagnosed with hypoplasminogenimia and have a&#xD;
      plasminogen activity level of ≤ 40% before they will be administered a single dose of&#xD;
      Plasminogen (Human), the investigational medicinal product. Plasminogen will be administered&#xD;
      as an intravenous (IV) infusion at the following doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 2 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 6 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3*: 12 mg/kg * Optional. If optimal dosing information is demonstrated in either&#xD;
           Cohort 1 or 2, Cohort 3 will not be pursued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each dose level, Plasma plasminogen activity and antigen levels will be measured to&#xD;
      develop a pharmacokinetic profile. Blood samples will be drawn at the following time points:&#xD;
      baseline immediately before dosing; at the end of infusion; and at 1, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120,&#xD;
      168, and 216 hours after the end of infusion. Visits 1-4 and 11 must be conducted at the&#xD;
      clinical site. A subject may conduct Visits 5-10 at the clinical site or have the study&#xD;
      procedures performed by a Home Health Nurses Group (HHNG) nurse through home visits, if&#xD;
      continued visits to the study site are not possible or practical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have another visit 14 days after the IV infusion for Visit 10 (Day 15,&#xD;
      Short-term-Safety Visit). Subjects will return to the clinic 30 days after IV infusion for&#xD;
      Visit 11 (Day 30, Follow-up-Safety Visit) for the collection of adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      immunogenicity testing, routine safety tests and procedures, and final viral safety testing,&#xD;
      unless the subject is entering into another Cohort.&#xD;

    <description>The following PK parameters will be calculated from PLG activity and antigen levels using the non-compartmental PK analysis method: Area under the concentration time curve (both AUC0-t and AUC0-inf), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), volume of distribution (Vd), clearance (Cl), and mean residence time (MRT). Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of lyophilized plasminogen (PLG) at 3 dose levels (the third dose is optional) in subjects with hypoplasminogenemia to determine the desirable dose and dosing interval to be studied in a Phase 2/3 study.</description>
