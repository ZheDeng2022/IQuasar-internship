      The F.R.O.N.T. formula for pre-operative airway assessment and documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of difficult airway is one of the most important challenges before general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Although in recent decades different scoring systems have been for the&#xD;
      preoperative assessment of their sensitivity and specificity in predicting a difficult airway&#xD;
      remains moderate. Recently, the calculation of composite scores using different formulae has&#xD;
      been proposed as the most sensitive one. The aim of the present work was to test the clinical&#xD;
      usefulness of the FRONT score, a recently developed scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a multi-center, inter-observer, prospective and double-blind investigation&#xD;
      that included 976 patients from two university centers: 250 from the University of&#xD;
      Cluj-Napoca, Romania, and 726 from the University of Debrecen, Hungary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative evaluation of the patients was performed by a preoperative team of&#xD;
      anesthesiologists (team A) who evaluated and scored the expected difficulty of the management&#xD;
      of the airway. An intraoperative team of evaluators (team B) working independently from team&#xD;
      A, performed the actual instrumentation of the airway and scored the actual findings. Both&#xD;
      teams used the FRONT scoring system and worked independently from each other to ensure&#xD;
      blinded assessment. Statistical analysis of the preoperative and intraoperative FRONT scores&#xD;
      were performed post hoc.&#xD;

      Criteria for preoperative assessment and grading for all five levels &quot;F&quot; 0 Normal level of&#xD;
      difficulty or no difficulty to be expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difficulty to apply air tight the facial mask ventilation by one person (difficulty to&#xD;
           maintain SpO2 above 92% with 100% O2), or inability to prevent the decrease in SpO2&#xD;
           during facial mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased ventilation difficulty, requiring the presence of two anesthetists in order to&#xD;
           maintain the patient's oxygenation, or inability to ventilate the patient with the&#xD;
           facial mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;R&quot; 0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty to be expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incomplete teeth, loose teeth, edentulous status, incisor protrusion, prognathia,&#xD;
           micrognathia, limited opening of the mouth but still more than 3 cm., expected&#xD;
           difficulty with direct laringoscopy and/or insertion of a supraglottic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mobile teeth, mouth opening less than 3 cm, laryngoscopy or insertion of a supraglottic&#xD;
           airway device impossible &quot;O&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty to be expected&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 Laryngoscopy and intubation difficult expected by intaroral mass, abscess, anatomical&#xD;
      anomalies (large tongue) 2 Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation expected to be extremely&#xD;
      difficult or impossible &quot;N&quot; 0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty to be expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduced mobility of the cervical spine, short neck, bulky chest, special positioning of&#xD;
           the patient necessary (roll under the shoulders)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Immobile cervical spine &quot;T&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty to be expected&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expected trouble for passing the tube through the glottis (polyp, tumor, abscess), and&#xD;
           tube with smaller diameter necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severe obstruction in the upper airway (polyp, tumor, abscess, paralysis of the vocal&#xD;
           cords), tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for intraoperative assessment and grading for all five levels. &quot;F&quot; 0 Normal level of&#xD;
      difficulty or no difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difficulty to seal the face mask accordingly by one person in order to maintain SpO2&#xD;
           above 92% by ventilating with oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inability to maintain SpO2 above 92% by ventilating with oxygen with handling the face&#xD;
           mask by two persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;R&quot; 0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incomplete dentition, protruding incisives, prognathia, micrognathia, a reduced&#xD;
           interincisive gap above 3 cm thus explicitly hampering (but not completely preventing)&#xD;
           intubation or supraglottic device insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incomplete dentition, protruding incisives, prognathia, micrognathia, a reduced&#xD;
           interincisive gap below 3 cm limiting intubation or supraglottic device insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;O&quot; 0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Macroglossia, presence of tumours or other findings with increased oral tissue mass,&#xD;
           tongue base processes which hamper the performance of direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
           (Cormack/Lehane grades up to 3°), conventional intubation or the insertion of a&#xD;
           supraglottic airway. Final success could be achieved after two attempts to secure the&#xD;
           airway with any adopted technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Macroglossia, presence of tumours or other findings with increased oral tissue mass,&#xD;
           tongue base processes which prevent the performance of direct laryngoscopy&#xD;
           (Cormack/Lehane grade 4°), conventional intubation or the insertion of a supraglottic&#xD;
           airway. Tracheal intubation could be achieved only after recurring to a visualizing&#xD;
           technique (e.g. flexible fiberoptic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;N&quot; 0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduced cervical spine mobility, short neck, risk of spinal cord damage by certain head&#xD;
           positions that hamper direct laryngoscopy and conventional means of tracheal intubation.&#xD;
           Successful intubation possible by 2 or more attempts. Supraglottic airway insertion is&#xD;
           not affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduced cervical spine mobility, short neck, risk of spinal cord damage by certain head&#xD;
           positions that prevent direct laryngoscopy and conventional means of tracheal&#xD;
           intubation. Tracheal intubation could be achieved only after recurring to a visualizing&#xD;
           technique (e.g. flexible fiberoptic). Supraglottic airway insertion may have been&#xD;
           affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;T&quot; 0 Normal level of difficulty or no difficulty&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difficult forwarding of a tracheal tube with regular diameter to a mid-tracheal&#xD;
           position. Supraglottic airway insertion is not affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impossible forwarding of a tracheal tube even with a reduced diameter to a mid-tracheal&#xD;
           position. Supraglottic airway insertion is not affected but ventilation is difficult or&#xD;
           impossible. Necessity to apply jet ventilation or to bypass the oro-tracheal route by&#xD;
           performing a trans-tracheal access.&#xD;
