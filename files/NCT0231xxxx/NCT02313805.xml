    <textblock>
      Diabetes prevalence continues to rise worldwide, leading to the increasing use of insulin.&#xD;
      This especially applies to developing countries where the needle-and-syringe method of&#xD;
      administration remains the most affordable and effective form of hyperglycemic treatment.&#xD;
      Competent health care professionals are required to ensure safe insulin initiation. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate a teaching intervention on insulin initiation for medical&#xD;
      students, and whether after experiencing that intervention the use of a checklist, during&#xD;
      simulate insulin initiation, improves the education they provide to patients.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is on the increase worldwide. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that&#xD;
      there are currently 382 million persons diagnosed with diabetes. The prevalence is expected&#xD;
      to increase to over 592 million in less than 25 years [1]. This increase is disproportional&#xD;
      in the developing world, with 80% of those affected living in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries. For example, in South and Central America, the prevalence of diabetes is estimated&#xD;
      to increase by over 60% in the next two decades [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin is one of the agents that can be used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes&#xD;
      is characterized by a progressive decline in beta-cell function and insulin secretion. Over&#xD;
      time, a significant number of persons with diabetes will require intensification of&#xD;
      management, and possibly insulin treatment to achieve acceptable glycemic control [3].&#xD;
      Insulin remains the oldest and most effective treatment of hyperglycemia. It is also possibly&#xD;
      the cheapest form of treatment relative to its potency, particularly when used in its animal&#xD;
      or human forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin is a particularly important treatment option in the developing world and in&#xD;
      low-income groups in the developed world. In the developing world, drug affordability has&#xD;
      limited the international evolution from an algorithmic to an individualized approach to&#xD;
      glycemic management [4, 5]. In many countries, insulin remains the affordable second or third&#xD;
      line choice for treatment, and will therefore be used with greater frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin initiation is, however, a complex task. To safely initiate insulin, many important&#xD;
      aspects of patient education must be addressed. Patients must understand the technicalities&#xD;
      of drawing insulin with a needle and syringe as well as administering insulin with a syringe,&#xD;
      pen or pump. The side effects of weight gain and hypoglycemia must also be understood,&#xD;
      including the recognition and treatment of the latter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checklists have been shown to increase the quality of care by reducing errors [6]. They&#xD;
      reduce the cognitive load of decision making by decreasing analytic conscious thinking [7].&#xD;
      At the most basic level, they can reduce human error by providing a documented methodological&#xD;
      approach to completing tasks. This advantage may be useful in the complex and potentially&#xD;
      dangerous arena of insulin initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We seek to evaluate a teaching intervention on insulin initiation, and to determine whether&#xD;
      there are safety gains to the additional use of a checklist. This evaluation will be done by&#xD;
      means of patient simulations, which allow reliable evaluation [8] without exposing patients&#xD;
      to risks [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis (alternate):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a checklist during insulin initiation, with a needle and syringe, can improve patient&#xD;
      education on safe and effective insulin use, above that of thorough undergraduate education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design; The study is randomized and controlled. Initially, the students will all&#xD;
      experience a two-hour training session on insulin initiation. Within a week of completing the&#xD;
      training, they will be asked to submit a 250 to 400-word reflective narrative, with guiding&#xD;
      questions for reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two to four weeks after training, students consenting to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the two study groups: the control group and the intervention group. They&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a simulation exercise on insulin initiation, with (intervention&#xD;
      group) or without (the control group) the availability of an insulin initiation checklist.&#xD;
      Performance during each simulation will be assessed with the aid of a check sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Checklist; The checklist was developed by a task-force, which consisted of eleven&#xD;
      individuals: a layperson, a pharmacist, two dietitians, two diabetes educators, a podiatrist,&#xD;
      a diabetes specialist nurse, a pediatrician and two diabetologists. The process was lead by&#xD;
      the pharmacist, diabetes specialist nurse and one of the diabetologists. The final version of&#xD;
      the checklist was achieved through iterative cycles of re-design and feedback. The aim was to&#xD;
      develop a simple A4-size, two-sided document that could be easily copied. Eleven checklist&#xD;
      items were agreed upon, which cover insulin side effects; use and disposal of syringes;&#xD;
      insulin administration and storage; and the recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia. Images&#xD;
      illustrating the process of using a syringe to draw insulin from a vial as well as injections&#xD;
      sites (for children, adults and pregnant women) were included at the back. There was also&#xD;
      space provided for documentation of the client's name and registration number, insulin type&#xD;
      and when it should be taken, medications to be stopped, and the date and signature of the&#xD;
      facilitator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Check Sheet; A check sheet will be used to evaluate the performance of the undergraduate&#xD;
      students during each simulation. Educational tasks will be listed under five sub-headings:&#xD;
      'side effects', 'hypoglycemia', 'drawing up insulin', 'insulin administration', and 'other'.&#xD;
      Tick boxes will be used to 'check off' whether tasks are performed adequately, inadequately&#xD;
      or not at all. Each task will have brief notes on what constitutes adequate performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and Simulation; The study will take place within a nine-week final year medicine&#xD;
      clerkship at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, Barbados. Every nine weeks, the&#xD;
      simulation will take place within the medicine end-of-clerkship Objective Structured Clinical&#xD;
      Examination. An actor/actress will be used during the simulations to play the role of the&#xD;
      patient, in which he/she will require education on the use and administration of insulin via&#xD;
      a needle and syringe. The participant will be given instructions for the simulation and the&#xD;
      use of the checklist, if in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training session on insulin initiation; Key aspects of the lesson plan will be as outlined&#xD;
      below:&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Evaluate clients and decide on how insulin will be initiated and titrated&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Discuss the major side effects of insulin use, including weight gain and hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Discuss the frequency and timing of glucose monitoring on insulin regimes (background,&#xD;
           biphasic and basal bolus)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explain to clients how to recognize and treat hypoglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Demonstrate and explain to clients the proper technique of drawing up and injecting&#xD;
           insulin, using a needle and syringe as well as pen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Case based approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socratic discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of simulation to create a clinically authentic learning environment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kolb's experiential reflective cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Utilization of checklist to structure learning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: (10 minutes) Brief review of insulin types&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: (30 minutes - 10 minutes per case)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion of three clinical case scenarios, to decide on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. whether insulin initiation is appropriate and which regime should be used,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the frequency of glucose monitoring and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the approach to initiation and titration of insulin, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      General learning points from this section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications of insulin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type-1 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes due to pancreatic insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type-2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral agents (as second-line or third-line&#xD;
           agent) when insulin can be safely introduced&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight gain with insulin is approximately 2 to 4 kg and proportional to glucose lowering. It&#xD;
      is likely due to reduction in glycosuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: (15 minutes) Students are to discuss key elements of education for a client who is&#xD;
      learning to draw and self-administer insulin, using a needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: (10 minutes) Simulation- students are to demonstrate how they would educate a client who&#xD;
      is to be started on insulin using needle and syringe. Instructions given to students: please&#xD;
      start this patient on 10 units of Novolin N at bedtime; administration will be by the needle&#xD;
      and syringe method; and, please provide any education required. A diabetes specialist nurse&#xD;
      (DSN) will act as the simulated client. Other students will observe and reflect on how they&#xD;
      would do it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E: (30 minutes) Insulin initiation will be taught by DSN, using the structure of the&#xD;
      checklist. Methods of administration will include syringe and pen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F: (30 minutes - Role change at 15 minutes) Simulation- Students are to work in pairs, one&#xD;
      acting as the patient and one the doctor, to simulate the education required during insulin&#xD;
      initiation. &quot;Doctors&quot; are to have instructions and to use the checklist during the process of&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin initiation reflective narrative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions to students; Having experienced the insulin initiation session you are now&#xD;
      required to write a short, 250-400 word reflective narrative. The desired outcome of this&#xD;
      process is enhancement of your understanding of what you learnt, what further knowledge and&#xD;
      skills are needed and what facilitated your learning. Please consider the guiding questions&#xD;
      below to assist this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How did the session impact my knowledge or skills of insulin initiation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What further actions will enable me to provide the best quality care during insulin&#xD;
           initiation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What made the session a useful learning experience for me?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that the submission of an adequate piece is an essential part of the educational&#xD;
      intervention and this will be assessed on the presence of content related to the above&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational intervention will be evaluated on 2 of the 4 levels of the Kirkpatrick&#xD;
      evaluation model 10. On level one, content analysis of the reflective narrative will provide&#xD;
      information on what was liked about the intervention. On level two, student's performance&#xD;
      during simulation of insulin initiation will provide information on what was learnt.&#xD;
      Additionally, comparison of the students initiating insulin with and without (the control&#xD;
      group) a checklist will give insight on safety gains with its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflective commentaries will be analyzed qualitatively using Atlas ti V7 software. Code list&#xD;
      creation will be both inductive (codes formulated based on the research question and&#xD;
      available literature) and deductive (codes based on other information derived from the&#xD;
      commentaries). Thematic analysis will take place through iterative cycles of coding, updating&#xD;
      of codes and analysis. To ensure consistency in the analytic process, two researchers will&#xD;
      participate in this process and meet regularly to compare analyses within and across&#xD;
      participants. A third researcher will repeat the analysis in the event of discrepancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be analyzed using SPSS version 18 (IBM Inc., Armonk, New York, USA).&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe performance without the checklist. The&#xD;
      chi-squared test will be used to analyze nominal data captured with and without the use of&#xD;
      the checklist. If the necessary assumptions apply the t-tests will determine whether there&#xD;
      are statistically significant differences within checklist scores between the administrations&#xD;
      in each group. If the necessary assumptions do not apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test will&#xD;
      be used respectively. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered to represent statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
