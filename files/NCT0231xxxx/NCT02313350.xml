  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sciatica due to herniated disc is a major cause of disability in young adults. Surgery is the&#xD;
      gold-standard and the only controlled treatment in case of failure of conservative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous chemonucleolysis with Discogel® may be a valuable alternative to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Discogel® chemonucleolysis appears as a relatively innocuous technique which may&#xD;
      avoid 2% complications after disc surgery and 5% repeated surgery (according to recent&#xD;
      trials).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first randomized trial comparing Discogel® chemonucleolysis versus surgery&#xD;
      in patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation and unresponsive to conservative&#xD;
      medical treatments (including epidural steroid injections) Our expectation is that Discogel®&#xD;
      chemonucleolysis will avoid surgery in 80% of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since chymopapain was taken off the market in 2002, no percutaneous treatment has been proven&#xD;
      to be a valuable alternative to surgical discectomy in herniated disk-related sciatica.&#xD;
      Intradiscal injection of alcohol was a possibly efficient technique but was not used due to&#xD;
      its rapid dissipation and nerve toxicity. The gel, by stabilizing the alcohol into the disc,&#xD;
      now makes it effective locally and cancels its nerve toxicity. As a preliminary evaluation,&#xD;
      we conducted an open trial with strict methodological criteria to test the efficiency of an&#xD;
      intradiscal injection using a new product based on jellified ethanol, Discogel®, in the&#xD;
      treatment of nerve root pain due to compression by herniated disk. A 30% improvement in pain&#xD;
      VAS was obtained in two thirds of the patients. No complication was encountered. These&#xD;
      results prompted us to further investigate the effectiveness of Discogel® chemonucleolysis&#xD;
      using a randomized design comparing it to surgery which remains the gold-standard treatment&#xD;
      for disk-related sciatica resistant to conservative treatment. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      chemonucleolysis using Discogel® has suitable efficacy and safety profile for large&#xD;
      application in the treatment of persistent herniated disc related sciatica and that it is&#xD;
      consequently able to reduce the need of surgery, namely open discectomy, in this indication.&#xD;
      New minimally invasive approach of herniated disc-related sciatica is crucial, due to high&#xD;
      prevalence and medico-economic impact of the disease. Awaited advances are enrichment of&#xD;
      management strategies for herniated disc-related sciatica, earlier recovery of patients&#xD;
      unresponsive to first line conservative treatment, reduction of the costs and serious adverse&#xD;
      events related with surgery and finally reduction of the costs associated with induced&#xD;
      sciatica disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open randomized non-inferiority clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discogel® vs surgery, to be organized within four next weeks after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible patients who decline participation to the trial will be followed in an&#xD;
           observational cohort at the same time-frame as the randomized cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of compliance with the assigned treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients randomized who will delay or decline the assigned treatment will not be&#xD;
           excluded from the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits at 4, 8, 16, 24 and 52 weeks (evaluation of the main and secondary outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Result analysis will be conducted in Intention to treat&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery will be allowed in the Discogel® arm starting at the 16 W visit or before in&#xD;
           case of intractable pain or complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of patients will be done from the consultations of Rheumatology, Radiology,&#xD;
      Surgery and Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Departments of each study center. Indeed,&#xD;
      the inclusion visit will not be done by the physician who will perform the chemonucleolysis,&#xD;
      or the surgeon in charge of the patient. After randomization, chemonucleolysis or surgery&#xD;
      will be scheduled within the four next weeks. Patients undergoing chemonucleolysis will be&#xD;
      hospitalized in day hospital of the Rheumatology / Surgery department of each study center.&#xD;
      The procedure of chemonucleolysis will be performed in the corresponding Radiology department&#xD;
      or in the usual department. Open discectomy will be performed during a conventional&#xD;
      hospitalization in the Surgery department of each study center. Duration of the hospital stay&#xD;
      will depend on patient's recovery after surgery. A duration of about one week is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up of patients will be 52 weeks (5 time points). At each time point, main and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be evaluated. Questionnaires will be filled out by the patient,&#xD;
      before the consultation visit. An independent person (nurse, secretary, clinical research&#xD;
      technician..) will be available to help the patient to fill his self questionnaire and check&#xD;
      for the accuracy of the patient answers. It is important to note no physician involved in the&#xD;
      protocol will participate to the patient evaluation. The physician assessor will be blinded&#xD;
      for the result of the questionnaire.&#xD;
