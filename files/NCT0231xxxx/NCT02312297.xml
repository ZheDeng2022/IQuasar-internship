      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing Minocycline&#xD;
      hydrochloride extended release tablets 135 mg manufactured by OHM Laboratories Inc. with&#xD;
      SolodynTM extended release tablets 135 mg manufactured by AAI Pharma, Inc Wilmington, NC&#xD;
      28405 and manufactured for Medicis, The Dermatology Company Scottsdale, AZ 85258 in healthy,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Test for drugs of abuse (opiates and cannabinoids) in urine and breath test for alcohol were&#xD;
      carried out prior to admission in each period of the study. Following an overnight fast of at&#xD;
      least 10 hour, a single oral dose of minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablet 135 mg&#xD;
      of either test or reference formulation was administered during each period of the study,&#xD;
      along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature under low light condition and&#xD;
      under supervision of trained study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done&#xD;
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood&#xD;
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
