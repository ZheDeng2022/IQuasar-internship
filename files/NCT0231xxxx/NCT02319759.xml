  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of guselkumab&#xD;
      in participants with Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (more than one clinical site will work on a medical research study),&#xD;
      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither&#xD;
      investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant receives),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test&#xD;
      whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) study to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of guselkumab in participants with PsA. The study will consist of 4 parts: Screening&#xD;
      period (6 weeks), a double-blind treatment period (consists of guselkumab and placebo&#xD;
      treatment for 24 weeks), an active treatment period (guselkumab for 20 weeks), and follow-up&#xD;
      period (12 weeks). The maximal study duration for a participant will not exceed 62 weeks&#xD;
      including the Screening period. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups in a 2:1 ratio to either receive Guselkumab 100 milligram (mg) at Weeks 0, 4 then&#xD;
      every 8 weeks or Placebo at Weeks 0, 4 then every 8 weeks until Week 24. At week 24,&#xD;
      participants remaining in the placebo group will start to receive guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks&#xD;
      24, 28, 36 and 44. Participants in both treatment groups who have less than (&lt;) 5 percent (%)&#xD;
      improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts at Week 16 will qualify for&#xD;
      early escape and will switch to open-label therapy with ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg at Weeks&#xD;
      16, 20, 32, and 44 based on the approved dosage for the PsA indication in the particular&#xD;
      country of study. The efficacy will be assessed primarily by measuring percentage of&#xD;
      participants who achieve an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response at Week 24.&#xD;
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 Response at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (worst condition). PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in HAQ-DI score is a measure of the change in the physical function, where a negative change reflects an improvement and a positive change reflects worsening of physical function. HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty, to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area (that is, lower scores are indicative of better functioning). The total HAQ-DI score ranges from 0-24 with lower score indicating better functioning.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 16, 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in GRACE index score measures the change in disease activity, where a negative change indicates an improvement and a positive change indicates a worsening of PsA disease activity. GRACE index was converted from Arithmetic Mean of the Desirability Function (AMDF). AMDF is calculated by transforming all variables using predefined algorithms and expressing the total score as a mean with a score range of 0 - 1, where 1 indicates a better state than 0. GRACE Index = (1 - AMDF)*10, where GRACE index has a range of 0-10, with higher scores indicate more active disease. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 16, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The mCPDAI assessed 4 domains (joints, skin, entheses, and dactylitis). The mCPDAI scores were calculated using the following assessments: joints (66 swollen and 68 tender joint counts), HAQ-DI score, PASI, dactylitis, and enthesitis. Within each domain a score (range 0-3) was assigned, where 0= Not involved, 1= Mild, 2= Moderate and 3= Severe. The scores for each domain were then added together to give a final score range of 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more active disease activity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of PsA disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. PASI 50, 75, 90, and 100 responses were defined as at least a 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline respectively. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (worst condition). PASI 75 response was defined as at least a 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in HAQ-DI score is a measure of the change in the physical function, where a negative change reflects an improvement and a positive change reflects worsening of physical function. HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty, to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area (that is, lower scores are indicative of better functioning). The total HAQ-DI score ranges from 0-24 with lower score indicating better functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Response at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in HAQ-DI score is a measure of the change in the physical function, where a negative change reflects an improvement and a positive change reflects worsening of physical function. HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty, to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area (that is, lower scores are indicative of better functioning). The total HAQ-DI score ranges from 0-24 with lower score indicating better functioning.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI response was defined as &gt;= 0.3 improvement from baseline in HAQ-DI score. HAQ-DI is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty, to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area (that is, lower scores are indicative of better functioning). The total HAQ-DI score ranges from 0-24 with lower score indicating better functioning.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Dactylitis Scores at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The severity of dactylitis is scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0, 1, 2, 3 indicates none, mild, moderate, severe, respectively in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis scores for a participant is 0-60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Dactylitis at Weeks 24, 28, 32, 44, and 56</title>
        <description>Dactylitis was characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. The severity of dactylitis is scored on a scale of 0-3, where 0, 1, 2, 3 indicates none, mild, moderate, severe, respectively in each digit of the hands and feet. The range of total dactylitis scores for a participant is 0-60. Higher score indicates greater degree of tenderness.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in LEI Scores at Week 4, 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI). The LEI was developed to assess enthesitis in participants with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence of pain (score of 0) by applying local pressure to Lateral elbow epicondyle, left and right, Medial femoral condyle, left and right, and Achilles tendon insertion, left and right. LEI scores ranging from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness).</description>

        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI). The LEI was developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA, and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence of pain (score of 0) by applying local pressure to Lateral elbow epicondyle, left and right, Medial femoral condyle, left and right, and Achilles tendon insertion, left and right. Participants with enthesitis had LEI score &gt;0. LEI scores ranging from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Psoriatic ArthritiS Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) Score at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in PASDAS score measures the change in disease activity where a negative value indicates an improvement and a positive value indicates worsening of PsA disease activity. PASDAS is a PsA disease activity score that assesses 4 domains (joints, entheses, dactylitis and quality of life) of PsA. PASDAS is a derived score combining Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis and psoriasis, on a 100-unit VAS), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (on a 100-unit VAS), swollen joint count (66 joints), tender joint count (68 joints), CRP (mg/L), enthesitis based on LEI (scaled to a 0-6 range), dactylitis count (scoring each digit from 0-3 and recoding to 0-1, where any score &gt; 0 equaled 1), and the PCS score of the SF-36 health survey. The total score range is 0-10 and the cutoffs for disease activity were 3.2 (low) to 5.4 (high). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of overall disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in GRAppa Composite scorE (GRACE) Index Score at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in GRACE index score measures the change in disease activity, where a negative change indicates an improvement and a positive change indicates a worsening of PsA disease activity. GRACE index was converted from Arithmetic Mean of the Desirability Function (AMDF). AMDF is calculated by transforming all variables using predefined algorithms and expressing the total score as a mean with a score range of 0 - 1, where 1 indicates a better state than 0. GRACE Index = (1 - AMDF)*10, where GRACE index has a range of 0-10, with higher scores indicate more active disease. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (mCPDAI) Score at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
        <description>The mCPDAI assessed 4 domains (joints, skin, entheses, and dactylitis). The mCPDAI scores were calculated using the following assessments: joints (66 swollen and 68 tender joint counts), HAQ-DI score, PASI, dactylitis, and enthesitis. Within each domain a score (range 0-3) was assigned, where 0= Not involved, 1= Mild, 2= Moderate and 3= Severe. The scores for each domain were then added together to give a final score range of 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more active disease activity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of PsA disease activity.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in DAPSA measures the change in disease activity, where a negative change indicates an improvement and a positive change indicates worsening of disease activity. DAPSA score is a the sum of swollen joint count (66 joints), tender joint count (68 joints), CRP (mg/dL), Patient's Assessment of Pain (on a 10-unit VAS;0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis, on a 10-unit VAS; 0 to 100 centimeter [cm] VAS, 0=excellent and 10=poor). Cut-off values for disease activity: 0-4 remission; 5-14 low; 15-28 moderate; &gt;28 high.</description>

          <description>Change from baseline in DAPSA measures the change in disease activity, where a negative change indicates an improvement and a positive change indicates worsening of disease activity. DAPSA score is a the sum of swollen joint count (66 joints), tender joint count (68 joints), CRP (mg/dL), Patient's Assessment of Pain (on a 10-unit VAS;0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis, on a 10-unit VAS; 0 to 10cm VAS, 0=excellent and 10=poor). Cut-off values for disease activity: 0-4 remission; 5-14 low; 15-28 moderate; &gt;28 high.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Physical and Mental Component Summary (PCS and MCS) Scores of 36- Item Short Form Health Assessment Questionnaire (SF-36) at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS and MCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms as presented in this outcome measure. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

          <description>RAPID3 is a multi-dimensional health assessment questionnaire that was designed for use in routine clinical care. Three core data set for function, pain, and patient global estimate of disease activity were recorded. Each was scored 0-10 and the score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating worse condition. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in condition.</description>

        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. PASI 50, 75, 90, and 100 responses were defined as at least a 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline respectively. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PASI Score at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percentage (%)-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A negative percent change from baseline indicates the percent improvement from baseline in the severity of psoriatic lesions. As planned, results data was analyzed and reported for the specified arms for this outcome measure.</description>
