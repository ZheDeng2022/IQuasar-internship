      Introduction: The lack of congruence between the acetabulum and femoral head in hip dysplasia&#xD;
      compromise the passive stability of the hip joint resulting in increased stress on the&#xD;
      acetabular labrum, joint capsule and the muscles acting close to the hip joint. Soft tissue&#xD;
      injury is present in hip dysplasia, and pathology of the iliopsoas muscle has been found in&#xD;
      18-50%. To our knowledge, no studies have systematically examined the prevalence of soft&#xD;
      tissue pathology in hip dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this research project is to examine soft tissue pathology in 100 patients&#xD;
      with hip dysplasia prior to and one year after Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Soft tissue pathology will be examined in a prospective cohort study on 100 patients&#xD;
      with hip dysplasia prior to and one year after surgery. Pathology will be examined using&#xD;
      ultrasonography and the Clinical Entities Approach that focus on pathology of the iliopsoas,&#xD;
      adductors, rectus abdominis, gluteus medius and hamstrings. Furthermore, hip muscle strength&#xD;
      is tested with a dynamometer, hip related health is measured with the Copenhagen Hip and&#xD;
      Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and physical activity is measured with triaxial accelerometers&#xD;
      during a period of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective: Is it possible to demonstrate pathology of the hip muscles and tendons applying&#xD;
      clinical tests, muscle strength tests, and ultrasonography, as it has been found in&#xD;
      sports-active people with groin pain, it will make sense to plan and test a specific training&#xD;
      program focusing on the pathological soft tissue pathology.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hip dysplasia the acetabulum presents as shallow and oblique with insufficient coverage of&#xD;
      the femoral head. Deformity of the femoral neck and head is common with bilateral affection&#xD;
      in 54%. The lack of congruence between the acetabulum and femoral head compromise the passive&#xD;
      stability of the hip joint resulting in increased increased stress on the acetabular labrum,&#xD;
      joint capsule and the muscles acting close to the hip joint. The increased stress on soft&#xD;
      tissue results in acetabular labrum injury in 49-94% of the patients with hip dysplasia&#xD;
      scheduled for joint preserving surgery. Left untreated hip dysplasia may lead to development&#xD;
      of early osteoarthritis; however, the osteoarthritic process can be prevented or delayed with&#xD;
      the Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue injury is present in hip dysplasia, and pathology of the iliopsoas muscle has&#xD;
      been found in 18-50%. The muscles acting close to the hip joint including the deep fibers of&#xD;
      the iliopsoas and the iliocapsularis muscle are together with the acetabular labrum and joint&#xD;
      capsule able to increase the dynamic stabilisation of the femoral head in the dysplastic and&#xD;
      shallow acetabulum. The hip joint is beside the iliopsoas further stabilised by the adductors&#xD;
      and the gluteus medius muscle. Sustained hip pain and immobilisation has a negative impact on&#xD;
      the iliopsoas, psoas and the hip adductors in terms of atrophy and decreased hip muscle&#xD;
      strength. In an experimental study design it was found that decreased force contribution from&#xD;
      the gluteal muscles during hip extension and the iliopsoas muscle during hip flexion resulted&#xD;
      in an increase in the anterior hip joint force. The increased anterior hip joint force may&#xD;
      contribute to anterior hip pain, subtle hip instability and the development of anterior&#xD;
      acetabular labral tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hip dysplasia are less physical active prior to PAO mainly due to groin pain. A&#xD;
      decreased physical activity level is likely to have a negative impact on the muscles acting&#xD;
      close to the hip joint with a possible increased risk of sustaining further acetabular labrum&#xD;
      injury and/or overuse related to soft tissue pathology. After surgery, the risk of overuse&#xD;
      related soft tissue pathology might be further increased due to surgery impact on muscles and&#xD;
      tendons. If it is possible to demonstrate pathology of the hip muscles and tendons applying&#xD;
      clinical tests, muscle strength tests, and ultrasonography, as it has been found in&#xD;
      sports-active people with groin pain, it will make sense to plan and test a specific training&#xD;
      program focusing on the pathological soft tissue pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this research project is to examine soft tissue pathology in 100 patients&#xD;
      with hip dysplasia prior to and one year after PAO.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are included from the division of hip surgery at Aarhus University Hospital using&#xD;
      the listed inclusion and exclusion criteria's. The patients complete the HAGOS questionnaire&#xD;
      after informed written consent. Wiberg's center-edge (CE) angle, Tönnis' acetabular index&#xD;
      (AI) angle, and osteoarthritis grade are measured on anteroposterior radiographs after&#xD;
      inclusion and after surgery by the surgeon. Information from the hospital charts is used to&#xD;
      record age, gender, unilateral or bilateral involvement and other pathologies. Baseline&#xD;
      characteristics are registered using standardized questions including data on BMI, duration&#xD;
      of pain and intake of analgesia. Pain is afterwards measured on 100 mm visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) resting in sitting and lying, and furthermore registered on a pain drawing. Preferred&#xD;
      physical activity and hours spend on primary and overall physical activity is registered&#xD;
      using standardized questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography is carried out first with an ultrasound scanner (Noblus, Hitachi-Aloka&#xD;
      Medical, Zug, Switzerland) using an 18 Megahertz (MHz) linear transducer.Then the&#xD;
      standardized examination protocol of abnormal clinical entities is carried out. Examination&#xD;
      of pain at the conjoint tendon, presence of lumbar and thoracic back pathology, examination&#xD;
      of intra-articular pathology and evaluation of internal snapping hip follow this. The hip&#xD;
      muscle strength is then carried out, and finally the physical activity sensor is attached,&#xD;
      and the patients are informed on how to monitor duration of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year postoperative the following examination is carried out in the listed order: HAGOS,&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, pain on a VAS scale, pain on a pain drawing, hours of physical&#xD;
      activity, ultrasonography, abnormal clinical entities, pain at the conjoint tendon, presence&#xD;
      of lumbar and thoracic back pathology, examination of intra-articular pathology, evaluation&#xD;
      of internal snapping hip, hip muscle strength. Finally the physical activity sensor is&#xD;
      attached and the patient informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stata 11 is used for statistic calculations, and results are presented as significant if&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a descriptive study aiming to describe musculotendinous pathology in&#xD;
      patients with hip dysplasia. This means that a power calculation is not feasible. On an&#xD;
      annual basis approximately 140 periacetabular osteotomies is carried out on Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowing a lack of participation of 25 % it seems possible to include 100 patients during a&#xD;
      period of one year. Based on this, a convenience sample of 100 patients is included to&#xD;
      describe musculotendinous pathology in patients with hip dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was presented to the local research ethics the 14th of January 2014. The Committee&#xD;
      waived the request of ethic approval, since the study according to Danish law does not&#xD;
      require approval owing the observational design (Request 5/2014). All participants provided&#xD;
      written consent prior to inclusion, and approval has been obtained from the Danish Data&#xD;
      Protection Agency (Reference number: 1-16-02-47-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy and publicising&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial support will be applied to internal and external funds. Both positive and negative&#xD;
      results will be published in international journals and presented at conferences.&#xD;
