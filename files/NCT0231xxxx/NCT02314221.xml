      The primary objective of this study is to achieve successful walking skills using exoskeletal&#xD;
      walking devices over the course of 36 sessions in 3 months at specific velocities and&#xD;
      distances in people with chronic SCI who are wheelchair dependent for community mobility. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine if this amount of exoskeletal walking is effective in&#xD;
      improving bowel function and body composition in the same patient population. The exploratory&#xD;
      objectives are to address additional questions concerning the retention or non-retention of&#xD;
      the positive changes, the effects of the increased physical activity from this intervention&#xD;
      on vagal tone, orthostatic tolerance, lipid profile, total testosterone, estradiol levels,&#xD;
      and quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be performed using a crossover design and&#xD;
      employing an exoskeletal-assisted walking intervention. The experimental arm will be compared&#xD;
      to a usual activities (UA) arm, as the control, in 64 persons with chronic SCI (&gt;6 month post&#xD;
      injury) who are wheelchair-dependent for outdoor mobility in the community. The WALK arm will&#xD;
      consist of supervised exoskeletal-assisted walking training, three sessions per week (4-6&#xD;
      h/week) for 36 sessions for their second 12-week period. The UA arm will consist of&#xD;
      identification of usual activities for each participant, encouragement to continue with these&#xD;
      activities and attention by study team members throughout the 12-week UA arm. These&#xD;
      activities will be recorded in a weekly log. The investigators hypotheses are that 1) this&#xD;
      exoskeletal intervention will be successful in training ambulatory skills in this patient&#xD;
      population, 2) the exoskeletal intervention will be better than a control group in improving&#xD;
      body composition, bowel function, metabolic parameters and quality of life in the same&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      Study Design Research design: A Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be performed&#xD;
      using a crossover design and employing an exoskeletal-assisted walking intervention. The&#xD;
      experimental arm will be compared to a usual activities (UA) arm, as the control, in 64&#xD;
      persons with chronic SCI (&gt;6 month post injury) who are wheelchair-dependent for outdoor&#xD;
      mobility in the community. Eligible participants will be randomized (within site) to one of&#xD;
      two groups for 12 weeks (three months): Group 1 (n=32) will receive exoskeletal-assisted&#xD;
      walking (WALK) first for 12 weeks then crossover UA for a second 12 weeks; Group 2 (n=32)&#xD;
      will receive UA first for 12 weeks then cross-over to the WALK arm for 12 weeks of training.&#xD;
      The WALK arm will consist of supervised exoskeletal-assisted walking training, three sessions&#xD;
      per week (4-6 h/week) for 36 sessions for their second 12-week period. The UA arm will&#xD;
      consist of identification of usual activities for each participant, encouragement to continue&#xD;
      with these activities and attention by study team members throughout the 12-week UA arm.&#xD;
      These activities will be recorded in a weekly log. A fixed answer format will be used to&#xD;
      capture this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for intervention to be studied: This research design has several advantages. Group&#xD;
      1 will serve as the intervention follow-up to assess retention or non-retention of change due&#xD;
      to the intervention on the outcome variables. Group 2 will serve as a lead-in to assess&#xD;
      stability of the outcome variables prior to the intervention. Additionally, because of&#xD;
      tremendous variability in the SCI population and difficulty with case-control matching, the&#xD;
      cross-over design will help to control for variability between participants because each&#xD;
      participant will serve as their own control. Veterans and nonveterans with SCI generally do&#xD;
      not receive further structured rehabilitation once they have completed the acute and&#xD;
      sub-acute phases of their rehabilitation. As such, the usual lifestyle activities have been&#xD;
      chosen as the control for this study. Dr. Spungen has discussed the optimal control for an&#xD;
      exoskeletal-assisted walking program. She has consulted with the Chiefs of several SCI&#xD;
      Services in both the VA and non-VA rehabilitation hospitals. A case-controlled, matched RCT&#xD;
      study would be strongest with two interventions: exoskeletal-assisted walking compared with&#xD;
      any other form of physical activity such as robotically assisted body weight supported&#xD;
      treadmill training (Lokomat), body weight supported treadmill training, arm ergometry etc.&#xD;
      However, there are two considerations that make this type of study not feasible. One is that&#xD;
      it would be extremely difficult to case-control match for independent variables within site,&#xD;
      and the second is that most participants would likely not agree to participate if there was a&#xD;
      50% chance they would not get the exoskeletal-assisted walking arm. In order to control for&#xD;
      an attention effect, participants in the UA arm will keep weekly activity logs and be&#xD;
      contacted by phone calls from the study team to receive attention and encouragement to&#xD;
      continue participation in the UA of their choice. In order to control for attention aspects&#xD;
      of this type of study, participants will also make in person twice monthly visits to their&#xD;
      sites during the UA arm. During these visits, study team staff will review their UA logs and&#xD;
      administers the 10Q BFS and BSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the achievement of improved secondary medical outcomes is likely dependent on the&#xD;
      ability to walk in the exoskeletons, the primary outcome will be achievement of mobility&#xD;
      skills in the exoskeletal devices. It has not been demonstrated in a large sample that people&#xD;
      with SCI can use the device as described by the pilot data. Secondary outcomes will be change&#xD;
      in fat mass and bowel function. Exploratory outcomes will be change in cardiovascular and&#xD;
      autonomic measures and quality of life surveys [using the newly validated SCI quality of life&#xD;
      (SCI-QOL) tool for bowel, bladder and five emotional domains]21,50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of walking in the ReWalk: The ReWalk exoskeletal system requires the user to&#xD;
      actively shift their body appropriately over their legs in order to maintain balance on the&#xD;
      stance leg allowing the swing leg to clear the floor. This is accomplished with coordinated&#xD;
      movements involving the upper extremity muscles in the trunk, arms, shoulder, back, neck, and&#xD;
      head for the body to maintain balance dynamically as the system assists the legs to move in a&#xD;
      normal walking pattern. Balance is maintained with the use of Loftstrand crutches. A mode&#xD;
      selector, which is worn on the wrist, is used to select &quot;walk mode&quot; once the person is stable&#xD;
      during standing. Following walk mode selection, the user shifts onto the left leg and&#xD;
      slightly forward so that the right leg is offloaded. The tilting/leaning action triggers the&#xD;
      device to swing the right leg forward and the user weight shifts so that their trunk is over&#xD;
      the right leg as they step onto the right foot. This will then initiate the left leg to swing&#xD;
      forward; the use weight shifts onto it and continuous walking is achieved if this coordinated&#xD;
      weight shifting and stepping onto each leg is continued. The unit will stop walking in two&#xD;
      ways. If the user does not shift their weight onto the front foot, then the ReWalk will time&#xD;
      out after two seconds and return to the standing position. The second way is if the person&#xD;
      does not shift their weight appropriately to have the swing leg clear the floor. This will&#xD;
      cause the leg to have some additional external force that the ReWalk will sense and cause the&#xD;
      system to return to standing mode. The stepping and walking gait pattern of the ReWalk is&#xD;
      very similar to normal walking51. The gait pattern settings in the ReWalk can be preset in&#xD;
      order to increase or decrease the step length, speed of the step and/or the amount of foot&#xD;
      clearance the person will have during walking, permitting a velocity of 0.10 to 0.80 m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to successfully accomplish walking with the ReWalk, considerable coordination&#xD;
      between the upper extremity muscles in the trunk, arms, shoulder, back, neck, and head is&#xD;
      needed in conjunction with dynamic standing balance. A specific pattern of trunk positioning,&#xD;
      crutch placement and weight shifting is needed. To prepare for walking, the user must attain&#xD;
      a stable standing position with the crutches placed slightly in front of him/her. To begin&#xD;
      walking, the user must shift their weight onto the left foot to unweight the right foot. The&#xD;
      right foot steps forward first, and this is initiated when the user slightly leans forward,&#xD;
      by bringing the crutches forward, away from the stepping leg to allow it to swing forward and&#xD;
      clear the floor. As the stepping leg moves forward and extends toward the ground, the user&#xD;
      shifts weight forward, stepping onto that leg and then sequentially brings the crutches&#xD;
      forward for the next step. Immediately after the weight is shifted, the user must straighten&#xD;
      his/her posture with their body perpendicular to the ground before leaning forward to&#xD;
      initiate the next step. This is similar to a normal walking pattern. As the leg contralateral&#xD;
      to the initial step leg swings forward, the participant must shift the crutches away from&#xD;
      that leg to allow it to step forward. This process is repeated for continued walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of walking in the Ekso: The users are progressed through a series of steps to&#xD;
      participate in over ground ambulation. The first method, called FirstStep. This is when the&#xD;
      trainer triggers the step by using a controller while verbally cueing the participant that&#xD;
      the device is taking a step. The second method, called ActiveStep is when the user to&#xD;
      initiates the stepping action by pressing a button on a pair of instrumented crutches for&#xD;
      each step. The last method, called ProStep, is when the user shifts their weight lateral and&#xD;
      forward onto the front foot, until sensors indicate when an appropriate shift has been&#xD;
      performed. The stepping pattern can be adjusted to change the step time and step length. The&#xD;
      trajectory of the foot allows for foot clearance similar to a marching pattern. The device&#xD;
      has the ability for provide some abduction and plantar/dorsi flexion positioning. This device&#xD;
      has the ability to alter the stepping, which would allow the user to take faster or slower&#xD;
      steps with a longer or shorter stride length, thus permitting a walking velocity of 0.10 to&#xD;
      0.45 m/s. Stopping is achieved by holding a stationary position and by not activating&#xD;
      sensors. The Ekso allows for varying robot-assist levels that can be decrease or increased&#xD;
      bilaterally. The robot assistance can operate will full or variable assist, dependent on the&#xD;
      level of function of the individual.&#xD;
