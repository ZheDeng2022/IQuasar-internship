    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study of lofexidine in 8 adult&#xD;
      subjects with ESRD maintained on hemodialysis (3 times per week) and 8 control subjects with&#xD;
      normal renal function (creatinine [Cr] clearance &gt;90 mL/min), recruited as 1:1 matches to&#xD;
      each ESRD subject, matched for gender, age (±10 years), and body mass index (BMI) (±15%).&#xD;
      Normal renal function and ESRD subjects will be confined to an inpatient facility from the&#xD;
      day before dosing to 144 or 156 hours after dosing, respectively, for a total of 7 8 nights&#xD;
      and 8-9 days of inpatient confinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who successfully complete screening will report to the inpatient facility at an&#xD;
      appropriate time the day before study drug administration to undergo pre-dosing study&#xD;
      procedures (Day 1). The next morning (Day 1), all subjects will receive breakfast&#xD;
      (approximately 6 hours before planned lofexidine dosing) and then ESRD subjects will begin&#xD;
      their hemodialysis session. All subjects will receive a single, oral dose of 400 µg&#xD;
      lofexidine HCl (two 200 µg tablets), dosed with 240 mL of water, the clock time for which&#xD;
      will be approximately the same for both normal renal function subjects and ESRD subjects.&#xD;
      Because ESRD subjects will be maintained on 3 times per week dialysis, lofexidine will be&#xD;
      administered near the beginning of a 3-day between-dialysis interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fingerprick blood samples for subjects with normal renal function will be collected for PK&#xD;
      analysis at multiple time points over the next 144 hours. Fingerprick blood samples for ESRD&#xD;
      subjects will be collected for PK analysis at multiple time points over the next 156 hours.&#xD;
      Fingerprick blood samples (0.5 mL each) will be collected in BD Microtainer pink top K2EDTA&#xD;
      tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) venous blood samples (4-6 mL each in K2EDTA tubes) will be collected from each&#xD;
      subject for lofexidine protein binding analysis, one sample collected 0-60 minutes before&#xD;
      dosing and one sample collected 4 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pooled urine samples for subjects with normal renal function will be collected at 0 3 hours,&#xD;
      3 6 hours, 6 12 hours, 12 24 hours, 24 48 hours, 48 72 hours, 72 96 hours, and 96 144 hours&#xD;
      post-dose. Pooled urine samples will be collected from ESRD subjects as available according&#xD;
      to the same schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial and venous blood samples from the arterial-venous (A-V) shunt (0.5 mL in BD&#xD;
      Microtainer pink top K2EDTA tubes) for PK analysis will be collected from ESRD subjects at&#xD;
      0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 hours into each of the two 4 hour hemodialysis sessions. Additionally,&#xD;
      fingerprick blood samples (0.5 mL) will be collected from the hand contralateral to the arm&#xD;
      used for the dialysis A V shunt at each of these specified time points. Dialysate from ESRD&#xD;
      subjects will be collected during the two 4 hour hemodialysis sessions at 0 1 hour, 1 2 hour,&#xD;
      2 3 hour, and 3 4 hour. Two 10 mL samples from each of the 1-hour pooled dialysate&#xD;
      collections will be aliquoted into suitable collection tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events (AEs), measuring vital signs (blood&#xD;
      pressure and pulse rate) and clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and&#xD;
      urinalysis), recording 12 lead safety and Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs), and performing&#xD;
      physical exams.&#xD;
