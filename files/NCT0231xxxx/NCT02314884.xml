      A Phase I, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate safety, tolerability of cafusertib in Chinese patients with Advanced Solid&#xD;
      Tumors that are not eligible for conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of cafusertib&#xD;
      will be escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of cafusertib in advanced cancer patients. At the same time, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics and preliminary efficacy of cafusertib will be observed in advanced cancer&#xD;
      patients. To determine the recommended dosage regimen for phase II.&#xD;
