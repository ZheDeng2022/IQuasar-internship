    <textblock>
      This is an open label interventional study using an implantable vagus nerve stimulation&#xD;
      device in patients with Crohn's disease who have active disease despite treatment with a&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist drug.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, multicenter study of the safety, biological activity and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of an active implantable VNS device in patients with active refractory CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will sign informed consent prior to screening and will undergo all screening and&#xD;
      baseline assessment procedures including endoscopy and endoscopic biopsy prior to planned VNS&#xD;
      implantation date. Those who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be considered enrolled and will be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a minimum of 14 days following the implantation, patients will have their first&#xD;
      in-clinic visit (Week 0 Visit), during which they will begin self-delivered once-daily&#xD;
      stimulation using the VNS device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for weekly visits between Weeks 1-4, at which time outcomes and safety&#xD;
      assessments will be taken. At each visit between weeks 1 and 4, an attempt will be made to&#xD;
      increase the output current to the maximum level tolerated. At the Week 4 Visit, another&#xD;
      attempt to increase the output current will be made and the daily stimulation time will in&#xD;
      addition be incremented by 60 seconds to 2 minutes total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Week 6 Visit safety and outcomes assessments will be taken and another attempt to&#xD;
      increase the output current will be made, and the daily stimulation time will in addition be&#xD;
      incremented to 5 minutes total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return at Week 8, at which time safety and outcomes assessments will be taken.&#xD;
      If the patient has not achieved a clinical remission by CDAI, the frequency of stimulations&#xD;
      will increase from once daily to 4 times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12, the patient will return for safety and outcomes assessments. The final study&#xD;
      visit will be at the Week 16 Visit, at which time patients will have final primary endpoint&#xD;
      safety and outcomes assessments, including a follow-up endoscopy with endoscopic biopsy. If&#xD;
      patients terminate the study prior to week 16, every effort will be made to perform all Week&#xD;
      16 Visit procedures during an Early Termination Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete the study will have the option to enroll in a long-term extension&#xD;
      study. If they do not wish to participate in the extension study they can opt to either have&#xD;
      their device permanently inactivated and left in place or have the device surgically&#xD;
      explanted.&#xD;
