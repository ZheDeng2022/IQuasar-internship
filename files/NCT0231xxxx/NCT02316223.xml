  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 3-arm, patient-randomized trial among Latino and African-American older adults with&#xD;
      poorly-controlled asthma will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of clinic-based vs.&#xD;
      home-based asthma care coordination / self-management support (CC/SMS) vs. usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older asthmatics experience worse outcomes than younger adults, especially if they identify&#xD;
      as Latino or African-American. Several factors contribute to worse outcomes in these&#xD;
      populations including frailty, cognitive impairment, managing multiple chronic diseases and&#xD;
      multiple daily medications, low health literacy and English proficiency, high healthcare&#xD;
      costs, and misunderstandings about asthma. To our knowledge, there are no programs designed&#xD;
      to help older asthmatics manage their illness. In order to address these factors two emerging&#xD;
      patient-centered strategies, clinic- and home-based care coordination and self-management&#xD;
      support led by an Asthma Care Coach (ACC) and a community health worker (CHW), respectively,&#xD;
      will be tested. These strategies will be combined a clinician-centered strategy, use of&#xD;
      electronic medical record (EMR)-based asthma decision support that guides medication&#xD;
      prescribing, basic counseling, and provision of asthma action plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effectiveness of (1) ACC/clinic- or (2) CHW/home-based asthma care&#xD;
           coordination and self-management support with (3) no care coordination/self-management&#xD;
           support (usual care) for improving asthma-related outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify subsets of individuals who have greater benefit from home-based care&#xD;
           coordination and self-management support compared to clinic-based support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3-arm, randomized trial will be conducted among 450 adult asthmatics ages 60 and older at&#xD;
      primary care practices in East and Central Harlem and the South Bronx. All patients,&#xD;
      regardless of assignment, will receive care from primary care providers (PCP) with access to&#xD;
      the EMR-based asthma decision support. Patients in the ACC and CHW arms will be assessed for&#xD;
      barriers to asthma control and will receive support specifically tailored to the identified&#xD;
      barriers, including those arising from physical, mental, social/economic, or cognitive&#xD;
      issues. Program participation will be 12 months, during which the ACCs and CHWs will also&#xD;
      work with the patients' PCPs to optimize care. The study team will engage stakeholders&#xD;
      (patients and caregivers, clinicians, community-based organizations, others) to develop and&#xD;
      prepare study materials and protocols. In addition to studying patient outcomes, the process&#xD;
      of implementing these models of care will be evaluated and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the ACC and CHW arms will have similar asthma outcomes (asthma control, quality&#xD;
      of life, use of urgent care, appointment keeping, medication adherence, use of asthma actions&#xD;
      plans). Compared to usual care, patients in the ACC and CHW arms will perform better on these&#xD;
      outcomes. Patients with more severe asthma and those at greater risk of missed clinic&#xD;
      appointments because of physical or cognitive impairment and psychosocial issues (e.g.,&#xD;
      substance abuse, mental illness) will be more likely to benefit from the CHW/home-based&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The Asthma Control Test™ is a quick test for people with asthma 12 years and older. The ACT is a 5 items, with 4-week recall (on symptoms and daily functioning) patient self-administered tool for identifying those with poorly controlled asthma. Each items is scored on a 5-point scale (for symptoms and activities: 1=all the time to 5= not at all; for asthma control rating: 1=not controlled at all to 5=completely controlled), The total scores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control.&#xD;
It provides a numerical score to help assess asthma control at 12 months compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>The SAMBA program will be led by an asthma care coach (ACC) and the home program by a community health worker (CHW). All interventions, including usual care, will include EMR-based asthma self-management and decision support tools for clinicians in all practice sites. The ACC and CHW will provide education, goal setting, and general self-management support with assigned patients and coordinate with PCPs through in-person and phone contacts over 12 months. Outcomes will be measured through interviews, EMR chart abstractions, and from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) dataset to identify all ED visits and hospitalizations to any New York State facility.</description>

        <title>Change in Asthma Control Test (ACT)</title>
        <description>The Asthma Control Test™ is a quick test for people with asthma 12 years and older. The ACT is a 5 items, with 4-week recall (on symptoms and daily functioning) patient self-administered tool for identifying those with poorly controlled asthma. Each items is scored on a 5-point scale (for symptoms and activities: 1=all the time to 5= not at all; for asthma control rating: 1=not controlled at all to 5=completely controlled), The total scores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control.&#xD;
It provides a numerical score to help assess asthma control at 12 months compared to baseline.</description>
