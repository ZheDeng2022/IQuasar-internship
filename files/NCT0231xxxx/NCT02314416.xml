      Wounds are a widespread problem all around the world. From a practical purpose, wounds are&#xD;
      divided in acute and chronic. Acute wound management depends on amount and type of tissue&#xD;
      destruction. Therefore, acute wounds could be furthermore subdivided as simple wound where&#xD;
      only skin is missing and complex wounds when some underlying structures are involved. Complex&#xD;
      wounds may require free flap if wound beds are poorly vascularized, devascularized or&#xD;
      underlying tissue wouldn't accept skin graft or biologically derived extracellular matrix&#xD;
      (BDEM). Simple wounds, on other hand, would be managed in the past by skin graft or by local&#xD;
      flap when feasible. These management strategies commonly result in unacceptable aesthetically&#xD;
      and/or functionally (e.g. contracture, unstable wound) outcomes and will often require&#xD;
      secondary reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second class of wounds is the chronic wounds. Chronic wounds occur whenever the normally&#xD;
      well-orchestrated reparative process does not proceed in a sequential and timely fashion from&#xD;
      hemostasis and inflammation, through proliferation to remodeling. The process is necessarily&#xD;
      complicated and can be delayed by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors along the way (1).&#xD;
      Acute and chronic wounds pose a significant burden to patients, healthcare professionals, and&#xD;
      the healthcare system, affecting more than 15.5 million patients and costing an estimated $&#xD;
      500 billion annually (2-3). Based on their pathogenesis, there are four principle types of&#xD;
      chronic wounds: venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, arterial ischemic and pressure ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Venous ulcers usually occur in the legs, account for the majority of wounds, and often&#xD;
           affecting the elderly with prior history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Ulcers form&#xD;
           eventually, when cells cannot keep with rate of degradation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetic ulcers are seen in diabetic patients who are developing ulcers for several&#xD;
           reasons. Neuropathy and micro-angiopathy are quite common, and these changes together&#xD;
           with a reduced immunity set up the perfect storm for tissue breakdown in the lower&#xD;
           extremities. Because of all these factors, exacerbated by impaired healing, even the&#xD;
           smallest cuts or bruises can become dangerously infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PAD, is a term that covers an array of medical problems caused by obstruction of the&#xD;
           large arteries in the arms or legs. In the advanced form of PAD, critical limb ischemia&#xD;
           (CLI) can occur, which is a leading cause of lower limb amputations. The Angiogenesis&#xD;
           Foundation estimates that 1.4 million people in the United States have CLI, with an&#xD;
           estimated 350,876 new cases diagnosed each year (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pressure ulcers comprise the fourth major type of wounds. These typically occur in&#xD;
           people who are bedridden or whose mobility is severely limited. They are caused by a&#xD;
           loss of blood circulation that occurs when pressure on the tissue is greater than the&#xD;
           perfusion pressure in capillaries, thereby cutting off circulation, rendering tissue&#xD;
           ischemic. The combination of anesthesia and paralysis is a potent inducer of tissue&#xD;
           break down. Data from spinal cord units at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers show an&#xD;
           alarmingly high prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers in young soldiers paralyzed&#xD;
           by spinal cord injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decades, little improvement has been made in reducing morbidity and disability&#xD;
      from chronic wounds (3). The best available treatment for chronic wounds achieves only a 50%&#xD;
      healing rate that is often temporary, with an unacceptably high recurrence rate. Among the&#xD;
      many factors contributing to &quot;stalling&quot; of wound healing processes, impairment in the&#xD;
      production of cytokines by local inflammatory cells and fibroblasts and reduced angiogenesis&#xD;
      are crucial problems (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of BDEMs has improved wound care significantly over the years. The most&#xD;
      commonly used BDEM is a bovine derived collagen matrix. This bovine collagen matrix is a FDA&#xD;
      approved wound care device comprised of a porous matrix of cross-linked bovine tendon&#xD;
      collagen and glycosaminoglycan and a semi-permeable polysiloxane (silicone layer). The&#xD;
      collagen-glycosaminoglycan biodegradable matrix provides a scaffold for cellular invasion and&#xD;
      capillary growth (5). The use of the bovine collagen matrix can improve aesthetic and&#xD;
      functional outcomes in complex wounds with full thickness skin defects and exposure of&#xD;
      underlying structure such as muscle, tendons, vessels or nerves. Despite its clinical&#xD;
      benefit, a significant problem exists due to the long period required for vascularization and&#xD;
      regeneration, which requires 3 weeks as per the manufacturer. As a result, this not only&#xD;
      increases the cost of wound management but also decreases income potential and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As research is being advanced in the field of wound care, stem cell therapy is emerging to be&#xD;
      a promising approach to the treatment of both acute and chronic wounds. It is now known that&#xD;
      bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC) are multipotential stem cells capable of&#xD;
      differentiation into numerous cell types including fibroblast, muscle, brain, and cartilage&#xD;
      (6). Among the cells found in BMSCs is a group called mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). MSCs are&#xD;
      stromal cells that have been held in reserve with the ability to self-renew and also exhibit&#xD;
      multilineage differentiation. MSCs are also found in fetal and adult tissues and have been&#xD;
      isolated from umbilical cord, endometrial polyps, adipose tissue, and menstrual blood.&#xD;
      Because they are readily available to harvest from various tissues, MSCs are an attractive&#xD;
      choice in experimental and possible clinical applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical observations and small sample size studies report accelerated healing in&#xD;
      difficult wounds by topical and regional applications of mononuclear cell preparations from&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow. In the rat model, the application of systemic and local BMSCs have&#xD;
      has resulted in improved wound healing through increased wound tensile strength, increased&#xD;
      collagen, and faster wound maturation (7). However, bone marrow harvesting is painful, at&#xD;
      times requires general anesthesia, and occasionally not feasible due to the debilitated state&#xD;
      of the patients. It is thus, extremely desirable to use off-the-shelf, commercially&#xD;
      available, allogeneic, mesenchymal stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NuCel (NutechMedical, Birmingham, AL USA) is a FDA approved allograft containing MSCs derived&#xD;
      from human amnion and amniotic fluid and is currently being used in different clinical&#xD;
      settings including orthopedic surgery and in neurosurgery as grafts. Amnion-derived MSCs have&#xD;
      been reported to have high trans-differentiation and angio-vasculogenic properties (8). NuCel&#xD;
      stem cells are immune privileged as the do not express major histo-compatibility complex&#xD;
      class II and has lower expression of MHC class I compared with adult bone marrow derived stem&#xD;
      cells. NuCel contains five types of collagen and fibronectin which are factors involved in&#xD;
      the wound healing process. Moreover, they are less ethically controversial due to the&#xD;
      abundance of waste placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have shown that pluripotent stem cells can increase and speed up&#xD;
      vascularization of BDEM and significantly decrease the time to BDEM maturation (6-8). As a&#xD;
      result, there is potential for this application to decrease the cost of wound management and&#xD;
      increase quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, we propose to test definitively, the safety and effectiveness of just such&#xD;
      allogeneic MSCs, NuCel, in promoting the healing of acute and chronic wounds. NuCel consists&#xD;
      of a special class of human stem cells that have the ability to express a range of&#xD;
      therapeutically relevant proteins and other factors, as well as form multiple cell types. We&#xD;
      propose a pilot study is to be conducted at the Georgia Regents University. It is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, controlled trial with the aim to generate Level I and II evidence on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of amniotic stem cells using a collagen matrix as a carrier in enhancing&#xD;
      healing of wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal and design of the current proposal is to establish a practical protocol which has&#xD;
      the potential to not only accelerate the translation of advances in knowledge into new&#xD;
      standards of care for wound management, but also is safe, FDA approved, and inexpensively&#xD;
      accessible to address some of the most pressing needs in today's wound healing field. The&#xD;
      main objective of the current proposal is to use amniotic MSC to speed up maturation and&#xD;
      integration of collagen matrix in the wound bed and shorten total time needed for wound&#xD;
      healing. This can potentially result in a saving of hundreds of millions of dollars to the&#xD;
      healthcare system. The outcome of this proposal will accelerate translation of greater&#xD;
      medical capabilities to patients using a novel, safe and creative intervention.&#xD;
