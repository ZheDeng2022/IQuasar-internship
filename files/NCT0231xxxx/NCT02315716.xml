      The Cardamon trial is a phase 2 trial using the standard chemotherapy drugs cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and dexamethasone in combination with a new drug called Carfilzomib in patients with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma is a cancer of the bone marrow and, for those patients that are young and&#xD;
      fit enough, the disease is usually treated with chemotherapy (sometimes called induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy) followed by a stem cell transplant using the patient's own stem cells&#xD;
      (autograft or Autologous Stem Cell Transplant). Unfortunately almost all patients will&#xD;
      experience a relapse at some point following this treatment. After relapse there are a number&#xD;
      of treatment options but eventually the disease will become resistant to further therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (or Transplant) after initial chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment has been shown in studies to increase the amount of time that patients are without&#xD;
      symptoms of their myeloma before unfortunately their disease relapses. However, recently more&#xD;
      effective induction chemotherapy regimens have been developed and patients treated with these&#xD;
      new regimens are able to achieve higher and deeper responses than those previously treated on&#xD;
      older regimens. Many also achieve complete or very good partial response, which was rare with&#xD;
      the traditional chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the investigators now do not know if giving patients an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant&#xD;
      straight after their initial induction chemotherapy is the best thing to do. It may be that&#xD;
      patients who respond well to a new drug containing regimen will obtain most benefit from&#xD;
      their stem cells if these stem cells are frozen and stored, so that they can be used when&#xD;
      their disease relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Cardamon trial, the investigators will directly compare the outcome of patients who&#xD;
      receive a transplant, versus those patients who do not and who instead receive Consolidation&#xD;
      therapy. After induction treatment and stem cell harvest, patients will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to receive either a transplant or to receive consolidation therapy. Patients in the Cardamon&#xD;
      trial will also be given maintenance treatment. This is treatment that is given on an ongoing&#xD;
      basis, after the transplant or after the Consolidation therapy. The aim of maintenance&#xD;
      treatment is to prolong disease response and delay the time to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary the purpose of the Cardamon study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to confirm the high response rate to a new treatment regime that includes Carfilzomib&#xD;
           plus 2 standard chemotherapy drugs used for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to investigate whether patients who respond well to this new Carfilzomib-containing&#xD;
           induction regimen are able to maintain a long remission period without having an&#xD;
           Autologous Stem Cell Transplant 'up-front', and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to find out if maintenance treatment with Carfilzomib is able to further reduce the&#xD;
           number of remaining myeloma cells in the bone marrow, using the Minimal Residual Disease&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
