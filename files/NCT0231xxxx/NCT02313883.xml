      A Pharmacokinetic Pilot followed by a Phase I/II, Blinded, Randomized, Controlled, Parallel&#xD;
      Arm Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of PerioSept® and Scaling and&#xD;
      Root Planing in Subjects with Periodontitis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will follow an adaptive trial design, whereby information regarding PerioSept(r)&#xD;
      drug levels will be obtained via a PK trial lead in period (PK Pilot) in a limited number of&#xD;
      subjects (up to N=8). This will be followed by the main safety and efficacy trial of&#xD;
      PerioSept(r) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe periodontitis (Main Trial, N=87). The PK Pilot will be an open label PK study. Up to 8&#xD;
      qualifying subjects will receive SRP on Day 1 followed by 3% PerioSept(r) administered in a&#xD;
      minimum of 4 qualifying periodontal Study Pockets in at least 2 quadrants with a probing&#xD;
      pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 5mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) and at least 20 other qualifying&#xD;
      pockets (PPD ≥ 5 mm). The Main Trial will be a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, parallel arm trial of PerioSept(r) (0.3%, 1% or 3%) administered up to three&#xD;
      times (over Days 1 and 2, at Weeks 4 and 12) into a minimum of 4 qualifying periodontal Study&#xD;
      Pockets in at least 2 quadrants with a PPD ≥ 5mm and BOP following SRP at baseline. All other&#xD;
      eligible pockets with a PPD ≥ 5mm will also be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full mouth SRP will be initiated on Day 1 followed by randomized treatment of that side. If&#xD;
      necessary, SRP and randomized treatment may be completed on the other side of the mouth on&#xD;
      Day 2. Treated pockets that still have a PPD ≥ 5mm at the 4 and 12 week visits will be&#xD;
      retreated with SRP or SRP plus placebo or PS, as randomized. Assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      over a 24 week (6 month) period including safety assessments and assessments of dental&#xD;
      parameters (PPD, BOP, Plaque index, Gingival Index, Clinical attachment level).&#xD;
