      To assess the efficacy of the PRP Concepts Fibrin Bio-Matrix and compare its performance with&#xD;
      usual and customary practice for the treatment of chronic non-healing pressure ulcers (PU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multi-center study for subjects&#xD;
      undergoing PU treatment. Qualified subjects will be randomized (1:1); test group (PRP&#xD;
      Concepts Fibrin Bio-Matrix) and control group (usual and customary practice). The study will&#xD;
      consist of 3 periods: a screening period, an active treatment period, and a follow-up period&#xD;
      (if healed). Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be â‰¥18 years of age&#xD;
      with a PU (greater than 4 weeks duration). Each subject will be enrolled in the active&#xD;
      treatment period for up to 12 weeks, or to closure of wound with a confirmatory visit 2 weeks&#xD;
      after wound closure, whether such closure occurs at 12 weeks or earlier.&#xD;
