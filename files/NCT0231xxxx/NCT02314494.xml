  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are above healthy weight are more likely to be ill and to miss time off school.&#xD;
      Being overweight in childhood can also sow the seeds for health problems in later life such&#xD;
      as heart disease and diabetes. Most overweight children become overweight adults. One&#xD;
      solution is to try to prevent children becoming overweight by intervening very early in life.&#xD;
      The risk factors for childhood overweight are known and this project aims to facilitate&#xD;
      parents' (and other carers') understanding about this for their infant and to enable them to&#xD;
      access intervention. UK health visitors (public health nurses) will use an interactive,&#xD;
      multimedia programme (Proactive Assessment of Overweight Risk during infancy (ProAsk)), with&#xD;
      parents to calculate their infant's risk and to discuss strategies for risk reduction as&#xD;
      appropriate. Health visitors will be trained to communicate obesity risk and in Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing techniques to enable them to offer intervention to parents of infants identified&#xD;
      as at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility study of ProAsk will take place in two health provider organisations in the UK.&#xD;
      The purpose of this is to a) determine the acceptability and utility of the ProAsk&#xD;
      intervention with health visitors and parents and b) gather information to inform the trial&#xD;
      design and data collection procedures for a future Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Globally, overweight and obesity is a significant public health issue affecting more than 40&#xD;
      million children under the age of five in 2011. There is broad agreement around the aetiology&#xD;
      of childhood overweight and obesity and risk factors have been identified prenatally, during&#xD;
      pregnancy and early infancy. Clearly, from the point of view of the infant, risk factors that&#xD;
      are present prenatally or during pregnancy are non-modifiable but those identified during&#xD;
      infancy are potentially modifiable. Between 25%-33% of infants gain weight more rapidly than&#xD;
      desirable during the first 6 months of life and this is the strongest risk factor for&#xD;
      childhood overweight at 3 years. Rapid weight gain is potentially modifiable with&#xD;
      interventions to facilitate better infant diet, feeding practices and exposure to physical&#xD;
      activity. To facilitate identification of infants that might be at greater risk of developing&#xD;
      childhood overweight and obesity a number of models have been developed. The Infant Risk of&#xD;
      Obesity Checklist (IROC) was developed by the research team using data from the Millennium&#xD;
      Cohort Study (MCS) and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to&#xD;
      potentially screen infants at 4 months of age for risk factors for childhood overweight and&#xD;
      obesity at 3 years. However, it has not yet been tested in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns have been expressed about using tools developed from the epidemiological literature&#xD;
      to identify overweight and obesity risk where there are few effective evidence-based&#xD;
      interventions for those affected. There is evidence that complex interventions targeting diet&#xD;
      and feeding delivered to parents of infants &lt;2 years old show some positive intervention&#xD;
      effects on feeding practices and physical activity, although many of these interventions do&#xD;
      not tackle the psycho-emotional aspects of feeding and are not underpinned by behavioural&#xD;
      change theory. The impact on weight outcomes is less certain, and in some cases this may be&#xD;
      due to intervention components and behaviour change techniques targeted at the parent rather&#xD;
      than infant level. Universal eligibility for overweight and obesity prevention is costly and&#xD;
      may be unnecessary for those with a low baseline risk. However, targeting of certain groups&#xD;
      where overweight and obesity is more prevalent (for example, lower socio-economic status,&#xD;
      minority ethnic groups) has raised concerns around stigmatisation. Preliminary work with&#xD;
      parents/legal guardians/carers suggests that targeting may be appropriate provided the person&#xD;
      conveying the information has appropriate knowledge and sensitivity. his suggests a novel&#xD;
      approach to such discussions is needed. Digital technologies are being used to provide&#xD;
      information to patients about health care related areas. The findings of a recent review&#xD;
      suggest that interactive multimedia programmes have the capacity to facilitate communication&#xD;
      between health professionals and patients, but further research in this field is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pragmatic research design is planned with three linked phases. The first involved the&#xD;
      development of an interactive multimedia programme, namely ProActive Assessment of Overweight&#xD;
      Risk during Infancy (ProAsk) which includes the IROC and a therapeutic wheel, to facilitate&#xD;
      health professionals' discussions with parents/legal guardians/carers about overweight risk&#xD;
      and prevention during infancy. This phase is a feasibility study of the ProAsk intervention&#xD;
      with parents/legal guardians/carers and health professionals. The study will gather&#xD;
      information to inform the trial design and data collection procedures for a Randomised&#xD;
      Controlled Trial (RCT) of overweight risk identification and intervention during infancy by&#xD;
      UK health visiting teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third phase will be conducted at the end of the feasibility trial .Qualitative work will&#xD;
      be undertaken to determine the acceptability and utility of ProAsk with the health&#xD;
      professionals working in a health visiting team and parents/legal guardians/carers.&#xD;
