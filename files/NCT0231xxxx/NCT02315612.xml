  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One type of cancer therapy takes blood cells from a person, changes them in a lab, then&#xD;
      gives the cells back to the person. In this study, researchers are using an anti-CD22 gene, a&#xD;
      virus, and an immune receptor to change the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if giving anti-CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) cells to young people with&#xD;
      certain cancers is safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People ages 1-39 with a leukemia or lymphoma that has not been cured by standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened to ensure their cancer cells express the CD22 protein.&#xD;
           They will also have medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests, heart tests,&#xD;
           scans, and x-rays. They may give spinal fluid or have bone marrow tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have eye and neurologic exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get a central venous catheter or a catheter in a large vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have white blood cells removed. Blood is removed through a needle in&#xD;
           an arm. White blood cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned by needle in&#xD;
           the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cells will be changed in a laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get two IV chemotherapy drugs over 4 days. Some will stay in the&#xD;
           hospital for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be in the hospital to get anti-CD22 CAR cells through IV. They&#xD;
           will stay until any bad side effects are gone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have many blood tests. They may repeat some screening exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have monthly visits for 2-3 months, then every 3-6 months. They may&#xD;
           repeat some screening exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have follow-up for 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adoptive cellular therapy with T cells genetically modified using viral-based vectors to&#xD;
           express chimeric antigen receptors targeting the CD19 molecule have demonstrated&#xD;
           dramatic clinical responses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
           However, not all patients respond and CD19-negative escape has been observed following&#xD;
           CD19 CAR therapy, as well as anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody therapy. Thus, additional&#xD;
           targets are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD22 is a B-lineage-restricted, transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein of the Ig superfamily&#xD;
           that is widely expressed on B-cell malignancies including 96% to 100% of pediatric&#xD;
           Bprecursor ALL. Therefore, CD22 represents a promising target. Encouraging responses&#xD;
           targeting CD22 with an antibody based immunoconjugate have been seen in patients,&#xD;
           including children, with recurrent and refractory ALL. This will be the first in human&#xD;
           testing of anti-CD22 CAR adoptive cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of producing anti-CD22 CAR cells meeting established&#xD;
           release criteria. Complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-CD22-CAR engineered T&#xD;
           cells in children and young adults with recurrent or refractory CD22- expressing B cell&#xD;
           malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients 3-39 years of age, at least 14.5 kg, with CD22-expressing B-cell malignancies that&#xD;
      have recurred after or not responded to one or more standard regimens and deemed incurable by&#xD;
      standard therapy. Patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation (SCT)&#xD;
      who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate. Patients previously treated&#xD;
      with anti-CD19 CAR engineered T cells are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis, CD3+ cells enriched and cultured in the presence&#xD;
           of anti-CD3/-CD28 beads followed by lentiviral vector supernatant containing the&#xD;
           anti-CD22 (M971BBz) CAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -4 (cell infusion is Day 0), patients will begin induction chemotherapy&#xD;
           comprising fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on Days -4, -3 and -2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 on&#xD;
           day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CD22-CAR cells will be infused on Day 0, with up to a 72h delay allowed for infusion&#xD;
           of fresh cells or a 7 day delay if cells are cryopreserved, if needed for resolution of&#xD;
           clinical toxicities, to generate adequate cell numbers, or to facilitate scheduling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will be performed using 3 dose levels (3 x 10(5)&#xD;
           transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; and 3 x 10(6) transduced T&#xD;
           cells/kg;). If 2/6 patients have DLT at dose level 1, safety will be evaluated in a&#xD;
           de-escalated dose of 1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg (more or less 20%)). Once the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose (or highest level evaluated) is reached, enrollment into an&#xD;
           expansion cohort of a total of 83 patients at MTD will proceed to provide additional&#xD;
           information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be monitored for toxicity, response and T cell persistence as well as&#xD;
           other biologic correlates.&#xD;
