    <textblock>
      HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), likely due to chronically increased inflammation. Low-dose&#xD;
      methotrexate (LDMTX) may reduce CVD risk in people with rheumatoid arthritis, who like those&#xD;
      with HIV, have increased levels of inflammation. The NHLBI is funding a clinical trial&#xD;
      targeting the excess inflammation in HIV. That &quot;Parent Study&quot; is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial (NCT01949116) that will assess whether 24-week treatment with LDMTX:&#xD;
      i) is safe, ii) reduces circulating inflammatory biomarkers and levels of immune cell&#xD;
      activation and iii) improves brachial artery reactivity. However, neither the biomarkers nor&#xD;
      endothelial function tests measured as part of the parent study will report on&#xD;
      atherosclerotic inflammation, (the desired pathobiological target of LDMTX therapy in HIV).&#xD;
      As such, the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would substantially enhance the&#xD;
      scientific value of the trial. In this imaging sub-study, the overall goal is to determine if&#xD;
      treating virologically suppressed, HIV-infected individuals with LDMTX will reduce&#xD;
      inflammation within the arterial wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This fully integrated ancillary study would, in a subset of patients enrolled in the parent&#xD;
      trial: (i) assess the impact of LDMTX on arterial inflammation, (ii) evaluate mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for arterial inflammation in HIV and iii) explore mechanisms responsible for&#xD;
      actions of LDMTX on the artery wall. Accordingly, the proposed study would provide unique and&#xD;
      highly complementary information that would greatly increase the knowledge and mechanistic&#xD;
      insights gained from Parent Study. The ancillary study has two specific aims1) To determine&#xD;
      the impact of anti-inflammatory treatment with LDMTX on arterial inflammation, as assessed by&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT imaging, in virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals., and 2) To evaluate the&#xD;
      cellular and biochemical basis of the effect of LDMTX therapy on arterial inflammation in&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is associated with a substantially increased risk of CVD that is not fully&#xD;
      accounted for by traditional risk factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that chronic&#xD;
      immune cell activation may be complicit. In support of this concept, we recently used&#xD;
      18F-FDG-PET/CT to demonstrate that HIV-infected individuals have increased arterial&#xD;
      inflammation compared to non-HIV, FRS-matched controls and that the degree of arterial&#xD;
      inflammation is related to markers of monocyte activation. Further, we and others have shown&#xD;
      that increased arterial FDG uptake predicts future CVD events in non-HIV cohorts. Together,&#xD;
      these observations support the concept that targeting arterial inflammation may provide&#xD;
      benefit for HIV infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NHLBI recently provided funding for a clinical trial targeting the excess inflammation in&#xD;
      HIV. The &quot;Parent Study&quot; is being performed as a collaboration with the National Institute of&#xD;
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) AIDS Clinical Trials Group and the NHLBI. That&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will assess whether 24-week treatment with&#xD;
      very low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX): i) is safe, ii) reduces levels of circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers and activated immune cells and iii) improves brachial artery&#xD;
      reactivity (BART). However, neither the biomarkers nor the BART studies measured as part of&#xD;
      Parent Study will report on atherosclerotic inflammation, (the desired pathobiological target&#xD;
      of LDMTX therapy in HIV). As such, the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would&#xD;
      substantially enhance the scientific value of the Parent Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerotic inflammation can be non-invasively and reproducibly measured with FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging, a well-validated quantitative technique that can sensitively detect changes in&#xD;
      atherosclerotic inflammation. FDG-PET/CT imaging has been employed in several multi-center&#xD;
      trials to measure changes in arterial inflammation in response to anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      treatments. Accordingly, we propose a time sensitive ancillary imaging study to determine if&#xD;
      treating virologically suppressed, HIV-infected individuals with LDMTX reduces&#xD;
      atherosclerotic inflammation, assessed by FDG-PET/CT. Our central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      persistent immune cell activation results in chronic arterial inflammation, which&#xD;
      subsequently contributes to the CVD risk observed in HIV. This fully integrated ancillary&#xD;
      study would, in a subset of patients enrolled in the parent trial: (i) assess the impact of&#xD;
      LDMTX on arterial inflammation, and (ii) identify the immune cell subtypes whose changes&#xD;
      (with LDMTX) are associated with changes in arterial inflammation. Accordingly, the proposed&#xD;
      ancillary study would provide unique and highly complementary information that would greatly&#xD;
      increase the knowledge and mechanistic insights gained from the Parent Study. The ancillary&#xD;
      study has two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of anti-inflammatory treatment with LDMTX on arterial&#xD;
      inflammation, as assessed by FDG-PET/CT imaging, in virally suppressed HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals. [Primary and secondary outcomes]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Gap/Need: The parent study does not provide for assessment of the target pathology&#xD;
      (arterial inflammation) hence insights regarding effects of LDMTX treatment on arterial&#xD;
      inflammation are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: LDMTX therapy will reduce arterial inflammation (to a greater extent than&#xD;
      placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test hypothesis 1: We will determine in 91 patients (a subset of the parent study) if&#xD;
      arterial inflammation (measured with PET/CT at 0 and 24 weeks) is reduced by LDMTX (relative&#xD;
      to placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the cellular and biochemical mediators associated with arterial&#xD;
      inflammation in HIV and to explore the potential mechanism of the effect of LDMTX therapy on&#xD;
      arterial inflammation in HIV. [Exploratory outcomes]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Gap/Need: The parent study, on its own, does not provide the tools to directly&#xD;
      evaluate arterial inflammation in HIV. Evaluation of the relationships between circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators and arterial inflammation in the context of this study would yeild&#xD;
      mechanistic insights regarding atherosclerotic disease in HIV and provide a greater&#xD;
      understanding of the effect of LDMTX on arterial inflammation in HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1:At baseline, arterial inflammation is closely associated with measures of&#xD;
      activated immune cells (CD14+/CD16+ monocytes). Additional relationships might be seen&#xD;
      between arterial inflammation and other cellular subsets (e.g. T-cells), inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, and endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Post-treatment changes in arterial inflammation are positively correlated&#xD;
      with changes in measures of activated immune cells (especially activated monocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test these hypotheses: We will evaluate if arterial inflammation (by PET) correlates with&#xD;
      inflammatory cell activation and other measured biomarkers separately. We will then compare&#xD;
      the strength of the associations and test their independence. The evaluation of associations&#xD;
      will be performed: comparing baseline measurements (SA 2.1), and comparing post-randomization&#xD;
      changes (SA2.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that LDMTX therapy will improve arterial inflammation and that this mechanistic,&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study will demonstrate the importance of inflammation and immune activation&#xD;
      in HIV. This would thus form the basis for event-driven trials to evaluate whether&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory strategies reduce CVD risk in individuals with treated HIV infection.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the study has the potential to shift the paradigm in the approach to treating&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals, and potentially in other populations as well.&#xD;

        1. Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1 HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or&#xD;
        chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and&#xD;
        confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the&#xD;
        initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND&#xD;
        studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&#xD;
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test&#xD;
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a&#xD;
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus&#xD;
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.2 Currently on continuous ART for ≥24 weeks prior to study entry. This is defined as&#xD;
        continuous active therapy for the 24-week period prior to study entry with no treatment&#xD;
        interruption longer than 7 consecutive days and a total duration off treatment of no more&#xD;
        than 14 days in the 90 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.3 CD4+ T-cell count ≥400 cells/mm3 obtained within 60 days prior to study entry by any US&#xD;
        laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification or&#xD;
        its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.4 HIV-1 RNA level below the limit of quantification using a FDA-approved assay for at&#xD;
        least 24 weeks prior to study entry and confirmed within 60 days prior to study entry. The&#xD;
        assay used for eligibility can be performed by any US laboratory that has a CLIA&#xD;
        certification or its equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 200&#xD;
        copies/mL are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations are below the&#xD;
        level of quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.5 The following laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to study entry by any US&#xD;
        laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting glucose &lt;180 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)] &lt;2 times upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;150,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.6 Females subjects who are postmenopausal (i.e., of non-childbearing potential), defined&#xD;
        as having either:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Appropriate medical documentation of prior hysterectomy and/or complete bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (i.e., surgical removal of the ovaries, resulting in &quot;surgical menopause&quot;&#xD;
             and occurring at the age at which the procedure was performed), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Permanent cessation of previously occurring menses as a result of ovarian failure with&#xD;
             documentation of hormonal deficiency by a certified healthcare provider (i.e.,&#xD;
             &quot;spontaneous menopause&quot;). Hormonal deficiency should be properly documented in the&#xD;
             case of suspected spontaneous menopause as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If age &gt;54 years and with the absence of normal menses for at least 24&#xD;
                  consecutive months: serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level elevated to&#xD;
                  within the post-menopausal range based on the laboratory reference range where&#xD;
                  the hormonal assay is performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If age ≤ 54 years and with the absence of normal menses for at least 24&#xD;
                  consecutive months: Negative serum or urine (β-HCG) performed within 48 hours&#xD;
                  prior to study entry with concurrently elevated serum FSH level in the&#xD;
                  post-menopausal range, depressed estradiol (E2) level in the post-menopausal&#xD;
                  range, and absent serum progesterone level, based on the laboratory reference&#xD;
                  ranges where the hormonal assays are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.7 Male subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (i.e., active&#xD;
        attempt to impregnate, sperm donation). If participating in sexual activity that could lead&#xD;
        to pregnancy, the male subject must agree to the use of TWO reliable forms of&#xD;
        contraceptives simultaneously while on study and for a minimum of 3 months after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least TWO of the following contraceptives MUST be used appropriately by male subjects&#xD;
        and their female partners:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormone-based contraceptive&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTES: Sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy is not applicable to sexual activity&#xD;
        with an infertile partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acceptable documentation for the use of two methods of contraceptives is the male subject's&#xD;
        report of use of a second form of contraceptive by his female partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.8 Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (defined as women who have been&#xD;
        postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or men who have documented vasectomy) are&#xD;
        eligible for the study without requiring the use of contraceptives. In order to verify lack&#xD;
        of reproductive potential, written documentation or verbal communication by the clinician&#xD;
        or clinician's staff of one of the following must be in the source documents:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physician report/letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Discharge summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement elevated into the menopausal range as&#xD;
             established by the reporting laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTES: Any statement of self-reported sterility or infertility (or that of a partner's)&#xD;
        should be entered into the source document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Females who report being postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months but who do not&#xD;
        have documentation of postmenopausal status from a clinician will have the hormonal&#xD;
        assessments performed prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.9 Moderate or high CVD risk defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) Documented CVD as assessed by meeting at least 1 of 3 criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;

        <title>Change in Arterial FDG Uptake (From Baseline) in the Aorta</title>
        <description>Arterial FDG Uptake provides a measure of inflammation in the artery wall.&#xD;
TBR is target-to-background ratio (a measure of the ratio of the activity in the vessel wall divided by the blood background). A negative number for the change in TBR implies a reduction in activity over time.&#xD;
The entire ascending aorta is used for this analysis.&#xD;
The results are expressed as the change in the median value, of the TBR, from baseline to week 24</description>
