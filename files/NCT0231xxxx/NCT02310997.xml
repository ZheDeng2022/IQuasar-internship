      This trial is looking at using umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors after high dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy. It is for people who have cancer of the bone marrow or lymphatic system&#xD;
      including leukaemia and lymphoma, or a blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is for babies over 4 weeks old, children, and adults up to the age of 45.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During treatment for cancers of the bone marrow or lymphatic system, a lot of the stem cells&#xD;
      are damaged and you may need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant to replace them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells can also be collected from the umbilical cord of newborn babies. Many people&#xD;
      around the world have donated their baby's umbilical cords which are stored safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are usually enough cells in one cord to transplant a small child, but there may not be&#xD;
      enough cells for an older child or adult. Researchers want to see if adults and children can&#xD;
      safely have stem cells from more than 1 umbilical cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before a transplant, you have high doses of chemotherapy, sometimes with radiotherapy. This&#xD;
      intensive conditioning aims to destroy all the cells in your bone marrow, and is called&#xD;
      myeloablative conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to see if a transplant using cord blood cells from unrelated donors&#xD;
      after myeloablative conditioning is safe, and whether it helps people who need a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant but don't have a stem cell donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be able to enter this trial if you:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have leukaemia, lymphoma or another disorder of the bone marrow and treatment with&#xD;
           intensive conditioning followed by a stem cell transplant is likely to help you&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not have a suitable stem cell donor in your family, and your doctors have not been&#xD;
           able to find a matched unrelated donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have satisfactory blood test results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are between 4 weeks and 45 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      You cannot enter this trial if you:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a family member who could donate stem cells to you, or you have a matched unrelated&#xD;
           donor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can have any other treatment that your doctors think will cure your disease or keep it&#xD;
           under control for a long time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have already had a lot of radiotherapy (the trial doctor can advise you about this)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have already had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant using your own cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have chronic myeloid leukaemia that is in chronic phase and is responding to imatinib,&#xD;
           or is in blast phase and is not responding to treatment Have acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
           leukaemia that is not responding to treatment or has come back and more than 5% of your&#xD;
           bone marrow is made up of immature cells (blasts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have acute myeloid leukaemia that is not responding to treatment or has come back and&#xD;
           more than 20% of your bone marrow is made up of immature cells (blasts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a disease that has come back and you are having another type of treatment (salvage&#xD;
           treatment) but your disease is not responding or is getting worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a blood disorder called myelofibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a blood disorder called aplastic anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an infection that cannot be controlled with medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have either the HIV or HTLV virus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 trial aims to recruit 60 people. It will include both adults and children.&#xD;
      Everybody taking part will have intensive conditioning before having a transplant of stem&#xD;
      cells from the umbilical cord blood of at least 1 unrelated donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take part in this trial, the researchers need to be sure that there are 2 lots of cord&#xD;
      blood cells that would be suitable for you. They will only use cells from 2 cords if there is&#xD;
      some concern that they won't get enough cells from 1 umbilical cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged between 2 and 45 (apart from children under the age of 16 who have acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukaemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML) or MDS) will have conditioning with&#xD;
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy to the whole body (total body irradiation).&#xD;
      This takes 9 days all together. On the last day, you have the stem cells through a drip into&#xD;
      a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children under 2 years of age (and children up to the age of 16 who have acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukaemia, JMML or MDS) will have conditioning with busulfan, cyclophosphamide and melphalan.&#xD;
      They do not have radiotherapy. This conditioning takes 10 days all together. They have the&#xD;
      stem cells through a drip into a vein on the 11th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stem cells find their way into your bone marrow where they will start making new blood&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will see the trial team and have some tests before you start treatment. The tests&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart trace (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart ultrasound (echocardiogram) or MUGA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow test When you have your treatment, you will be in hospital for about 4 to 6&#xD;
           weeks. As you will be at a high risk of infection, you will be in your own room. This is&#xD;
           called being in isolation. You have another bone marrow test a month after your&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you go home, you have to go back to the hospital for regular blood tests. This is likely&#xD;
      to be 2 or 3 times a week to begin with. You may have to go back into hospital for a few days&#xD;
      at some point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a transplant, you will see the doctors and have blood tests At least once a week for&#xD;
      the first 3 months At least once a month for the rest of the first year The trial doctors&#xD;
      will follow your progress closely for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main side effect of the treatment you have just before the transplant is a drop in the&#xD;
      number of blood cells, causing an increased risk of infection, tiredness and breathing&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have more information about fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, busulfan and melphalan in our&#xD;
      cancer drugs section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It takes longer for blood cells to start growing again after a transplant of cord blood than&#xD;
      after other types of stem cell transplant. Even when your blood count gets back to normal,&#xD;
      your immune system may take up to 2 years to recover fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this treatment can affect your ability to have children (your fertility). Men&#xD;
      taking part will be offered the option to store sperm (sperm banking) before starting&#xD;
      treatment. Preserving fertility for women is more complicated and it is important that women&#xD;
      talk to their doctors about this before starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After any type of bone marrow or stem cell transplant, there is a risk of graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD). This happens when the new stem cells attack your body tissue. It mainly&#xD;
      affects your skin, gut and liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rarely, the new stem cells fail to start working. This is more common with cord blood&#xD;
      transplants than with other bone marrow transplants. And even if your transplant is&#xD;
      successful, there is a risk your disease may come back. Because of these risks, your doctors&#xD;
      will monitor you very closely after your transplant.&#xD;
