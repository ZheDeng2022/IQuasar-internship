  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a particular type of nerve fibers, A-delta&#xD;
      fibers, can be tested in an Electromyography (EMG) lab on a routine basis. Normal, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin that includes skin cells and small nerve&#xD;
      fibers called A-delta fibers. A-delta fibers send signals to the brain about pin-prick type&#xD;
      of pain and temperature. The investigators want to study whether the investigators can&#xD;
      stimulate A-delta fibers and document this by recording electrical potentials from the nerves&#xD;
      in subjects' limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small piece of plastic will be applied to your foot and your hand. A tiny sharp tip&#xD;
      protrudes from this piece of plastic. You will be barely able to feel this sharp tip when&#xD;
      touching the piece of plastic. This is the electrode for intra-epidermal stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With stimulation, you will feel a pin-prick type of sensation. The stimulus will be adjusted&#xD;
      so that you barely feel the pin-prick type of sensation. The investigators will record&#xD;
      responses of stimulation from nerves in your skin.&#xD;

    <description>A small piece of plastic with a tiny sharp protruding tip (the intra-epidermal stimulation electrode) will be applied to the foot and hand. Small &quot;sticker&quot; electrodes will be placed over nerves on the forearm or ankle. A stimulus will be applied to the electrode for intra-epidermal stimulation. The stimulus will be gradually increased from no stimulus to a stimulus that is barely felt as a pin-prick type of sensation. Thereafter, the stimulus will be applied 5-15 times per second for 10 periods of 40-60 seconds.</description>
