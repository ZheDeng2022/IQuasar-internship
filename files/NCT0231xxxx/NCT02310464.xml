    <description>Each subject will be given a total of 10 doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 subcutaneously at weeks 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,20,and 24 (Visits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10, respectively). Post treatment, subjects will be continually evaluated for safety and immune response every 4 weeks until the end of study, which is 12 weeks after the last dose, i.e., week 36. Subsequently, subjects will be followed for survival every 8 weeks up to 12 months after the end of study.</description>
