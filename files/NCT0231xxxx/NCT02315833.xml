      The purpose of this study is to validate the novel hypothesis that daily use of L-cysteine&#xD;
      (Acetium® capsules) is an effective means to decrease the frequency of (or completely abort)&#xD;
      the headache attacks in migraine patients.&#xD;

      Background: Globally, 15% of the population is affected by migraines at some point in their&#xD;
      life-time. Pprophylactic treatment of migraines is an important part of the total management&#xD;
      of migraine patients, having twofold goals: i) to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and/or&#xD;
      duration of migraines, and ii) to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy. During the&#xD;
      past several decades, a large number of optional modalities have been tested as preventive&#xD;
      measures of migraine attacks. Not unexpectedly, the effects of any such preventive therapies&#xD;
      are highly variable, and in many patients, the attack frequency is not under satisfactory&#xD;
      control. Many of these drugs also have untoward side effects that offset their potential&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, spontaneous case testimonials were received by Biohit Oyj from migraine patients,&#xD;
      reporting that our new medical device, Acetium™ capsule (containing 100mg L-cysteine,&#xD;
      developed for inactivation of acetaldehyde in the stomach contents after alcohol intake),&#xD;
      proved to be highly effective against migraine attacks. Their headache attacks disappeared&#xD;
      almost immediately after onset of L-cysteine administration, all of them remaining in&#xD;
      complete remission for several months up to several years by now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These spontaneous testimonials prompted us to formulate a novel study hypothesis that could&#xD;
      possibly explain these dramatic effects of L-cysteine in migraine prevention, to be tested in&#xD;
      this RCT. This novel hypothesis is starting from the fact that, swelling and dilatation of&#xD;
      cerebral blood vessels is necessary to provoke the attack in this vascular-type of headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that Nitric Oxide (NO) is the final trigger of migraine attack, operating through&#xD;
      phosphorylated protein kinase G (PKG) and Ca2+ channels, slowing the influx of calcium into&#xD;
      the cell, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Histamine is a potent&#xD;
      inducer of NO Synthase, making NO available locally on the vasculature, acting through&#xD;
      endothelial H1-receptors. Histamine is synthesized from histidine in tissue mast cells, which&#xD;
      are ubiquitous cells and their activation e.g. in the meninges has long been suspected to be&#xD;
      involved in generating migraine headaches. Finally, one of the potent liberators of histamine&#xD;
      from the mast cells is acetaldehyde, which, in turn, is effectively inactivated by L-cysteine&#xD;
      (Acetium capsule). This led us to rational that by eliminating acetaldehyde in the stomach,&#xD;
      L-cysteine could block (or reduce below the threshold levels) histamine liberation from the&#xD;
      tissue mast cells and ECL cells in the stomach, thus arresting its multitude of functions, of&#xD;
      which vasodilatation is critically involved in the migraine attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To validate the novel hypothesis that daily use of L-cysteine is an effective&#xD;
      means to decrease the frequency of (or completely abort) the headache attacks in migraine&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial comparing&#xD;
      Acetium capsules (100mg L-cysteine, twice a day) and placebo in prevention of migraine&#xD;
      attacks during a 3-month trial period. A cohort of 200 voluntary subjects (women and men,&#xD;
      with aural or non-aural migraine) are invited through the Finnish Migraine Association (FMA),&#xD;
      to participate in the study. To be eligible, the subjects should: i) have the attack&#xD;
      frequency of 2-8 times per month, ii) have had migraine for at least 1 year, iii) have the&#xD;
      onset of their migraine before 50 years of age, iv) be between 18 and 65 years of age, and v)&#xD;
      have a minimum of co-morbidity. Eligible patients are allowed (if they want) to continue&#xD;
      their current migraine prophylactic medication prior to study entry. Before enrolment in the&#xD;
      cohort, all subjects are requested to sign a written consent. The study protocol will be&#xD;
      subjected for approval by the Regional Committee on Medical Research Ethics (HUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 3-month retrospective history and 1-month prospective baseline (run-in) period is&#xD;
      used to assess the baseline attack frequency. The study setting is actually triple-blinded&#xD;
      (participant-blind, investigator-blind, sponsor-blind). Placebo preparation with design and&#xD;
      package identical to the test preparation will be used. Parallel group design instead of&#xD;
      cross-over design is used. Randomization will be performed using a random number generator,&#xD;
      with blocks size of 4, and creating unique randomization codes for each subject. The&#xD;
      stratified randomization is based on the attack frequency is used as the stratification&#xD;
      variable, using 4 attacks per month as the cut-off for low-and high frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period in both study arms will be 3 months. The participants should use (and&#xD;
      accurately report) their usual symptomatic or acute treatment, because not anticipated to&#xD;
      interfere with the study medication. During the 3-month treatment period, participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated at monthly intervals by the study coordinator. As determined by the final study&#xD;
      compliance, data analyses might be necessary separately for i) Per Protocol (PePr), and ii)&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat (ITT) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the baseline assessment of attack frequency, each subject will be requested to&#xD;
      fill in a structured Questionnaire recoding their detailed migraine history and other&#xD;
      pertinent data on potential triggers, to be used as covariates in multivariate analysis. The&#xD;
      headache diary is the main research tool used to monitor the efficacy of the test&#xD;
      preparations, recording all predefined assessment measures (efficacy, tolerability and&#xD;
      safety). These diaries are submitted to the study monitor on each FU visit, to confirm the&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In statistical analysis, both conventional techniques (e.g. non-parametric paired-samples and&#xD;
      non-paired samples t-test), and more sophisticated methods will be used. The latter include&#xD;
      i) life-table methods like Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression, as well as&#xD;
      ii) generalized linear models (GEE and panel Poisson) and as a new technique in migraine&#xD;
      RCTs, a competing risks regression, to model the natural outcomes of migraine during the&#xD;
      intervention. This study (n=100 per study arm) is adequately powered (Type II error 0.80,&#xD;
      type I error 0.05) to detect a true difference in attack frequency between 4 attacks/month in&#xD;
      the placebo and 2.4 attacks/month in the Acetium arm, i.e., the difference in effect size of&#xD;
      1.6 attacks. Given that the study subjects are selected among patients with 2-8 monthly&#xD;
      attacks, there figures seem reasonable estimates for the basis of these power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims: The null hypothesis of the study implicates that l-cysteine is no better than&#xD;
      placebo in migraine prophylaxis during the intervention period of 3 months. Rejection or not&#xD;
      of the null hypothesis is based on comparison of the two arms for two primary study endpoints&#xD;
      and (to lesser extent) for a series of secondary endpoints. The two primary study endpoints&#xD;
      (efficacy measures) are: a) Number of migraine attacks (NMA) per evaluation interval (1&#xD;
      month), and ii) Number of migraine days (NMD) per evaluation period. Potentially useful&#xD;
      secondary endpoints include: i) Intensity of headache (4-tier nominal scale); ii) Attack&#xD;
      duration in hours (potentially biased by treatment); iii) Drug consumption for symptomatic or&#xD;
      acute treatment (NMDs treated with abortive agents and the number of drug administrations for&#xD;
      acute therapy); iv) Patients' preferences and satisfaction; v) Responder rate (proportion of&#xD;
      study subjects with &gt;50% improvement in NMA or NMD, as compared to baseline values).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study execution and time table: Meanwhile the final protocol is under evaluation for ethical&#xD;
      approval by HUS, preparatory measures have been taken by informing the FMA about the planned&#xD;
      study and asking their co-operation in encouraging the interested migraine patients to&#xD;
      contact the study coordinator. Given the preliminary interest shown by the FMA, we are&#xD;
      optimistic that the required cohort of volunteers can be enrolled within a short time, most&#xD;
      likely by the end of 2013. Because each study subject shall complete only a 3-month trial&#xD;
      period, preceded by 1-month run-in time, we expect that the study will be completed during&#xD;
      the second half of 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of the study: Given that L-cysteine is a natural (semi-essential) amino acid,&#xD;
      converted to inert substance (MTCA) in the alimentary tract, it would comprise an ideal means&#xD;
      to conduct migraine prophylaxis for years, without concern about the side effects that are&#xD;
      inherent to many of the current treatment modalities. If the efficacy is proved in this&#xD;
      formal RCT, the concept of using Acetium capsules in prophylactic treatment of migraines&#xD;
      would represent a major step forward in a better clinical control of these frequently&#xD;
      intractable syndromes.&#xD;
