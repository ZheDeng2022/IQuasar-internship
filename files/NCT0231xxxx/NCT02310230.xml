      Purpose: To assess the utility of a new medical device that monitors a patient's breathing&#xD;
      during medical procedures in which a patient is sedated, but not mechanically ventilated. In&#xD;
      minor procedures, such as endoscopy (where the doctor examines a patient's digestive tract by&#xD;
      a TV camera inserted through the mouth), patients do not require general anesthesia, in which&#xD;
      a machine would take over their breathing while they are unconscious for surgery. However,&#xD;
      during endoscopic procedures it is sometimes difficult for the anesthesiologist to monitor&#xD;
      the patient's breathing-specifically, to monitor changes in breathing patterns and the&#xD;
      adequacy of breathing. In endoscopy procedures, the room is darkened, and the patient's mouth&#xD;
      is generally occupied by the endoscope. While the anesthesiologist can listen to the&#xD;
      patient's breathing sounds with a stethoscope, this type of monitoring can only be done&#xD;
      periodically, and there is limited ability to gauge the adequacy of ventilation. This study&#xD;
      will use the ExSpiron Respiratory Volume Monitor (RVM), which measures non-invasive minute&#xD;
      ventilation (MV), tidal volume (TV) and respiratory rate (RR), in patients undergoing an&#xD;
      endoscopic procedure to provide additional information regarding the effects of clinical&#xD;
      interventions such as drug administrations or airway maneuvers on the patient's respiratory&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who give informed consent, study participation means that they will have a&#xD;
      PadSet consisting of 3 electrodes applied to the chest. Another component, a nasal cannula (a&#xD;
      thin clear plastic tube that goes under the nose) will give patients supplemental oxygen, and&#xD;
      is standard of care for endoscopy at UVM Medical Center. Patients will then be asked to&#xD;
      breathe in and out of a portable spirometer (breath meter) for 30 seconds up to five times.&#xD;
      This data will be compared to data recorded by the monitor to confirm that the monitor is&#xD;
      recording accurately. The procedure will then go forward in the normal fashion. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomly placed into one of two groups. In the first group during the procedure, the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist will not be able to see the numbers (MV, TV, and RR) displayed screen of the&#xD;
      monitor, so the data will not be used to guide the patient's clinical care. In the second&#xD;
      group, the anesthesiologist will be able to see the RVM measurements of MV, TV, and RR to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the interventions. Monitoring for both groups will continue in the&#xD;
      recovery room, until discharge.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of the ExSpiron Respiratory Variation&#xD;
      Monitor in patients undergoing an interventional procedure with anesthesia. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be the average minute ventilation of the patient during the procedure.&#xD;
      This study will also examine the correlation between clinical interventions such as drug&#xD;
      administrations or airway maneuvers with data from the monitor. Additionally the study may&#xD;
      provide information about the ability of this new monitoring system to prevent hypoxemia&#xD;
      during these procedures and to consider its utility, compared with capnography, to detect&#xD;
      hypopnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Assessing the adequacy of ventilation during Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) and&#xD;
      sedation is difficult. Agents used to provide procedural sedation can depress ventilatory&#xD;
      drive and can interfere with airway patency, making it much more likely that the patient will&#xD;
      hypoventilate and experience partial or complete obstruction to ventilation. [It is actually&#xD;
      clinically easier to administer general anesthesia and insert an airway management device&#xD;
      such as an endotracheal tube or a laryngeal mask airway , however given the superior recovery&#xD;
      profile following sedation vs. general anesthesia, it is usually preferable to administer&#xD;
      sedation, if the procedure can be performed with its use.] The American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists maintains a database of closed malpractice claims which allows analysis of&#xD;
      patterns of injury. A study considering claims from MAC/sedation cases found that 40% of the&#xD;
      MAC claims resulted in death or brain damage, that 25% of the claims that were associated&#xD;
      with oversedation/hypoventilation occurred in the endoscopy suite, and that 44% of the&#xD;
      oversedation cases could have been prevented by better monitoring.1 A study comparing claims&#xD;
      from remote locations (such as endoscopy) with operating rooms, found that 50% of remote&#xD;
      location claims involving monitored anesthesia care, the proportion of claims for death was&#xD;
      increased in remote location claims [54 vs. 29% (operating room claims)], respiratory&#xD;
      damaging events were more common in remote location claims (44 vs. 20%), with inadequate&#xD;
      oxygenation/ventilation the most common specific event (21 vs. 3% in operating room claims),&#xD;
      and that remote location claims were more often judged as being preventable by better&#xD;
      monitoring (32 vs. 8% for operating room claims).2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper endoscopy procedures, such as upper GI endoscopy and endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), are particularly challenging where the anesthesiologist has&#xD;
      limited access to the patient's head and is working in darkened rooms. Indeed investigators&#xD;
      have found it very difficult to find a combination of propofol and short acting opioid that&#xD;
      allows instrumentation of the esophagus without &quot;intolerable ventilatory depression&quot;.3 Trying&#xD;
      to assess ventilation by observing chest excursion or listening to ventilation with a&#xD;
      stethoscope under these conditions can be difficult and can be done only periodically.&#xD;
      Side-stream nasal cannula end-tidal capnography offers a possible solution, but the cannula&#xD;
      can become dislodged and the proceduralist's endoscope often interferes with its function.&#xD;
      End-tidal capnography in the non-intubated patient is very insensitive to changes in minute&#xD;
      ventilation. At best, this technology can usually assess only the presence or absence of&#xD;
      ventilation: there is limited ability to judge the adequacy of ventilation or to quantify&#xD;
      it.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Device The ExSpiron Respiratory Volume Monitor (Respiratory Motion, Inc., Waltham&#xD;
      MA) has FDA 501(k) clearance to be used for patient care. It consists of a proprietary PadSet&#xD;
      that is placed on the chest in the mid-axillary line and connected to a free standing&#xD;
      monitor. This monitor measures and analyzes the changes in thoracic electrical impedance that&#xD;
      occur during the respiratory duty cycle. It is able to quantify respiratory rate and also&#xD;
      determine tidal volume and minute ventilation as well as graphically display changes in lung&#xD;
      volumes. It has been shown to accurately measure the effect of interventions (medications,&#xD;
      airway maneuvers) in endoscopy patients.5 Preliminary work has determined optimal lead&#xD;
      placement demonstrated excellent correlation to spirometry with an R value of 0.94-0.98 and&#xD;
      excellent accuracy and precision.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary work cited below has shown that the monitor provides information about the effect&#xD;
      of medications and airway maneuvers on breathing patterns that is not available with routine&#xD;
      monitoring. This study seeks to extend that knowledge by investigating whether using this&#xD;
      information in real-time results in different respiratory measurements compared to patients&#xD;
      with routine monitoring.&#xD;
