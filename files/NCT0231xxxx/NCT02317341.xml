      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and its treatment. No medications can treat this&#xD;
      fatigue. Researchers want to see if the drug ketamine can improve fatigue after radiation&#xD;
      therapy for cancer. They will compare the effects of ketamine on fatigue to midazolam, a&#xD;
      sedative with similar effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand fatigue in people who completed radiation therapy for cancer. To look&#xD;
      at the effects of a dose of ketamine on fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 and older who completed radiation therapy for cancer and are enrolled in NIH&#xD;
      protocol 08-NR-0132.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. They will complete questionnaires about their fatigue and take a breath alcohol&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is divided into 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first phase I visit, participants will have blood taken. They will talk about&#xD;
           their fatigue and other symptoms. They will take thinking and handgrip strength tests.&#xD;
           Then they will get either ketamine or placebo (midazolam) through an intravenous line,&#xD;
           placed by a needle guided by a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a follow-up phone call within 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have phase I visits 3, 7, and 14 days after infusion. For the 3- and&#xD;
           7-day visits, participants will take thinking and handgrip strength tests. They will&#xD;
           complete questionnaires, talk about infusion side effects, and have blood taken. For the&#xD;
           14-day visit, they will talk about their fatigue and infusion side effects. They will&#xD;
           start phase II that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II visits are the same as phase I, except that the 14-day visit is over the phone.&#xD;

      Although the underlying mechanisms of fatigue have been studied in several disease conditions&#xD;
      (Bower et al., 2002; Brola et al., 2007), the etiology, mechanisms, and risk factors remain&#xD;
      elusive, and this symptom remains poorly managed. Fatigue is conceptualized as a&#xD;
      multidimensional symptom which incorporates temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental,&#xD;
      affective/emotional, behavioral, and physiological dimensions (Voss, et al., 2006). We&#xD;
      recently observed increased levels of neutrophic factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor&#xD;
      (BDNF)), glial-cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and synaptosomal-associated&#xD;
      protein (SNAP) from the serum samples of fatigued prostate cancer men receiving external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy, suggesting that fatigue may be a component of depression and the&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may be involved in fatigue intensification during&#xD;
      cancer therapy. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist and has been reported to treat acute&#xD;
      depression (Berman et al., 2000; Prommer, 2012; Aan Het Rot et al., 2012). Depression and&#xD;
      cancer-related fatigue (CRF) are highly correlated during cancer therapy (Portenoy and Itri,&#xD;
      1999; Roscoe et al., 2002, Servaes et al., 2002, Aan Het Rot et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study will explore the effect of a single,&#xD;
      intravenous dose of ketamine in providing immediate reduction of fatigue following radiation&#xD;
      therapy. The primary objective of the study is to determine the immediate effect of a single&#xD;
      intravenous dose of ketamine in reducing clinically-significant worsening of fatigue&#xD;
      following radiation therapy. The secondary objectives of this study are to investigate the&#xD;
      levels of cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), insulin-like growth factor&#xD;
      1 (IGF-I), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, transforming growth factors (TGF)alpha and beta),&#xD;
      neurotrophic factors (i.e., BDNF, GDNF, SNAP), metabolic (i.e., apoliprotein, arginine,&#xD;
      arginase), and mitochondrial (i.e., oxygen consumption rate, glycolysis rate) markers from&#xD;
      peripheral blood before and after treatment with ketamine or placebo and relate these levels&#xD;
      to self-reported fatigue, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores. This&#xD;
      study also aims to measure cognitive function and skeletal muscle strength of patients before&#xD;
      and after treatment with ketamine or placebo and relate these findings with self-reported&#xD;
      fatigue, depression, and HRQOL scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll 40 subjects who completed radiation therapy for cancer within at least 3&#xD;
      months. The primary outcome measure of the study is the change in self-reported fatigue score&#xD;
      after receiving a single intravenous dose (0.5 mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of this study include: the cytokine profile (e.g. TNFalpha, IGF-I, IL-6, IL-8,&#xD;
      TGFalpha and TGFbeta), neurotrophic factors (e.g. BDNF, GDNF), metabolic (i.e., apoliprotein,&#xD;
      arginine, arginase), and mitochondrial markers (i.e., Complex I-V, manganese superoxide&#xD;
      dismutase (MnSOD), oxygen consumption rate, glycolysis rate) from blood samples; cognitive&#xD;
      function test scores; depression scores; HRQOL scores; and skeletal muscle strength of study&#xD;
      participants before and after a dose of ketamine or placebo.&#xD;
