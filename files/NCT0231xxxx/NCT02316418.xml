    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to provide evidence of safety and preliminary performance of the&#xD;
      Hairstetics™ anchoring system in female subjects affected with androgenetic alopecia (female&#xD;
      pattern hair loss; (FPHL)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also help to determine whether the Hairstetics™ anchoring system, in&#xD;
      conjunction with attachment of hair extensions, is efficacious in improving patient and&#xD;
      physician aesthetic satisfaction with the treated scalp appearance in female patients with&#xD;
      androgenetic alopecia.&#xD;

      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent of subjects with at least 70% of the hair extensions remaining in place at the&#xD;
      6-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of hair extensions remaining at place at the different visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject aesthetic satisfaction based on a satisfaction questionnaire (on a scale of&#xD;
           1-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator aesthetic satisfaction based on a satisfaction questionnaire on a scale of&#xD;
           1-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain rating during procedure, based on a visual analogue numeric pain rating scale (on a&#xD;
           scale of 0-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ease of use, based on a user questionnaire responses (on a scale of 1-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant retrieval rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events both expected and unexpected, related or unrelated to study device or&#xD;
      procedure, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURE - After signing informed consent, patients will be screened for study&#xD;
      eligibility by assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening procedures will&#xD;
      include collection of demographic data, medical history, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
      and laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unless the patient's participation in the trial is terminated, subjects will then be&#xD;
      implanted with Hairstetics™ anchoring system cartridges holding up to a total of 360 of the&#xD;
      Hairstetics™ prosthetic hair units. Complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry and coagulation&#xD;
      panel and a quantitative β-HCG, as specified in the eligibility criteria, will be required&#xD;
      before treatment and the test requirements specified in the inclusion criteria must be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed a week after the study implantation procedure, to ensure proper&#xD;
      monitoring of safety events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hair extensions will be attached four weeks after the implantation. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      at 3 and 6 months after the attachment of hair extensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will allow excision of implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol does not provide arrangements for long-term follow-up of study participants&#xD;
      beyond primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION - Female patients with androgenetic alopecia (female pattern hair loss;&#xD;
      (FPHL))&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION - 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - General -&#xD;
&#xD;
      No separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) document is planned. Nevertheless, if during the&#xD;
      study, modifications to the statistical considerations will be deemed necessary, a SAP may be&#xD;
      issued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned as a prospective, single-arm study to assess safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy data on the treatment of female subjects affected with androgenetic alopecia (FPHL)&#xD;
      with the Hairstetics™ anchoring system. The analysis of the endpoints is descriptive in&#xD;
      nature; no formal statistical hypotheses will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number and proportion of subjects with at least 70% of the hair extensions remaining in&#xD;
      place at the 6-month follow-up visit, will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of hair extensions remaining in place at the different visit will be presented&#xD;
      in a tabular form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aesthetic satisfaction as assessed by the subjects and the investigators will be&#xD;
      presented in a tabular form by visit, once as continuous variables, and once as categorical&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain during the procedure will be presented in a tabular form, once as continuous&#xD;
      variable, and once as categorical variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ease of use will be presented in the same manner as the pain. The number and proportion&#xD;
      of subjects for whom the implants are removed will be presented in a tabular form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative incidence (and 95% CI) of adverse events observed during procedure and&#xD;
      throughout the follow-up period, will be presented in tabular format. A detailed list of all&#xD;
      adverse events will be presented. The adverse event rate will be compiled with respect to&#xD;
      seriousness, severity, and relationship to procedure and device. In addition, listings of all&#xD;
      safety measures will be produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline descriptive statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, medical and clinical history variables will be tabulated. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum, and&#xD;
      categorical variables by a count and percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned for efficacy and/or safety review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No formal sample size calculations were performed. A sample size of ten subjects will provide&#xD;
      safety and performance preliminary assessment.&#xD;
