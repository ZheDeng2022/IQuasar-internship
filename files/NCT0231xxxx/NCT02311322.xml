      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some growth disorders are caused by a change in genes. Genes are the instructions the body&#xD;
      uses to function. Changes in genes often cause them not to work correctly. Researchers want&#xD;
      to use a new technology called exome sequencing, to look at many genes at once. This is done&#xD;
      by looking at DNA from blood or saliva in a lab. This method may help find the cause of&#xD;
      disorders that researchers haven t been able to find using past methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand genetic causes of growth disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children and adults with growth disorders and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will give a small sample of blood and/or saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will purify DNA from the sample. They will perform exome sequencing and&#xD;
           other tests to look for changes in genes. Some participants may receive limited or no&#xD;
           genetic tests. Researchers will let them know if exome sequencing is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a medical history, physical exam, and lab tests. They may have&#xD;
           x-rays or ultrasound tests to study the disorder in their family.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may be recommended for a specific genetic test from a commercial lab.&#xD;
           They may have to pay for that test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be told about test results that relate to the growth disorder. This&#xD;
           may happen up to years after the testing. They may have to give another blood and/or&#xD;
           saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may get results about other health conditions. This will only happen&#xD;
           if the information would help the person or their family protect their health. They may&#xD;
           have to give another blood and/or saliva sample.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children often present to pediatricians and pediatric endocrinologists because of abnormal&#xD;
      body growth, including both childhood growth failure and, less commonly, overgrowth.&#xD;
      Sometimes the cause is evident, for example, growth hormone deficiency for growth failure and&#xD;
      growth hormone excess for overgrowth. In other children, the etiology remains unknown despite&#xD;
      extensive evaluation, resulting in the unhelpful diagnosis of severe idiopathic short stature&#xD;
      or tall stature. These conditions are quite heterogeneous, including children with isolated&#xD;
      growth disorders and others who also have other abnormalities such as developmental delay or&#xD;
      a constellation of congenital anomalies (syndromic growth disorders). Some cases of severe&#xD;
      growth disorders have a polygenic inheritance while others appear to be inherited as a&#xD;
      monogenic trait - recessive, dominant or X-linked. Because of recent advances in DNA&#xD;
      sequencing technology, it is now feasible to sequence the exome (portion of the genome that&#xD;
      encodes gene exons) in families with monogenic disorders and thereby determine the underlying&#xD;
      molecular etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose a study to identify novel genetic causes of idiopathic growth disorders&#xD;
      using whole-exome sequencing. The primary goal of this study is to identify novel causes of&#xD;
      childhood growth disorders in order to improve clinical diagnosis, to provide a more precise&#xD;
      characterization of associated medical problems, prognosis, and response to treatment based&#xD;
      on etiology, and to gain new insights into the regulation of human growth, which may&#xD;
      eventually lead to new therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will include children and adults with a clearly recognizable phenotype that includes&#xD;
      either short stature or tall stature and a pedigree that strongly suggests a monogenic&#xD;
      inheritance. Both syndromic and non-syndromic growth disorders and both proportionate and&#xD;
      disproportionate growth disorders will be included. Affected and unaffected family members&#xD;
      (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index case) will&#xD;
      also be studied because of their importance for this genetic approach. The phenotype will be&#xD;
      characterized by medical history, physical exam, body measurements, and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluation. Blood and saliva samples will be collected for whole-exome sequencing and single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Candidate sequence variants will typically be&#xD;
      verified by Sanger sequencing.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a subject meets any one of these criteria, he/she will potentially be eligible to&#xD;
        participate:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Short stature (height less than - 2 SDS), either currently or previously - or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tall stature (height greater than + 2 SDS) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone age delay (greater than 3 years) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone age advancement (&gt;1.5 years) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Predicted adult height &lt; - 2SD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Predicted adult height - mid-parental height &lt; -2SDS or &gt; 2SDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Growth disorder that was treated promptly, thus maintaining the child s height within&#xD;
             the normal range, e.g. a subject with congenital growth hormone deficiency or multiple&#xD;
             pituitary hormone deficiency of unknown genetic etiology who received growth hormone&#xD;
             treatment beginning in early life or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family member of subjects who meet any of the above criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have a current height at a low normal percentile but has short adult height&#xD;
             prediction based on bone age (&gt; 5 inches shorter than mid-parent height)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject who has more than one of the above criteria and elevated DHEA-S&#xD;
             concentration for age&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, subjects are only eligible, if, the pedigree suggests a monogenic inheritance,&#xD;
        and, in the judgement of the investigators, there is a reasonable likelihood of identifying&#xD;
        a novel gene responsible for the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A non-genetic disorder or condition, either congenital or acquired, that explains the&#xD;
             growth abnormality, for example, pituitary injury, chronic thyroiditis, whole body&#xD;
             irradiation, or celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigators, there is an established diagnosis of a genetic&#xD;
             disorder or condition that explains the growth abnormality and for which the molecular&#xD;
             genetic etiology has already been identified, for example, SHOX deficiency,&#xD;
             hypochondroplasia, or Noonan syndrome.&#xD;
