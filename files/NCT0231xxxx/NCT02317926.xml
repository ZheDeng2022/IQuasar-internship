  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study design is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. After&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, patients will be randomized to receive either desiccated&#xD;
      thyroid in capsules, or L-T4/L-T3 (ThyrolarTM) in capsules, or L-T4 alone capsules. All study&#xD;
      participants, physician investigators, those administering the neurocognitive tests and those&#xD;
      analyzing test results will be blinded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo memory testing, a disease specific symptom questionnaire, a general&#xD;
      mental health assessment, a complete physical examination, baseline EKG, and biochemical&#xD;
      testing consisting of serum TSH, free T4, total T4, total T3, free T3, T3 resin uptake,&#xD;
      reverse T3, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), serum iodine, a lipid panel, insulin,&#xD;
      glucose and leptin. This testing and DXA scan of body composition will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and after each 3 month treatment period. Deiodinase type 2 (DIO2) polymorphisms&#xD;
      analyses - will also be performed at the beginning of the study and the results will be&#xD;
      blinded to the investigators performing the memory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5-6 weeks on the study medication, TSH levels will be checked and the medication&#xD;
      adjusted to maintain TSH level between 0.46-4.68 mIU/L. Once the TSH level is in the desired&#xD;
      range, subjects will continue the medication for an additional 6 weeks. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      crossed-over to the other treatment arm for 3 months. Again, testing will be performed after&#xD;
      each treatment period. Finally the subjects will again switched over to the 3rd arm and&#xD;
      testing will be performed after treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-over design is preferred because we are assessing subjective symptoms such as&#xD;
      clinical well-being and other parameters. Therefore, we will be able to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of L-T4/T3 (ThyrolarTM) vs DTE vs T4 alone in the same patientssubjects. This&#xD;
      is also supported by the previous study by Escobar-Morreale et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the Wechsler memory scale, DEXA for body composition, measurment of reverse T3,&#xD;
      insulin, leptin, and DIO2 polymorphisms analysis will be included for the research portion of&#xD;
      this study. Further, the frequency of serum blood draws, for research purposes, will be at&#xD;
      intervals of 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 weeks.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be between the ages of 18 to 65 and will have been on levothyroxine for&#xD;
             primary hypothyroidism for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Department of Defense beneficiaries living within 60 miles of Besthesda, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have the following problems: pregnancy, plan for&#xD;
             pregnancy in the next 12 months, cardiac disease, especially coronary artery disease,&#xD;
             chronic obstructive lung disease, malabsorption disorder, gastrointestinal surgeries,&#xD;
             significant renal or liver dysfunction, seizure disorders, thyroid and non-thyroid&#xD;
             active cancers, uncontrolled psychosis, psychotropic medication use, steroid use,&#xD;
             amiodarone, chemotherapy for cancer, iron supplement more than 325mg per day,&#xD;
             carafate/ proton pump inhibitor use, cholestyramine use, and those with recent orders&#xD;
             who are expected to move out of the geographic area, age less than 18 years old or&#xD;
             older than 65 years old. Patients scheduled for deployment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism will be excluded. If we include patients with&#xD;
             subclinical hypothyroidism, it will be difficult to assess the outcomes. This is&#xD;
             because only a very small percentage of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism&#xD;
             benefit from thyroid hormone therapy and therefore, a cross-over study as done in this&#xD;
             project will not show a difference between the therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child-bearing age will be screened with initial assessment for pregnancy as&#xD;
             part of standard of care (eg history of amnenorrhea and/or positive pregnancy testing&#xD;
             via hCG). There is no experience in using desiccated thyroid extract in pregnant women&#xD;
             and there is no published paper in this area. Desiccated thyroid extract is rated&#xD;
             Category-A drug in pregnancy which means there are no known risks to the fetus.&#xD;
