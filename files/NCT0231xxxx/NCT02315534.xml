    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1 safety run-in and phase 2 study of BBI608 in&#xD;
      combination with temozolomide in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma who have&#xD;
      not received prior bevacizumab therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In arm A, patients who are candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 as&#xD;
      monotherapy prior to resection, followed by post-operative BBI608 administered in combination&#xD;
      with temozolomide. In arm B, patients who are not candidates for surgical resection will&#xD;
      receive BBI608 administered orally, daily, in combination with temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1/dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) cohort portion of this study, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      will be evaluated for both arms A and B. Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated in all patients&#xD;
      who undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
