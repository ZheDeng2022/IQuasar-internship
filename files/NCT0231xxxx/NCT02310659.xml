  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a pandemic condition in elderly patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease (CAD) and associated with worse prognosis. Although available data shows&#xD;
      association between testosterone levels in men and CAD, the association between testosterone&#xD;
      and CAC in old-aged male patients with CAD remains unknown. In this study, the relationship&#xD;
      of serum testosterone levels with CAC score in elderly male patients with CAD was evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with worse outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD), especially in old-aged population. Extensive CAC also&#xD;
      increases the risk of procedure associated complications, such as stent migration, coronary&#xD;
      artery perforation, dissection and thrombosis. The pathogenesis of CAC has not been fully&#xD;
      explained. Recent evidence suggests that CAC share common pathways with bone formation. So,&#xD;
      it can be presumed that risk factors contributing to bone formation and resorption activity&#xD;
      also affect the development of CAC. Sex hormones is known to play an important role in bone&#xD;
      development and in bone quality maintenance. Available data shows that androgens may affect&#xD;
      differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis of osteocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts.&#xD;
      Androgen receptor expression has been detected on different types of cells which contributing&#xD;
      to the bone formation, such as osteoblastes, osteocytes and condrocytes, and androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy results negative effects on bone mineral density in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic prostate cancer. Osteoporosis, a systemic disease characterized by bone tissue&#xD;
      loss, is more prevalent in oler men with low testosterone levels. In CAC, pathophysiological&#xD;
      researches show that several vascular cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells,&#xD;
      adventitial myofibroblasts and microvascular pericytes, have the potential to produce&#xD;
      mineralized matrix and differentiate into osteoblasts. So, it can be postulated that&#xD;
      androgens may play a similar role in the development of CAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date, only limited data is available about the association between testosterone and&#xD;
      CAC. A single-center study with relatively small sample revealed an inverse association&#xD;
      between testosterone and CAC in non-obese men. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      association between testosterone and CAC measured as CAC score in old-aged male patients with&#xD;
      CAD.&#xD;
