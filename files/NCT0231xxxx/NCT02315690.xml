      Title Evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of reactive focal mass drug administration&#xD;
      (fMDA) vs. reactive case detection (RACD) as a community level intervention in response to a&#xD;
      passively identified index malaria case in Swaziland&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Cluster randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim: To compare the impact of fMDA versus RACD on malaria incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the impact of fMDA versus RACD on seroprevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the impact of fMDA versus RACD on prevalence of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety of fMDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the adherence of DHAp using a modified DOT regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the feasibility of reaching 80% coverage for fMDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the acceptability of fMDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of fMDA versus RACD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site Eastern endemic region of Swaziland, a very low endemic malaria elimination&#xD;
      setting. A total of 287 health facilities and their catchment areas are located in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame September 2015 - August 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster or unit of randomisation At-risk localities will be randomized to either fMDA or RACD&#xD;
      using a block stratified randomization based on risk rank and population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target area Individuals residing within 200 m (fMDA arm) or 500 m (RACD arm) of an index case&#xD;
      detected in passive surveillance, individuals residing immediately beyond 200 m in the fMDA&#xD;
      arm will be included if a minimum of 30 individuals are not enrolled within 200 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention All individuals residing in study localities will receive vector control&#xD;
      preventative measures as per program. In the fMDA arm, all individuals in the target area&#xD;
      will receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHAp) once daily for 3 days with the first dose&#xD;
      taken no later than 5 weeks from the index case presentation (goal within one week).&#xD;
      Individuals in RACD target areas will be tested by RDT and taken to the nearest health&#xD;
      facility for treatment as per program operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation methods The primary outcome measure of incidence will be obtained through routine&#xD;
      surveillance data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of effectiveness will be measured at study conclusion by collecting a&#xD;
      dried blood spot (DBS) from all residents in target areas in both arms. Prevalence of&#xD;
      infection will be measured by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and&#xD;
      seroprevalence measured by quantifying markers of recent malaria exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of feasibility will be measured as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety: number of serious adverse events deemed possibly, probably, or definitely&#xD;
           related to DHAp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence: proportion of individuals who completed three days of therapy among all&#xD;
           individuals initiated on DHAp in the fMDA arm, assessed by pill count.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coverage: proportion of individuals residing within 200m (fMDA localities) or 500m (RACD&#xD;
           localities) of an index case who consented to participate and who completed the initial&#xD;
           procedures for their study arm (initial dose of DHAp in the fMDA arm or finger prick for&#xD;
           RDT in the RACD arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Acceptability: proportion of eligible individuals refusing to take part in the study and&#xD;
           a qualitative assessment of a subset of individuals in the fMDA arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cost: cost per index case-level intervention and cost per case averted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size is based on the number of study localities that experienced at&#xD;
      least one incident case of malaria in the previous season. Within 77 randomized localities,&#xD;
      we expect that 63 localities will have an incident case of malaria and receive an&#xD;
      intervention. For the primary objective, we hypothesize that mFDA will be more effective than&#xD;
      RACD. At the current sample size, the study is powered to detect a difference in cumulative&#xD;
      incidence if incidence in the fMDA arm is reduced 50% compared to the RACD arm. Incidence&#xD;
      will be measured at the locality level and among the at-risk population, or all individuals&#xD;
      in an enumeration area (EA) where at least one case was identified (expected to be&#xD;
      approximately 55,928 individuals among a total study population of 211,189, or a harmonic&#xD;
      mean of 656 per locality (41,328 effective population)). Secondary outcomes of seroprevalence&#xD;
      and prevalence will be measured on individuals residing in target areas (total N=5,400) with&#xD;
      a harmonic mean of 60 persons receiving intervention per locality (3,780 effective&#xD;
      population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Incidence of malaria cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Seroprevalence by ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prevalence of infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Coverage of the intervention: proportion of the target population that receives a finger&#xD;
           prick in the RACD arm and receives an initial dose of DHAp in the TPE arm (intention to&#xD;
           treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adherence to DHAp in TPE arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Safety of DHAp&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Acceptance&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cost per intervention episode, per case averted&#xD;
