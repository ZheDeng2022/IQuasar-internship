  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted using 3+3 design and includes, a dose escalation part to define&#xD;
      the MTDfRP2D for the combination of BGJ398 and carboplatin/paclitaxel, and a dose expansion&#xD;
      part to treat another 12 patients (only cervix cancer) to further evaluate safety of this&#xD;
      combination. Safety, tolerability and MTD will be determined in the dose escalation part of&#xD;
      the study. The dose expansion will additionally investigate preliminary anti-tumor efficacy&#xD;
      in cervical cancer. The dosing cycle is 21 days.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects age &gt;18 years at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for&#xD;
             which no curable therapy exists. In dose expansion part of this study, only patients&#xD;
             with stage IV or recurrent/persistent cervical cancer will be enrolled. Confirmation&#xD;
             of FGF/FGFR aberration is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10 9/L platelets ≥ 100,000 x 10 9/L hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
        Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
        (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (AL T) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;3 times the&#xD;
        ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease, as determined by RECIST v 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A female of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: has not&#xD;
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has not been naturally&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (Le., has had menses at any time in&#xD;
             the preceding 12 consecutive months). Oral contraceptives (OC), injected or implanted&#xD;
             hormonal methods are not allowed as the sole method of contraception because BGJ398&#xD;
             has not been characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with PK and/or&#xD;
             the effectiveness of OCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is preferred that archival tumor sample is available for molecular testing, if not&#xD;
             available, a newly obtained tumor biopsy may be submitted instead (not mandatory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients enrolled in dose escalation, any number of prior treatments allowed. For&#xD;
             patients enrolled in dose expansion, no prior chemotherapy is allowed (previous single&#xD;
             agent cisplatin concurrent with radiotherapy is accepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior therapy with paclitaxel, BGJ398 or other FGFR targeting agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preexisting&gt; grade 2 peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases are allowed provided that they are clinically stable&#xD;
             for a period of 30 days prior to study entry and there is not a requirement for&#xD;
             steroids or anti epileptics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of pancreatitis in last 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History and/or current evidence of endocrine alterations of calcium/phosphate&#xD;
             homeostasis, e.g., parathyroid disorders, history of parathyroidectomy, tumor lysis,&#xD;
             tumoral calcinosis, or patients with other phosphate regulating abnormalities. Because&#xD;
             hyperphosphatemia is a frequent occurrence with BGJ398 treatment, pretreatment and&#xD;
             concurrent treatment with phosphate regulating agents is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of corneal or retinal disorder/ keratopathy such as bullous/ band&#xD;
             keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation/ulceration, keratoconjunctivits, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since BGJ398 is a likely inhibitor of CYP3A4, patients who are currently receiving&#xD;
             treatment with agents that are known sting inducers or inhibitors CYP3A4 are not&#xD;
             allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any of the following anti-cancer therapies prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             the of BGJ398 within the stated timeframes: intravenous chemotherapy within a period&#xD;
             of 4 weeks ( 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin-C), biological therapy (e,g.&#xD;
             antibodies) within a period of time that is ~ 5 t1/2 or less than 4 weeks, whichever&#xD;
             is shorter, prior to starting study drug, any other investigational agents within a&#xD;
             period of time that is &lt; 5 tl/2 or 4 weeks (whichever is shortest) prior to starting&#xD;
             study drug, wide field radiotherapy &lt; 4 weeks or limited field radiation for&#xD;
             palliation &lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medications that increase serum levels of phosphorus and/or calcium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cardiac disease (Congestive heart failure NYHA grade&gt; 2, LVEF &lt; 50% as&#xD;
             determined by MUGA scan or ECHO, history of clinically significant ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmias, unstable angina pectoriS or acute myocardial infarction &lt;6 months prior&#xD;
             to starting study drug, QTcF &gt; 450 msec)&#xD;
