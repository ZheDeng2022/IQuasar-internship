      The study is a comparative effectiveness study with comparision of two cohorts of patients&#xD;
      with stroke in North of Norway and in Denmark. At baseline information is collected from the&#xD;
      stroke registries in both countries. Time points for follow up are at 3 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-stroke. Data are collected from medical charts and with use of telephone interview in&#xD;
      addition to self-report questionnaires. The study will provide information about functional&#xD;
      status, health related quality of life and rehabilitation needs. Information about&#xD;
