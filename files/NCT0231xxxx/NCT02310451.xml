    <textblock>
      Recent progresses have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, nevertheless&#xD;
      improved patient survival is still limited because of primary resistance and relapses. It is&#xD;
      therefore important to continue to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma&#xD;
      development and progression to improve the management of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs such as the alkylating agents (temozolomide and fotemustine) or vemurafenib trigger&#xD;
      senescence-like phenotypes in melanoma cells. It is now known that senescent cells secrete&#xD;
      some factors that exert a pro-tumoral role but the potential existence and the role of&#xD;
      insoluble factors remain undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results from the investigators laboratory indicate the presence in the senescent&#xD;
      secretome of exosomes; microvesicles involved in intercellular communication,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory functions, and tumorigenesis. Several studies showed that these vesicles&#xD;
      shape the tumor microenvironment and contribute to the migration of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their interest in oncology as a prognostic factor and marker of therapeutic response is&#xD;
      increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our project aims to study the effect of exosomes produced by senescent melanoma cells&#xD;
      in the development and progression of melanoma in vitro and in vivo using cell cultures and&#xD;
      animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigator propose a pilot study whose objective is to determine the&#xD;
      effect of vemurafenib on nanovesicles produced by patients with advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hope to show that exosomes participate in the process of drug resistance and&#xD;
      relapse, with the goal of developing (with the exosomes study) theranostic tools for&#xD;
      personalized care in patients.&#xD;

      Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive tumor with a 5-year survival rate of about 6 months.&#xD;
      Although recent progresses have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, improved&#xD;
      patient survival is still limited because of primary resistance and relapses. It is therefore&#xD;
      important to continue to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma development&#xD;
      and progression to improve current treatments and / or to discover new anti-metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs such as the alkylating agents (temozolomide and fotemustine) or vemurafenib trigger&#xD;
      senescence-like phenotypes in melanoma cells. Although senescence is a process that limits&#xD;
      the proliferation of cells, it is now known that senescent cells secrete factors that exert a&#xD;
      pro-tumoral role. If many studies have focused on the role of the soluble factors of this&#xD;
      secretome, the potential existence and the role of insoluble factors remain undetermined.&#xD;
      Preliminary results from the investigators laboratory indicate the presence in the senescent&#xD;
      secretome of exosomes; microvesicles involved in intercellular communication,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory functions, and tumorigenesis. The exovesicules discharged by a cell in its&#xD;
      environment are the subject of increasing interest in oncology as a prognostic factor and&#xD;
      marker of therapeutic response. Several studies showed that these vesicles shape the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and contribute to the migration of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to study the effect of exosomes produced by senescent melanoma cells in the&#xD;
      development and progression of melanoma in vitro and in vivo using cell cultures and animal&#xD;
      models. In addition, the investigator propose a pilot study whose objective is to determine&#xD;
      the effect of vemurafenib on production, quantity, size and composition of nanovesicles&#xD;
      produced by patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The investigator hope&#xD;
      to show that exosomes participate in the process of drug resistance and relapse, with the&#xD;
      goal of developing (with the exosomes study) theranostic tools for personalized care in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
