    <textblock>
      Impairment of arm function is more common than lower limb impairment in stroke patients and&#xD;
      is also more resistant to treatment. Several clinical trials with stroke patients have&#xD;
      produced statistically significant gains in upper limb function when using instrumental&#xD;
      playing and treatments where rhythm supports the priming and timing of movements. Based on&#xD;
      the positive results from controlled and non-controlled trials, the Cochrane review of music&#xD;
      therapy for acquired brain injury (Bradt, et al., 2010) recommends further investigation into&#xD;
      rhythm based techniques to treat hemiparesis in stroke patients, and that future studies need&#xD;
      to examine the relationship between the frequency and duration of interventions and treatment&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine whether or not a thirty minute, twice weekly, six week,&#xD;
      home music therapy treatment, playing set musical patterns on instruments to music is&#xD;
      feasible to deliver, and will lead to improved coordination, dexterity and activities of&#xD;
      daily living in hemiparetic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients will be recruited from Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS trust (CCS) who&#xD;
      are between one month and two years post stroke with hemiparesis. Participants will have&#xD;
      completed and been discharged from community rehabilitation for their upper limb and not be&#xD;
      receiving any other treatment for arm function. They will be randomised into two groups:&#xD;
      treatment (for immediate treatment following discharge from community rehab) and waiting list&#xD;
      (beginning 9 weeks after baseline measure). Participants will be assessed at the beginning&#xD;
      and end of treatment (just before starting and just after completing 6 weeks of treatment) by&#xD;
      one of two experienced community occupational therapists under contract with CCS, who are&#xD;
      also experienced in working with stroke patients and who will be blind to the experiment. The&#xD;
      other three measures will be conducted by the chief investigator. The assessment tools will&#xD;
      be the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and nine hole peg test (9HPT). There will also be a&#xD;
      pre and post treatment semi-structured interview for each participant, which will be&#xD;
      conducted by the chief investigator. ARAT and 9HPT assessments will be administered to all&#xD;
      participants at the same time points: baseline and then at week 6, 9, 15 and 18. Data will be&#xD;
      analysed to determine if the treatment is effective compared to no treatment (wait list)&#xD;
      following community discharge, and whether earlier intervention (treatment group) yields&#xD;
      better results for participants, all of whom will eventually receive treatment.&#xD;

      CROSSOVER DESIGN After the stroke patients have finished their upper limb rehabilitation with&#xD;
      CCS and are no longer receiving any physiotherapy or occupational therapy to improve it, this&#xD;
      study aims to establish if their upper limb function is maintained, deteriorates, or&#xD;
      improves. In order to do this the investigators will have a waiting list group who wait 9&#xD;
      weeks after the end of their CCS rehabilitation but are assessed at the same time points&#xD;
      after their baseline measure as the treatment group. This enables us to compare the results&#xD;
      of the treatment group with the waiting list group, in other words 'treatment compared to no&#xD;
      treatment after CCS rehab has ended', and establish if the music therapy has been effective.&#xD;
      The investigators can also compare the results of both groups and determine if the&#xD;
      participants who received music therapy earlier performed any differently than the waiting&#xD;
      list group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five repeated measures using the ARAT and 9HPT also allow each participant to be measured&#xD;
      against themselves, comparing treatment with no treatment and establishing how the exercises&#xD;
      using the musical instruments (TIMP treatment) have influenced their paretic arm use during&#xD;
      activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study goal is to investigate the feasibility of delivering this music therapy treatment&#xD;
      in stroke patients' homes twice a week for six weeks with the objective of answering the&#xD;
      primary research question, which is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does TIMP improve upper limb function after statutory rehabilitation has ceased to be&#xD;
           effective and consequently ended?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Secondary objectives are to try and determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is TIMP more effective when delivered immediately after statutory rehabilitation has&#xD;
           ended compared to 9 weeks later ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do participants experience TIMP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer the research questions a wait list, crossover design will be used, with&#xD;
      twelve participants randomly assigned to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A = treatment B = wait list Randomisation will be achieved using an envelope system, with&#xD;
      twelve sealed envelopes containing folded pieces of paper, six with the word 'treatment' and&#xD;
      six with the word 'wait list' written on them. Each time a patient consents to participation,&#xD;
      the chief investigator will contact the statistician and ask him to open an envelope and read&#xD;
      the piece of paper inside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There can be enormous variability between patients in terms of speed of recovery following&#xD;
      stroke and so the inclusion criteria for 'time since stroke' is quite broad. There is no&#xD;
      clear data that fully confirms differences in degrees of upper limb paresis based on type or&#xD;
      site of stroke and so all types and sites are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can consent to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. aged 18-70&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. has completed community rehabilitation for upper limb paresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. any type and site of stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. between 1 month and 2 years post stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. can lift paretic hand onto a table whilst seated, without assistance from unaffected&#xD;
           hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. some finger movement, which could be extension of one or more fingers&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. not receiving any other treatment for upper limb paresis during the course of this study&#xD;
           (18 weeks from baseline measure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment begins, each participant will receive two, thirty minute music therapy&#xD;
      sessions per week for six weeks. All participants will eventually receive treatment. Group A&#xD;
      will begin music therapy immediately after completing their baseline assessment using ARAT&#xD;
      and 9HPT and completing the semi-structured interview. This means that the first session will&#xD;
      require approximately two hours in order to allow for setting up equipment and breaks for the&#xD;
      participant. In the event that the participant is too tired following the assessment to&#xD;
      continue with the treatment, then the music therapy session will be rescheduled for another&#xD;
      day in the same week. The end measure will also take place on the same day as the twelfth and&#xD;
      final session and if the participant is too tired to complete the end assessment then it will&#xD;
      be rescheduled for another day in the same week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT Patients who have completed their CCS community occupational and physiotherapy&#xD;
      rehabilitation will be sent a letter of invitation to participate in this study and an&#xD;
      information sheet (see attached 'Letter of Invitation' and 'participant information sheet').&#xD;
      In the letter they will be asked to contact the chief investigator if they are interested in&#xD;
      participating, explaining that he will answer any questions that they have about&#xD;
      participation and arrange to visit them in their home in order to demonstrate some of the&#xD;
      exercises. Then, if they are interested the chief investigator will leave a consent form for&#xD;
      them to sign and return within a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMISATION Once a participant has given informed consent, the chief investigator will&#xD;
      contact the statistician (Mike Parker, medical statistician, Anglia University, Chelmsford)&#xD;
      and ask him to open one of 12 envelopes, which will have either 'treatment' or 'waiting list'&#xD;
      written on a piece of paper inside and indicate which group the participant will go into.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS The primary outcome measure will be the Action Research Arm Test (Lyle 1981. See&#xD;
      diagram 12 under 'Appendix'), which has been used in similar studies (Schneider; 2007,&#xD;
      Altenmueller; 2009, Grau-Sanchez; 2013) thus enabling some comparison of data with this&#xD;
      study. It is a 19 item measure that is divided into four categories: grasp, grip, pinch and&#xD;
      gross movement. Each item, or action, is performed by the participant while seated a measured&#xD;
      distance from a table (15cm), where all of the assessment items are placed (blocks of wood of&#xD;
      various sizes, smaller items, etc). The test recreates the movements or sequences of&#xD;
      movements common to activities of daily living, such as reaching up onto a shelf to pick up a&#xD;
      can of soup. A table map for the ARAT is laid out flat on the table top and this has markers&#xD;
      on it to indicate the start and end position for each object used in the test, thus&#xD;
      optimising consistency between patients and setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of each task is timed using a stopwatch, and scored according to a&#xD;
      standardised scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment can take up to 30 minutes if the patient needs to complete all items in every&#xD;
      subcategory, but this is rare. The test usually takes approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure is the 9 hole peg test (Kellor et al, 1971). This is a test&#xD;
      that the Cambridgeshire Community Services team (host to this study) use. It is a timed test&#xD;
      measuring finger dexterity using standardised equipment comprising a rectangular plastic tray&#xD;
      with a rounded, concave tray at one end containing nine small white pegs and at the other end&#xD;
      nine holes into which the participant must (one at a time) place the nine pegs from the tray&#xD;
      and then remove them, placing them back into the tray as quickly as possible. The patient&#xD;
      practices with the unaffected hand first, then the paretic side. The patient is seated while&#xD;
      performing the test. A non-slip mat is placed between the base of the peg test and the table&#xD;
      surface. The participant may stabilise the test base if necessary using their unaffected&#xD;
      hand. The test takes no more than 2 minutes to administer, depending on the age of the&#xD;
      patient and their existing degree of finger dexterity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW Before beginning the music therapy treatment each participant will&#xD;
      be asked set questions about it and to score how much they think it will improve their&#xD;
      paretic arm use in activities of daily living. At the end of treatment participants will be&#xD;
      asked the same questions. The chief investigator will write down responses during the&#xD;
      interview for later thematic analysis. Interviews will not be recorded. Questions have been&#xD;
      used that are as open as possible so as to give participants the opportunity to express their&#xD;
      preconceptions and thoughts. Each question may lead to further questions, for example&#xD;
      question 1 may prompt a response 'I think it will help me&quot; to which the chief investigator&#xD;
      may respond &quot;how might it help you?&quot; The purpose of the semi-structured interview is to&#xD;
      gather qualitative data specifically regarding how participants experienced the treatment.&#xD;
      The pre and post questions are set out below.&#xD;
