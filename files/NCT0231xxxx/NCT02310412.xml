      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that INTERCEPT platelet components&#xD;
      stored for 7 days retain sufficient viability for therapeutic efficacy. The post-infusion&#xD;
      recovery and lifespan of 7-day old INTERCEPT platelet components stored in 35% plasma and 65%&#xD;
      InterSol or stored in 100% plasma, will be measured in comparison to &quot;fresh&quot; radiolabeled&#xD;
      platelets according to FDA guidance for platelet testing (FDA 1999).&#xD;

      The two stages of this pilot study consist of the following: single or double-dose platelet&#xD;
      apheresis collection, pathogen inactivation with INTERCEPT treatment, storage for 7 days,&#xD;
      collection of fresh platelets, radiolabeling, infusion of fresh and stored INTERCEPT treated&#xD;
      radiolabeled autologous platelets, and collection of blood samples for assessment of platelet&#xD;
      recovery and survival (lifespan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage A, apheresis platelets will be collected using the Amicus separator and stored for 7&#xD;
      days in 35% Plasma and 65% InterSol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage B, apheresis platelets will be collected using the Trima separator and stored for 7&#xD;
      days in 100% plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for both stages will be as follows: On Day 0, each healthy volunteer subject has&#xD;
      apheresis platelets collected. INTERCEPT treatment will begin on either the day of donation&#xD;
      (Day 0) or before the end of the day following donation (Day 1). Platelets will then be&#xD;
      stored for 7 days after collection (Day 7). Aliquots for in vitro platelet function will be&#xD;
      taken on Day 0/1 after INTERCEPT treatment and Day 7. An aliquot for bacterial detection will&#xD;
      be taken on Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7, healthy volunteers will return to the laboratory, and 43 mL of blood will be drawn&#xD;
      into a syringe containing 9 mL of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution, Formula A (ACD-A).&#xD;
      Fresh platelets will be prepared from this sample. An aliquot (10-20 mL) of the stored&#xD;
      (INTERCEPT treated) platelets will be aseptically removed from each subject's test container.&#xD;
      Previously stored (Test) and fresh (Control) platelets will be radiolabeled according to&#xD;
      randomization assignment with either 51Cr (≤20 μCi) as sodium radiochromate (Na251CrO4), or&#xD;
      111In (≤15 μCi) as indium oxine, following the labeling and washing procedures outlined by&#xD;
      the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) Collaborative. The isotope labels will&#xD;
      be determined by a random number table such that equal numbers of fresh and stored (INTERCEPT&#xD;
      treated) platelets will be labeled with each isotope. Aliquots of the fresh and stored&#xD;
      platelets will be radiolabeled in tubes with the standard techniques. After radiolabeling,&#xD;
      the autologous fresh and stored platelets will be simultaneously infused into the subject&#xD;
      (approximately 10-30 mL). Negative bacteria detection test and negative pregnancy test for&#xD;
      females of childbearing potential are required before infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for radioactivity measurements will be drawn at 0 (pre-infusion), 0.5, 1, and 2&#xD;
      hours post-infusion, and then 6 more samples will be drawn 1, 2, 3, 4 (or 6), 7±1, and 10±1&#xD;
      days post-infusion. In addition, when logistically feasible, an additional sample will be&#xD;
      obtained 5 days post-infusion (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioactivity measurements Samples will be obtained from the radiolabeled fresh and stored&#xD;
      platelets before infusion and used as a radioactive standard. By measuring the volume&#xD;
      infused, the total dose of radioactivity infused will be calculated. In vitro elution of the&#xD;
      label from the transfused platelets will be determined by two elution assessment methods, as&#xD;
      well as the in vivo elution of radioactivity from the serial blood samples obtained&#xD;
      post-infusion of the labeled platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard as well as the subject's whole-blood samples will be corrected for elution and&#xD;
      also for the residual activity in the cellular fraction on Day 8. The first four data points&#xD;
      post-infusion will be used to calculate in vivo recoveries and survivals after all&#xD;
      radioactive corrections have been made. The radioactivity of the samples will be determined&#xD;
      by use of a gamma counter. A multiple-hit model, with a computerized program &quot;COST,&quot; will be&#xD;
      used to estimate the recovery and survival of the radioactively labeled platelets.&#xD;
