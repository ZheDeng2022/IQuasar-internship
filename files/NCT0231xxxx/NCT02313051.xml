      Everolimus has been approved to be effective when used with exemestane after progression on&#xD;
      non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women based on the BOLERO-2 clinical&#xD;
      trial. However, the superiority of addition of everolimus to endocrine therapy hasn't been&#xD;
      established in the premenopausal women. This is a phase 2, multicentre clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the role of everolimus in the first-line endocrine treatment of premenopausal MBC&#xD;
      patients after progression on tamoxifen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endocrine therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with hormone receptor&#xD;
      (HR)-positive advanced breast cancer. The selection of endocrine agents takes account of the&#xD;
      menopausal status, the type of previous adjuvant endocrine treatment, the disease free&#xD;
      interval and past medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In premenopausal women with HR-positive advanced breast cancer, ovarian function suppression&#xD;
      combined with aromatase inhibitors is a standard first-line choice of hormone treatment,&#xD;
      especially patients progressed after tamoxifen. Unfortunately, not all patients have a&#xD;
      response to first-line endocrine therapy, and even patients who have a response will&#xD;
      eventually become resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An emerging mechanism of endocrine resistance in aberrant signaling through the&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling&#xD;
      pathway7-9. Growing evidence supports a close interaction between the mTOR pathway and ER&#xD;
      signaling. Everolimus is a sirolimus derivative that inhibits mTORactivation11. In&#xD;
      preclinical models, the use of everolimus in combination with aromatase inhibitors results in&#xD;
      synergistic inhibition of the proliferation and induction of apoptosis12. In a randomized,&#xD;
      phase 2 study comparing neoadjuvant everolimus plus letrozole with letrozole alone in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer, the response rate for the&#xD;
      combination was higher than that for letrozole alone. Recently, the Breast Cancer Trials of&#xD;
      Oral Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) study showed that the addition of everolimus to exemestane&#xD;
      significantly improved progression-free survival, with observed medians of 11 and 4 months,&#xD;
      corresponding to a 62% reduction in the hazard ratio14 which is impressive and practice&#xD;
      changing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, different from western countries, the majority (50-55%) of patients are&#xD;
      premenopausal women in Asia including China.The benefit of everolimus plus endocrine therapy&#xD;
      in premenopausal women have not yet been well delineated. Although there was a report that&#xD;
      efficacy was comparable between premenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      letrozole plus goserelin and postmenopausal patients treated with letrozole alone as first&#xD;
      line hormone therapy, it is generally accepted that endocrine treatment outcome in&#xD;
      premenopausal women, especially in younger age is known to be poor. So the addition of&#xD;
      everolimusin this population would be a potential viable treatment option to overcome&#xD;
      resistance to endocrine therapies that needs to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the feasibility of patients progressed on the endocrine continue to receive the&#xD;
      same endocrine agent plus everolimus is unclear. At the same time, the difference between&#xD;
      concurrent and sequential medication of endocrine agent and everolimus is not yet addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this rationale, the investigators introduced randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of addition of everolimus to letrozole with LHRH agonist in premenopausal metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer patients who failed to tamoxifen treatment and also explore the best schedule&#xD;
      of endocrine therapy together with everolimus.&#xD;
