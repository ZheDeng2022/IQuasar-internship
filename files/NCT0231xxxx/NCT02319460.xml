  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational cohort study is designed to obtain product safety information from the&#xD;
      routine clinical setting within large, diverse, community-based populations. In the setting&#xD;
      of acute major bleeding in which patients are treated for Vitamin K antagonist reversal, the&#xD;
      risk of thromboembolic events (TEE) in patients treated with Kcentra® and in patients treated&#xD;
      with plasma will be assessed.&#xD;
