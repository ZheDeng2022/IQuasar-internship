  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of bosutinib when given together&#xD;
      with inotuzumab ozogamicin and to see how well it works in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia that has come back or does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment. Bosutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Immunotoxins, such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, are antibodies linked to&#xD;
      a toxic substance and may help find cancer cells that express CD22 and kill them without&#xD;
      harming normal cells. Giving bosutinib together with inotuzumab ozogamicin may be a better&#xD;
      treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bosutinib in combination with&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with Philadelphia-chromosome positive (Ph+) acute&#xD;

      patients with Ph+ ALL and CML in lymphoid blast phase that express CD22. (Phase I) II. To&#xD;
      determine the duration of response of patients treated with this combination. (Phase I) III.&#xD;
      To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this combination. (Phase I) IV. To&#xD;
      determine the effect of the level of pre-treatment expression of CD22 with response to this&#xD;
      combination. (Phase I) V. To determine the efficacy of this combination according to&#xD;
      pre-treatment mutation status in the ABL kinase domain. (Phase I) VI. To determine the&#xD;
      minimal residual disease after treatment with this combination and its impact in long-term&#xD;
      outcome. (Phase I) VII. To determine the safety bosutinib in combination with inotuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin in patients with Ph+ ALL and CML in lymphoid blast phase that express CD22. (Phase&#xD;
      II) VIII. To determine the duration of response of patients treated with this combination.&#xD;
      (Phase II) IX. To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this combination.&#xD;

      response to this combination. (Phase II) XI. To determine the efficacy of this combination&#xD;
      according to pre-treatment mutation status in the abl kinase domain. (Phase II) XII. To&#xD;
      determine the minimal residual disease after treatment with this combination and its impact&#xD;
      in long-term outcome. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bosutinib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bosutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients with&#xD;
      confirmed complete response (CR), incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), complete cytogenetic&#xD;
      response (CCyR) and/or absence of minimal residual disease (MRD) may receive inotuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin IV on day 1 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
