  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of calcium channel blockers and beta&#xD;
      blockers for controlling tourniquet induced blood pressure increase in patients undergoing&#xD;
      carpal tunnel operations with IVRA. For this purpose files of patients undergoing operation&#xD;
      under IVRA were retrospectively examined in terms of demographical and hemodynamic variables.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After approval of the University Research Ethics Committee, the files of patients who have&#xD;
      been operated under intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) in orthopedics clinics between&#xD;
      January 2009 and January 2010 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 312 patients, 164&#xD;
      patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 148 patients with trigger finger have been operated&#xD;
      under IVRA. Out of 164 patients who have been operated due to carpal tunnel syndrome, 50&#xD;
      patients in which either calcium channel blockers or beta blockers were used for treatment of&#xD;
      critical blood pressure increase after tourniquet inflation and in which whole data were&#xD;
      obtained, were included to the study.The patients with systolic blood pressure above to 150&#xD;
      mmHg following tourniquet inflation and in which bolus dose of diltiazem 10 mg (Group I) or&#xD;
      calcium channel blocker 0.5mg/kg (Group II) have been administered by intravenous route&#xD;
      constituted the study groups. Demographical characteristics and hemodynamic parameters were&#xD;
      recorded from the patient files.&#xD;
