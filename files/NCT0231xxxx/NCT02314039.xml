      This cross sectional questionnaire based study will aim at exploring psychological factors at&#xD;
      play in the experience of acne, and their association with perceived and clinical severity.&#xD;
      We will focus in particular on the role of psychological trauma in the patients with acne and&#xD;
      their wellness. This project is being undertaken as part of a wider developing initiative in&#xD;
      the Dermatology Department within NHS Tayside, which aims at identifying and consequently&#xD;
      addressing the psychological needs of their patients. Participants will be consecutive&#xD;
      patients with acne aged at least 18 years old, seen in the outpatient clinics of the&#xD;
      Dermatology Department in NHS Tayside. Potential participants will be informed about the&#xD;
      research by their clinician during an outpatients appointment and if interested, given an&#xD;
      information sheet and consent form to review. Verbal consent will be sought by the clinician&#xD;
      to give the potential participant's contact details to the Chief Investigator (CI)/Research&#xD;
      Assistant (RA). If agreeable, the CI/RA will contact the potential participant after at least&#xD;
      24 hours to arrange a mutually agreed time for meeting. If the potential participant are&#xD;
      still keen to participate and has read the information sheet, fit our inclusion criteria, are&#xD;
      not deemed to be distressed by their attending clinician and want to take part, they will be&#xD;
      included. Participants will complete a number of standardised questionnaires and a&#xD;
      demographics information sheet in the outpatients' clinic with the CI/RA present. The&#xD;
      questionnaires include questions on psychological trauma history and symptomatology, general&#xD;
      psychological distress, appearance related distress and perceived severity of condition.&#xD;
      Clinical severity of their acne will be obtained from patient files after questionnaire&#xD;
      completion by NHS staff. Participants will also be given a debrief letter and additional&#xD;
      forms of support and information to take home with them. Participants will not be contacted&#xD;
      for follow-up.&#xD;

      The research questions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the association between psychological trauma symptoms, and perceived/clinical&#xD;
           severity of the condition?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the levels of psychological trauma symptoms exhibited in patients with acne?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the associations between traumatic history (in childhood and adulthood),&#xD;
           current traumatic symptoms exhibited and perceived/clinical severity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the association between psychological trauma symptomatology, trauma history,&#xD;
           general psychological distress, appearance-related distress and perceived/clinical&#xD;
           severity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A quantitative cross--sectional design will be used. Five self-report, standardised&#xD;
      questionnaires will be completed by participants and assisted by the Chief Investigator (CI)&#xD;
      or the Research Assistant (RA) to the study. The questionnaires contains measures on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      psychological trauma history; perceived severity of acne; general appearance--related&#xD;
      distress; and depression, stress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographics will be collected by asking participants to also complete a Demographics&#xD;
      Information sheet (measuring age, gender, time since diagnosis etc.). Information on&#xD;
      objective severity of acne will be provided by staff (e.g. named specialist nurse of&#xD;
      consultant dermatologist for each clinical site). Information on objective severity is&#xD;
      routinely measured in dermatology clinical practice and such information will be available in&#xD;
      file for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The population sample will be recruited from NHS Tayside dermatology&#xD;
      departments, i.e. Ninewells, Strathcathro and Perth Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure &amp; recruitment: The CI will liaise with Principal Investigator (PI), Dr Andrew&#xD;
      Affleck, and arrange to present the study to clinical staff teams in each of the names&#xD;
      clinical sites. The CI and RA will meet with relevant staff at the recruitment sites to&#xD;
      discuss the purpose and nature of the study prior to and throughout the recruitment and data&#xD;
      collection process. The researchers will also commit to present the findings of the research&#xD;
      to the participating clinical teams when the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Testing Phase: Information packs regarding the study will be provided to clinical staff&#xD;
      at the recruitment sites. The information packs will include: background information and&#xD;
      purpose of the study, and participant exclusion/inclusion criteria. Staff at the recruitment&#xD;
      sites will be asked to identify suitable participants who meet the criteria outlines in the&#xD;
      study. The CI and RA will not be required to review patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable participants will be initially approached by a familiar member of staff. The&#xD;
      clinician will inform the potential participant about the research, introduce the study with&#xD;
      an explanation of what would be involved in taking part and the potential participants will&#xD;
      be asked if they would be interested in considering participation in the study. If interest&#xD;
      is expressed, the potential participants will be provided with further information, including&#xD;
      a Participant Information Letter and a consent form. The potential participant will be given&#xD;
      the opportunity to ask the clinician questions about the study. Verbal consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the potential participant to pass their details onto the CI/RA so a meeting can&#xD;
      be arranged. Contact details will be given to the CI/RA either in person or via telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential participant will be given at least 24 hours to further consider the study&#xD;
      before the CI/RAcalls to arrange a meeting. A meeting will be arranged, at a mutually agreed&#xD;
      time at the clinic to meet each potential participant. The meeting will be arranged either at&#xD;
      the time of their follow up appointment or at another agreed time which is convenient for the&#xD;
      potential participant. The time between arranging the meeting and the actual meeting provides&#xD;
      the potential participants with additional time to consider participation in the study. On&#xD;
      the day of the scheduled appointment, the CI/RA will liaise with clinical staff in charge of&#xD;
      the care of the patient to check if the participant still meets eligibility criteria and if&#xD;
      they still wish to meet with the CI/RA. The CI/RA to the study will meet with the potential&#xD;
      participant to verbally review the Participant Information Letter and provide an opportunity&#xD;
      for the participants to ask any questions about the study. This will help ensure that the&#xD;
      potential participant understands the information presented and are able to provide informed&#xD;
      consent. If the potential participant would like to further consider participation, a further&#xD;
      meeting will be arranged. If the CI/RA contacts clinical staff and is informed that it is not&#xD;
      appropriate to meet with the participant at this time, for example, if the potential&#xD;
      participant is distressed or unwell on the day, the meeting will not take place that day.&#xD;
      However, if the participant still meets the eligibility criteria at a later date and wishes&#xD;
      to take part, the appointment can be rescheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Phase: Further to reviewing the Patient Information Letter, if the participant meets&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and provides agreement to take part, a signed informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. After the CI/RA has obtained signed consent from the participant, the study&#xD;
      measures will be completed. The CI/RA will remain present throughout the testing phase to&#xD;
      provide appropriate assistance with the completion of the measures. The CI/RA will offer to&#xD;
      read the questions and record the participant's responses in case the participant has&#xD;
      literacy difficulties or visual difficulties. The participant will also have a copy of the&#xD;
      questionnaires to view when they are being completed. Participants will be offered breaks,&#xD;
      however, if they become fatigued, they will also be offered to continue the testing on&#xD;
      another date or withdraw from the study. If for any other reason the participant becomes&#xD;
      distressed or the CI/RA deems the participant as unable to understand the study related&#xD;
      information or questionnaires, the testing will be discontinued and appropriate action in&#xD;
      line with clinical practice will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Testing Phase: Following the completion of the testing phase, each participant will be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to discuss their participation in the study and raise concerns of&#xD;
      difficulties they experienced during completion of the study. Participants will also be made&#xD;
      aware that they can discuss their experience with a named independent person, whose contact&#xD;
      will be clearly mentioned in the Debrief. Should participants become distressed or highlight&#xD;
      concerns, the CI will use her clinical skills, as a Practitioner Counselling and Health&#xD;
      Psychologist and Psychotherapist Counsellor. The RA to the study will be supervised closely&#xD;
      and frequently by the CI. The RA is knowledgeable in the area of skin disorders and acne in&#xD;
      particular at Masters level, and has worked in many clinical studies before as part of her&#xD;
      post with the Mental Health Research Network. She also has a certificate in Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (June, 2014). When data collection is carried out by the RA, the RA will perform her&#xD;
      duty of care at all times and will follow good practice and ethics for research guidelines.&#xD;
      Any concerns the RA has, she will discuss with the CI immediately, who will be available to&#xD;
      be contacted during meeting with participants and will provide her with further guidance&#xD;
      about which course of action should it be necessary. If distress escalates and the CI is&#xD;
      unavailable, the RA will contact appropriate clinical staff (e.g. Dr Andrew Affleck, a named&#xD;
      nurse or another consultant dermatologist on site) for advice and input, if necessary.&#xD;
      Potential participants will be made aware of these stages and limitations to confidentiality&#xD;
      prior to consenting to take part. A Patient Information Sheet will be completed by the&#xD;
      patient along with the rest of the measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical severity score will be obtained from patient files by clinical staff. The CI and the&#xD;
      RA will have no contact with patient files. The study packs will be anonymised prior to&#xD;
      administration, i.e. a participant code will be printed on every page of the pack, including&#xD;
      the participant information letter, consent form and participant debrief. Consent forms will&#xD;
      be separately handed to Dr Andrew Affleck in person and will be securely kept locked in a&#xD;
      cabinet on NHS Tayside premises. Completed questionnaires will be separated from consent&#xD;
      forms immediately after completion and questionnaires will be kept separately on Edinburgh&#xD;
      Napier University premises. From that point on, the CI and the RA will have no access to the&#xD;
      consent forms. Only Dr Affleck will have access to the consent forms. Anonymised data will be&#xD;
      entered on a electronic statistical package (SPSSX) that will be password protected. As part&#xD;
      of the governance of the study, we have now put in place, Professor Kevin Power, Head of&#xD;
      Psychological Services, NHS Tayside, has agreed to monitor the clinical governance of this&#xD;
      research study. The researchers, i.e. CI and the RA, will score the psychological trauma&#xD;
      screening questionnaires on the spot. If the participants are identified in the testing phase&#xD;
      as scoring within the clinical range in post-traumatic symptoms, the CI will notify the&#xD;
      consultant dermatologist in charge of this patient, who will then notify Prof. Power. Prof.&#xD;
      Power will ensure that such patients enter an appropriate clinical pathway via appropriate&#xD;
      referral. Participants will be notified of this governance as part of their information&#xD;
      letter and participant debrief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: The measures will be administered by the CI or the RA by paper and pencil or&#xD;
      verbally, if required.&#xD;
