  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the general intensive care unit (ICU) population, there is strong evidence for benefit&#xD;
      from lung-protective mechanical ventilation, including the use of low tidal volumes and&#xD;
      adequate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In burn patients it is highly&#xD;
      uncertain whether these settings are beneficial and there are even concerns over safety of,&#xD;
      in particular use of low tidal volumes. There is lack of international guidelines and&#xD;
      consequently ventilation practice in burn patients may widely vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine ventilation practice in burn ICUs worldwide, focusing&#xD;
      on the size of tidal volumes and the levels of PEEP used for burn patients. In addition, data&#xD;
      on other strategies considered important in patients who receive ventilation are also&#xD;
      collected, including data on neuromuscular blocking agents, sedatives and analgesics, and&#xD;
      type and amount of intravenous fluids used in the period of ventilation. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the association between tidal volume size and levels of PEEP, and&#xD;
      duration of ventilation in burn patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient population: Consecutive burn patients admitted to participating burn ICUs who receive&#xD;
      invasive ventilation, irrespective of severity of burn injury and/or presence of inhalation&#xD;
      trauma are eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: includes burn patients admitted within a period of three months. Demographic&#xD;
      and baseline data are collected from the clinical files on the day of admission. If&#xD;
      available, standard of care and clinical outcome parameters are collected daily until day 14,&#xD;
      death or discharge from ICU, whatever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The primary objective is to determine (variations in) ventilation practice in&#xD;
      burn patients in burn ICUs. Therefore, the sample size is based on the main secondary&#xD;
      objective, which is to determine the association between the following ventilator settings:&#xD;
      tidal volume, PEEP, FiO2 and mode; and outcome of burn patients. The investigators calculated&#xD;
      the sample size for a multiple regression model: a sample size of at least 300 patients is&#xD;
      required to have a power of 0.80, a significance level of 0.05, using an estimated effect&#xD;
      size of 0.04, while using 4 independent variables in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Approval: National coordinators will be responsible for clarifying the need for ethics&#xD;
      approval and applying for this where appropriate according to local policy. Centres will not&#xD;
      be permitted to record data unless ethics approval or an equivalent waiver is in place. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that in most, if not every participating country, a patient informed&#xD;
      consent is not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring: Due to the observational nature of the study, a DSMB is not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization: National co-ordinators will lead the project within individual nations and&#xD;
      identify participating hospitals, translate study paperwork, distribute study paperwork and&#xD;
      ensure necessary regulatory approvals are in place. They provide assistance to the&#xD;
      participating clinical sites in trial management, record keeping and data management. Local&#xD;
      coordinators in each site will supervise data collection and ensure adherence to Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice during the trial.&#xD;

If ventilation is prolonged after surgery due to respiratory insufficiency, the day(s) ventilation is required counts as a 'ventilator day'</description>
