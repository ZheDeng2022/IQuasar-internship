    <textblock>
      This project which is fully funded by the European Union FP7 Program is designed to pull&#xD;
      together all the information we obtain from scans and x-rays to design a personalised 3-D&#xD;
      digital model of each patient, their anatomy and disease. We can then use this as follows: as&#xD;
      (i) an aid to surgical planning to enable objective clinical decision making (ii) a decision&#xD;
      support tool to communicate the available treatment options to the patient and facilitate&#xD;
      shared decision making and provision of personalised care and (iii) to enable standardised&#xD;
      objective evaluation of the aesthetic outcome of the treatment procedures. This study aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate the ability of the Virtual Physiological Human concept to empower breast cancer&#xD;
      patients and assess the impact on their care and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer to affect women in Europe, having a lifetime risk of&#xD;
      1 in 9. It is an increasingly treatable disease, and 10-year survival now exceeds 80%. The&#xD;
      primary treatment for breast cancer is surgery, which may be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Given the high breast cancer&#xD;
      survival rate, many women will live for many years with the potentially disfiguring aesthetic&#xD;
      consequences of their surgical and therapeutic treatment. A good aesthetic outcome is an&#xD;
      important endpoint for breast cancer treatment and is closely related to psychosocial&#xD;
      recovery and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a woman faces a breast cancer diagnosis, and surgery is proposed, several options are&#xD;
      available. The decision as to which type of surgery to offer patients is largely subjective&#xD;
      and based almost exclusively on the judgment and experience of the clinician. The cosmetic&#xD;
      outcome of surgery is a function of many factors including tumour size and location, the&#xD;
      volume of the breast, its density, and the dose and distribution of radiotherapy. In&#xD;
      breast-conserving surgery, there is evidence that approximately 30% of women receive a&#xD;
      suboptimal or poor aesthetic outcome; however there is currently no standardised method of&#xD;
      identifying these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PICTURE project aims to address these issues by providing objective tools, tailored to&#xD;
      the individual patient, to predict the aesthetic outcome of local treatment. Using a&#xD;
      combination of 3D photography and routinely acquired radiological images (i.e. mammography,&#xD;
      ultrasound and MRI, when available), together with information about the tumour (size,&#xD;
      location, shape etc.) we will develop techniques to biomechanically model the anatomy of the&#xD;
      breast and the effect of surgical removal of cancerous tissue. This digital patient&#xD;
      representation and associated predictive tools will enable alternative surgical strategies to&#xD;
      be explored and the consequences of the available options, with respect to the appearance of&#xD;
      the breast, to be visualised. This will aid communication with the patient of the type of&#xD;
      breast surgery recommended by the surgeon, and will empower patients to take an active role&#xD;
      in a shared decision making process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will develop tools to enable the patient's aesthetic appearance after treatment to&#xD;
      be objectively evaluated. Current techniques use subjective methods, such as assessment by an&#xD;
      expert panel, or computer analysis of 2-dimensional photography to estimate, for instance,&#xD;
      breast asymmetry. By adopting recent developments in low cost 3D photography and depth&#xD;
      sensing technology, we will develop a standardised, reproducible analysis tool which will&#xD;
      base the aesthetic outcome evaluation on both the 3-dimensional shape of the reconstructed&#xD;
      breast and its volume. This will establish standardised quality assurance and evaluation&#xD;
      procedures, enabling institutions across Europe to be compared and factors that have a&#xD;
      positive or negative impact on surgical outcome identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the demonstrator created by the PICTURE project will integrate models of surgical&#xD;
      techniques and treatment schemes, clinical patient data, multi-modal imaging and&#xD;
      individualised models of patient anatomy to build a personalised, digital representation of&#xD;
      the patient. The aim is for this to be used as an aid to surgical planning, via simulation of&#xD;
      the cosmetic effects of breast conserving surgery, as a decision support tool to communicate&#xD;
      the available options to the patient and to enable standardised evaluation and a safe outcome&#xD;
      of the procedure. The demonstrator aims to empower patients and will have a direct impact on&#xD;
      their care and quality of life.&#xD;
