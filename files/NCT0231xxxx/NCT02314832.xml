    <textblock>
      Blocking sensation from the femoral nerve by injecting local anesthetic around the nerve&#xD;
      plays an important role in pain control after total knee replacement. However, femoral nerve&#xD;
      block has been associated with increased risk of falls due to weakness of the thigh muscle.&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized controlled trial asks the question whether blocking the more&#xD;
      distal branch of the femoral nerve (saphenous nerve) will result in less muscle motor block,&#xD;
      and thus less risk of falls. The study also aims to compare pain control after both&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the patient is willing to participate and signs the consent, he/she will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of the two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Femoral nerve block&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adductor canal block&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care anesthesia regimen for this surgery is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Patients will receive their Multimodal Perioperative Pain Protocol (MP3) medication as&#xD;
      per routine care in the patient receiving area. All blocks are performed in the pre-operative&#xD;
      holding area with standard ASA monitors applied. Typically, patients receive 1-2 mg of&#xD;
      midazolam and 50-100 mcg of fentanyl for sedation during the placement of the block. Standard&#xD;
      operating procedure of the block room will be followed. Block time out will be preformed&#xD;
      according to standard operating procedure. All blocks will be done under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
      Sonosite (S nerve) machine will be used with a high frequency linear (HFL) US probe with 6-13&#xD;
      MHZ frequency. Both CFNB and ACB will take be performed according to the SOP in the&#xD;
      investigators department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CFNB: Images of the femoral nerve will be obtained in the short axis. 1% lidocaine will&#xD;
      be used for local infiltration of the skin. A 2 inch 18 G touhy needle ( B Braun) will be&#xD;
      advanced in plane under US guidance . Confirmation may take place with Quadricpes muscle&#xD;
      twitches and patella movement between 0.3 and 0.4mA (2Hz; 0.1ms). A bolus of 20 ml of&#xD;
      Ropivicaine 0.5% will be injected. A non stimulating catheter will be advanced through the&#xD;
      needle to a distance of 3-4 cm beyond the needle tip. Catheter will be secured in place using&#xD;
      benzoin, Steristrips, and a tegaderm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the ACB: ultrasound survey at the medial part of the thigh will take place, halfway&#xD;
      between the superior anterior iliac spine and the patella. In a short axis view, the femoral&#xD;
      artery will be identified underneath the sartorius muscle, with the vein just inferior and&#xD;
      the saphenous nerve just lateral to the artery. The needle will be introduced in-plane and 2&#xD;
      to 3 mL of LA bolus (0.2% ropivicaine) will be used to verify correct placement of the needle&#xD;
      in the vicinity of the saphenous nerve in the adductor canal. A bolus of total volume of 20&#xD;
      ml of Ropivicaine 0.5% will be injected through the needle. The catheter will then be&#xD;
      introduced and advanced 2-3 cm beyond the tip of the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of surgery a large obaque dressing will be applied from the femoral crease&#xD;
      to the mid thigh region so that the catheter location will be concealed. Both catheters will&#xD;
      be connected to a pump that will infuse local anesthetic. Ropivicaine 0.2% at 8 ml/hour.&#xD;
      There is usually a period of time before the patient transport to the operating room during&#xD;
      which the investigators will be able to evaluate if the block is effective and sufficient for&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive either general or spinal anesthesia in the operating room. All patients&#xD;
      will receive prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting during surgery. Regimen for prophylaxis&#xD;
      include a single dose of dexamethasone after induction of anesthesia and a single dose of&#xD;
      Ondansetron 20 minutes before recovery from anesthesia. This study is not deviating from the&#xD;
      standard of care anesthetic regimen for this surgical procedure at Penn Presbyterian Medical&#xD;
      Center. Only the type of blocks will be different between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia All PACU analgesia will follow standard of care protocol for post&#xD;
      operative care at PPMC. Hydromorphone 0.2 mg iv q5 minutes as necessary. The infusion of the&#xD;
      local anesthetic will start in the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PACU, patients are assessed for pain with the Visual Analog Scale (pain scale of 1 to&#xD;
      10) at routine time points for the duration of their stay. The worse VAS score will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia will follow the MP3 protocol. The protocol includes administration of&#xD;
      around the clock acetaminophen, Celebrex, gabapentin, immediate and extended release&#xD;
      oxycodone.&#xD;
