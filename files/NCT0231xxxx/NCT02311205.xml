    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II, prospective, open-label, single arm, single center study of the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of concurrent conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and&#xD;
      sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic metastasis. All of the&#xD;
      55 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and newly diagnosed extrahepatic (lung, bone, lymph&#xD;
      node, adrenal gland) metastasis will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On demand conventional TACE will be performed in all the patients after enrollment and can be&#xD;
      continued until intrahepatic CR, TACE failure or consent withdrawal. Sorafenib will be&#xD;
      started 3-7 days after the first and each subsequent TACE and stopped one day before next&#xD;
      TACE and will be continued until sorafenib failure, consent withdrawal or condition worsening&#xD;
      by clinical decision. Repeated on-demand TACE and sorafenib should continue until the&#xD;
      criteria for treatment discontinuation are met. After initiation of sorafenib combination&#xD;
      treatment, patients will be seen and will perform routine examination at week 4 and, after&#xD;
      then routine examination will be followed every 6 ± 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, prospective, phase II study in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      HCC. A total of 55 patients with HCC and newly diagnosed extrahepatic (lung, bone, lymph&#xD;
      node, adrenal gland) metastasis will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On demand conventional TACE will be performed in all the patients after enrollment and can be&#xD;
      continued until intrahepatic CR, TACE failure or consent withdrawal. Safety will be evaluated&#xD;
      every 6 ± 2 weeks after initial TACE and closed monitoring at unscheduled visit will be done&#xD;
      as well. The efficacy of TACE will be evaluated every 6 ± 2 weeks after each session of TACE&#xD;
      using dynamic CT or MRI. Performance of repeated TACE will be decided based on the findings&#xD;
      of follow-up CT, patients' liver function and performance status, within 6 ± 2 weeks of the&#xD;
      previous TACE. Patients with no residual viable tumors after previous TACE who are not&#xD;
      indicated for further TACE are evaluated with routine examination and imaging studies every 6&#xD;
      ± 2 weeks. Safety should be evaluated on an ongoing basis and within 3 days of next TACE. All&#xD;
      eligible patients will be given sorafenib (initially 400mg po bid) on day 3-7 after the first&#xD;
      or every session of TACE, and sorafenib will be stopped one day before each TACE. Sorafenib&#xD;
      will be continued until sorafenib failure, consent withdrawal or condition worsening by&#xD;
      clinical decision. Treatment failure will be judged by the evaluation of intra- or&#xD;
      extrahepatic lesion separately. TACE failure is defined as when TACE/transarterial&#xD;
      chemo-lipiodolization (TACL) has no more benefit by clinical assessment which is judged&#xD;
      clinically by one investigator and/or the patient is not more eligible because of worsening&#xD;
      of ECOG PS or liver function. Detailed criteria for stopping TACE will be clarified in below.&#xD;
      Sorafenib failure will be evaluated by modified RECIST applied to the extrahepatic lesion,&#xD;
      and sorafenib will be stopped when progressive disease (PD) by mRECIST for extrahepatic&#xD;
      lesion is indicated and clinical benefit of TACE is not expected for intrahepatic lesion. As&#xD;
      long as TACE is evaluated to be beneficial and planned to be performed by investigator,&#xD;
      sorafenib could be continued if side effect is tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When any of the treatment discontinuation criteria is met, test treatment will be stopped.&#xD;
      Survival and post-treatment information will be collected at 1-3 months intervals after the&#xD;
      last study visit until the endpoint of death, or until the subject has become lost to&#xD;
      follow-up or until study termination by Principal Investigator. Additional palliative&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapies such as cytotoxic chemotherapy and TACL without gelfoam embolization&#xD;
      and palliative radiation therapy will be allowed and recorded.&#xD;
