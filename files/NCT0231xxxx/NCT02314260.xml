      After approval of the ethical &amp; scientific committees of the OBGYN department of Kasr El Aini&#xD;
      hospital, 80 primigravidas undergoing induction of labour at our hospital in a prospective&#xD;
      blind study were subjected to history taking, examination, investigations &amp; ultrasonography.&#xD;
      Indication for pregnancy termination was explained to each patient and a written consent was&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination &amp; assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were examined vaginally by the attending physician and a Bishop score was assigned&#xD;
      and recorded according to the original bishop scoring system 1964 (Bishop EH, 1964) as seen&#xD;
      in table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: The Bishop score (Bishop EH, 1964):&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 points : for no dilation, effacement 0-30%, station -3, firm consistency &amp; posterior&#xD;
      position of cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. point : for dilation 1-2 cm, effacement 40-50%, station -2, medium consistency &amp; mid&#xD;
           position of cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. points: for dilation 3-4 cm, effacement 60-70%, station -1, soft consistency &amp; Anterior&#xD;
           position of cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. points: for dilation 5-6 cm, effacement 80%, station +1 or +2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sum of the points in each criteria assessed will be the bishop score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans-vaginal ultrasound assessment of cervical length was performed using the same machine&#xD;
      each time Sonoace x4 (samsung Medison Co., Ltd. Seoul, South Korea) following a standardized&#xD;
      technique in which the bladder was emptied &amp; the vaginal probe 6.5MHz was introduced into the&#xD;
      vagina and manipulated so that the main anatomical landmarks (bladder, fetal presentation,&#xD;
      cervical canal, internal and external cervical os) were identified. The hyper echoic line&#xD;
      extending from the internal os to external os, was identified by fine manipulations of the&#xD;
      probe. The cervical canal length was measured as the distance between the internal and&#xD;
      external os, while presence of funneling was recorded. Funneling was defined as a (V)or (U)&#xD;
      shaped indentation of the internal os. In the presence of funneling, the length of an&#xD;
      associated funnel was not included as part of the cervical length, and the measurement was&#xD;
      taken from the apex of the funnel to the external os.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified bishop score was devised for the purpose of this study, which aimed to incorporate&#xD;
      cervical length into the bishop scoring system. This score was calculated by addition or&#xD;
      subtraction of the figure obtained respectively for cervical length in table 2 from the&#xD;
      original bishop score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2: Scoring System for respective cervical length&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score: -2 for Cervical length &gt; 2.5cm by trans-vaginal ultrasound. Score: -1 for Cervical&#xD;
      length 2 - 2.5 cm by trans-vaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score: 0 for Cervical length 1.6 - 1.9 cm by trans-vaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score: +1 for Cervical length 1 - 1.5 cm by trans-vaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score: +2 for Cervical length &lt; 1 cm by trans-vaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think an unfavorable score should decrease the value of the bishop score, and not just&#xD;
      fail to increase it (in comparison to the original score) &amp; hence our negative value for&#xD;
      unfavorable cervical length. The values used to set the figures for the max and min score for&#xD;
      cervical length in table 2 were based on our observation of how several studies displayed the&#xD;
      range of their results for cervical length and how we think that it should impact the bishop&#xD;
      score. There is no exact pre-set cut off value for what a favorable cervical length should&#xD;
      be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labour induction and Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of labor was carried out as per our hospital's standard protocol, in which patients&#xD;
      with unfavorable cervical examination i.e. bishop score of 4 or less were given dinoprostone&#xD;
      3mg (Dinoglandin E2 Â® Egypharma Nasr City Cairo Egypt) vaginal tablet, with re-dosing&#xD;
      intervals every six hours if no significant cervical changes were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where the initial bishop score was 5 or more, or improvement was seen after&#xD;
      dinoprostone, Oxytocin was initiated for induction. In cases already having one or more&#xD;
      dinoprostone vaginal tablets, oxytocin was started four hours after the final dinoprostone&#xD;
      dose, using the low-dose protocol beginning with 2 mU/min (and increase by 2 mU/min) at&#xD;
      incremental time intervals (15 - 30 minutes). The goal was to reach satisfactory contractions&#xD;
      (3-5 per ten minutes with each contraction lasting 45 seconds), &amp; to avoid uterine&#xD;
      hyperstimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All through induction &amp; labor fetal heart rate was measured every 30 minutes in first stage&#xD;
      of labor and every 10 minutes in second stage of labor. Progress of labor was observed &amp;&#xD;
      recorded, the total amount of oxytocin used, fetal weight and Apgar score for each baby were&#xD;
      recorded. The total time taken till reaching active phase of labor, total time taken till&#xD;
      delivery &amp; mode of delivery were recorded. Any decision to proceed to caesarean was reviewed&#xD;
      by a senior consultant and the indication was noted. Any case undergoing caesarean for any&#xD;
      indication other than failure of progress will be omitted from the results.&#xD;

          <title>New Modified Bishop Score</title>
          <description>The modified bishop score, is tailored by criteria we added to incorporate cervical length into the old bishop score.&#xD;
it can have a range between (-2 &amp; 15). low scores bellow 5 are associated with failed induction , while high scores are associated with successful vaginal delivery.&#xD;
there are no set cut-off value for failed induction</description>

          <title>Apgar score at 5 minutes</title>
          <description>Apgar score is a method to assess the health of a newborn immediately after birth.&#xD;
It is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on 5 simple criteria on a scale from 0-2, then adding the five values obtained.&#xD;
The resulting Apgar score ranges from 0-10. The 5 criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance,Pulse,Grimace,Activity,Respiration).&#xD;
The test is generally done at 1 &amp; 5 minutes after birth. Scores 7 &amp; above are normal, 4-6 fairly low,and 3 and below are critically low.A low score on the one-minute test, may indicate neonate requires medical attention</description>
