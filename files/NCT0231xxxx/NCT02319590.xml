      The study aims 1) to determine autoantibody titers against the AGTR1 receptor and against the&#xD;
      ETA receptor, 2) to characterize cytokine expression profiles of heart-specific activated T&#xD;
      cells in patients with systolic heart failure. Auto-antibody titers and specific cytokine&#xD;
      expression profiles in heart-specific activated T cells will then be correlated with heart&#xD;
      failure progression and outcome.&#xD;

      1. AIM OF THE STUDY 1.1. Background Progressive interstitial fibrosis parallels&#xD;
           pathological remodeling in the failing heart. This is particularly the case in patients&#xD;
           with post-inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy, but is also observed in ischemic and&#xD;
           hypertensive heart disease. Both, Angiotensin II (AngII) and Endothelin-1 (ET1) induce&#xD;
           the formation of the profibrotic cytokine TGFβ and promote fibrosis. From this point of&#xD;
           view, it is not surprising that blocking the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone-System (RAAS)&#xD;
           evolved as key strategy to slow heart failure progression. Furthermore, recent data also&#xD;
           points to an important role of Angiotensin II signaling in heart failure with preserved&#xD;
           ejection fraction. In animal models, blocking the effect of AngII or ET1 reduces&#xD;
           fibrotic remodeling following myocardial ischemia or in pulmonal hypertension. In line&#xD;
           with these findings, we found no evidence of fibrotic remodeling in AGTR1-/- mice who&#xD;
           recovered from acute myocarditis. Nevertheless, RAAS blockade is not efficient enough to&#xD;
           completely prevent heart failure progression or even rapid deterioration in subgroups of&#xD;
           the affected patients. Only recently, Riemekasten et al demonstrated that&#xD;
           auto-antibodies against AGTR1 and ETAR are increased in systemic sclerosis and&#xD;
           associated with increased pulmonary hypertension and lung fibrosis (2). Moreover, these&#xD;
           auto-antibodies were shown to be functional active and to induce downstream expression&#xD;
           of TGFβ -mRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anti-AGTR1-Ab and Anti-ETAR-Ab might therefore directly promote fibrosis through&#xD;
           activation of AGTR1 and ETAR. Furthermore, auto-reactive T-cells to the myosin heavy&#xD;
           chain (MyHC) of the heart muscle were demonstrated to play an important role in both the&#xD;
           initial inflammation during myocarditis as well as the progression of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Rationale for the current study Cardiac autoantibody titers are generally elevated&#xD;
           in patients after myocardial infarction or suffering from systolic heart failure. In&#xD;
           addition, we found experimental evidence for a critical role of AngII signaling in the&#xD;
           development of cardiac fibrosis. We hypothesize that auto-immunological effects in&#xD;
           general, and Anti-AGTR1-Ab, Anti- ETAR-Ab and auto-reactive T-cells in particular, are&#xD;
           important and so far widely underestimated in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies and&#xD;
           that they interfere with evidence based treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Aims The objectives of this study are to&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  determine the concentration of Anti-AGTR1- and Anti-ETRA-AB in the patients blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  determine the auto-reactive heart specific T-cells and their cytokine expression&#xD;
                profile in patients blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  to correlate these findings to outcome (hospitalizations due to heart failure,&#xD;
                stroke, myocardial infarction, and death) and to cardiac function of the patient&#xD;
                (VO2, Ejection fraction, NYHA class).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN Prospective pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PARTICITPANT ENTRY 3.1. Pre---registration evaluation Patients with cardiomyopathy and&#xD;
           heart failure for 6 months or more will be recruited at the GZO Spital Wetzikon during&#xD;
           ambulatory visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES 4.1. Efficacy variables and examinations 4.1.1 non---study&#xD;
           specific variables and examinations Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  general information: age, gender, weight, height&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  actual medications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  staging of heart failure according to the severty of symptoms and physical activity&#xD;
                (New York Heart Association-classification) Electrocardiogram (ECG) For all&#xD;
                electrocardiographic recordings a commercially available 12-lead ECG will be used&#xD;
                and set at 25mm/s paper speed and 10mm/mV amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transthoracal echocardiography (TTE) TTE will be performed by a cardiologist. The&#xD;
           following parameters will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Left ventricular ejection fraction using Simpson Biplan method&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Left atrial diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peak velocity E, A; E/A quotient; TDI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Flow in pulmonary veines&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1.2 Study specific variables and examinations Determinations of Anti-AGTR1-AB and&#xD;
           Anti-ETRA-AB Concentrations of Anti-AGTR1-AB and Anti-ETRA-AB will be measured using&#xD;
           commercially available ELISA-Kits according to manufactures protocol (Celltrend,&#xD;
           Luckenwalde, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation of auto-reactive T-Cells Auto-reactive T-cells will be isolated from patient&#xD;
           blood and analysed as described for organ-specificity (cMET+), for their reactivity&#xD;
           against cardiac self-antigens and for their cytokine expression profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW---UP The investigations during the visit are described in&#xD;
           paragraph 4. The assessment are performed during the initial visit, at 4 months, and at&#xD;
           12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS As this is a pilot study and no published data on the&#xD;
           observed parameters in cardiomyopathies are available, no power analysis was performed.&#xD;
           Groups will be compared using ANOVA. Statistical significance will be assumed at a&#xD;
           probability of p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. REGULATORY ISSUES 7.1 Ethic approval The study will be conducted according to the&#xD;
           current declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice-guidelines and Swiss&#xD;
           regulatory authority´s requirements. The study has been approved by the KEK (local&#xD;
           ethics committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 Consent Written consent will be sought from participants only after full explanation&#xD;
           of the study and time allowed for consideration. The right of the participant to refuse&#xD;
           to participate without giving reasons will be respected. If the participant withdrawls&#xD;
           his/her consent, data collected to the date of the withdrawal will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.3 Confidentiality All study personnel will preserve the confidentiality of&#xD;
           participants taking part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.4 Insurance Insurance is covered by &quot;Zurich Versicherungsgesellschaft AG&quot; for GZO&#xD;
           Spital Wetzikon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. QUALITY CONTROL 8.1 Audits The investigators welcome audits by regulatory bodies to&#xD;
           ensure adherence to GCP and regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Data management A designated research nurse and/or research fellow will be responsible&#xD;
      for data collection and data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3 Data privacy Access to personal data of participants is strictly limited to the&#xD;
      investigators aforementioned. Raw data will be archieved for at least 10 years. Blood samples&#xD;
      willbe analysed at the Center for Molecular Cardiology of the University of Zurich in the&#xD;
      group for cardioimmunology and destroyed after definitive analysis. Blood sample collection&#xD;
      will be done at GZO Spital Wetzikon. The blood samples will be anonymised directly after&#xD;
      collection. All data sheets, blood samples and data fromanalysis will be anonymised to a&#xD;
      two-digit code. The key to match the two-digit-code to the personal data of the patient will&#xD;
      be stored in a separate, password-protected data base. Only the principal investigator and&#xD;
      investigator Dr. med. Nazmi Krasniqi will have access to this data base.&#xD;
