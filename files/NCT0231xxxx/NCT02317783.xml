  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial goal of the investigators interdisciplinary group of imagers, oncologists,&#xD;
      neurologists, neuro-psychologists, and biostatisticians is to obtain proof of concept pilot&#xD;
      data for eventual submission of a National Cancer Institute Quick-Trial for Imaging and&#xD;
      Image-Guided Interventions: Exploratory Grant (R10) depending on the results of this pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to use [18F]Flutemetamol, FDG-PET, and MRI to better understand&#xD;
      CICI, which effects up to 16 -50% of individuals receiving long-term adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.2,3 To date there have been few studies examining this problem using&#xD;
      multi-modality imaging techniques to better understand this complex and significant problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG-PET and MRI are routinely used in clinical practice for the evaluation of cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction in older populations complaining of memory dysfunction. It is well recognized&#xD;
      that FDG-PET can assist with the differentiation and characterization of various cognitive&#xD;
      disorders due to unique patterns of cerebral metabolism caused by various cognitive and&#xD;
      dementia-causing disorders.4-6 FDG-PET has been studied extensively in dementia research and&#xD;
      has a high reliability in detecting Alzheimers disease (AD) many years before it can be&#xD;
      diagnosed reliably using clinical criteria.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, there has been only a single small study using FDG-PET and&#xD;
      bolus water activation paradigms in cancer patients complaining of memory problems.7 To date,&#xD;
      there have been no studies using [18F]Flutemetamol as a PET imaging agent to assess the&#xD;
      possibility of increased amyloid plaque burden as a potential contributing factor to the&#xD;
      cognitive deficits and complaints seen in patients experiencing CICI. The novel feature of&#xD;
      this project is in the combined use of [18F]Flutemetamol-PET, FDG-PET, and anatomic MRI to&#xD;
      study a poorly understood but common problem: cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If [18F]Flutemetamol, FDG-PET, and MRI can provide information on the pathophysiology of this&#xD;
      disorder, it will be an important step in better understanding the etiology of this&#xD;
      phenomenon and possibly other conditions resulting in cognitive dysfunction. These imaging&#xD;
      assessments will make it possible to explore any altered changes in cerebral structure,&#xD;
      metabolism, and amyloid deposition that may be responsible for CICI. This may help to predict&#xD;
      which individuals may be affected by this problem and provide information for eventual&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies to treat this common cancer-associated disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use [18F]Flutemetamol and FDG-PET imaging to assess and quantify the amyloid&#xD;
      plaque burden and cerebral glucose metabolism, respectively, in breast cancer patients&#xD;
      suffering from CICI and correlate those findings with structural changes on MRI. The&#xD;
      [18F]Flutemetamol and FDG-PET scans of these study patients will then be compared to two GE&#xD;
      software databases (CortexID-FDG and CortexID-Flutemetamol) which contain scan data from&#xD;
      healthy control individuals to evaluate for abnormalities in cerebral glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      amyloid plaque burden differing from the values expected for individuals in their age range.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this research study. There&#xD;
             is inadequate experience with the safety of Flutemetamol in children and therefore&#xD;
             this radiopharmaceutical should not be used in patients under the age of 18.&#xD;
             Individuals over 70 years age will be excluded as the incidence of amyloid positivity&#xD;
             increases significantly even with no cognitive problems and will not allow for testing&#xD;
             of our primary hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a histologically proven diagnosis of Stage I through IIIC Breast&#xD;
             Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have completed adjuvant chemotherapy within at least 6 months, but no&#xD;
             more than 36 months prior to initial study scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must report persistent cognitive problems, defined as being one or more&#xD;
             standard deviations above normative data on our two scales of subjective cognitive&#xD;
             dysfunction. This is defined as a total score of 45 or higher on the Cognitive Failure&#xD;
             Questionnaire, and a T-score of 60 or higher on the Frontal System Behavioral Scale&#xD;
             Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to have clinical and radiographic endpoints and the results of&#xD;
             histopathologic tissue analysis and other laboratory information entered into a&#xD;
             research database, as evidenced by signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients, or their legal guardians, must sign a written informed consent and HIPAA&#xD;
             authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered&#xD;
             radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune&#xD;
             diseases may be enrolled at the Investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are too claustrophobic to undergo MRI or PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of neurological disease known to affect cognition (e.g., stroke, head injury&#xD;
             with loss of consciousness of greater than 30 minutes, seizure disorder, demyelinating&#xD;
             disorder, mental retardation, primary brain tumor, brain metastases, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or past major psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar affective&#xD;
             disorder)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of stroke or mass lesion on CT or MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcoholism or other substance abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of cholinesterase inhibitors, other cognitive enhancers, antipsychotics,&#xD;
             antidepressants, or anticonvulsant medications&#xD;
