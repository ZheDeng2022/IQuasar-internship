  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the most prevalent type of urinary incontinence, is&#xD;
      defined as involuntary loss of urine during effort, or physical exertion (e.g. sporting&#xD;
      activities), or upon sneezing, or coughing (Haylen et al, 2010). The overall prevalence of&#xD;
      stress, urge, mixed, and any UI was 23.7%, 9.9%, 14.5%, and 49.2%, respectively (Minassian et&#xD;
      al, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous epidemiologic studies show that parity is a risk factor for SUI. Other significant&#xD;
      risk factors are age, weight, obesity, chronic pulmonary diseases, ethnic background, and&#xD;
      menopause. (Minassian et al, 2008; Matthews et al, 2013) Urinary incontinence affects four&#xD;
      times more women (51.1%) than men (13.9%) (Markland et al, 2011). It has an impact on the&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial, social, personal, and economic well-being of the affected individuals&#xD;
      and of their families. It is associated with a concomitant impairment of activities and&#xD;
      participation, and a higher risk of suffering from anxiety disorders has been shown.&#xD;
      (Goldstick &amp; Constantini, 2014; Hunskaar et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUI is increasingly recognized as a health and economic problem, which not only troubles the&#xD;
      affected women, but also implies a substantial economic burden on the health and social&#xD;
      services (Hampel et al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, as physiotherapy has proven to be good value for the money, its effectiveness&#xD;
      could contribute to a reduction in the cost of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscles (PFM) have to be able to contract strongly (Shishido et al, 2008),&#xD;
      rapidly and reflexively (Deffieux et al; 2008; Morin et al, 2004) to guarantee continence.&#xD;
      The ability of PFM to generate rapid and strong contractions results in the generation of an&#xD;
      adequate squeeze pressure in the proximal urethra, which maintains a pressure higher than&#xD;
      that in the bladder, thus preventing leakage (Miller et al, 1994). Rapid and reflexive PFM&#xD;
      contractions are crucial for maintaining continence, preceding an abrupt rise in the&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure associated with coughing, sneezing, running, or jumping (Morin et&#xD;
      al., 2004). Studies have shown that the PFM function regarding power (rate of force&#xD;
      development) was impaired in incontinent women compared to continent women (Deffieux et al,&#xD;
      2008; Morin et al, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFM training - defined as a program of repeated voluntary PFM contractions taught and&#xD;
      supervised by a health care professional - is the most commonly used physiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      for women with SUI and is effective in the treatment of female stress and mixed urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and, therefore, is recommended as a first-line therapy (Dumoulin et al, 2014;&#xD;
      BÃ¸, 2012). As recommended by the International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) PFM&#xD;
      training should generally be the first step of treatment before surgery (Abrams et al, 2010).&#xD;
      However, standard SUI physiotherapy concentrates on voluntary contractions even though the&#xD;
      situations provoking SUI such as sneezing, coughing, jumping and running (Haylen et al, 2010)&#xD;
      require involuntary fast reflexive pelvic floor muscle contractions. Although training&#xD;
      procedures following the concepts of training science and sports medicine are generally well&#xD;
      known and widely implemented in rehabilitation and sports (ACSM, 2009; Schmidtbleicher &amp;&#xD;
      Gollhofer, 1991), the optimal, and well standardized training protocol for involuntary, fast,&#xD;
      and reflexive PFM contractions still remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the research group developed a standardized therapy program, which includes the&#xD;
      standard therapy and additionally focuses on involuntary fast reflexive PFM contractions. The&#xD;
      additional exercises are well known and applied in physiotherapy, however not yet regarding&#xD;
      SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to compare two different physiotherapy programs&#xD;
      for women suffering from SUI. Both programs include standard physiotherapy. Both follow the&#xD;
      concepts of training science (periodization/ exercise sequence and training of specific&#xD;
      muscle strength components). One program focuses on voluntary fast contractions (standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy; control group), the other one focuses on involuntary fast reflexive PFM&#xD;
      contractions (experimental group).&#xD;
