      A prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical study to establish clinical based evidence of&#xD;
      PRP Concepts Fibrin Bio-Matrix and compare its performance with the usual and customary&#xD;
      practice for the treatment of Wagner 1 or 2 DFUs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multi-center study for subjects&#xD;
      undergoing DFU treatment. Qualified subjects will be randomized (1:1); test group (PRP&#xD;
      Concepts Fibrin Bio-Matrix) and control group (usual and customary practice). The study will&#xD;
      consist of 3 periods: a screening period, an active treatment period, and a follow-up period&#xD;
      (if healed). Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be â‰¥18 years of age&#xD;
      with a chronic Wagner grade 1 or 2 DFU (greater than 1 month duration). Each subject will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the active treatment period for up to 12 weeks, or to closure of wound with a&#xD;
      confirmatory visit 2 weeks after wound closure, whether such closure occurs at 12 weeks or&#xD;
      earlier.&#xD;
