      Prospective cohort study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the fragmented, inactivated&#xD;
      trivalent Influenza vaccine produced at Butantan Institute in healthy adults and elderly. The&#xD;
      study will include a total of 120 participants: 60 participants aged 18 to 59 years in the&#xD;
      healthy adults group, and 60 participants aged older than 60 years in the elderly group.This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety of one dose of the fragmented, inactivated trivalent Influenza&#xD;
      vaccine in the first 3 days after vaccination, as well as its immunogenicity 21 days after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
