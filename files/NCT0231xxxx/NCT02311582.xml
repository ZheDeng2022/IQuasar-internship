  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to drug delivery in the treatment of&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors including Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MRI-guided laser ablation&#xD;
      (MLA) has been noted to disrupt peritumoral BBB, which could then lead to increased access of&#xD;
      new tumor antigens to the lymphovascular system and vice versa of immune effector cells to&#xD;
      the tumor for effective activation of the immune system. Therefore the combination of MK-3475&#xD;
      and MLA as proposed in this protocol is hypothesized to create a therapeutic synergy in which&#xD;
      MLA increases material access to promote immune activation and then MK-3475 maximizes these&#xD;
      tumor-specific immune reactions to impart effective tumor control.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase I: Histologically confirmed grade III or IV malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase II: Histologically confirmed grade IV malignant glioma (GBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: GBM variants and suspected secondary GBM are allowed for both phase I and phase&#xD;
             II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unequivocal evidence of tumor progression as documented by biopsy or brain MRI scan&#xD;
             per RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of standard front&#xD;
             line therapy to study registration unless there is unequivocal evidence for tumor&#xD;
             recurrence per RANO criteria. When the interval is less than 12 weeks, the use of&#xD;
             perfusion imaging and/or PET scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal&#xD;
             evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression. Standard front line therapy is as&#xD;
             described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For grade IV malignant gliomas (GBM): Standard front line therapy for newly&#xD;
                  diagnosed GBM must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone&#xD;
                  allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. If the tumor was initially&#xD;
                  diagnosed as either a grade II or III tumor and now has recurred or progressed as&#xD;
                  a grade IV GBM, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade IV GBM and will&#xD;
                  be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible&#xD;
                  surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide&#xD;
                  chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For grade III malignant gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions: Standard front line&#xD;
                  therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal&#xD;
                  feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and&#xD;
                  chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide). If the patient did not receive any or all&#xD;
                  components of the standard front line therapy as detailed above for newly&#xD;
                  diagnosed grade III gliomas and the tumor then recurred or progressed, s/he must&#xD;
                  first receive at least one prior standard therapy or any appropriate combination&#xD;
                  of the components of standard therapy as detailed above and must experience&#xD;
                  further recurrence or progression before s/he is deemed eligible for this study.&#xD;
                  If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II glioma with 1p 19q codeletions&#xD;
                  and now has recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a&#xD;
                  secondary recurrent grade III glioma with 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible&#xD;
                  for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical&#xD;
                  resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (PCV or&#xD;
                  temozolomide).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For grade III malignant gliomas without 1p 19q codeletions: Standard front line&#xD;
                  therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal&#xD;
                  feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and&#xD;
                  temozolomide chemotherapy. If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II&#xD;
                  glioma without 1p 19q codeletions and now has recurred or progressed as a grade&#xD;
                  III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma without&#xD;
                  1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment&#xD;
                  included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed),&#xD;
                  radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for MLA based on the size, location, and shape of the recurrent tumor as&#xD;
             determined by the performing neurosurgeon. Surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA&#xD;
             is allowed per standard of care but is not required; if the patient undergoes&#xD;
             resection or debulking, it must have occurred at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of MK-3475. For Phase II: if surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is not&#xD;
             indicated, a biopsy of the tumor will be done at the same time of MLA to obtain tumor&#xD;
             tissue for both diagnostic purposes and immune monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone a resection for recurrence will be eligible. In those who&#xD;
             have undergone a gross total resection, the MLA will be directed at treating a&#xD;
             peritumoral margin of 0.5-1cm surrounding the resection cavity to disrupt the BBB and&#xD;
             potentially increase access of MK-3475 to the peritumoral infiltrating glioma cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 x IULN OR direct bilirubin â‰¤ IULN for patients with&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) â‰¤ 2.5 x IULN (or â‰¤ 5 x IULN for patients with liver&#xD;
                  metastases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR or PT â‰¤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long&#xD;

             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved&#xD;
             written informed consent document will be enrolled into the trial. However, should a&#xD;
             patient lose their ability to consent while participating in this study and s/he is&#xD;
             still receiving clinical benefit from participation, s/he may continue on study with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Presence of leptomeningeal metastases.&#xD;

             an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 3 weeks of the&#xD;

             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment&#xD;
             (with the exception of daily dexamethasone â‰¤ 4 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that required&#xD;
             steroids or current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.&#xD;

             test within 72 hours of study entry.&#xD;

             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (e.g.,defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is&#xD;
             detected) infection.&#xD;
