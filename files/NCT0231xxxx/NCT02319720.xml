  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to randomization the subject will be screened for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.&#xD;
      Women of child bearing age will be tested for pregnancy. As this is primarily a safety study,&#xD;
      an electrocardiogram is done at the start of the study as a baseline in order to document any&#xD;
      potential changes at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial randomization visit the subject will return to have the wound examined once&#xD;
      a week for 17 weeks after each treatment cycle begins or until the wound heals, whichever is&#xD;
      earlier. Up to 4 treatment cycles will be allowed. As soon as the wound is completely healed,&#xD;
      the subject will return once a month for 6 months to be certain the wound remains healed. The&#xD;
      duration of the subject wound participation in the study is expected to be a maximum of 18&#xD;
      months following the start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in this study will be randomized into one of four arms. Three groups will&#xD;
      receive bone marrow cells and one will not receive bone marrow cells (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) Plus Cultured Cells Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects in this arm of the study will have fresh bone marrow aspirate administered&#xD;
           to the wound at the time the bone marrow is taken. Part of the aspirate will be&#xD;
           cultured. Once the cell cultures have matured (within 8 weeks) they will be checked for&#xD;
           sterility, and frozen until applied to the wound. Up to three applications of cultured&#xD;
           cells will be applied to the wound following the bone marrow biopsy. A single treatment&#xD;
           cycle will consist of one application of a freshly obtained bone marrow aspirate and up&#xD;
           to three applications of cultured cells derived from that aspirate. If the wound has not&#xD;
           healed, up to three additional treatment cycles may be performed. Each bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy will be followed by direct application of fresh bone marrow to the wound and up&#xD;
           to three applications of cultured cells (prepared from the most recent bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy). If the wound heals at any point during this protocol, no additional bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy procedures will be performed and no additional cells will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cultured Cells Alone Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this group, the bone marrow aspirate will be sent to the laboratory to be grown in&#xD;
           tissue culture. Once the cell cultures have matured (within 8 weeks) they will be&#xD;
           checked for sterility and frozen until applied to the subject wound. Up to three&#xD;
           applications of cultured cells will be applied to the wound following the bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy. A single treatment cycle will consist of up to three applications of cultured&#xD;
           cells derived from a single bone marrow aspiration. If the wound has not healed, up to&#xD;
           three additional treatment cycles may be performed. Each bone marrow biopsy will be&#xD;
           followed by up to three applications of cultured cells (prepared from the most recent&#xD;
           bone marrow biopsy). If the wound should heal at any point during this protocol, no&#xD;
           additional bone marrow biopsy procedures will be performed and no additional cells will&#xD;
           be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bone Marrow Aspirate Alone Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects in this group will have fresh bone marrow aspirate administered to the&#xD;
           wound at the time the bone marrow is taken. A single treatment cycle will consist of one&#xD;
           application of a freshly obtained bone marrow aspirate. If the wound has not healed, up&#xD;
           to three additional bone marrow biopsies may be performed. If the wound heals at any&#xD;
           point during this protocol, no additional bone marrow biopsy procedures will be&#xD;
           performed and no additional cells will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in this group will receive currently approved treatments for their wound. These&#xD;
      treatments will include debridement and dressing changes. Wound dressings allowed will&#xD;
      include gauze, foam dressings, occlusive films, and non-stick pads. More advanced dressing&#xD;
      materials such as hydrocolloids, alginates, silver containing dressing, and biomaterials can&#xD;
      also be used. Compression will be utilized for lower extremity wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT SCHEDULING; Regardless of the group the subject is assigned to, he/she will be asked to&#xD;
      return weekly for Standard Of Care (SOC) and wound evaluation. Subjects that miss more than 4&#xD;
      consecutive weekly visits and are not receiving SOC elsewhere, may be removed from the study.&#xD;
      After this (or after wound closure if this occurs earlier) the subject will return once a&#xD;
      month for 6 months for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up study visits will be arranged at 1 to 4 week intervals based on clinical&#xD;
      evaluations and scheduling restrictions until the wound heals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the wound is determined to have healed, the subject will be asked to return monthly for&#xD;
      6 months to be certain the wound remains healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with non-healing wounds will be monitored for 6 months following the last&#xD;
      administration of bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity wounds will be covered with a compression bandage. If a wound is not located&#xD;
      on a lower extremity, it will be covered by a nonstick pad, an adsorbent pad, a gauze wrap&#xD;
      and, optionally, a light compression bandage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with diabetic wounds will be asked to submit a record of blood sugar monitoring. The&#xD;
      blood levels of Hemoglobin A1c will also be monitored at three-month intervals if this is not&#xD;
      already being done routinely. If the Hemoglobin A1c levels are above 10%, the physician who&#xD;
      is managing the subject diabetes will be contacted to discuss any changes in medication to&#xD;
      control the subject diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study examinations will include observation of healing, wound tracing measurements and&#xD;
      photography of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have a skin biopsy taken at the time of healing or at the week 17 end of&#xD;
      treatment cycle visit. Tissues derived from debridement procedures will also be collected.&#xD;
