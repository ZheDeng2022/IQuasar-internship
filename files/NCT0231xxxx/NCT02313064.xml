    <textblock>
      This will be the first-in-human (FIH) study with the oral formulation of CXA-10. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      CXA-10 and its metabolite(s) administered as single ascending oral doses to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (Part A). The effects of food on the PK of CXA-10 will also be investigated (Part&#xD;
      B).&#xD;

      This will be the first-in-human (FIH) study with oral formulation of CXA-10. The main purpose&#xD;
      of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10&#xD;
      and its metabolite(s) administered as single ascending oral doses to healthy volunteers (Part&#xD;
      A). The effects of food on the PK of CXA-10 will also be investigated (Part B). Part A of the&#xD;
      study will be a single-center, randomized, double-blind, third party open (sponsor)&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study. Sequential single ascending doses will be administered in up to 5&#xD;
      cohorts of subjects. Each cohort of subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of&#xD;
      CXA-10 or placebo in, a fasted state, as illustrated in the table below. Part B of the study&#xD;
      will be a single-center, open-label, two-period study conducted in two cohorts of subjects as&#xD;
      follows. The selected dose and the interval between Period 1 and Period 2 will be determined&#xD;
      based on emerging PK data from Part A. The selected dose will be an intermediate dose level&#xD;
      to avoid a food effect interaction that markedly enhances exposure. Subjects who participate&#xD;
      in Part B of the study will receive two doses of CXA-10.&#xD;

             excluded from the study. Subjects with a history of congenital long QT syndrome or in&#xD;
             the subject's family will be excluded from the study (see Section 6.4)&#xD;

             unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to expected study medication non-compliance,&#xD;
             inability to medically tolerate the study procedures, or a subject's unwillingness to&#xD;
             comply with study-related procedures)&#xD;
