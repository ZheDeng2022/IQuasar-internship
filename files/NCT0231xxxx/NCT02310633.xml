  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blast-related and blunt traumatic brain injury is a key priority area of Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Research &amp; Development (RR&amp;D) and represents a critically important public health problem&#xD;
      facing the Veteran population. Developing efficacious treatments for persistent memory&#xD;
      deficits seen in this population is a key step in reducing the impact that such problems have&#xD;
      in the everyday lives of Veterans. Memory problems after TBI in Veterans are quite&#xD;
      heterogeneous, and efficacy will likely be maximized by developing and disseminating multiple&#xD;
      alternative treatments individually matched to the Veteran's key deficits, and by research&#xD;
      that seeks to understand the cognitive and neural basis of treatment-related change over&#xD;
      time. The results of this approach may aid clinical decision making and assignment of&#xD;
      patients to rehabilitative treatments most likely to improve memory capacity and functional&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Memory dysfunction can result from impairments along a continuum of information processing,&#xD;
      from poor initial acquisition of information during learning to disturbed retrieval of stored&#xD;
      memory when it is later needed to perform a task1. The heterogeneous nature of TBI-related&#xD;
      memory impairment is well-known, and there is a critical need to better understand such&#xD;
      disease heterogeneity in order to enhance diagnosis and therapeutic management2. Several&#xD;
      subtypes of memory dysfunction after TBI have been identified3,4. First, some TBI survivors&#xD;
      exhibit impaired memory acquisition/encoding (e.g., frontal system damage)5. Second, some&#xD;
      exhibit impaired memory consolidation/storage impairment (e.g., prominent damage to temporal&#xD;
      lobe systems6). Third, some show impairment in retrieval of information5,7. This&#xD;
      heterogeneity results from the variable nature and severity of underlying brain trauma&#xD;
      resulting from unpredictable mechanical forces2,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that parsing this underlying variability should take precedence over&#xD;
      generalities regarding the effect of TBI on memory when conceptualizing or treating memory&#xD;
      disorders in this population8 Nevertheless, many rehabilitation programs utilize a &quot;one size&#xD;
      fits all&quot; approach to memory training, based (typically) on training compensatory strategies,&#xD;
      with no training specifically targeted to the identifiable component processes of memory that&#xD;
      could be differentially impaired (encoding, consolidation/storage, and retrieval), and which&#xD;
      might respond differentially to more specifically targeted treatment. This situation in&#xD;
      clinical practice is due to the lack of evidence upon which to base informed decision-making&#xD;
      in allocating specifically targeted memory re-training for individual survivors of TBI, based&#xD;
      on clinical test results identifying which memory component processes are impaired (encoding,&#xD;
      consolidation/storage, and retrieval). Because of this, there is little attempt to&#xD;
      appropriately match patient impairment to targeted treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are existing training protocols for training these three components of memory&#xD;
      processing, as follows: encoding (memory strategy training9), consolidation (errorless&#xD;
      learning10), and retrieval (retrieval practice11, but their efficacy has not been tested in&#xD;
      TBI survivors with documented impairments in each component. That is, to the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge, there is no solid evidence for memory training in TBI survivors that supports the&#xD;
      widely held belief that specifically matching the patient impairment to the treatment leads&#xD;
      to better treatment outcomes. This proposal attempts to fill this gap in the investigators'&#xD;
      knowledge. Prior to testing the efficacy of these three types of training in a large trial,&#xD;
      it is important to make standard preparations, such as refining and testing training&#xD;
      materials and ensuring fidelity of treatment methods across clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Aim 1 is to refine and validate three separate, process-specific memory rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatments that focus on improving information-processing at the encoding, consolidation, or&#xD;
      retrieval stage for Veterans with chronic moderate/severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.1. Generate treatment manuals for three process-specific memory treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.2. Test and refine treatment fidelity so that each of the three interventions can&#xD;
      be reliably delivered by different clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Aim 2 is to provide a preliminary test of the response to the three memory&#xD;
      interventions. At baseline, TBI survivors will be evaluated for memory function in each of&#xD;
      these three memory component processes using established neuropsychometric methods. Their&#xD;
      experimental treatment allocation will be to the treatment targeting their most impaired&#xD;
      memory component. In addition, each subject will serve as his/her own control, by engaging in&#xD;
      a treatment targeted to another memory component ('mismatched' group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis A. Matched vs. mismatched group will show differential improvement in memory&#xD;
      component function, with the former group benefitting to a significantly greater degree.&#xD;
      (Primary measures: Memory component performance, encoding, consolidation, retrieval;&#xD;
      secondary: cognitive function and quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Aim 3 is to establish links between the behavioral taxonomy of the three memory&#xD;
      components and differences in brain structure and function documented with diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging and functional connectivity analysis. This is a key first step in establishing&#xD;
      brain-based metrics of neuroplastic change after memory therapy in the investigators'&#xD;
      research program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3.1. Identify specific and unique imaging signatures that distinguish patients with&#xD;
      deficits in encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, respectively. Primary measures:&#xD;
      structural measures of morphometry and white matter integrity (FA) and functional&#xD;
      connectivity (cross correlation and total interdependence) in identified brain networks&#xD;
      damaged in TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Implications. This research has the potential to devise a method to match specific&#xD;
      subcomponents of memory impairment to specifically targeted memory interventions, thus&#xD;
      maximizing recovery of memory and function. The results of this investigation will be used to&#xD;
      refine the interventions, to evaluate cognitive and functional endpoints, and to power a&#xD;
      larger clinical trial that will yield data enabling clinicians to match TBI patients to&#xD;
      effective treatments based on their individual profile of memory dysfunction.&#xD;
