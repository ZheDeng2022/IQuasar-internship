      This study is a Phase 1b open label, single arm, adaptive multi-centre trial of copanlisib in&#xD;
      combination with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in pretreated locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who&#xD;
      previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination, will be treated&#xD;
      with copanlisib (to the dose escalation scheme) plus trastuzumab emtansine 3.6mg/kg IV on day&#xD;

      This study is a phase Ib open label, single arm, adaptive multi-centre trial. Patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who previously&#xD;
      received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination, will be treated with&#xD;
      copanlisib plus trastuzumab emtansine 3.6mg/kg IV on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 to 6 patients will be enrolled per dose level. All patients in each level must have&#xD;
      completed at least the first cycle of therapy before enrolment in the next dose level begins.&#xD;
      Patients not completing the first cycle for a reason other than toxicity will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copanlisib will start at a low level and dose escalations will be performed in cohorts of 3&#xD;
      patients according to a standard 3+3 algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be based on&#xD;
      occurrences of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort of 3 patients will commence at dose level 1. All patients in each cohort&#xD;
      will be observed for one cycle on the specified dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of 3 patients at a given dose level experiences a DLT, accrual will continue to&#xD;
           the next dose level according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at a given dose level, 3 additional patients will&#xD;
           be treated at the same dose. If no additional patient has a DLT in this cohort, accrual&#xD;
           will continue to the next dose level according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 2 or more patients in 3 or 6 patients treated at a given dose experience a DLT, the&#xD;
           dose will be de-escalated to the next lower dose level, which will define the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 or more patients in 3 or 6 patients treated at the -1 dose level experience DLT, the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), for copanlisib in combination with&#xD;
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with pretreated unresectable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate efficacy measures in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the incidence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine for predictive biomarkers in tumour tissue and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine molecular tumour adaptation to clinical trial therapy.&#xD;
