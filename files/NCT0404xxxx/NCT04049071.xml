  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal post-marketing surveillance registry nested within the UK GCA Consortium that&#xD;
      assesses the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab in controlling refractory or relapsing&#xD;
      forms of GCA in patients who require escalation of therapy to reach sustained remission. Half&#xD;
      the patients recruited will have been prescribed tocilizumab (cases) and the other half will&#xD;
      be prescribed alternative therapies (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four study visits over 18 months: baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 18 months. At&#xD;
      each visit data is collected on demographics; diagnosis and investigations; previous and&#xD;
      concomitant medications; medical history; co-morbidities, vital signs; smoking and alcohol;&#xD;
      disease activity and damage; routine laboratory tests; reason for starting escalation&#xD;
      therapy. Safety data is collected on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
