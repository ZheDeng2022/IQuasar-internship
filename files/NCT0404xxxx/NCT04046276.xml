    <textblock>
      In phenotypic animal models of Parkinson's Disease (PD), chronic physical exercise has&#xD;
      produced nigrostriatal neuroprotection and symptom improvement, provided training was of&#xD;
      high-intensity and prolonged duration (&gt;3 months in rodent models). Conventional physical&#xD;
      therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has traditionally avoided fatigue and high intensity&#xD;
      workouts. Yet, in PD controlled studies have shown that: (i) an acute aerobic stress produces&#xD;
      endogenous dopamine immediately after the exercise and (ii) short term (a few weeks) high&#xD;
      intensity aerobic training enhances D2 striatal receptor density and cortical excitability&#xD;
      and clinically improves walking, upper limb and executive functions; (iii) long-term (six&#xD;
      months) high intensity aerobic treadmill training is associated with less deterioration of&#xD;
      subjective UPDRS III score compared to a waiting list. Long-term high intensity aerobic&#xD;
      training has not been compared to low or medium intensity training in PD patients for its&#xD;
      objective motor, cognitive and putative neuroprotective effects.&#xD;

      A short description, 5000 characters Intro: In phenotypic animal models of Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease (PD), chronic physical exercise has produced nigrostriatal neuroprotection and&#xD;
      symptom improvement, provided training was of high-intensity and prolonged duration (&gt;3&#xD;
      months in rodent models). Conventional physical therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has&#xD;
      traditionally avoided fatigue and high intensity workouts. Yet, in PD controlled studies have&#xD;
      shown that: (i) an acute aerobic stress produces endogenous dopamine immediately after the&#xD;
      exercise and (ii) short term (a few weeks) high intensity aerobic training enhances D2&#xD;
      striatal receptor density and cortical excitability and clinically improves walking, upper&#xD;
      limb and executive functions; (iii) long-term (six months) high intensity aerobic treadmill&#xD;
      training is associated with less deterioration of subjective UPDRS III score compared to a&#xD;
      waiting list. Long-term high intensity aerobic training has not been compared to low or&#xD;
      medium intensity training in PD patients for its objective motor, cognitive and putative&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis High-intensity aerobic exercises practiced over 9 months will produce greater&#xD;
      symptomatic motor and cognitive benefits and neuroprotective effects in PD patients, than low&#xD;
      or medium intensity training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To compare the motor effects of a 9-month conventional physical therapy&#xD;
      program (light aerobic exercises), an aerobic program of medium intensity on stationary&#xD;
      bicycle (50% maximal oxygen uptake, VO2 max), and an aerobic program of high intensity (70%&#xD;
      VO2 max) in Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate aerobic capacities before and after the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate cognitive functions, depression, quality of life before and after each&#xD;
           program as well as 3 months following program termination and motor function 3 months&#xD;
           following program termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore potential neuroprotective effects of a 9-month aerobic program through&#xD;
           specialized brain imaging (123I-Ioflupane SPECT) and a potential aerobic&#xD;
           intensity-effect of such neuroprotection.&#xD;
&#xD;
