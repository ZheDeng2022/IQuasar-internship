      Introduction: Maximal strength increments are reported to result in improvements in sprint&#xD;
      speed and jump height in elite male football players. Although similar effects are expected&#xD;
      in females, this is yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of&#xD;
      maximal strength training on sprint speed and jump height in high-level female football&#xD;
      players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Two female football teams were team-cluster-randomized to a training group (TG)&#xD;
      performing maximal strength training (MST) twice a week for five weeks, or control group (CG)&#xD;
      doing their regular pre-season preparations. The MST consisted of 3-4 sets of 4-6 repetitions&#xD;
      at ≥85% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in a squat exercise. Sprint speed and jump height were&#xD;
      assessed in 5-, 10- and 15 meter sprints and a counter-movement jump (CMJ) test,&#xD;
      respectively. 19 participants in TG (18.3 ± 2.7 years) and 14 in CG (18.3 ± 2.4 years)&#xD;
      completed pre- and posttests and were carried forward for final analyses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In male football players, studies have reported a favorable effect on both 1RM, sprint and&#xD;
      jumping performance following MST. Although females and males possess diverse levels of&#xD;
      anabolic hormones, they do in general respond similarly after training interventions in most&#xD;
      strength outcomes. However, there are reports of a larger relative increase in females&#xD;
      compared to males when the same ST is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cluster-randomized controlled trial, two football teams (playing at level 2 and 3 in&#xD;
      Norway) was invited to participate. The study were conducted during the last part of the&#xD;
      pre-season preparations, ending one week before first seasonal competition. The training&#xD;
      group (TG) performed MST training carried out as free-barbell squats twice a week over five&#xD;
      weeks in addition to the planned pre-season training, while the control group (CG) was&#xD;
      instructed to perform their originally planned pre-season training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample comprised 46 players aged 15-26 years, where two separate football teams&#xD;
      were cluster-randomized to either TG or CG. The two teams played at level two and three in&#xD;
      Norway, where level two is a national league and level three a regional league in Northern&#xD;
      Norway. Inclusion criteria was that the players perceived themselves as injury free and able&#xD;
      to complete the strength training. Players were only excluded if having injuries that made&#xD;
      strength training, running and jumping unachievable. The players carried out ̴ 6.5 h training&#xD;
      per week with their team. Four players were injured, two did not complete the required amount&#xD;
      of training, one withdrew due to time limitations and five withdrew without providing any&#xD;
      reason resulting in 19 participants in TG and 15 in CG that completed both pre- and&#xD;
      posttests, and were included in the analyses for training effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the declaration of Helsinki, all participants were fully informed of the&#xD;
      potential benefits and risks of the study, both orally and written, before signing an&#xD;
      informed consent. For participants under 16 years, both the players and their parents gave&#xD;
      their written informed consent. The participants were fully informed of their rights to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time without providing any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All testing and training sessions were conducted in an exercise training laboratory at&#xD;
      Alfheim Stadium, Tromsø. Prior to the intervention, the players underwent baseline tests over&#xD;
      two test days, with a 72 hour washout period to avoid any detrimental effects from the&#xD;
      preceding test day: day 1) measurement of body mass and body height, 5-, 10- and 15m sprint&#xD;
      time and a counter-movement jump (CMJ), day 2) 1RM in a free-barbell squat exercise with&#xD;
      partial 90° knee angle range of motion (ROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the tests, the participants were asked to refrain from heavy training the preceding&#xD;
      day, and to arrive in the laboratory well-hydrated. All tests and training sessions started&#xD;
      in the afternoon, with the same general warm-up routine: 7 min of self-selected low intensity&#xD;
      cycling on an ergometer bike (Pro/Trainer, Wattbike Ltd, Nottingham, UK) followed by 7 min&#xD;
      low intensity running of self-selected speed on artificial grass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, following the general warm-up and three 15 m strides on a sprinting field, a 15-m&#xD;
      sprint test was carried out. Data were assessed in 5 m splits by photocells mounted to the&#xD;
      floor and walls (ATU-X, IC control AB, Stockholm, Sweden) using single-beam electronic&#xD;
      barriers. The within-subject coefficient of variation is 2% for this measurement. The surface&#xD;
      consisted of artificial grass, and the players wore their own running shoes. The sprints&#xD;
      started with the players in a static position placing their front foot 30 cm behind the&#xD;
      starting line. A timer was triggered by the participant breaking the initial sensor. The rest&#xD;
      interval between the single sprint trials was 180 seconds. The fastest sprint time of three&#xD;
      trials was carried forward for further analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, the players rested for 5 minutes prior to performing the CMJ test. CMJ was&#xD;
      assessed by a portable force platform, with a validity within 1 centimeter (2%) when compared&#xD;
      with the gold standard mounted floor force platform, and a within-subject coefﬁcient of&#xD;
      variation of 2.8%. Force data were recorded by a software. This device records only the&#xD;
      vertical ground reaction force at a sampling frequency of 1200 Hz and jump height is&#xD;
      automatically calculated by software applying double integration of the force signal through&#xD;
      Simpson's rule of integration. The players were instructed to keep their hands placed on the&#xD;
      hips and the feet shoulder-width apart. Each player performed two trials with a ≥180 second&#xD;
      rest between sets. The highest jump was carried forward for further analysis. Day 1 was ended&#xD;
      with a familiarization trial for the squat exercise with low loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2, the players returned to the laboratory for the assessment of maximal strength as&#xD;
      1RM. The session was initiated with the same general warm up routine as mentioned above. An&#xD;
      Olympic barbell and a suitable rack was applied for testing of 1RM. The ~ 90° knee angle of&#xD;
      each participant was measured during every repetition using a goniometer, and the players&#xD;
      were given an orally &quot;go&quot; when being allowed to start the concentric phase of the lift. Prior&#xD;
      to starting their 1RM attempts, the participants warmed up with 10 repetitions with a low&#xD;
      load of - 50% 1RM (subjectively assessed by the instructor). The starting 1RM attempt was an&#xD;
      initial acceptable load decided by the instructor. Each 1RM attempt was carried out by a&#xD;
      single repetition, with increasing load of 5-10 kg until they failed to execute the 1RM&#xD;
      attempt, which on average was five trials. Each attempt was interspaced by ≥180 s of rest.&#xD;
      The within-subject coefficient of variation for squat 1RM is 2.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The players attended supervised training in the laboratory twice a week for five weeks. The&#xD;
      training session started with the general warm-up routine described above, before starting&#xD;
      the strength training. The program consisted of 90° squats, carried out in the same way as in&#xD;
      the 1RM test. The squat training was initiated with three sessions of three sets of six&#xD;
      repetitions, followed by seven sessions of four sets of four repetitions. The repetitions&#xD;
      were carried out with a slow eccentric movement followed by maximal mobilization in the&#xD;
      concentric phase. 180 s of recovery was given between each set. The load was initially set at&#xD;
      85% of pre-test 1RM, which the participants increased with 2.5-10 kg if they could manage&#xD;
      more than six or four repetitions, depending on their scheduled program, resulting in a&#xD;
      consistent overload during the whole intervention. Weight lifted for each repetition was&#xD;
      logged continuously during the study. Additionally, for ethical reasons, in order to avoid&#xD;
      hamstring strains due to an anticipated large agonist-antagonist strength ratio following the&#xD;
      intervention, three sets of six repetitions of the Nordic hamstring exercise were performed&#xD;
      after the squat exercise for each session with a ≥180 s rest period between sets.&#xD;
