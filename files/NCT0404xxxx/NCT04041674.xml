      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost&#xD;
      vaccine regimen of GEO-D02 DNA and MVA/HIV62B with and without B63521^11 gp120 and IHV01&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccine regimen of&#xD;
      GEO-D02 DNA and MVA/HIV62B with and without B63521^11 gp120 and IHV01 gp120 Env proteins in&#xD;
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. Participants in all five groups&#xD;
      will receive GEO-D02 DNA by intramuscular (IM) injection at Months 0 and 2. Then, at Months&#xD;
      4, 6, and 10, participants will receive three additional injections according to their&#xD;
      assigned group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: MVA/HIV62B, placebo for B63521^11 gp120, and placebo for IHV01, all by IM&#xD;
           injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: MVA/HIV62B by IM injection and placebo for B63521^11 gp120 and for IHV01, both&#xD;
           by subcutaneous (SC) injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: MVA/HIV62B, B63521^11 gp120, and IHV01, all by IM injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: MVA/HIV62B, placebo for B63521^11 gp120, and IHV01, all by IM injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5: MVA/HIV62B by IM injection and IHV01 and B63521^11 gp120, both by SC injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend several study visits through Month 16. Visits may include physical&#xD;
      examinations, blood and urine collection, electrocardiogram, HIV testing, risk reduction&#xD;
      counseling, and questionnaires. Study staff will contact participants at Month 24 for&#xD;
      follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;
