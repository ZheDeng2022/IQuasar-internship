      This study will evaluate the rate of radiation necrosis following treatment with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment and radiation therapy in subjects with metastatic brain&#xD;
      cancer. Subjects will be treated with the standard of care immunotherapy followed by&#xD;
      radiation therapy via stereotactic radiosurgery at a reduced dose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single arm, pilot study to determine the symptomatic radiation&#xD;
      necrosis rate at 6 months utilizing dose-reduced stereotactic radiosurgery with immunotherapy&#xD;
      for subjects with a diagnosis of 1-10 brain metastases from MRI and tissue diagnosis of&#xD;
      primary malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point is 6 month symptomatic radiation necrosis, defined as a 6-month rate of&#xD;
      clinical symptomatology requiring steroid administration (i.e. Decadron) and/or operative&#xD;
      intervention concomitant with advanced and routine brain imaging findings consistent with&#xD;
      radiation necrosis. Follow-up MRIs will be fused with the planning scan for this assessment.&#xD;
