    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 study will be a dose escalation study in adults in 5 cohorts (named cohorts 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, 5 and 6), with the main purpose to assess the safety of subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      OCTA101 (a human-cl rhFVIII and recombinant human von Willebrand Factor fragment dimer) in&#xD;
      previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia A. The study also aims to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics, dose proportionality, and subcutaneous bioavailability&#xD;
      of OCTA101 compared with intravenous administration of Nuwiq (Human-cl rh FVIII), in order to&#xD;
      define the prophylactic treatment (dose and injection interval) that would result in&#xD;
      protective trough levels of FVIII:C for future Phase 3 studies. Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 5 will&#xD;
      undergo a single injection of OCTA101, with cohorts 1, 2 and 3 proceeding to 3-month daily&#xD;
      dosing prophylactic treatment for 3 months by Data Monitoring Committee recommendation.&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 and 2 will undergo a further PK at the end of the daily injection period. A further&#xD;
      cohort, cohort 6, will have an initial 4 to 6-week run-in treatment period with Nuwiq&#xD;
      intravenous prophylaxis followed by 12.5 IU/kg OCTA101 subcutaneous daily prophylaxis for &gt;3&#xD;
      up to 6-7 months.&#xD;
