  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will pilot an intervention to deliver sexual and reproductive health services, including&#xD;
      HIV self-testing (HIVST) and contraception, to adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at&#xD;
      accredited drug dispensing outlets (ADDOs) in Shinyanga, Tanzania. In a 4-month randomized&#xD;
      pilot study, we will compare mediating outcomes (AGYW patronage, product distribution, and&#xD;
      referral) between 10 intervention and 10 comparison ADDOs, using data from time-location&#xD;
      surveys of customers and inventory distribution and referral records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Building on our team's formative work using human-centered design methods and behavioral&#xD;
      economics theories, we have designed an intervention (the &quot;Queen Club&quot;) to develop&#xD;
      AGYW-friendly drug shops where we will introduce HIVST alongside contraceptives and linkages&#xD;
      to care. In a 4-month randomized pilot study, we will compare mediating outcomes (i.e., AGYW&#xD;
      visits, distribution of HIVST and contraception, referral to SRH services) between 10&#xD;
      intervention and 10 comparison ADDOs, using data from a time-location survey of customers and&#xD;
      records for HIVST and contraception distribution and referrals for sexual and reproductive&#xD;
      health (SRH) services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDOs will be randomly selected from four wards in the Shinyanga municipality. We will use&#xD;
      stratified randomization by ward to assign 20 ADDOs 1:1 into the two study groups. Regardless&#xD;
      of intervention arm, we will conduct the following activities in all ADDOs: in-person&#xD;
      training on HIVST provision, monthly HIVST supply with half of kits explicitly earmarked for&#xD;
      free provision to AGYW customers, an HIV care referral plan, and shop record tracking. The&#xD;
      shop records will collect data on AGYW patronage, HIVST distribution, contraception&#xD;
      distribution, and health facility referrals for SRH services. Monthly reviews of inventory&#xD;
      records by the local team will include review of these records to determine AGYW patronage&#xD;
      (for any service) and the volume and types of contraception and HIVST kits distributed to&#xD;
      AGYW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDOs in the intervention arm will be trained to implement the &quot;Queen Club&quot; intervention. The&#xD;
      Queen Club intervention was developed through a year-long human-centered design process with&#xD;
      AGYW and other stakeholders and is informed by behavioral economic theory and game-design. It&#xD;
      is intended to partially mitigate to the physical, economic, and social constraints faced by&#xD;
      AGYW in Shinyanga, as revealed in the formative research, and motivate them to discretely&#xD;
      seek HIVST and contraception at local drug shops, while in a context of fun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, the Queen Club is a loyalty program through which AGYW can earn surprise mystery&#xD;
      gifts through repeated purchases at participating ADDOs. This is intended to build loyalty&#xD;
      and trust with an ADDO shop, and also build the customer base for the ADDO owner. The back of&#xD;
      the Queen Club loyalty card includes symbols, selected by AGYW, that represent oral&#xD;
      contraception, HIVST, emergency contraception, condoms, and pregnancy tests. With the symbol&#xD;
      portion of the card, AGYW can discretely point to their desired product and receive it for&#xD;
      free without questioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a one-day training, we will review contraceptive methods and counseling techniques with&#xD;
      intervention ADDO owners and staff using training materials adapted from the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children. At every intervention ADDO, we&#xD;
      will provide a countertop display with contraceptive methods and an HIVST kit for&#xD;
      demonstration (if desired by any customer), as well as a tablet computer pre-loaded with&#xD;
      videos about various contraceptive products and the Oraquick HIVST kit instructional video in&#xD;
      Kiswahili.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are mediators of the intervention's potential effect on preventing HIV&#xD;
      and unintended pregnancy. In this phase, our goal is to measure these mediating, &quot;process&quot;&#xD;
      outcomes and maximize learning for a future effectiveness and sustainability study using&#xD;
      ADDOs as a platform to deliver HIVST and other HIV prevention and SRH services. We will&#xD;
      collect data on the following mediating outcomes from the 10 intervention and 10 comparison&#xD;
      ADDOs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AGYW patronage: number and proportion of visits by AGYW.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraceptive distribution: number and types of contraceptives (i.e., condoms, oral&#xD;
           contraception, emergency contraception) distributed to AGYW.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health facility referrals: number of referrals for AGYW made for SRH services, including&#xD;
           HIV testing or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIVST kit uptake: number and proportion of kits distributed to AGYW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess AGYW patronage with a time-location survey of ADDO customers (randomly&#xD;
      selected 3-hour intervals) at baseline (during the month prior to intervention) and during&#xD;
      the final two months of the intervention (12 episodes per ADDO total) in which trained&#xD;
      researchers will discretely document the number of customers, their sex, and approximate age.&#xD;
      Monthly reviews of inventory and referral records will show the volume and types of SRH&#xD;
      products distributed to customers, including HIVST and contraception distributed to AGYW, and&#xD;
      the number of SRH referrals made, the number and proportion for AGYW, and for which services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare AGYW patronage, referrals to health facilities, and contraception&#xD;
      transactions between intervention and comparison ADDOs over the 4-month pilot period using:&#xD;
      (1) statistical tests of means (t-tests) and medians (Wilcoxon rank-sum test); (2) a Poisson&#xD;
      regression model (for counts of AGYW visits) to estimate rate ratios and confidence intervals&#xD;
      controlling for baseline levels of AGYW patronage using a &quot;difference-in-differences&quot;&#xD;
      approach; and (3) chi-squared tests for independence to qualitatively assess differences&#xD;
      between groups for all mediating outcomes. Results will be used to understand the potential&#xD;
      effectiveness of AGYW-friendly ADDO environments on AGYW visits and demand generation for HIV&#xD;
      prevention and SRH services, a basis for power calculations to determine the sample size&#xD;
      needed for the future study of effectiveness and sustainability.&#xD;
