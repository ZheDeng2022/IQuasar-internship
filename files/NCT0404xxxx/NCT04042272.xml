  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uremic encephalopathy is an organic brain disorder may be frequently seen in patients with&#xD;
      acute or chronic renal failure. Certain neurological symptoms can be found under clinical&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate of 15 ml/minutes. The above mentioned neurological disorders can&#xD;
      be due to uremic toxins as well as many other reasons such as metabolic and hemodynamic&#xD;
      disturbances, inflammation, or oxidative stress. Most frequent symptoms are impaired&#xD;
      consciousness, lethargy, cranial nerve involvement, nystagmus, dysarthria, and even coma and&#xD;
      death. Brain tissue may receive damage and some secondary biomarkers may appear in case BUN&#xD;
      (Blood Urea Nitrogen) level is &gt;175 mg/dl together with neuroinflammation. Although&#xD;
      hemodialysis is a temporary solution in terms of treatment, these symptoms may be reversible&#xD;
      in the long-run with organ transplantation. A rigorous neurological assessment before&#xD;
      transplantation is important for identifying the severity and distribution of the&#xD;
      neurological disorder as well as defining the abnormalities that are responding to the&#xD;
      current treatments and foreseeing potential postoperative prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100β is excreted by astrocytes in brain damage cases. S100β level rises when brain damage&#xD;
      starts, thus it may be used in the prognosis of brain damage in its early period.&#xD;
      Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) functions as intracytoplasmic enzyme and serum level rises in&#xD;
      neuron damage. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), on the other hand, is the intermediary&#xD;
      filament cytoskeleton protein found in astrocytes. It has the same root structure with S100β.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess neurological damage by looking at the levels of S100β,&#xD;
      NSE and GFAP in patients who underwent kidney transplantation and to analyze the impacts on&#xD;
      the prognosis.&#xD;

      Encephalopathy, thiamine deficiency, uremia, hypertension, electrolyte imbalance after&#xD;
      dialysis are clinical pictures with high incidences in case of renal failure. There are&#xD;
      multifactor reasons in its pathophysiology such as hormonal imbalance, oxidative stress,&#xD;
      accumulation of metabolites in time, disorders in excitatory and inhibitory transmitters and&#xD;
      intermediary metabolisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological disorders that affect renal transplant patients during the waiting list period&#xD;
      do not only significantly affect preoperative morbidity and even mortality, but also show&#xD;
      important predictive factors for neurological symptoms after the transplantation. A rigorous&#xD;
      neurological assessment before transplantation is important for identifying the severity and&#xD;
      distribution of the neurological disorder as well as defining the abnormalities that are&#xD;
      responding to the current treatments and foreseeing potential postoperative prognosis.&#xD;
      Specific indexes preferred for neurological assessment before the transplant may vary&#xD;
      depending on the clinic; however, correct and differential diagnosis of various symptoms may&#xD;
      be difficult despite the use of various diagnostic tools such as biochemical,&#xD;
      neurophysiologic, neuropsychological and neuroimaging tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100β is a 10.4 kDa protein. S100β is synthesized in the brain through endfeet processes of&#xD;
      astrocytes and it belongs to the superfamily of low molecular weight EF-hand type acidic&#xD;
      calcium-binding proteins. This protein is metabolized in the kidneys first and foremost and&#xD;
      then discharged through urine. It has been shown that S100β does not differ depending on&#xD;
      ethnic groups and genders and is not affected by circadian rhythm. Even though S100β may be&#xD;
      found in other tissues, it may be used as an early marker for brain damage since it is found&#xD;
      in higher concentration in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Astrocytes are the key agents for homeostasis regulation in the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      and they secrete S100β after brain damage. Certain studies show that increased levels of&#xD;
      S100β may be used as an early marker of intracerebral changes in the brains of patients with&#xD;
      acute or chronic liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) before the development of&#xD;
      cerebral edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, some studies suggest that increased levels of S100β in serum concentrations may&#xD;
      predict HE. However, there are few pieces of evidence that prove the correlation between&#xD;
      S100β levels and HE's presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSE (neuron-specific enolase) is a CNS protein found in neurons and neuroendocrine tissues.&#xD;
      NSE functions in the glycolytic path of neurons as an intracytoplasmic enzyme and its serum&#xD;
      levels increase in case of neuron damage. S100β is a marker of astroglial dysfunction while&#xD;
      NSE is a marker of neuronal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is reported to be more specific to brain tissue&#xD;
      compared to S100β. There are studies showing that prognosis is worse when both GFAP and S100β&#xD;
      levels are seen to increase in the assessment of neurological damage, especially in cases of&#xD;
      head traumas, thus supporting the use of both proteins for higher prognostic accuracy. GFAP&#xD;
      is also a biomarker used for neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic cases other than cases&#xD;
      of trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to analyze neurological damage in renal transplant patients&#xD;
      through S100β, NSE and GFAP serum concentrations and assess their impacts on the prognosis.&#xD;
