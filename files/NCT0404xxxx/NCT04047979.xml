      The purpose of the study is to better understand how the immune system responds to the new&#xD;
      herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine (Shingrix®). The study will be looking at certain markers in&#xD;
      the blood after vaccination with Shingrix®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause two distinct diseases: chicken pox (varicella) and&#xD;
      herpes zoster (shingles). The primary infection with VZV causes chicken pox, a widespread&#xD;
      rash occurring with fever, mostly in childhood. The virus can then remain dormant in a&#xD;
      person's body and has the ability to reactivate later in life causing shingles. Shingles is a&#xD;
      painful rash, occurring mostly in older individuals or those who have a weakened immune&#xD;
      system. After resolution of the rash, individuals may experience persistent pain in the same&#xD;
      area, called post-herpetic neuralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to better understand how the immune system responds to the new&#xD;
      herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine (Shingrix®). In particular, looking at certain markers in&#xD;
      the blood after vaccination with Shingrix®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open label randomized clinical trial in healthy older adults. There will&#xD;
      be two groups of participants: those aged 50 to 60 years or those who are 70 years old and&#xD;
      above, both groups will receive the vaccine. This will help compare the immune response to&#xD;
      the herpes zoster vaccine in different age cohorts of older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited by flyer advertisements. Interested individuals will be screened&#xD;
      for the study and if they qualify they will be consented and enrolled in the study. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected and banked. There are optional storage of data/specimens for future&#xD;
      research including: being contacted for future studies, having contact information and&#xD;
      limited medical information entered into a clinic database, and storage of Protected Health&#xD;
      Information and samples for future research (yes, no, and de-identified)&#xD;
