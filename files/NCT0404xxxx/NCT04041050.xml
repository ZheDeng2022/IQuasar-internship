  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 4 parts to this study for which the primary objectives are to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of navitoclax when administered alone (Part 1) or&#xD;
      when administered in combination with ruxolitinib (Part 2). In Part 2, participants must have&#xD;
      been receiving a stable dose of ruxolitinib therapy for at least 12 weeks prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. In Part 3, all eligible participants will receive navitoclax, with the primary&#xD;
      objective being to evaluate potential navitoclax effect on QTc prolongation. In Part 4,&#xD;
      effect of navitoclax is evaluated on the PK, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of&#xD;
      celecoxib in participants with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or chronic myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CMML).&#xD;
