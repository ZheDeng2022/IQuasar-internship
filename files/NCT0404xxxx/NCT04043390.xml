  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TB is a major public health problem and the second most common cause of adult death due to&#xD;
      infection in many low-income countries. Despite major efforts to de-centralise services,&#xD;
      accessibility to diagnosis is still limited, with one third of the 9 million cases occurring&#xD;
      each year being missed by national control programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New TB diagnostics suitable for use at the point-of-care are emerging. Some of these are&#xD;
      intended for screening purposes, as an initial step to identify individuals who may have TB&#xD;
      and should undergo further tests for confirmation. These tests may have high sensitivity, but&#xD;
      also give false-positive results (low specificity). Other tests aim to be the confirmatory&#xD;
      tests for TB (high specificity), but these tests are often more expensive and complex and are&#xD;
      only available in hospital laboratories. As these tests have different purposes, it is likely&#xD;
      they would work better in combination in a step fashion to optimise their impact and to&#xD;
      develop an efficient diagnostic process. Furthermore, as none of the tests is versatile&#xD;
      enough to be used in all settings, test combinations will need to consider the health system&#xD;
      context in which they would be used. Our aim is to develop and evaluate rapid and accurate&#xD;
      diagnostic approaches for TB that facilitate the initiation of appropriate treatment on the&#xD;
      same day of the initial consultation in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate new diagnostics for TB (including among HIV co-infected individuals) that are&#xD;
           suitable at the point-of-care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop diagnostic algorithms that streamline and accelerate the diagnosis of TB,&#xD;
           allowing patients to reach clinical management decisions within a single clinic visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the impact of using novel point-of-care diagnostic combinations on the&#xD;
           proportion of patients correctly initiating TB treatment within 24-48 hours of first&#xD;
           attendance; their potential cost effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted studies in 2016-2018 to accomplish the first two objectives and&#xD;
      have identified diagnostic tests that are suitable for low and middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This document therefore refers to objective 3, which aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the performance of two diagnostic schemes for the diagnosis of TB when compared&#xD;
           to culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the yield of two diagnostic schemes for the diagnosis of TB when compared to&#xD;
           Xpert and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the cost of the two diagnostic schemes compared to Xpert.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enrol patients in TB clinics based in 4 selected district hospitals (two in&#xD;
      Nigeria and two in Ethiopia) and samples will be processed in a single reference laboratory.&#xD;
      This diagnostic evaluation trial will comprise two experimental diagnostic schemes which will&#xD;
      be compared against the standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One experimental arm (scheme 1) will screen all patients for HIV using two rapid tests&#xD;
           routinely used by the clinics and a rapid CRP. Selected patients will be further tested&#xD;
           using ULTRA. Individuals with HIV will undergo an HIV VL using Xpert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second experimental arm (scheme 2): will screen individuals for HIV and CRP (as in&#xD;
           scheme 1) and selected patients will be tested using Molbio Truenat MTB. Individuals&#xD;
           with HIV will undergo an HIV VL using Molbio Truenat HIV-VL and Truenat RIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, all patients will be tested using the standard of care consistent of&#xD;
           confirmatory HIV and CRP tests, Xpert MTB/RIF and culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomisation All patients will be randomised at a ratio of 1:1 into schemes 1 and&#xD;
                2. Random numbers will be generated in LSTM by a statistician independent to the&#xD;
                study. The scheme allocations will be included in study envelopes assigned to&#xD;
                individual study numbers. Equal number of participants will be included in Nigeria&#xD;
                and Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proposed methods for protecting against source bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an open trial, the classification of patients will be based on objective&#xD;
      quantitative results of laboratory tests. It is expected the test performances will vary&#xD;
      according to HIV status. Participants will be classified according to their experimental test&#xD;
      results&#xD;
