  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Provoked vestibulodynia is a pain condition, which is associated with lower quality of life&#xD;
      and discomfort. Furthermore, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Provoked vestibulodynia&#xD;
      is defined as vulvar pain with no known cause. Provoked vestibulodynia can be generalized and&#xD;
      involve several areas of the vulva. It can also be localized and involve only one area of the&#xD;
      vulva. Pain is often provoked by touch or pressure but it can also be spontaneous or both.&#xD;
      The life prevalence for vestibulodynia varies between 3-28 percent in different populations.&#xD;
      Persons with vestibulodynia report more frequently anxiety-, depression- and stress- symptoms&#xD;
      than the normal population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate an internet-based treatment for vestibulodynia.&#xD;
      The intervention will be based on Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy with focus on exposure and acceptance.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from vestibulodynia often experience psychological distress. Acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapy (ACT) has been shown to be effective in treating psychological&#xD;
      distress and pain. However delivering relevant treatment can be difficult due to logistics,&#xD;
      cost and lack of personnel with required competence. Delivering ACT though the internet&#xD;
      (iACT) is a novel approach, sidestepping logistical issues while lowering costs. There is&#xD;
      however, a need to research this kind of treatment for persons with vestibulodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will primarily investigate whether an ACT-treatment administered through the&#xD;
      internet can be beneficial for patients suffering from provoked vestibulodynia. The treatment&#xD;
      will be 10 weeks long. Participants will be randomized to the treatment program or a&#xD;
      waiting-list control group. Analysis of possible mediating variables will be able to give&#xD;
      insight into the internal workings of the treatment itself, further elucidating efficacy of&#xD;
      specific interventions, data which will be useful in future developments of treatment design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will consist of a 10-week period where participants would get access to a&#xD;
      series of treatment modules, each addressing a separate problem area using ACT techniques.&#xD;
      The treatment includes modules focuses on acceptance and exposure techniques. The&#xD;
      participants will receive every week different exposure assignments. The platform used is an&#xD;
      existing platform employed by the Pain Center at Uppsala university hospital for delivering&#xD;
      internet based treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted using a randomized controlled trial with a between-group design.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to two groups, were one group will gain access to iACT&#xD;
      treatment while the second group will be a wait-list control, and will gain access to the&#xD;
      program once treatment of the active group is finished. A licensed psychologist will assess&#xD;
      participants. In addition to online ACT modules, consisting of information, exercises and&#xD;
      homework assignments, all participants will have regular contact by secure email-channel with&#xD;
      a licensed psychologists or last-year psychology student under supervision. This contact will&#xD;
      guide treatment, providing support, feedback on homework, and if necessary clarify treatment&#xD;
      content and help with IT-related problems interfering with treatment adherence. After a year,&#xD;
      participants will be invited to take part in a follow-up module, consisting of limited&#xD;
      treatment recapitulation and evaluation.&#xD;
