    <textblock>
      This research is studying the safety of combining ibrutinib with the study drug LY3214996 for&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), mantle cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (MCL), or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL).&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      combination of drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ibrutinib as a treatment option for&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LY3214996 is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor that is being developed&#xD;
      as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. ERK inhibitors stop the signal that a&#xD;
      cancer cell receives telling it to grow. In this research study, the investigators are&#xD;
      testing to see if LY3214996 is safe when combined with ibrutinib in patients with specific&#xD;
      gene mutations. Making treatment decisions based on genetic testing is investigational, and&#xD;
      the FDA has not approved this genetic testing. Several doses of LY3214996 will be explored in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of ibrutinib or LY3214996 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of ibrutinib or LY3214996 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have previously received treatment with an ERK inhibitor, including&#xD;
             but not limited to previous treatment with LY3214996.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known CNS disease involvement should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to LY3214996 or ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible with the following&#xD;
             exceptions: individuals who have been treated and are disease-free for a minimum of 3&#xD;
             years prior to study enrollment, or individuals who are deemed by the treating&#xD;
             investigator to be at low risk for disease recurrence. Additionally, individuals with&#xD;
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed within the past 3 years: basal or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, breast or cervical carcinomas in situ, and low&#xD;
             risk prostate cancer that does not require treatment as judged by the treating&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are known at the time of trial enrollment to require concomitant&#xD;
             therapy with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. The use of strong or&#xD;
             moderate CYP3A inhibitors or inducers is prohibited for the duration of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are known at the time of trial enrollment to require concomitant&#xD;
             therapy with sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 or drugs cleared by CYP3A4 that have a&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic range. The use of these drugs is prohibited for the duration of&#xD;
             trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LY3214996 and ibrutinib are agents&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with LY3214996 or ibrutinib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with LY3214996 or ibrutinib. A negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test is required for women of childbearing potential prior to the first dose&#xD;
             of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             or hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history or findings of central or branch retinal artery or venous&#xD;
             occlusion with significant vision less, or other retinal diseases causing visual&#xD;
             impairment&#xD;
