    <textblock>
      This study proposes to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique by&#xD;
      which a very small electrical current (2 mA) is applied to the scalp, along side speech&#xD;
      therapy in patients with subacute stroke and aphasia in order to enhance language recovery.&#xD;
      Aphasic patients in an inpatient neurorehabilitation facility who have experienced a stroke&#xD;
      between one week and three months prior to enrollment will be invited to participate.&#xD;
      Participants will receive either real or sham tDCS to the left hemisphere of the brain for a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 consecutive sessions to up-to a max of 10 sessions depending on the length of&#xD;
      their rehab stay . Stimulation will be paired with with the patient's normal speech therapy&#xD;
      schedule. Participant's language skills will be assessed at baseline and immediately after&#xD;
      the last session of therapy in order to determine whether tDCS is associated with either&#xD;
      transient or persistent improvement in language.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Speech therapy is the standard of care nationwide in treating individuals who have had a&#xD;
      stroke and are now experiencing aphasia. Speech therapy can help to rehabilitate language&#xD;
      skills and supplement function by teaching alternate strategies for communication; however,&#xD;
      these benefits often leave room for further improvement. Researchers have focused their&#xD;
      efforts in combining speech therapy with other techniques to boost the effects. In this&#xD;
      study, we will combine speech therapy with non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in the hopes of significantly improve&#xD;
      language in subacute aphasia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot project, where inpatients with&#xD;
      subacute stroke and aphasia will be recruited from the Penn Institute for Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Medicine hospital (PIRM). The typical patient admitted to PIRM is approximately 1-2 weeks&#xD;
      post-stroke. Upon enrollment, baseline aphasia severity will be characterized using&#xD;
      standardized measures such as the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), Pyramids and Palm Trees&#xD;
      (PPT) and Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT) by the patient's speech therapist. Subjects will&#xD;
      subsequently be randomized to undergo either real or sham tDCS. Subjects will then undergo a&#xD;
      minimum of 5-consectuive stimulation session (Monday-Friday) and maximum of 10-consecutive&#xD;
      stimulation sessions (Monday-Friday) of either real or sham tDCS. During stimulation,&#xD;
      subjects will receive either real tDCS at a current of 2.0 mA for 20 minutes or sham&#xD;
      stimulation for an equivalent period of time with a 30sec ramp-up/ramp-down. Sham stimulation&#xD;
      mimics real stimulation closely; most subjects cannot distinguish between real and sham tDCS.&#xD;
      During stimulation visits subjects will concurrently participate in their regular speech&#xD;
      therapy treatment. Speech Therapy will be administered by their speech therapist and will&#xD;
      follow whatever protocol the therapist deems useful for standard of care treatment of their&#xD;
      aphasia. An immediate follow-up session will also take place, subjects will repeat language&#xD;
      batteries including the WAB, PPT and PNT.&#xD;
