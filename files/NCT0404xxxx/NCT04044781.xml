  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sponsor initiated, single site, first-in-human study of an investigational imaging&#xD;
      agent for quantifying the topographically specific concentrations of the phosphodiesterase&#xD;
      enzyme Type 4D (PDE4D) with positron emission tomography (PET) using a selective radioligand,&#xD;
      [11C]T2310. T2310 will be measured with imaging techniques to characterize plasma exposure&#xD;
      levels versus regionally specific target engagement fractions for oral doses of BPN14770, an&#xD;
      investigational new drug (IND) for modulating PDE4D. BPN14770 is under evaluation for the&#xD;
      treatment of Fragile X syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  3. Between 18 and 75 years, inclusive, but preference will be given to subjects who&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  4. The subject weighs at least 45 kg and has a body mass index between 18.0 and 32&#xD;
             kg/m2.&#xD;

          -  5. Subjects should be willing to observe the following contraception requirements from&#xD;
             Screening until 90 days after the final follow-up visit: Male subjects must be willing&#xD;
             to inform female partners of their participation in the study and must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraceptive methods (vasectomy performed at least 6 months prior to dosing&#xD;
             BPN14770 or use at least one barrier method of birth control). Female subjects: Female&#xD;
             subjects must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to dosing of BPN14770), at least two&#xD;
             years post-menopausal, or willing to use one barrier plus a hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
             method of contraception from initial screening until one month after taking the last&#xD;
             dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Known history or evidence of a clinically significant medical condition, disorder,&#xD;
             or disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a risk to subject&#xD;
             safety, proper completion of the procedures, or the integrity of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2. Clinical laboratory studies suggestive of a medically meaningful disease or&#xD;
             condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could pose a risk to subject&#xD;
             safety, proper completion of the procedures, or the integrity of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             disease, or will potentially compromise subject safety or the scientific integrity of&#xD;
             the study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  5. Previous exposure to ionizing radiation for research purposes, such that, in&#xD;

             within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of an&#xD;
             investigational product, unless in the opinion of the investigator (or delegate) and&#xD;
             the Sponsor's Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures, the pharmacokinetics of either the radiopharmaceutical or the&#xD;
             investigational drug product, or compromise subject safety. An example of potentially&#xD;
             acceptable drug use might be beta blockers in eye drops for glaucoma.&#xD;

             Sponsor's Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures,&#xD;
             the pharmacokinetics of either the radiopharmaceutical or the investigational drug&#xD;
             product, or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
