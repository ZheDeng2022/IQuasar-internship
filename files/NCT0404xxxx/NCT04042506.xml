  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade is a first-line treatment for patients with advanced&#xD;
      melanoma, but unfortunately most patients progress on this therapy. Recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that radiation can enhance the immune response in the presence of checkpoint blockade. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine if radiation can elicit increased immune responses in patients&#xD;
      who have stable or progressive disease on nivolumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in presence of ICB in&#xD;
      patients with advanced unresectable melanoma. Toxicity will be deemed acceptable if the rate&#xD;
      of Grade 3+ adverse events (CTC v4) is ≤ 33%, with relevant AEs defined as either of the&#xD;
      following occurring between the start of SBRT and 12 weeks following SBRT completion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3-5 metabolic or hematological toxicity that is related, probably related or&#xD;
           possibly related to nivolumab or SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3-5 non-hematological toxicity that is related, probably related or possibly&#xD;
           related to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine whether SBRT results in a clinical abscopal effect on unirradiated lesions.&#xD;
      The hypothesized rate of abscopal effect is &gt;14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Correlative studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In select patients for whom TCRseq reveals clonal expansion in non-irradiated tumor and&#xD;
           serial blood specimens, the relevance of such expansion to tumor-specific responses will&#xD;
           be investigated using mutation-associated neoantigens (MANAFEST) assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serial stool specimens will be studied to correlate potential changes in microbiome with&#xD;
           abscopal effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether SBRT promotes clonal expansion of melanoma-specific T-cells, in&#xD;
           both peripheral blood and within TME of non-irradiated lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether TCR clonal expansion correlates with clinically observed abscopal&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify additional immunological biomarkers in the non-irradiated (abscopal) TME&#xD;
           using intratumoral gene expression profiling to assess for induction and upregulation of&#xD;
           a Type I IFN signature among responders1-3. IHC in TME will be used to characterize&#xD;
           modulation of immune cell populations pre- and post-SBRT, and to assess correlation of&#xD;
           PD-L1 and other immune-checkpoint receptor expression with responsiveness to SBRT and&#xD;
           changes in TME post-SBRT.&#xD;
