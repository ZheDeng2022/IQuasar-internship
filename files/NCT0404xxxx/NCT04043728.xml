  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is caused primarily by smoking and smoking&#xD;
      cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly&#xD;
      50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high&#xD;
      rates of co-occurring conditions - nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety - which serve&#xD;
      as barriers to quitting. The current study will pilot test a behavioral intervention designed&#xD;
      to target the common psychological factors underlying these co-occurring conditions and&#xD;
      foster smoking cessation among COPD patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Aim: Develop a multi-component behavioral treatment to address psychological risk factors&#xD;
      among COPD patients. We will conduct a component analysis using single case design&#xD;
      experiments with 15 participants to a) examine the contribution of each treatment component&#xD;
      to the behavioral target of smoking for affect regulation, and b) establish proof-of-concept&#xD;
      on the clinical endpoint of initial cessation (&gt;24 hours abstinence).&#xD;

    <description>The secondary outcome is percent change in Smoking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (SMQ-R) average score. The SMQ-R measures the construct of smoking for affect regulation (i.e., smoking to improve mood or reduce distress). SMQ-R average score is computed as the average of 13 items, each assessed on a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating greater smoking for affect regulation.</description>

    <description>This module introduces mindfulness training skills, with the goal of cultivating nonjudgmental, present-focused experience of emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations related to cigarette smoking. By progressing though a series of experiential exercises (e.g., awareness of the breath, anchoring in the present), this module seeks to reduce maladaptive attempts to control negative emotions and facilitate tolerance of the physical and emotional symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.</description>

    <description>This module introduces interoceptive exposure, a technique in which participants purposefully and systematically complete exercises to evoke physical sensations typically associated with anxiety and distress, in order to reduce fear and avoidance of these sensations. Interoceptive exercises will focus on a gradual exposure to nicotine withdrawal symptoms, through a series of 'practice quit attempts' (i.e., brief periods of smoking abstinence without intention to permanently quit).</description>

    <description>This module introduces behavioral activation, which seeks to increase positive emotions by systematically introducing greater engagement with natural rewards. Treatment sessions focus on the identification of avoidance strategies, including cigarette smoking as a coping strategy for negative emotions. The goal of this treatment module is to replace smoking with adaptive coping strategies to facilitate contact with and enjoyment of reinforcing activities that are incompatible with smoking.</description>

            <description>This module introduces mindfulness training skills, with the goal of cultivating nonjudgmental, present-focused experience of emotions, thoughts, and physical sensations related to cigarette smoking. By progressing though a series of experiential exercises (e.g., awareness of the breath, anchoring in the present), this module seeks to reduce maladaptive attempts to control negative emotions and facilitate tolerance of the physical and emotional symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.&#xD;
Unified Protocol adapted for smoking cessation: Treatment components are cognitive-behavioral strategies adapted from the Unified Protocol (UP) for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders. Behavioral counseling strategies for smoking cessation, drawn from current US Public Health Service guidelines, are incorporated in each treatment module. All participants will be provided with the American Lung Association Freedom from Smoking guide to aid in their quit attempt.</description>

Interoceptive exercises will focus on a gradual exposure to nicotine withdrawal symptoms, through a series of 'practice quit attempts' (i.e., brief periods of smoking abstinence without intention to permanently quit).&#xD;

Treatment sessions focus on the identification of avoidance strategies, including cigarette smoking as a coping strategy for negative emotions. The goal of this treatment module is to replace smoking with adaptive coping strategies to facilitate contact with and enjoyment of reinforcing activities that are incompatible with smoking.&#xD;

The SMQ-R measures the construct of smoking for affect regulation (i.e., smoking to improve mood or reduce distress). SMQ-R average score is computed as the average of 13 items, each assessed on a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating greater smoking for affect regulation.</description>
