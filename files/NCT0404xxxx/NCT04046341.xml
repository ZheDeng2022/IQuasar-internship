  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will enroll up to 20 participants from 3 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&#xD;
      (CHOP) primary care locations. The primary objective is to determine the whether the Sleep&#xD;
      Well! behavioral sleep intervention is feasible to be implemented in primary care offices and&#xD;
      acceptable to families. The direction and magnitude of change in child sleep from&#xD;
      pre-intervention to post-intervention will also be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral sleep problems such as insomnia and insufficient sleep are common in toddlers and&#xD;
      preschoolers and disproportionately impact lower socioeconomic status (SES) children. Despite&#xD;
      a robust evidence base, behavioral sleep interventions are rarely tested with lower-SES&#xD;
      children or in primary care, an accessible service delivery setting. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the whether the Sleep Well! behavioral sleep intervention is&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable to families. We will also examine the direction and magnitude of&#xD;
      change in child sleep from pre-intervention to post-intervention. This is a preliminary open&#xD;
      trial of the Sleep Well! program with pre-intervention and post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments.Caregiver-child dyads (child ages 1-5 years with a sleep problem) will be&#xD;
      recruited from CHOP urban primary care sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Well! is a brief, behavioral sleep intervention for toddlers and preschoolers who have&#xD;
      a caregiver-reported sleep problem or who are not getting enough sleep. The intervention&#xD;
      includes evidence-based behavioral sleep approaches and strategies to engage and empower&#xD;
      families. The primary outcomes for this open trial are feasibility (number of caregivers&#xD;
      recruited, engaged, and retained in intervention; participant intervention attendance rate)&#xD;
      and caregiver acceptability, assessed via a questionnaire and qualitative post-intervention&#xD;
      interview. Secondary outcomes are the direction and magnitude in any pre- to&#xD;
      post-intervention change in child sleep.&#xD;

The BCSQ is appropriate for children ages 1.5-5 years and has shown good reliability and moderate correspondence with actigraphic recordings of child-sleep. When completing the BCSQ, caregivers are prompted to think about their child's sleep on a &quot;typical night&quot; over the past week (7 nights). Sleep onset latency is assessed by asking caregivers to report in minutes how long it typically takes their child to fall asleep.</description>

            <description>Parents attend 1-3 one-hour sessions at their primary care office or via telemedicine, where they receive sleep education and work with interventionists to develop strategies to help their child at bedtime.&#xD;
Sleep Well!: The intervention comprehensively addresses poor sleep health behaviors (e.g., use of electronics at bedtime; inconsistent and variable sleep schedules; lack of a bedtime routine) as well as insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep; the need for caregiver presence at bedtime) and insufficient sleep in toddlers and preschoolers. Interventionists will use strategies to engage with and empower families, such as motivational interviewing and collaborative problem-solving. Session content will be reinforced via phone calls from interventionists. Families will receive intervention session appointment reminders and information about intervention content (e.g., reminders to follow a bedtime routine) via text message.</description>

The BCSQ is appropriate for children ages 1.5-5 years and has shown good reliability and moderate correspondence with actigraphic recordings of child-sleep. When completing the BCSQ, caregivers are prompted to think about their child's sleep on a &quot;typical night&quot; over the past week (7 nights). Sleep onset latency is assessed by asking caregivers to report in minutes how long it typically takes their child to fall asleep.</description>

        <description>Caregivers will complete the BCSQ to report on child sleep habits and the severity of any caregiver-perceived sleep problems at pretreatment and posttreatment. The BCSQ is appropriate for children ages 1.5-5 years and has shown good reliability and moderate correspondence with actigraphic recordings of child-sleep.</description>

            <description>Parents attend 1-3 one-hour sessions at their primary care office or via telemedicine, where they receive sleep education and work with interventionists to develop strategies to help their child at bedtime.&#xD;
Sleep Well!: The intervention comprehensively addresses poor sleep health behaviors (e.g., use of electronics at bedtime; inconsistent and variable sleep schedules; lack of a bedtime routine) as well as insomnia (difficulty falling and staying asleep; the need for caregiver presence at bedtime) and insufficient sleep in toddlers and preschoolers. Interventionists will use strategies to engage with and empower families, such as motivational interviewing and collaborative problem-solving. Session content will be reinforced via phone calls from interventionists. Families will receive intervention session appointment reminders and information about intervention content (e.g., reminders to follow a bedtime routine) via text message.</description>
