      Study type: prospective cohort and randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: estimated 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications: Type II myocardial infarction in critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To recognise the incidence of type I myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with&#xD;
           suspected type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determining the safety of early coronary angiography in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of the effect of percutaneous coronary revascularization in critically ill&#xD;
           patients with stable obstructive coronary disease and type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obstructive coronary artery disease suitable for percutaneous revascularization is&#xD;
           present in majority of patients with type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type I MI (acute coronary artery thrombosis) is present in some patients and not&#xD;
           recognised.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiogram and a 12-lead electrocardiogram are not reliable in predicting coronary&#xD;
           artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Urgent invasive diagnostic is safe in patients with type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Percutaneous revascularization (if indicated) reduces the size of myocardial necrosis in&#xD;
           patients with type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Primary endpoint: to demonstrate that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the&#xD;
           group with obstructive coronary disease reduces the size of MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary endpoints: improved cardiac function after revascularization, shorter&#xD;
           hospitalization, reduced mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety objective: renal function, bleeding complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: 140 patients with type II MI over 18 years of age with no evidence of active&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Myocardial ischemia is common in critically ill patients. When the cause of&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia and subsequent necrosis is a mismatch between the delivery and&#xD;
      consumption of oxygen in the myocardium and not acute coronary artery thrombosis, we are&#xD;
      talking about type II myocardial infarction (type II MI) (1). The most common cause of such&#xD;
      MI is infection - sepsis. The infection increases oxygen consumption in the heart muscle,&#xD;
      which can lead to acute ischemia when the coronary reserve is reduced (chronic stable&#xD;
      coronary disease). This is manifested by troponin leakage, ischemic changes in the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), or impaired contraction of the heart muscle. In critically ill&#xD;
      patients, acute coronary artery thrombosis may also occur due to hyper coagulability, which&#xD;
      cannot be identified without urgent invasive coronary diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the lack of data on the efficacy of acute percutaneous revascularization, these&#xD;
      patients are generally treated medically. The cause of the increase in oxygen consumption is&#xD;
      treated. Usually invasive diagnostics is performed only in case of severe hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, very high levels of troponin, or clear newly formed segmental wall contraction&#xD;
      disorders visible on ultrasound. Delays to invasive diagnostics are generally longer than the&#xD;
      time frames recommended for invasive diagnostics in the treatment of type I MI without the ST&#xD;
      segment elevation in ECG (NSTE-ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obstructive coronary artery disease suitable for percutaneous revascularization is&#xD;
           present in most patients with type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Type I MI (acute coronary artery thrombosis) is misdiagnosed in some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiogram and a 12-lead electrocardiogram are not reliable in predicting coronary&#xD;
           artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Urgent coronary angiography is safe in patients with type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Percutaneous coronary revascularization (if indicated) reduces the size of myocardial&#xD;
           necrosis and may improve survival in the critically ill patients with type II MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A prospective randomized trial in critically ill patients with type II MI will be&#xD;
      performed. All patients will undergo coronary angiography in the first 24 hours after the&#xD;
      diagnosis. If acute coronary artery thrombosis is found, PCI will be done according to the&#xD;
      latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines for NSTE-ACS (2). In the case of&#xD;
      non-obstructive coronary artery disease or a normal coronary angiogram, standard treatment of&#xD;
      the underlying disease (pneumonia, sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc.) will&#xD;
      be continued. Patients with stable obstructive coronary artery disease will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups - interventional and control group. The first group of patients will undergo&#xD;
      immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (of all obstructive lesions or until 300&#xD;
      mL of contrast is reached), the second group will receive only medical treatment and a&#xD;
      delayed PCI if needed before hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial serum high sensitivity troponin I levels will be monitored at pre specified time&#xD;
      intervals (baseline, after 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours) and the &quot;area under the curve&quot;&#xD;
      of troponin concentration will be calculated, serving as a rough estimate of myocardial&#xD;
      necrosis size. At predetermined intervals, cardiac function will be evaluated with&#xD;
      echocardiography (baseline, day 3-5). Intensive care unit stay and hospitalization duration&#xD;
      will be recorded as well as survival at 30 days and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality rates in patients with type II MI treated in ICU are high (up to 40%). The&#xD;
      invertigators anticipate that the intervention could reduce myocardial necrosis (troponin&#xD;
      area under the curve) by 20-30% (primary goal) and absolute mortality by 5-10% (secondary&#xD;
      goal). In order to achieve a study power of 80% and a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between groups with p &lt;0.05, 70 patients should be included in each group. According to&#xD;
      current hospitalization data at the Department of Intensive Internal Medicine Ljubljana, such&#xD;
      a number of patients would require 18-24 months of enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the course of the study, potential complications would be carefully noted, notably the&#xD;
      potential for additional bleeding due to arterial punctures and the use of additional&#xD;
      anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs in the invasive group. Kidney function will be closely&#xD;
      monitored and the contrast volume will be limited to 300 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in critically ill patients who, in general, are not able to&#xD;
      give informed consent for inclusion in the study at the time of enrolment. Therefore, the&#xD;
      invertigators will seek for legal representative's agreement or patient's consent after&#xD;
      mental improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTATIONS Obstructive coronary disease is expected to be found in majority of patients&#xD;
      with type II MI. In some patients concomitant coronary thrombosis is expected, which would be&#xD;
      missed by standard diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that a routine invasive approach and PCI of obstructive coronary&#xD;
      lesions could reduce the infarct size and thus improve the prognosis of patients with type II&#xD;
      MI without significant complications in their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide important data on the safety and efficacy of early coronary&#xD;
      angiography in patients with type II MI, as it is currently only occasionally performed on&#xD;
      the basis of extrapolations from studies conducted in patients with NSTE-AKS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCHERS STATEMENT The researchers involved are trained in research work and are able to&#xD;
      identify in a timely manner any complications that could endanger the health or life of the&#xD;
      persons in the study and are able to act properly. The department takes care of the&#xD;
      professionalism of the work and the safety of persons in the study. All researchers will&#xD;

      beings, the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Human Rights&#xD;
      and Dignity of the Human Being in relation to the Use of Biology and Medicine (Oviedo&#xD;
      Convention) and the principles of the Slovenian Code of Medical Deontology.&#xD;
