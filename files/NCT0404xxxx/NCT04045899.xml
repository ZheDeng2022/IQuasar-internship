    <textblock>
      The present study entitled, &quot;A Randomized Controlled Study Comparing ProSeal Laryngeal Mask&#xD;
      Airway, Air-Q LMA and Ambu AuraGain in mechanically ventilated patients.&quot; was conducted in&#xD;
      during the period Nov 2016 - Aug 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim of the study was to compare the clinical performance of ProSeal-LMA (P-LMA) ,Air-Q&#xD;
      and Ambu AuraGain in terms of efficacy and safety in anaesthetized and paralyzed patients on&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation undergoing elective surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective was to study the three supraglottic devices with respect to following&#xD;
      parameters:-number of insertion attempts and overall success rate, ease of insertion of&#xD;
      device, time taken for placement of device, airway sealing pressure, glottic view, number of&#xD;
      attempts of gastric tube placement, hemodynamic parameters: heart rate and mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure: pre-insertion and 0,1,3,5 and 10 minutes post insertion and complications noted if&#xD;
      any: blood staining of device and tongue, lip and dental trauma, laryngospasm ,sore throat,&#xD;
      dysphagia, hoarseness of voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was a randomized prospective single blind comparative study comprised of 150 ASA I - II&#xD;
      patients, aged 18-65 years of either sex who weighed between 40 to 60 kg scheduled for&#xD;
      elective surgical procedure of duration not more than 90 mins. After a thorough&#xD;
      pre-anaesthetic check-up, informed written consent was obtained and the patients were&#xD;
      randomized into 3 groups of 50 patients each as Group P(Proseal), Group Q (Air Q) and Group A&#xD;
      (AuraGain) by computer generated randomization sequence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study PLMA, Air-Q® and Ambu AuraGain were compared undergoing elective surgeries&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia. Primary outcome measure was insertion time. Airway sealing&#xD;
      pressure,ease of insertion, number of attempts,overall success rate, glottis view,number of&#xD;
      attempts of gastric tube placement , hemodynamic parameters and complications were also&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval from the institutional ethical committee, 150 patients were studied in a&#xD;
      randomised prospective study, designed to compare PLMA , Air-Q® and Ambu AuraGain .The period&#xD;
      of the study was from nov 2016 to aug 2018. This study was conducted according to Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice standards and the Helsinki Declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II patients, between&#xD;
      18-65 years of age, weighing from 40 to 60 kg of either sex, undergoing elective surgical&#xD;
      procedures of duration not more than 90 minutes were selected for the study. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria included patients with anticipated difficult airway (mouth opening of &lt;2 finger,&#xD;
      Mallampati Score 4, limited neck extension, history of previous difficult intubation), upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections,airway related conditions such as trismus, trauma or mass,&#xD;
      cervical spine disease, obese with body mass index (BMI) ≥25kg/m2 ,pregnant females, patients&#xD;
      at risk of aspiration (full stomach, hiatus hernia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,&#xD;
      emergency surgery)and laparoscopic surgeries. Neck movement was assessed as Class: I-No&#xD;
      reduction in movement, II-1/3rd reduction, III-2/3rd reduction, IV-Complete reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following detailed pre-anaesthetic check-up, informed written consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      patients fulfilling the required criteria.Patients were randomly allocated into three groups&#xD;
      namely Group P(ProSeal,n=50) ,Group Q (Air-Q®, n = 50) and Group A (AuraGain™, n = 50) using&#xD;
      computer-generated randomisation sequence. Participants were assigned to specific groups by&#xD;
      the operating room nurse in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After attaching the standard monitors(ASA recommended), patients were pre-medicated with&#xD;
      injection midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg, dexamethasone 4 mg and nalbuphine&#xD;
      0.02mg/kg intravenously. All patients were pre-oxygenated for 3 min, and anaesthesia was&#xD;
      induced with injection propofol 2 mg/kg. Injection vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg was given for&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLMA or Air-Q® or AuraGain™ appropriate for weight or/and height was inserted as per the&#xD;
      manufacturers guidelines.After successful insertion, the cuff was inflated with air according&#xD;
      to the size and type of LMA as per manufacturers guidelines, to prevent audible and palpable&#xD;
      air leak. An effective airway was confirmed by bilateral symmetrical chest expansion on&#xD;
      manual ventilation, auscultation of breath sounds, square waveform on capnography. Devices&#xD;
      were fixed with adhesive tape applied to the maxilla on one side of the patient's face and&#xD;
      passed over and under the tube in a single loop before fixing to the opposite maxilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide and isoflurane and intermittent&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation. Haemodynamic parameters[heart rate(HR), mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure(MAP)]were monitored before and after the insertion of the device. A lubricated&#xD;
      gastric tube was placed in the stomach through the gastric channel. At the end of surgical&#xD;
      procedure, anaesthesia was discontinued and residual neuromuscular blockade reversed with&#xD;
      injection neostigmine and glycopyrrolate, followed by device removal. Complication if any was&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion time, number of insertion attempts, overall success rate, ease of insertion, airway&#xD;
      sealing pressure, glottis view, number of attempts of gastric tube insertion, hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters (HR and MAP) preinduction, induction and 1,3,5 and 10mins post induction and&#xD;
      complications were noted. One attempt was defined as insertion of the LMA between the teeth&#xD;
      until the LMA will be deemed to be correctly placed and its cuff will be properly inflated.&#xD;
      In case of insertion attempts, maximum of three attempts were allowed. An attempt was&#xD;
      considered unsuccessful, if there was failure to negotiate the device beyond oropharynx,&#xD;
      significant leak present (both audible and auscultatory) or inadequate ventilation with&#xD;
      EtCO2&gt;45 mmHg. Failure of a device was defined as three unsuccessful insertion attempts or&#xD;
      inadequate ventilation. After failure of three attempts, intubation was performed using&#xD;
      conventional rigid laryngoscopy and case was recorded as failed and also deleted from the&#xD;
      study. The ease of insertion of device based on Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) was recorded.0 was&#xD;
      considered the easiest insertion of device and 10 being the most difficult&#xD;
      insertion.Insertion time was defined as time interval (in seconds) elapsed from insertion of&#xD;
      LMA between the dental arches until the confirmation of successful ventilation determined by&#xD;
      chest wall movement, auscultation of breath sounds and square wave capnographic curves and no&#xD;
      oropharyngeal leak with peak airway pressure ≥ 20cmH2O, which was recorded by an independent&#xD;
      observer.The airway sealing pressure was measured by closing the expiratory valve of the&#xD;
      circle system at a fixed gas flow of 3 L/min and recording the airway pressure at which&#xD;
      equilibrium is reached. At this stage, a leak at mouth and stomach was ascertained. Glottic&#xD;
      viewing was assessed by insertion of the fibreoptic bronchoscope through the airway channel&#xD;
      of the respective LMA.A maximum of two attempts were allowed for gastric tube placement. Its&#xD;
      correct placement was confirmed by injection of air and epigastric auscultation or aspiration&#xD;
      of gastric contents. Failure was defined as inability to advance the orogastric tube into the&#xD;
      stomach within two attempts. Blood staining of the device and tongue, lip or dental trauma&#xD;
      was noted. Incidence of laryngospasm or hypoxia (defined as oxygen saturation &lt;92%), if any,&#xD;
      in intra-operative period was noted and managed accordingly. In post-operative period, an&#xD;
      investigator blinded to study asked the patients about the signs of sore throat, dysphagia&#xD;
      and hoarseness of voice. Incidence of hoarseness and sore throat, whether present or absent,&#xD;
      were enquired in 24 h post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of the study was insertion time. Based on a previous study&#xD;
      investigators found mean insertion time in PLMA group was 23.43 seconds and SD of 3.54. Based&#xD;
      on that, taking alpha 0.05, β =0.90 and 25% difference between the means as significant,&#xD;
      investigators calculated 47 patients were required in each group; hence, the sample size was&#xD;
      increased to 50 patients each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data were recorded in a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS statistics&#xD;
      software version 24 (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous numerical variables were&#xD;
      presented as mean (standard deviation) and intergroup differences were compared using one-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance with post hoc correction. Categorical variables were presented as ratio&#xD;
      or as n (%) and inter-group differences were compared using Kruskall-Wallis test. The P&lt; 0.05&#xD;
      was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
