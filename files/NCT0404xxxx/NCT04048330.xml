  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women of reproductive age are a high-risk population for anemia and micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies, and there is increasing evidence of the role of periconceptional nutritional&#xD;
      status in the risk of birth defects and other pregnancy complications. However, there is&#xD;
      limited population-based data from India, where the burden and consequences of these&#xD;
      deficiencies is unacceptably high. The objective of this study is to conduct a&#xD;
      population-based biomarker survey to determine the burden of anemia and vitamin B12 and&#xD;
      folate status in women of reproductive age, as part of a periconceptional surveillance&#xD;
      program in Southern India. Findings from this biomarker survey will establish the burden of&#xD;
      anemia and B-vitamin deficiencies in women of reproductive age, and inform the development of&#xD;
      a randomized efficacy trial of quadruple-fortified salt for the prevention of anemia and&#xD;
      birth defects in Southern India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women of reproductive age are a high-risk population for anemia and micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiencies due to social structures, and the physical demands of pregnancy and lactation&#xD;
      particularly in South Asia. Periconceptional vitamin B12 and folate status are implicated in&#xD;
      the development of birth defects and other pregnancy complications. Preliminary findings from&#xD;
      clinical populations suggest that vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies early in pregnancy are&#xD;
      the leading nutritional causes for neural tube defects. However, there is little&#xD;
      representative population-level data from Southern India. Surveillance programs are urgently&#xD;
      needed to establish the burden of anemia and key micronutrient deficiencies in high-burden&#xD;
      settings such as Southern India, and to inform the development of interventions for anemia&#xD;
      and birth defects prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to conduct a biomarker survey to determine the burden of&#xD;
      anemia and vitamin B12 and folate status in women of reproductive age, as part of an ongoing&#xD;
      periconceptional surveillance program in Southern India. The goals of this surveillance&#xD;
      program are to establish the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended microbiological&#xD;
      assay for folate in Southern India, to determine the burden of anemia and B-vitamin&#xD;
      deficiencies in women of reproductive age, and to inform the development of a randomized&#xD;
      trial of quadruple-fortified salt for anemia and birth defects prevention in Southern India.&#xD;
      This laboratory will also serve as the foundation for future intervention trials and public&#xD;
      health programs to improve the health of women and young children in this population.&#xD;

        In order to obtain representative, population-level data in this setting, all rural&#xD;
        households and a random subset (n=1,000) of urban households in the catchment area will be&#xD;
        selected for subsequent screening and recruitment of WRA for the biomarker study, with a&#xD;
        target sample size of 1,500 women of reproductive age. The random sample of urban&#xD;
        households (n=1,000) will be selected from the Census, through a simple random sample&#xD;
        conducted by a biostatistician from the CDC otherwise unaffiliated with the study. For&#xD;
        households with more than one eligible woman of reproductive age, an a priori algorithm&#xD;
        will be developed to randomly select one eligible WRA as the proband for the biomarker&#xD;
        survey, for a final sample with one eligible WRA per household.&#xD;
