  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, many studies have shown that prehabilitation based on aerobic training&#xD;
      strategies could have a positive effect on the recovery of postoperative functional capacity&#xD;
      in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Investigators are proposing a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to compare the impact of a short home-based multimodal&#xD;
      prehabilitation strategy to preoperative aerobic training on patients scheduled for&#xD;
      video-assisted thorascopic lobectomy for lung cancer. The multimodal prehabilitation strategy&#xD;
      includes guided aerobic and resistance exercise, breathing exercises, nutrition supplement&#xD;
      and physiology management preoperatively, while the aerobic strategy offers the same aerobic&#xD;
      training guidance without the other parts. The prehabilitation lasts 2-3 weeks in our center.&#xD;
      Investigators follow-up patients until 30 days after surgery, to investigate whether&#xD;
      multimodal prehabilitation strategy differs from aerobic training program in postoperative&#xD;
      functional capability improvement, health-related quality of life scorings, incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative complications and other outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of a short home-based multimodal&#xD;
      prehabilitaiton strategy to preoperative aerobic training program on patients undertaking&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy for lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of prehabilitation is to enhance an individual's functional capacity to reach the&#xD;
      optimal physiological state before surgery, helping them withstand the stress of surgery and&#xD;
      receive an enhanced recovery post operation. Recent studies have shown that trimodal or&#xD;
      multimodal prehabilitation strategy including exercise, diet and psychologic guidance could&#xD;
      improve postoperative functional recovery for patients undergoing colorectal resection.&#xD;
      However, researches regarding to the effect of multi-modal prehabilitation in other types of&#xD;
      operations remain scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the postoperative functional capacity decreases in patients&#xD;
      undergoing lung cancer surgery. Therefore, many clinical trials were designed to explore the&#xD;
      impact of prehabilitation on these patients, and many of them yielded positive results,&#xD;
      showing preoperative exercise for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery is safe and&#xD;
      beneficial in postoperative functional capacity recovery. However, the majority of the trials&#xD;
      conducted adopted preoperative exercises, specifically aerobic exercises, as the sole means&#xD;
      of prehabilitation. In 2017, our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (registration&#xD;
      number NCT03068507) to examine the efficacy of a 2-week multimodal home-based prehabilitation&#xD;
      strategy in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy for lung cancer. The preliminary results&#xD;
      indicate that patients who received the short multimodal home-based prehabilitation have a&#xD;
      significantly higher 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) perioperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are proposing a new randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of a&#xD;
      short multimodal home-based prehabilitation with the sole aerobic prehabilitation strategy&#xD;
      adopted by the previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 patients scheduled to have elective VATS lobectomy for primary lung cancer&#xD;
      will be recruited in this research at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After informed&#xD;
      consent is obtained, the patients will be evenly assigned to two groups randomly based on&#xD;
      computer-generated sequence, the multimodal prehabilitation group and the aerobic&#xD;
      prehabilitation group. The random allocation will be concealed using sealed opaque envelops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multimodal group will receive an individualized prehabilitation strategy after a complete&#xD;
      assessment, including aerobic and resistance exercise, nutritional optimization, and&#xD;
      psychological therapy, as well as conventional guidance. All patients will receive an&#xD;
      instruction booklet with details in text and pictures, and will be asked to complete standard&#xD;
      diaries in the booklet. The length of prehabilitation will be 2-3 weeks, determined by the&#xD;
      waiting time till surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the multimodal group, prehabilitation strategy is as follows: 1) a 30-minute aerobic&#xD;
      exercise at least 3 times a week, in the form of jogging, power walking or cycling, according&#xD;
      to the patients' individual choice; 2) a guided resistance exercise at least twice a week,&#xD;
      using a pull strap distributed by investigators to accomplish 4 pre-set resistance posture;&#xD;
      3) breathing exercise at least 3 times per day, lasting over 10 minutes, in the form of&#xD;
      guided effective coughing, blowing up a small balloon or using the respiratory exerciser&#xD;
      distributed by investigators; 4) nutritional advice and whey protein supplement 1hour prior&#xD;
      to exercising (20g/day for male and 15g/day for female patients); 5) psychological therapy by&#xD;
      listening to soothing music or radio and other relaxing activities. Patients are advised to&#xD;
      record daily exercises and adherence to nutritional, psychological and other recommendations&#xD;
      in a prehabilitation journal distributed by investigators. Standardized short message&#xD;
      interviews are sent to patients twice a week to optimize adherence and promote timely&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aerobic group will receive the same guidance in the individualized home-based aerobic&#xD;
      exercise strategy as the multimodal group, but not in the other aspects. These patients are&#xD;
      also advised to keep a prehabilitation journal recording daily exercises and will receive the&#xD;
      same short message interviews twice a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled will receive the conventional guidance, including preoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia assessment, drug treatment recommendations for chronic disease, quit smoking and&#xD;
      abstinence. And patients are also provided some useful information about anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients and trial personnel will not be blinded to the allocation regarding to the&#xD;
      nature of the intervention. The outcome assessors will independently collect the outcome data&#xD;
      without the knowledge of the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be post-operative 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), measured as&#xD;
      functional walking capacity, at 30 days postoperatively). The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      perioperative 6MWD (1 day before surgery, 30 days postoperatively), pulmonary function (1 day&#xD;
      before surgery, 30 days postoperatively), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), World&#xD;
      Health Organization disability assessment schedule II (WHODAS 2.0) score, postoperative&#xD;
      quality of recovery score -15 (QoR-15) score and prognosis information (mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity, length of hospital stay, ICU stay time, duration of chest tube, etc.).&#xD;
