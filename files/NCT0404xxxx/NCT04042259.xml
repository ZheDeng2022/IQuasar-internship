  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection rates for contaminated or dirty laparotomy wounds can be as high as&#xD;
      45%. Surgical management of dirty and contaminated wounds has been controversial in the&#xD;
      literature and between surgeons. Primary closure (PC) of these wounds can lead to multiple&#xD;
      complications including surgical site infection (SSI), necrotizing soft tissue infection,&#xD;
      wound and fascial dehiscence, evisceration, sepsis and hernia development. However, an&#xD;
      alternative technique of utilizing secondary intention results in prolonged healing time and&#xD;
      increased cost and healthcare resource utilization. Delayed primary closure (DPC) was&#xD;
      developed to address many of these issues. Bhangu completed a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis comparing primary versus delayed primary skin closure in contaminated and dirty&#xD;
      abdominal wounds. They included 8 studies randomizing 623 patients with contaminated or dirty&#xD;
      abdominal wounds to either DPC or PC. The most common diagnosis was appendicitis (77.4%),&#xD;
      followed by perforated abdominal viscus (11.5%), ileostomy closure (6.5%), trauma (2.7%), and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal abscess/other peritonitis (1.9%). The time to first assessment for DPC was&#xD;
      between 2 and 5 days postoperatively. In all studies, the DPC group had significantly less&#xD;
      SSIs using a fixed-effect model (odds ratio, 0.65; 95%CI, 0.40-0.93; P = .02). However,&#xD;
      heterogeneity was high (72%), and using a random-effects model, the effect was no longer&#xD;
      significant (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.25-1.64; P = .36). Additionally, all of the studies&#xD;
      were found to be at high risk of bias, with marked deficiencies in study design and outcome&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent systematic review showed improved fascial closure rates with negative pressure wound&#xD;
      therapy (NPWT) Yet, a large national study using NPWT to perform a DPC has been shown to&#xD;
      actually decrease the rate of closure. Access to NPWT has increased over the years and&#xD;
      innovative wound management techniques including incisional application of negative pressure&#xD;
      therapy have allowed clinicians to apply this method to dirty wounds following the principles&#xD;
      of delayed primary closure. There are currently no studies available to help determine the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of advanced NPWT techniques to optimize surgical wound management from&#xD;
      the open abdomen to skin closure. Within our Division, we have decided to make a practice&#xD;
      change and develop a standard closure plan for open abdomens using the negative pressure&#xD;
      devices available within our institution.&#xD;
