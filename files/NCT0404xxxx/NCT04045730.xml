    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in combination with PVHA and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as measured by progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, PVHA and pembrolizumab will&#xD;
      improve PFS compared to the historical control for chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Secondary Objectives &amp; Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective: To estimate median overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective: To determine the toxicity and tolerability of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
           with PVHA and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, PVHA, and pembrolizumab will be&#xD;
      safe and improve OS and ORR compared to the historical control for chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Exploratory Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective: To evaluate pre-treatment and on-treatment PD-L1 and hyaluronan (HA) status&#xD;
           and correlate with PFS, ORR, and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective: To measure the stromal alterations and stromal degradation of hyaluronan and&#xD;
           correlate with clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective: To quantify the pre-treatment and on-treatment change in immune effector&#xD;
           cells and correlate with clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective: To cryopreserve additional tumor tissue for future analysis, including but&#xD;
           not limited to DNA and RNA sequencing.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male/female participants who are at least 18 years of age on the day of signing&#xD;
             informed consent with an untreated metastatic histologically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A male participant must agree to use a contraception as detailed in Appendix 3 of this&#xD;
        protocol during the treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
        treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant not breastfeeding,&#xD;
        and at least one of the following conditions applies: Not a woman of childbearing potential&#xD;
        (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in during the treatment period and&#xD;
        for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written&#xD;
             informed consent for the trial. Patients or their legally authorized representative&#xD;
             must be informed of the investigational nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease on computed tomography (CT) scan and/or MRI per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             criteria. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable&#xD;
             if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to undergo a pre-treatment core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not&#xD;
             previously irradiated, except for patients with 15 FFPE unstained slides of tumor&#xD;
             tissue where a pre-treatment biopsy is optional. If 15 FFPE unstained slides are&#xD;
             unavailable a pre-treatment biopsy is only mandatory if it can be obtained via a&#xD;
             non-significant risk procedure. Significant risk procedures include (but are not&#xD;
             limited to) biopsies of the brain, lung / mediastinum, pancreas, or endoscopic&#xD;
             procedures extending beyond the esophagus, stomach, or bowel. Any biopsy via&#xD;
             significant risk procedure is optional. For patients who pursue an optional biopsy&#xD;
             when a non-significant risk biopsy is possible the optional biopsy will serve as the&#xD;
             pre-treatment tissue sample. Biopsy requirements are further outlined in section&#xD;
             7.1.2.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to undergo an on-treatment core or excisional tumor biopsy at week 8 (for the&#xD;
             first 20 evaluable patients). Biopsy risk requirements for on-treatment biopsies are&#xD;
             the same as the pre-treatment biopsy and outlined above and in section 7.1.2.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.&#xD;
             Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7 days prior to day 1 of treatment. .&#xD;
