      This study will evaluate the performance of the VIDAS® Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) Release Assay&#xD;
      (TB-IGRA) assay, which is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis&#xD;
      infection. This study is designed to assess (1) the sensitivity of this assay, (2) its&#xD;
      percent agreement with other diagnostic tests, (3) its measurement precision , and (4) any&#xD;
      potential interference of the presence of other non-tuberculosis mycobacterial bacterial&#xD;
      infections with this assay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) infection is one of the top 10 causes of death in the world and the leading&#xD;
      cause of death due to a single infectious agent. Millions of people are infected with TB each&#xD;
      year which can pose significant economic and health care burdens on the global population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB can infected the lungs (pulmonary TB) or other organs such as the brain, and kidneys&#xD;
      (extra-pulmonary TB). When a person with pulmonary TB coughs or sneezes, water droplets&#xD;
      containing M. tuberculosis are expelled into the air. Persons can become infected with TB&#xD;
      when they inhale air containing these water droplets, however, not everyone infected with&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) becomes ill. Therefore two TB-related conditions exist:&#xD;
      latent TB infection (LTBI) and TB disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with latent TB infection are not ill and do not present TB symptoms or have TB&#xD;
      disease. The only sign of TB infection is a positive reaction to the tuberculin skin test or&#xD;
      TB blood tests such as IGRA tests. People with latent TB infection are not contagious and&#xD;
      cannot spread TB infection to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and treatment of LTBI can substantially reduce the risk of developing active&#xD;
      disease. However, there is no diagnostic gold standard for LTBI. Two types of test are&#xD;
      currently available for the identification of LTBI: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the TB&#xD;
      Interferon Gamma (IFN-γ) Release Assay (TB-IGRA). Evidence suggests that both TST and TB-IGRA&#xD;
      are acceptable but not perfect because they detect indirect markers of Mtb exposure and&#xD;
      indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis. TB-IGRAs have a number of advantages&#xD;
      compared to TST which promote their progressive adoption in the clinical practice and in&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
