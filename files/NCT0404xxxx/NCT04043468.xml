  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Audit and feedback (A&amp;F) aims to improve practices by providing professionals with a summary&#xD;
      of their performance. A major limitation to its effectiveness is a persistent&#xD;
      intention-action gap following the feedback that prevents the translation of planned actions&#xD;
      into concrete changes in practice. In nursing, the lack of coordination within nursing teams&#xD;
      contributes to this gap and therefore limits their capacity for action. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effects of an A&amp;F intervention enhanced with an action support&#xD;
      component on the primary care nursing teams' capacity to improve performance compared to a&#xD;
      standard A&amp;F intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with analysis of implementation fidelity will&#xD;
      be conducted. Four nursing organizations will receive standard A&amp;F, while the other four will&#xD;
      receive A&amp;F with a support component. We will measure performance using clinical&#xD;
      administrative data from an electronic database based on wound care episodes. Performance&#xD;
      indicators will be measured 3 times: at the beginning of the study (T1), after 6 months (T2)&#xD;
      and after 12 months (T3). The feedback meetings will take place between times 1 and 2, then&#xD;
      between times 2 and 3. The intervention group will receive the support component in the form&#xD;
      of structured focus groups in addition to the feedback meetings. Changes in rates of seven&#xD;
      nursing-sensitive indicators (continuity, planning and adjusting of the treatment plan,&#xD;
      initial assessment, education, frequency and number of consultations and duration of&#xD;
      episodes) will be measured to evaluate the effects of A&amp;F on performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results are expected to inform of the effectiveness of A&amp;F in order to improve its design&#xD;
      and deployment. The potential impact on the improvement of practices is significant,&#xD;
      considering that wound care is one of the main conditions in primary care for which nursing&#xD;
      staff have a high degree of autonomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Audit and feedback (A&amp;F) is an intervention that aims to improve professionals practices by&#xD;
      providing professionals with a summary of their performance over a period of time. A&amp;F has 1)&#xD;
      an audit phase, in which performance indicators are measured and 2) a feedback phase, in&#xD;
      which the indicators are reported to the professionals to encourage reflexive practice and&#xD;
      determine an action plan. Although its effectiveness has been demonstrated, it is widely&#xD;
      accepted that this type of intervention is highly variable and that its design has&#xD;
      considerable room for improvement. A major limitation to the effectiveness of A&amp;F is a&#xD;
      persistent intention-action gap encounters by professionals following the feedback. This gap&#xD;
      prevents the translation of planned actions into concrete changes in practice. In nursing, an&#xD;
      aspect that contributes to this gap is a lack of coordination of actions within nursing&#xD;
      teams, which limits their capacity for collective action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of an A&amp;F&#xD;
      intervention enhanced with an action support component on the primary care nursing teams'&#xD;
      capacity to improve performance compared to a standard A&amp;F intervention. This study has two&#xD;
      specific objectives: 1) to measure the effects of the addition of structured focus groups&#xD;
      during an enhanced A&amp;F intervention on the performance levels of the process and outcome&#xD;
      indicators compared with the measured effects of standard A&amp;F intervention; and 2) to analyze&#xD;
      the effects of the implementation fidelity of the standard and enhanced A&amp;F interventions on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of A&amp;F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with analysis of implementation&#xD;
      fidelity will be conducted. Eight primary care nursing organizations will be included. Four&#xD;
      of them will receive a standard A&amp;F intervention, while the remaining four will receive an AF&#xD;
      intervention with a support component. Performance will be measured using clinical&#xD;
      administrative data from an electronic database currently used to compile statistics on the&#xD;
      services provided and the users of Local community service centers (CLSC) in Quebec.&#xD;
      Performance will be measured from wound care episodes of patients who had a follow-up during&#xD;
      the study period. Four process indicators (continuity, planning and adjusting of the&#xD;
      treatment plan, initial assessment and education) and three outcome indicators (frequency and&#xD;
      number of consultations and duration of episodes) sensitive to nursing care will be measured&#xD;
      3 times: at the beginning of the study (T1), after 6 months (T2) and after 12 months (T3).&#xD;
      The feedback meetings will take place between times 1 and 2, then between times 2 and 3. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the support component in the form of structured focus groups&#xD;
      in addition to the feedback meetings, twice between each of the time periods. Models of&#xD;
      generalized estimating equations will be adjusted to analyze differences in performance in&#xD;
      each group. An analysis of implementation fidelity will be conducted in parallel of the&#xD;
      pragmatic trial using grids of observations in each of the settings&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inclusion and exclusion criteria are at two levels: 1) primary care organizations&#xD;
             and 2) wound care episodes that will be used to measure performance improvement.&#xD;
             Nursing organizations that offer services seven days a week will be included so that&#xD;
             they can measure all the selected indicators and use the I-CLSC software in their&#xD;
             daily practice. Wound care episodes with a minimum duration of 7 days and an episode&#xD;
             start during the measurement period will be included. These two criteria are applied&#xD;
             in order to measure the seven indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wound care episodes in palliative care will be excluded, as the indicators were&#xD;
             selected for episodes of wound care with healing potential. Such episodes are&#xD;
             identifiable by codes in the database.&#xD;
