      The Million Hearts Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Reduction Model, run by the Centers for&#xD;
      Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), seeks to improve cardiovascular care by providing&#xD;
      incentives and supports for health care practitioners to engage in patient CVD risk&#xD;
      calculation and population-level CVD risk management. CMS enrolled organizations throughout&#xD;
      the United States, randomly assigning half to the intervention and half to a control group.&#xD;
      This study is an evaluation of the model and will assess the model impacts on patient&#xD;
      outcomes, changes in CVD care processes, and implementation challenges and successes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In January 2017, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Million&#xD;
      Hearts Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Reduction model, designed to reduce heart attacks&#xD;
      and strokes among Medicare fee for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. CMS is testing the Million&#xD;
      Hearts CVD model over five years among more than 400 participating organizations, with half&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention and half to a control group. These organizations&#xD;
      include primary care practices, specialty/multispecialty practices, health centers, and&#xD;
      hospital outpatient departments. The intervention organizations are expected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk stratify all of their eligible Medicare FFS beneficiaries, using the American&#xD;
           College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) calculator to estimate each&#xD;
           eligible beneficiary's risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years.&#xD;
           Beneficiaries are eligible if they are ages 40-79 as of enrollment in the program, have&#xD;
           not had a heart attack or stroke, are enrolled in Medicare Part A and B, do not have&#xD;
           end-stage renal disease, and are not receiving hospice benefits. Beneficiaries with a&#xD;
           CVD risk exceeding 30 percent are considered high risk, whereas those with a risk from&#xD;
           15-30 percent are medium risk. All others are low risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide cardiovascular care management to high-risk beneficiaries--which includes&#xD;
           discussing with patients different options for reducing CVD risk, developing a care&#xD;
           plan, and following up with patients at least twice a year (any mode) to assess and&#xD;
           encourage progress on the care plan, and annual in-person visits to reassess risk and&#xD;
           revise care plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect and report clinical data to CMS via the Million Hearts Model Data Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in learning system activities, including webinars and videoconferences,&#xD;
           designed to spread effective strategies for implementing the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMS supports the intervention organizations with payments for risk stratification,&#xD;
      cardiovascular management, and risk reduction. Participating organizations receive payments&#xD;
      for each eligible beneficiary they risk stratify. In the first model year, the cardiovascular&#xD;
      management fees are fixed per beneficiary per month (PBPM) for each high-risk enrollee. In&#xD;
      model year 2 and later, CMS is replacing the cardiovascular management fees with risk&#xD;
      reduction payments that are scaled to the organization's performance in reducing 10-year&#xD;
      predicted risk among their beneficiaries who were high-risk at initial enrollment. To support&#xD;
      the model's evaluation, CMS is also paying control organizations to collect and report&#xD;
      clinical data on their eligible Medicare FFS beneficiaries, but these organizations are not&#xD;
      asked to calculate CVD risk scores or otherwise change their clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the investigators is to evaluate the impact of this model on first-time&#xD;
      heart attacks and strokes and CVD-related spending among high CVD risk Medicare FFS&#xD;
      beneficiaries, comparing beneficiaries in intervention practices with beneficiaries in&#xD;
      control practices. Using Medicare Part A, B, and D administrative claims data, investigators&#xD;
      also plan to evaluate the impact of the model on beneficiary mortality, CVD service&#xD;
      utilization, and CVD-related medication use. The investigators will also use survey data from&#xD;
      providers to identify changes in CVD-related knowledge, behaviors, and care delivery.&#xD;

        The study population is a census of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who were&#xD;
        enrolled by providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants) in the&#xD;
        intervention and control organizations. Providers enroll a beneficiary when they have an&#xD;
        office visit with a patient and submit to CMS all of the CVD risk data needed to generate a&#xD;
        risk score that is current as of that visit date. Providers submit these data to CMS via a&#xD;
        registry-called the Million Hearts Model Data Registry-designed specifically for this&#xD;
        purpose. Beneficiaries will be included in the study population if they meet the&#xD;
        eligibility criteria. Following an intent-to-treat principle, we will keep beneficiaries in&#xD;
        the sample for as long as they are alive and observable in Medicare FFS claims data (the&#xD;
        primary source for study outcomes), whether or not they continue to receive clinical&#xD;
        services from the participating organizations.&#xD;
