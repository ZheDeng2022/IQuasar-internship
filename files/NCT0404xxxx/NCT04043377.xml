  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-DOTATATE is a PET radiotracer with high affinity and selectivity for somatostatin&#xD;
      receptor 2 (SSTR 2) and is approved clinically for the evaluation of patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors. The SSTR2 receptor is also highly expressed at the surface of human&#xD;
      macrophages and lymphocytes. In comparison to FDG, 68Ga-DOTATATE presents the advantage of&#xD;
      fast clearance from tissues, which are not expressing somatostatin receptors, in particular&#xD;
      muscular and myocardial tissues, and the level of blood glucose does not influence its&#xD;
      uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulation of 68Ga-DOTATATE has already been detected in coronary and carotid plaques and&#xD;
      is associated with the number of activated macrophages present in plaques obtained after&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy. In a recent study, Tarkin et al. confirmed the preferential uptake of&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTATATE by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. In addition, the intensity of&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTATATE was higher in culprit lesions in the carotid and coronary arteries than in&#xD;
      stable lesions. The evaluation of 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in coronary arteries was also strongly&#xD;
      facilitated in comparison to FDG thanks to the absence of spillover signal from the&#xD;
      myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AAA has developed a new kit that has markedly simplified the synthesis of 68Ga-DOTATATE and&#xD;
      has obtained in the US marketing authorization for the kit (Netspot; kit for the preparation&#xD;
      of Gallium-68-DOTATATE injection for intravenous use) on June 1st 2016 (NDA 208547) for&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with neuro-endocrine tumors. The Netspot kit will be used in this&#xD;
      study for the detection of progressing coronary atherosclerosis.&#xD;

      Design of the trial :&#xD;
&#xD;
      iPROGRESS is a prospective interventional study. The primary objective of this study will be&#xD;
      to test the association between the intensity of 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake in coronary plaques&#xD;
      quantified with PET at M0 and the absolute progression rate of coronary artery calcium&#xD;
      scoring (CACS) measured between the CT acquired at M0 and after 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened until 1 month before the inclusion (M0) visit. Thereafter, 3 visits&#xD;
      specifics to the study will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M0 (baseline): Injection of 68Ga-DOTATATE followed by PET-scan and a CCTA-scan M12 et&#xD;
      M24(follow-up): Consultation and low-dose cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring performed&#xD;
