  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single sequence clinical study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of B. Braun PA on&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes, indwell time and first stick success of PIVC using B. Braun&#xD;
      Peripheral Advantage (PA) by Registered Nurses (RNs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Emergency Department (ED) and/or Medical Surgical (MS)&#xD;
      floor(s)/unit(s) in multiple hospitals.&#xD;
