  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current dosing regimens for vancomycin result in many young infants not reaching the target&#xD;
      level of vancomycin in the blood at steady state (when the blood is in equilibrium at 24-48&#xD;
      hours).The purpose of this study is to assess an improved method of calculating the dose of&#xD;
      vancomycin ('model-based dosing') in young infants with infections in order for them to&#xD;
      achieve the target vancomycin level at steady state. A dosing calculator (which will be&#xD;
      available through a web application) will be used for the dose calculation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care dosing of vancomycin in young infants is based on weight (eg. 15&#xD;
      mg/kg/dose). There is evidence that many young infants who are prescribed vancomycin using&#xD;
      this calculation will not have enough vancomycin in the blood at steady state to treat an&#xD;
      infection effectively. In this study a dosing calculator will be used to generate each&#xD;
      participant's dose with the aim to improve the number of participant's who achieve the target&#xD;
      vancomycin level (10 - 20 mg/L) at steady state. The dosing calculator is based on a&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of vancomycin which was built from prospective data.&#xD;
      The participant's weight, post-menstrual age, creatinine and target vancomycin level will be&#xD;
      entered into the dosing calculator (available on a web application), and the calculator will&#xD;
      provide the dosing regimen for that participant. The participant will have the vancomycin&#xD;
      level checked at 24-48 hours to assess if the target level has been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is 'part 1' of the study protocol (version 4.0) as approved under HREC reference&#xD;
      number HREC/51942/RCHM-2019. This protocol also includes a second study, 'part 2', which will&#xD;
      be registered with clinicaltrials.gov separately. Part 2 will assess the use of early drug&#xD;
      monitoring and early dose adjustment to achieve the target vancomycin level in the blood at&#xD;
      steady state. Part 1 of this protocol will be completed before part 2 begins recruitment.&#xD;
      Part 1 and part 2 are two separate studies and the results of each part will not be compared&#xD;
      to one another. However, each part will be compared to a retrospective control arm - infants&#xD;
      from the VANC randomized controlled trial (NCT02210169) who received standard intermittent&#xD;
      infusion of vancomycin dosing (as per British National Formulary for children. 15mg/kg/dose)&#xD;
      and standard therapeutic drug monitoring.&#xD;
