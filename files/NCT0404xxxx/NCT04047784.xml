  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in critically ill patients is common and often life&#xD;
      threatening. The diagnosis of acute PE is often entertained in intensive care unit patients&#xD;
      who develop unexplained hypotension or hypoxemia. Obtaining diagnostic confirmation of acute&#xD;
      PE with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest (CT angiogram) may be difficult&#xD;
      as patients are often too unstable for transport to the CT scanner or have renal&#xD;
      insufficiency limiting the ability to receive intravenous contrast agents. Making or&#xD;
      excluding the diagnosis of acute PE in these patients is critically important, as hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability or right heart dysfunction, if due to PE, puts patients in the massive or&#xD;
      submassive category and increased mortality risk. More aggressive therapies such as&#xD;
      thrombolysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or surgical embolectomy are often&#xD;
      entertained. The investigators have previously described a case where endobronchial&#xD;
      ultrasound (EBUS) was employed in the diagnostic algorithm of suspected acute PE and&#xD;
      significantly affected treatment recommendations. The investigators believe that, in these&#xD;
      patients, use of EBUS to assess for thrombotic occlusion of the central pulmonary vasculature&#xD;
      can fill a critical gap in the decision tree for management of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBUS has become part of the diagnostic approach in a number of clinical situations, including&#xD;
      the workup and staging of suspected malignancy, unexplained lymphadenopathy, and diagnosis of&#xD;
      mediastinal and parabronchial masses. There is strong evidence that EBUS is equivalent to&#xD;
      mediastinoscopy in the mediastinal staging of lung cancer. The number of physicians skilled&#xD;
      and experienced in performance of EBUS has increased dramatically, and training in the&#xD;
      procedure is frequently obtained in a pulmonary fellowship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies that investigate the use of EBUS as&#xD;
      a tool for the diagnosis of acute central pulmonary embolism in critically ill patients where&#xD;
      obtaining diagnostic confirmation of this diagnosis with a contrast-enhanced computed&#xD;
      tomography of the chest is not safe or feasible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, pilot study to evaluate critically ill patients diagnosed with acute&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism using endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The investigators anticipate to&#xD;
      enroll 20 subjects at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center, Santa&#xD;
      Monica. The enrolled subjects will be imaged using the flexible bronchoscopy with EBUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, the following procedure will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Olympus EBUS bronchoscope will be used for all endobronchial ultrasound examinations. This&#xD;
      scope has a 6.9 mm outer diameter, a 2.7 mm working channel and 30-degree oblique&#xD;
      forward-viewing optics. A 12 MHz linear ultrasound transducer with a maximum penetration of&#xD;
      50 mm will be linked to a processor (Olympus EU-ME2) that allows an integrated power Doppler&#xD;
      mode to visualize the vascular blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy will be introduced through the adaptor connected to the endotracheal tube, in&#xD;
      patients who are already under general anesthesia and on mechanical ventilation. The&#xD;
      bronchoscope will be advanced into the airways and endobronchial ultrasound of the main&#xD;
      pulmonary artery (PA) and lobar branches will be performed in a standardized fashion as&#xD;
      follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advance the bronchoscopy into the right main bronchus distally to the level of the right&#xD;
      lower lobe, between 12 and 3 o'clock position where the interlobar artery of the PA is seen.&#xD;
      Then the scope will be pulled back slowly, turning counterclockwise, following the course of&#xD;
      the PA on the medial wall of the right bronchial tree until the level of the carina, where&#xD;
      the right main PA and the PA trunk are seen. The scope is then turned to the right again,&#xD;
      towards 3 o'clock following the right upper lobe bronchus to examine the upper lobar artery.&#xD;
      The scope is then advanced into the left main bronchus, towards 9 o'clock to examine the&#xD;
      upper lobar artery, then advanced distally to the left lower lobe bronchus to examine the&#xD;
      interlobar artery. At the completion of the imaging the EBUS bronchoscope will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound images and video will be stored to the machine and visualized thrombi will be&#xD;
      marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who have had a chest CT for suspected PE, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of EBUS to visualize or exclude PE. For patients who are unable&#xD;
      to have a CT, the investigators will not be able to determine true efficacy, but will report&#xD;
      the number of positive and negative studies and follow these patients for outcome and&#xD;
      subsequent definitive diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a pilot study looking at the feasibility of EBUS for diagnosing acute pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, study personnel performing the EBUS will not be blinded to the clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      and the management of the subject. A brief report of the procedure results will be uploaded&#xD;
      in the patient's medical record. Any clinically relevant findings from the EBUS will be&#xD;
      communicated to the subject's treating team. Regardless of the findings, a note stating that&#xD;
      the EBUS technique is not yet established for evaluating acute pulmonary embolism in&#xD;
      critically ill patients will be emphasized in order to prevent any bias in the patient's&#xD;
      clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Vascular Mapping Substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 60 total subjects enrolled in the study, approximately 20 subjects under the criteria&#xD;
      below will be enrolled at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center, Santa&#xD;
      Monica undergoing clinical bronchoscopy as a part of their standard of care. The enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will be imaged using the flexible bronchoscopy with EBUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective Chart Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 60 total subjects enrolled in the study, media including images and videos that are&#xD;
      previously recorded for 20 patients who underwent a clinical bronchoscopy with EBUS as a part&#xD;
      of their standard of care will also be available to our research team without consent from&#xD;
      the patient to help supplement the data we obtain from the 20 subjects that are enrolled in&#xD;
      the pulmonary vascular mapping substudy.&#xD;
