      This phase I trial studies the side effects of nivolumab, BMS-986205, and standard radiation&#xD;
      therapy with or without temozolomide in treating patients with new diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with nivolumab, may induce changes in body?s immune system and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. BMS-986205 may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high&#xD;
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab&#xD;
      and BMS-986205 may work better compared to radiation therapy and temozolomide alone in&#xD;
      treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in combination with IDO1 inhibitor&#xD;
      BMS-986205 (BMS986205) and radiation in newly diagnosed MGMT promoter unmethylated&#xD;
      glioblastoma and MGMT promoter methylated glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Descriptive survival analyses (overall survival [OS] and OS at 12 months [OS12]) in&#xD;
      patients with MGMT unmethylated and MGMT methylated promoter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Progression free survival (PFS) and PFS at 6 months (PFS6) in patients with MGMT&#xD;
      unmethylated and MGMT methylated promoter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Radiographic response rates (RR) as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
      (RANO) and immunotherapy (i)RANO criteria in patients with MGMT unmethylated and MGMT&#xD;
      methylated promoter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the T-cell changes that occur in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with BMS-986205 and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Correlate T-cell changes and IDO1 expression with patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205. Patients are assigned&#xD;
      to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients with MGMT methylated promoter undergo radiation therapy 5 days&#xD;
      per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO)&#xD;
      once daily (QD), IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or until Q4W dosing begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-5 and on day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Within 4 weeks of radiation therapy completion, patients also receive temozolomide PO&#xD;
      QD on days 1-5 of cycles 2-6. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients with MGMT unmethylated promoter undergo radiation therapy 5 days&#xD;
      per week (Monday-Friday) for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205&#xD;
      PO QD and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for up to 6 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor BMS-986205 PO QD on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-5 and on day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Cycles repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or until Q4W dosing begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;

             months following completion of therapy. Should a female patient become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Due to the potential interaction with study drug(s),&#xD;
             contraceptions that use hormones are not considered to be highly effective for FOCBP&#xD;
             participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: A FOCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following&#xD;
                  criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Has had menses&#xD;
                       at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months (and therefore has not&#xD;
                       been naturally postmenopausal for &gt; 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males who are sexually active with FOCBP must agree to follow instructions for&#xD;
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study treatment plus 7&#xD;
             months after the last dose of the study treatment (i.e., 90 days [duration of sperm&#xD;
             turnover] plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo approximately 5 half-lives).&#xD;
             In addition, male participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during&#xD;
             this time. Male participants with partners who are FOCBP are required to use a condom&#xD;
             for study duration and until end of relevant systemic exposure defined as 7 months&#xD;
             after the end of study treatment. This criteria applies to azoospermic males as well&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of registration on&#xD;
             study and within 24 hours of beginning study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             other complications before study registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent prior to registration on study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
