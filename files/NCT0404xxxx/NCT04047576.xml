    <textblock>
      Retroperitoneal fibrosis refers to a group of diseases characterized by hyperplasia of the&#xD;
      fibrosclerotic tissues in the retroperitoneal space, which can compress the surrounding&#xD;
      ureters and inferior vena cava and cause serious complications such as aortic aneurysm, renal&#xD;
      failure, and even death. The lesion is diffuse and difficult to resect. corticosteroid is the&#xD;
      first-line medication, but the recurrence rate of the disease is high, especially after dose&#xD;
      reduction of corticosteroid. Therefore, the combined use of immunosuppressants is very&#xD;
      important in preventing disease recurrence and reducing the toxic and side effects of&#xD;
      long-term corticosteroid. Sirolimus plays dual roles in inhibiting lymphocyte activation and&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation. It is inferred from its mechanism that sirolimus is a good&#xD;
      potential treatment option for idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. Therefore, we conducted&#xD;
      this RCT on patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis to determine the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of sirolimus.&#xD;

      Retroperitoneal fibrosis refers to a group of diseases characterized by hyperplasia of the&#xD;
      fibrosclerotic tissues in the retroperitoneal space, which mostly involve the abdominal aorta&#xD;
      and iliac artery distal to the kidneys. The hyperplastic tissues can compress the surrounding&#xD;
      ureters and inferior vena cava and cause serious complications such as aortic aneurysm, renal&#xD;
      failure, and even death. There is no clear boundary between the lesion and its surrounding&#xD;
      tissues. The lesion is diffuse and difficult to resect. corticosteroid is the first-line&#xD;
      medication, but the recurrence rate of the disease is high, especially after dose reduction&#xD;
      of corticosteroid. Therefore, the combined use of immunosuppressants is very important in&#xD;
      preventing disease recurrence and reducing the toxic and side effects of long-term high- and&#xD;
      medium-dose corticosteroid. In recent years, as the immunological characteristics of&#xD;
      retroperitoneal fibrosis have gradually been recognized, some rheumatologists and&#xD;
      immunologists have attempted to use immunosuppressants commonly used for autoimmune diseases&#xD;
      in this population, including biologics. However, high-level evidences of evidence-based&#xD;
      medicine such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were still lacking. Sirolimus plays dual&#xD;
      roles in inhibiting T lymphocyte activation and fibroblast proliferation. It is inferred from&#xD;
      its mechanism that sirolimus is a good potential treatment option for idiopathic&#xD;
      retroperitoneal fibrosis. Therefore, we conducted this RCT on patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      retroperitoneal fibrosis to determine the efficacy and safety of sirolimus.&#xD;
