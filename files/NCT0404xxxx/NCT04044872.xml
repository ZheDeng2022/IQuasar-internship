  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in the study will receive standard of care adjuvant or definitive breast,&#xD;
      chest wall or thoracic radiation therapy.Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of&#xD;
      radiation-induced cardiac injury. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by ionizing&#xD;
      radiation cause oxidation of mitochondrial proteins and alter oxidative phosphorylation and&#xD;
      pyruvate metabolism(5). The goal of this study is to detect early changes in the&#xD;
      mitochondrial metabolism in situ as a marker for subclinical radiation-induced&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of cancer continues to rise with an incidence of 17.5 million cancer cases&#xD;
      worldwide. Approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy as a component&#xD;
      of their cancer care. While radiation therapy has demonstrable benefit in improving survival&#xD;
      in patients with many types of malignancies, cardiotoxicity is a major concern in patients&#xD;
      receiving chest radiotherapy. The rates of major coronary events increased by 7.4% per gray&#xD;
      of mean heart dose; the increased risk was noted within the first 5 years of radiotherapy and&#xD;
      persisted into the third decade after treatment. With improvements in multi-disciplinary care&#xD;
      of cancer patients, the long-term survival in patients with thoracic malignancies continues&#xD;
      to improve and radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is now a major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in such patients.In this study, the investigators will enroll five female patients&#xD;
      (18 years of age to 100 years of age) with left-sided breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy&#xD;
      or mastectomy without tissue expander placement and will receive adjuvant standard-of-care&#xD;
      breast or chest wall radiation therapy. They will undergo baseline magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopic imaging with [1-13C]pyruvate injection and a proton MRI/spectroscopy scan prior&#xD;
      to receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy. Post-treatment imaging will be performed within 3&#xD;
      months of completion of radiation treatments. This study will investigate whether&#xD;
      non-invasive MRI scanning approaches will detect damage to the heart from left-sided&#xD;
      radiation treatments before structural changes and mechanical functional deficits become&#xD;
      apparent. A first-in-human clinical study to evaluate the effect of cardiotoxic chemotherapy&#xD;
      on [1-13C]Pyruvate metabolism is currently ongoing at UT Southwestern (ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      Identifier: NCT03685175; PI: Dr. Vlad Zaha). The proposed study employs the same technology&#xD;
      and approach to study radiation-induced cardiac toxicity. The study will also test the&#xD;
      prognostic value of decreased myocardial mitochondrial pyruvate flux in predicting clinically&#xD;
      significant radiation induced cardiotoxicity. Towards this goal, study will measure&#xD;
      myocardial mechanical functional parameters, including left ventricular global longitudinal&#xD;
      strain and left ventricular myocardial deformation using cardiac MRI and correlate these&#xD;
      changes with [1-13C]lactate/ [13C]bicarbonate ratio. Previous studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      strain rate imaging by MRI is a sensitive technique for dose-dependent decrease in myocardial&#xD;
      function after breast radiotherapy. Although this pilot study is restricted to breast cancer&#xD;
      patients, successful demonstration of feasibility will allow extension of the study to all&#xD;
      patients receiving thoracic radiation (such as patients receiving radiation therapy for lung&#xD;
      cancer, esophageal cancer and thoracic lymphomas). The lack of reliable technologies for&#xD;
      early detection of sub-clinical radiation-induced cardiotoxicity limits early intervention in&#xD;
      such patients. Thus, identification of early cardiac changes induced by radiation therapy at&#xD;
      a stage that offers potential for reversibility remains a major unmet need in cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns for sexually active men and women: Women should not become pregnant and men should&#xD;
      not father a baby while taking part in this study because we do not know how the study&#xD;
      drugs/procedures could affect a man's sperm (for some drugs/procedures, the concern may be&#xD;
      that the sperm might be affected and in some cases, drugs could being carried by the semen&#xD;
      into the vagina and cause harm) or a fetus, if a woman becomes pregnant during the study. It&#xD;
      is important that you talk to your study doctor about avoiding pregnancy during this study.&#xD;
      If you think you might have become pregnant or if you believe your female partner has become&#xD;
      pregnant while you are in this study, you must tell one of the study doctors right away so&#xD;
      that management of the pregnancy and the possibility of stopping the study can be discussed.&#xD;
