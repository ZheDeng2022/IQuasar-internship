      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some children/adolescents who have had a stem cell transplant live with chronic&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD). cGVHD is a side effect of the transplant that can cause&#xD;
      multiple bothersome symptoms and negatively affect a child/adolescent squality of daily life.&#xD;
      The questionnaires that measure thesymptoms caused by cGVHD are designed for adults.&#xD;
      Children/adolescents may not describe their symptoms in the same way. The goal of this&#xD;
      research is to improve the way we measure how bothersome these symptoms are for&#xD;
      children/adolescents living with cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a questionnaire (The Pediatric cGHVD Symptom Scale) for children/adolescents&#xD;
      living with cGVHD to identify the symptoms they are experiencing and describe how bothersome&#xD;
      those symptoms are to them. An additional goal is to design a parent/guardian companion&#xD;
      questionnaire that can be used to capture the symptom experiences of very young children who&#xD;
      may not be able to complete a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children/adolescents ages 5-17 who are receiving treatment for cGVHD after a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant, and their parent/guardian..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 2 projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children/adolescents with cGVHD and their parent/guardianparticipants will be grouped by the&#xD;
      child/adolescent s age: 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In project 1, participants will complete an age-appropriate questionnaire about cGVHD&#xD;
      symptoms. The questionnaire will ask about the child/adolescent s physical functioning and&#xD;
      emotional well-being. The parent/guardian will out fill out a companion questionnaire online.&#xD;
      The child/adolescent will then review their completed questionnaire during an interview with&#xD;
      a researcher and will be asked whether the questions about their symptoms were difficult to&#xD;
      understand. The parent/guardian and child/adolescent will then be interviewed together to&#xD;
      further explore their responses to the questionnaires. Interviews will be done in person, by&#xD;
      phone, and online. . Based on what is learned through these interviews, the wording of the&#xD;
      questionnaire will be improved for better comprehension and ease of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In project 2, participants will complete this revised questionnairefor their age group along&#xD;
      with some other questionnaires that ask about quality of life. Both the child/adolescent and&#xD;
      parent/guardian will fill out the questionnaires online at three separate time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both projects, children/adolescents with cGVHD and their parent/guardian participants will&#xD;
      be grouped by the child/adolescent s age: 5-7, 8-12, and 13-17.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative option for many children with&#xD;
      cancer and certain genetic disorders. However, recipients of stem cell transplant must deal&#xD;
      with years of disfigurement and symptoms arising from an undesirable side effect of&#xD;
      transplant, specifically chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children living with cGVHD often face many years of a disabling and painful chronic illness&#xD;
      compounded by the side effects of prolonged immunosuppression, particularly long-term steroid&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic GVHD can involve almost every organ although it most commonly affects the skin, eyes,&#xD;
      mouth, liver, intestines, lung and the musculoskeletal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a large effort through the NIH cGVHD Consensus Consortium to standardize&#xD;
      definitions, grading and response criteria for patients with cGVHD on clinical trials.&#xD;
      Because of the absence of evidence suggesting which response criteria truly correlates with&#xD;
      improvement, the NIH Consensus Panel has recommended following not only physical signs of&#xD;
      chronic GVHD, but also symptoms of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Lee cGVHD Symptom Score has been recognized as a core cGVHD outcome measure in the adult&#xD;
      population, however, the instrument has not been validated for use in children/adolescents&#xD;
      younger than 18, and many of the symptom terms used in the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale may not be&#xD;
      well understood by younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no available pediatric patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of cGVHD&#xD;
      symptom bother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a psychometrically valid Pediatric cGVHD Symptom Scale (PCSS) and a companion&#xD;
      parent-proxy measure as counterparts to the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children of 5 to 17 years of age, who have undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical diagnosis of cGVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently receiving systemic treatment for cGVHD (including phototherapies), or has tapered&#xD;
      systemic therapy for cGVHD to discontinuation within the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      No evidence of malignant disease relapse including molecular relapse and minimal residual&#xD;
      disease. Patients with mixed chimerism are eligible to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehend and speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter non-interventional psychosocial trial will address the study aims in two&#xD;
      projects: 1) a qualitative project using cognitive interviewing to confirm the comprehension&#xD;
      and ease of response to the PCSS, and 2) a quantitative project to evaluate test-retest&#xD;
      reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of the PCSS, as well as to explore&#xD;
      concordance of symptom ratings by patients and parent proxies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Project 1, we will conduct at least 20 cognitive interviews of patient and proxy dyads&#xD;
      (parent/guardian) within each age group (5-7; 8-12; 13-17) for a sample of 60 pediatric&#xD;
      transplant survivors with cGVHD to refine the symptom items and response choices to ensure&#xD;
      that they resonate across the developmental spectrum. Cognitive interviews will evaluate the&#xD;
      clarity and comprehension of the PCSS items, the ease and accuracy of judgement of the&#xD;
      response choices, and any errors in understanding the response choices, and will refine the&#xD;
      PCSS in accordance with study data, before proceeding to Project 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Project 2, we will evaluate test-retest reliability, construct validity, and&#xD;
      responsiveness of the PCSS, in association with the NIH Global cGVHD Symptom Severity Score,&#xD;
      the Peds QL, clinician ratings of organ specific cGVHD severity scores and cGVHD severity&#xD;
      using the NIH criteria, in a sample of 120 pediatric transplant survivors with cGVHD&#xD;
      reflecting three age groups (5-7 years; 8-12 years; 13-17 years) of equal numbers. In&#xD;
      subjects ages 13-17, we will also compare responses on the PCSS with those from the Lee&#xD;
      Scale, to determine the youngest age at which adolescent respondents can comprehend the Lee&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include CCR investigators as well as extramural investigators at national&#xD;
      study sites.&#xD;
