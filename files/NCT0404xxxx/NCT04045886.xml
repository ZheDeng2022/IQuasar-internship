  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the importance of preoperative code status and goals of care discussion (CSD/GOCD), a&#xD;
      formal curriculum for anesthesiology residents is lacking. Residents are often uncomfortable&#xD;
      conducting these conversations and there is a lack of research investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of formal, evidence-based teaching during anesthesia training. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop a novel skills training program with the aims to assess its&#xD;
      immediate effect on CSD/GOCD skills, long-term internalization of the CSD training, and the&#xD;
      authenticity, feasibility and acceptability of the CSD program and observed standardized&#xD;
      patient encounter (OSCE) interaction. In this prospective, randomized study, CA-1 residents&#xD;
      will be assigned to the study or control group. Both groups will undergo pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention OSCEs. The control group will complete the online modules only, while the&#xD;
      study group will complete the entire skills training program consisting of online modules,&#xD;
      self-assessments, and small group exercises. To measure CSD/GOCD proficiency, all&#xD;
      participants will interview trained patient actors in pre-and post intervention OSCE.&#xD;
      Investigators will use existing scoring systems and surveys. Standard patient encounters will&#xD;
      be video recorded and reviewed by two blinded clinician graders. The pre- and&#xD;
      post-participation survey will assess comfort and experience with CSD/GOCD. The follow up&#xD;
      surveys will assess long-term retention of training, comfort and interim experiences.&#xD;
      Investigators will perform a validation of the existing CSD/GOCD assessment tools for use in&#xD;
      the perioperative setting. If there is a clinically significant demonstrable benefit,&#xD;
      investigators expect that the results will lead to a formalization of this innovative&#xD;
      curriculum on a national scale.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite the importance of code status discussions (CSD) and goals of care discussions (GOCD)&#xD;
      before surgery, formal training for anesthesiology residents surrounding these patient&#xD;
      interactions is lacking. Investigators propose to develop a novel CSD/GOCD skills training&#xD;
      and testing program for anesthesiology residents. Resident participants will receive one of&#xD;
      two educational interventions: a) online learning modules (Group A, Control group) or b)&#xD;
      online learning modules followed by facilitated small group discussion and active learning&#xD;
      exercises (Group B, Study group). All residents will undergo competency assessment of CSD and&#xD;
      GOCD via an Objective Standardized Clinical Examination (OSCE). Accordingly, this study will&#xD;
      test the central hypothesis that participants in the group with facilitated discussions and&#xD;
      active learning will score more highly during the OSCE competency assessments immediately&#xD;
      after training and at 3 and 6 months. Testing of this hypothesis will be accomplished through&#xD;
      the following three Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creation of a standardized CSD/GOCD Training Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Online modules: This component of the training program will consist of online&#xD;
                materials that can be consumed by residents at their convenience over the 3 week&#xD;
                training period. Both Groups A and B will be given access to this material.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Self-Assessment and Small group exercises: This component of the training program&#xD;
                will consist of facilitated discussions, role playing, and guided reflective&#xD;
                writing in order to advance upon the material received in the online training. Only&#xD;
                Group B will receive this training prior to OSCE competency assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development and validation of a CSD/GOCD OSCE: Published best-practice principles for&#xD;
           the development of OSCE competency assessments will be used to create separate&#xD;
           experiences for CSD and GOCD. While keeping the core components of examinations the&#xD;
           same, several clinical stems will be created for each OSCE to prevent recall bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validation of the existing CSD/GOCD assessment tools for the perioperative setting: A&#xD;
           previously described modified Delphi technique will be used to further develop the&#xD;
           itemized and global assessment tools. Then, an Anghoff standard setting method will be&#xD;
           used to determine the minimum passing score (MPS) for the OSCE competency assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN and METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform a prospective randomized controlled trial as detailed below. The&#xD;
      overall hypothesis of this study is that anesthesiology residents who receive facilitated&#xD;
      discussions and active learning will score more highly during the OSCE competency assessments&#xD;
      immediately after training and at 3 and 6 months. This will be tested through the following&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creation of a standardized CSD/GOCD Training Program: Investigators will develop a novel&#xD;
           curriculum consisting of online modules covering the skills needed to Prepare for the&#xD;
           Discussion, address Values and Goals of Care, explain Informed Consent for Code Status&#xD;
           Discussions, and Summarize the Discussion for the patient. It will consist of&#xD;
           evidence-based, best practices content covering professional (i.e. ASA) guidelines,&#xD;
           current literature, and effective communication strategies. The Program will be&#xD;
           completed over 1 week. Group A will receive the Online Modules components and Group B&#xD;
           will receive two papers on CSD/GOCD topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Online Modules: This component of the training program will consist of online materials&#xD;
           that can be consumed by residents at their convenience over the 3 week training period.&#xD;
           A series of short videos with lectures by various experts in the field which will&#xD;
           include a detailed review of key scientific and educational research literature as well&#xD;
           as a practical 'how-to' guide for CSD and GOCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development and validation of a CSD OSCE and GOCD OSCE: Published best-practice&#xD;
           principles for the development of OSCE competency assessments will be used to create&#xD;
           separate experiences for CSD and GOCD. While keeping the core components of examinations&#xD;
           the same, several clinical stems will be created for each OSCE to prevent recall bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigators will develop and validate a standardized OSCE curriculum with an input&#xD;
           from a multidisciplinary team, including representatives from surgery, anesthesiology,&#xD;
           palliative medicine, nursing, and chaplaincy. CSD/GOCD skills will be assessed using a&#xD;
           validated Code Status Discussion Checklist. The training program will be based on&#xD;
           previous work developing similar programs and simulation scenarios for the Operating&#xD;
           Room Emergency Checklists. This program resulted in an increase from 75% of key items&#xD;
           completed to 94%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Case Development: Two case scenarios will be utilized, building on experience from our&#xD;
           preliminary data. These were described in Preliminary Studies: both will be oncology&#xD;
           patients with an active DNR/DNI order: One with cholecystitis presenting for a&#xD;
           cholecystectomy, and the other with an impending pathological femur fracture presenting&#xD;
           for an ORIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Validation and further development of existing CSD and GOCD assessment tools: A&#xD;
           previously described modified Delphi technique will be used to create the itemized and&#xD;
           global assessment tools. Then, an Anghoff Standard Setting method will be used to&#xD;
           determine the minimum passing score (MPS) for the OSCE competency assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Checklist Creation: i. Step 1: Engage a group of educational and content experts from&#xD;
           at least 3 institutions to create the checklist items through a modified Delphi&#xD;
           technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Step 2: Convene a face-to-face meeting of experts to perform an Angoff standard&#xD;
           setting process to determine a minimum passing score (MPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Step 3: All OSCE performances will be videotaped and a group of raters will be&#xD;
           engaged to grade all of the resident performances. Their ratings will be assessed for&#xD;
           interrater and intra-rater reliability, which is one component of validity assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Training for Standardized Patients and Graders: Both the standardized patient and the&#xD;
           graders will undergo training to familiarize them with the grading tools and the study&#xD;
           scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment: Using validated tools, investigators will assess the impact of the study by&#xD;
           analyzing the initial baseline survey, graded performance on Pre- and Post-Intervention&#xD;
           OSCE, and the 3 and 6 month follow-up survey. Specific outcomes analyzed will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The immediate effect of the training program intervention on improving CSD/GOCD&#xD;
                skills&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Long-term effect and internalization of the CSD/GOCD training&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The authenticity of the OSCE interaction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The feasibility and acceptability of the training program and OSCE&#xD;
