  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will utilize the electronic health record to individualize pain therapy in&#xD;
      surgical patients after hospital discharge using last 24-hour opioid intake as the decision&#xD;
      variable for the amount of opioid pain pills prescribed. The preliminary data indicate that&#xD;
      current opioid prescription practice after surgery follows a &quot;one size fits all&quot; pattern.&#xD;
      In-hospital opioid use 24 hours prior to discharge serves as a strong indicator to correctly&#xD;
      estimate needs for analgesic medications at home. The investigators will test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that this prescription estimation tool will enable providers to write need-based&#xD;
      prescriptions based on each patient's' 24-hour prior-to-discharge opioid use. The&#xD;
      investigators will test this tool prospectively for patients after Cesarean section who are&#xD;
      anticipated to use about half or less of the usually prescribed amount of opioid pain pills&#xD;
      after discharge randomized equally to prescription tool intervention or no intervention&#xD;
      (prescription as usual).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid overdose has emerged as a leading cause of death in the general&#xD;
      population. Opioid-based therapy represents a corner-stone of post-operative pain management.&#xD;
      With increasing emphasis on robust pain therapy, sales of opioid medications have increased&#xD;
      four-fold in the last decade. Parallel to this rise, opioid-associated deaths have also&#xD;
      quadrupled. The investigators have shown that long-term opioid use occurs in up to 22% of&#xD;
      patients following surgery. Over-prescribed opioids after surgery can create a reservoir of&#xD;
      opioids that become available for non-medical use. Effective strategies to maximize&#xD;
      non-opioid pain therapy and to limit such a reservoir are lacking. Thus, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need to individualize post-operative pain therapy and reduce reliance on opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Converting knowledge on actual need for opioid pain medications after surgery into tangible&#xD;
      benefits can prevent over-prescription of opioids that become available for non-medical use.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to prescribe pain medications after surgery in a&#xD;
      patient-centered fashion. The investigators will use the average amount of opioid medications&#xD;
      (in oral morphine equivalents - OME) taken in the last 24 hours prior to discharge to inform&#xD;
      and design a clinical decision support tool. This tool will reduce the amount of opioid&#xD;
      medications prescribed while maintaining patient post-operative pain control. The calculated&#xD;
      &quot;last 24 hour OME dose&quot; will be applied to generate a recommendation for the prescription of&#xD;
      a cumulative opioid dose that will be shared with the provider when the post-discharge pain&#xD;
      medication is made, e.g. via displaying the last 24-hour opioid use in the electronic health&#xD;
      record (EHR). The rationale is that testing of such a decision-making tool will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork to translate the findings of this project into more secure and efficient opioid&#xD;
      prescribing practices to a system-wide level. Upon completion, the investigators expect to&#xD;
      have developed an effective decision-making tool to help providers estimate required pain&#xD;
      medication following patient discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of an Electronic Health&#xD;
      Record (EHR)-based recommendation to prescribe opioids at discharge according to the recorded&#xD;
      last 24-hour inpatient use according to current recommendations and evaluate its effect on&#xD;
      the amount of opioids prescribed as well as pain control after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the University of Colorado Hospital Epic/Clarity database, the investigators will&#xD;
      continuously identify all patients who underwent Cesarean section surgery at University&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients will be approached regarding interest in the study prior to hospital&#xD;
      discharge.A trained Professional Research Assistant or other provider will explain the study&#xD;
      and obtain informed consent from prospective participants. After consent, demographics and&#xD;
      the best contact information will be collected from those enrolled patients who indicate they&#xD;
      are interested in completing the surveys after their hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect 44 patients to complete all four weekly surveys and define the&#xD;
      intent-to-treat sample as patients who complete one or more surveys (providing at least one&#xD;
      observation to be used in analyses). To conservatively allow for increased variability due to&#xD;
      attrition, 54 patients will be randomized equally electronically to intervention&#xD;
      (prescription tool) or no intervention (prescription as usual). The investigators will use an&#xD;
      electronic randomization scheme created so that the principal investigator and statistician&#xD;
      can remain blind to assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group (Arm 2), at the time of writing the prescription for a patient, the&#xD;
      provider will be informed that a patient may be considered for a lower post-discharge opioid&#xD;
      dose (No opioids for patients who did not take any opioids in the last 24 hours, and 10&#xD;
      oxycodone 5mg tablets, for patients having taken equal or less than 22.5 MME (morphine&#xD;
      milligram equivalent), e.g. 1-3 oxycodone 5mg tablets in the last 24 hours.) In the control&#xD;
      group (Arm 1), providers will receive a message to consider prescribing the usual medications&#xD;
      for pain management after discharge. Final dosing decisions and drug choices will remain at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating provider and decisions will be tracked. For this pilot study,&#xD;
      the provider information (best practice alert - BPA) will be operationalized via a written&#xD;
      recommendation on paper handed to the provider by study staff in a sealed envelope that the&#xD;
      provider will be asked to open and read. Alternatively the BPA may be presented&#xD;
      electronically using a screen. Providers will be asked to acknowledge that they read the BPA&#xD;
      by closing the window or opening the envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after hospital discharge interested patients will be contacted and asked to complete&#xD;
      the first of four surveys. All communication will be available in English. Patients will be&#xD;
      paid with a $10 gift card or money order equivalent to complete the study assessments using&#xD;
      REDCap at each of the four weekly follow-up time points ($40 total). All enrolled patients&#xD;
      will complete the weekly post-discharge surveys within REDCap or hard copy if they do not&#xD;
      have internet access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will contact all subjects ~2 weeks after discharge to ask about pain&#xD;
      management and monitor the need for secondary prescriptions from providers to ensure that no&#xD;
      significant under-prescription of opioid medications after surgery occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will seek follow-up with providers about the usefulness and acceptability&#xD;
      of the EHR-based intervention. Providers will be surveyed with a REDCap survey using a&#xD;
      modified version of the GUIDES checklist, which provides a tool to improve the successful use&#xD;
      of guideline-based computerized clinical decision support.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women ages at least 18 years of age having undergone Cesarean section surgery at the&#xD;
             University of Colorado Hospital are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to complete weekly surveys for 4 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated to need half or less of the usually prescribed amount of opioids based on&#xD;
             the amount of opioids taken in the last 24 hours prior to the opioid medication being&#xD;
             written for discharge (only patients who took 22.5 MME or less opioids in the last 24&#xD;
             hours prior to the day of discharge will be eligible for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients under the age of 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients returning to institutional settings (e.g. prison, jail, mental health&#xD;
             facility).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women (patients will be approached after their C-section).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decisionally challenged patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blind or illiterate patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on prior research factors such as emergency status, prior opioid use, repeat vs&#xD;
        primary C-section, and associated procedures were not associated with post-discharge opioid&#xD;
        use once the investigators adjusted for last-24 hour inpatient opioid use. Hence, these&#xD;
        patients will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria (including the amount of opioids taken in the last 24&#xD;
        hours prior to discharge) will be evaluated in the morning in patients scheduled to be&#xD;
        discharged later that day.&#xD;

        <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference Score as reported on the Week 1 study survey. The Scale consists of 8 questions; each question in the Scale has five response options ranging in value from one to five, e.g., Not at all (1), A little bit (2), Somewhat (3), Quite a bit (4), Very much (5). To find the total raw score sum the values of the response to each question. The lowest possible raw score is 8; the highest possible raw score is 40, with a lower score indicating a better outcome/less pain interference. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.</description>

The lowest possible raw score is 3; the highest possible raw score is 15, with a lower score indicating a better outcome/less pain intensity. Raw scores are then translated into a T-score for each participant. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.</description>
