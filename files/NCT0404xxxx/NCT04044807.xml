  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will be assessing whether it is practical and feasible&#xD;
      to use a stroke screening tool (the modified NHISS, mNIHSS) in an adult surgical population.&#xD;
      Perioperative stroke is an uncommon but devastating complication of surgery and previous&#xD;
      research suggests that stroke symptoms may be missed in this population. This stroke&#xD;
      screening tool has been used extensively in non-surgical patients but has not be used in&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgical patients. Surgical patients have additional factors that may affect&#xD;
      their ability to complete this assessment such as pain medications and sedatives, pain, and&#xD;
      use of epidurals and nerve blocks. This study will involve a total of five testing sessions.&#xD;
      The first will occur at the time of consent to screen for cognitive impairment via the&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), as part of our exclusion criteria. Then over the course&#xD;
      of four subsequent visits, participants will be assessed on the mNIHSS to track for any&#xD;
      changes before and after their procedure, as well as evaluate the real-life usability of the&#xD;
      mNIHSS as a potential tool to screen for stroke in the surgical population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose &amp; Justification: Perioperative stroke is a potentially devastating complication that&#xD;
      is currently poorly characterized with limited clinical tools available to detect and prevent&#xD;
      its occurrence. To date only two stroke assessment scales have been applied to the&#xD;
      perioperative setting, though none have been tested in non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgeries.&#xD;
      One of those assessments, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), is lengthy&#xD;
      and may be impractical in the surgical setting. This is further complicated by several&#xD;
      factors potentially existing in surgical patients that may alter the assessment, such as pain&#xD;
      and drowsiness from medications. However, there is a modified simpler version of the NIHSS&#xD;
      (mNIHSS) that has been shown to have improved reliability than the full version and reduced&#xD;
      time requirement, thus making it preferable for perioperative stroke screening. To overcome&#xD;
      the current gaps in knowledge and screening for risk of perioperative stroke, this&#xD;
      prospective observational study will be assessing the feasibility of applying the mNIHSS in&#xD;
      the surgical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the change in mNIHSS score from baseline to immediately after&#xD;
      surgery in the absence of diagnosed stroke in patients after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the components of the mNIHSS most likely to change following surgery;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the feasibility of administering the mNIHSS in surgical patients (e.g.&#xD;
           acceptability, resources, length of time to complete, completeness).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the relationship between baseline MoCA score and ability to complete the&#xD;
           mNIHSS screening after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: This is a prospective observational study involving five testing sessions. A&#xD;
      cognitive assessment (MoCA) will be conducted at the time of consent to screen for any&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. There will be 4 additional visits during which the mNIHSS will be&#xD;
      administered to surgical patients pre and post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation There is no specific data available on the application of the mNIHSS&#xD;
      in our study population. We estimate that we will require a sample size of 21 patients,&#xD;
      assuming a mean difference of 2 (standard deviation 3) points between pre- and&#xD;
      post-operatively, an alpha error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Anticipating a 20% drop out rate,&#xD;
      we will recruit 25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis We will describe the patient population using mean (SD), median (IQR)&#xD;
      and percentage as appropriate. The application of the mNIHSS will be described using percent&#xD;
      completed for each question, and the time taken to complete the test at each time point&#xD;
      (mean, SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The change in mNIHSS on postoperative days 0, 1 and 2 will be compared to baseline using a&#xD;
      Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for matched pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be two-sided with a p-value less than 0.05 considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. All statistical analysis will be done using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;

    <description>The modified National Institutes for Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) is a modified version of the NIHSS used widely in the clinical assessment of stroke patients. The The mNIHSS contains 11 items with a possible range of scores from 0 (best) to 31 (worse). Each of the 11 items provides in a subscore ranging from 0 (normal) to 2-4 points, and the total score is a sum of all subscores.</description>

        Patients will be recruited from the Vancouver General Hospital Anesthesia Consult Clinic&#xD;

        non-cardiac non-neurologic surgery under general anesthesia at Vancouver General Hospital&#xD;
        with a minimum two-night stay in hospital.&#xD;

&#xD;
        We will include older adult patients (65 years or older) presenting for non-cardiac&#xD;
        non-neurologic surgery under general anesthesia at Vancouver General Hospital with a&#xD;
        minimum two-night stay in hospital.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will exclude patients undergoing procedures involving the major vasculature of the head&#xD;
        and neck, as well as patients who are predicted to require postoperative ventilation or&#xD;
        planned tracheostomy. Patients who are not able to read or speak English will be excluded,&#xD;
        as well as patients with significant hearing or visual impairment that would make&#xD;
        assessment unreliable. In order to complete the mNIHSS accurately, we will exclude patients&#xD;
        with significant cognitive impairment suggestive of dementia (MoCA score 17 or less) or a&#xD;
        diagnosis of dementia.&#xD;
