  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase II study that will enroll a total of 45 subjects. All subjects&#xD;
      will have a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma or bone&#xD;
      sarcoma. All subjects must have intact Rb, identified at the time of screening, by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry testing of submitted tumor specimen. Subjects will receive Abemaciclib&#xD;
      200 mg twice daily until progression or discontinuation criteria are met.&#xD;

      Population to be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since abemaciclib is already being studied in dedifferentiated liposarcoma patients, patients&#xD;
      with this sarcoma subtype will not be enrolled in the current study. This exploratory study&#xD;
      will enroll patients with all other types of soft tissue sarcoma, in addition to patients&#xD;
      with several bone sarcomas. We are testing the hypothesis that biomarkers of Cyclin D1 -&#xD;
      CDK4/6 - Rb pathway activation will identify patients with a rare, heterogeneous cancer who&#xD;
      are most likely to benefit from cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibition with&#xD;
      abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three cohorts of patients, intended to ensure representation of subjects with&#xD;
      rare bone sarcomas - chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma - that have relatively frequent&#xD;
      occurrence of abnormalities in the Cyclin D1 - CDK4/6 - Rb pathway, in addition to soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 - Conventional chondrosarcoma, 9-12 patients; Cohort 2 - Osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, 9-12 patients; Cohort 3 - Soft tissue sarcoma (except WD/DD&#xD;
      Liposarcoma), 22-26 patients&#xD;
