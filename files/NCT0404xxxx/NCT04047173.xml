  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)after resection is as high as&#xD;
      65.0%-83.7%.The recurrence of HCC is the most important factor affecting prognosis.&#xD;
      Reasonable and effective treatment of recurrent lesion can significantly improve the&#xD;
      long-term treatment efficacy of HCC. The recurrent lesion is usually detected when it's small&#xD;
      and is the best indication for local treatment. Local ablation therapy represented by&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the main treatments for recurrent small HCC. Our&#xD;
      previous study showed that for recurrent small HCC(≤5cm), RFA has the efficacy equivalent to&#xD;
      re-excision, with the advantages of small trauma, quick recovery, low cost, and high quality&#xD;
      of life. With the advancement of radiotherapy equipment and the development of precise&#xD;
      radiotherapy technology, stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) has become one of the routine&#xD;
      treatments for HCC, especially for small HCC. Retrospective controlled studies have shown&#xD;
      that SBRT is similar to RFA in treating small HCC, and the local control rate may be better&#xD;
      than RFA. This project is to conduct a prospective, open, randomized, controlled clinical&#xD;
      study of RFA versus SBRT for the treatment of recurrent small hepatocellular carcinoma (1-2&#xD;
      lesions, Sum of diameter≤ 5.0 cm). The primary end point is the 2-year local progression-free&#xD;
      survival. As for secondary end points, we aim to compare 1-, 2-, 3- progression-free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival rate, local control rate, and rate of complications. Stratified&#xD;
      analysis will also be performed according to Sum of tumor diameter (≤2.0 cm; 2.1-5.0 cm). The&#xD;
      results of these study will help to further improve the long-term treatment efficacy of HCC&#xD;
      and establish a rational and effective treatment model for HCC.&#xD;

      Recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)after resection is as high as&#xD;
      65.0%-83.7%.The recurrence of HCC is the most important factor affecting prognosis.&#xD;
      Reasonable and effective treatment of recurrent lesion can significantly improve the&#xD;
      long-term treatment efficacy of HCC. Resection is the preferred treatment for recurrent HCC.&#xD;
      Although liver surgery has been progressing in recent years, the alteration of anatomical&#xD;
      structure after the first operation, the reduction of liver volume, and the mostly&#xD;
      multi-centered origin recurrent lesions, lead to low surgical resection rate, difficult&#xD;
      operation, high risk, multiple complications, and high recurrence rate of resection surgery.&#xD;
      Salvage liver transplantation is difficult to apply widely due to donor shortages and other&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local ablation, represented by radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is the third major treatment&#xD;
      for liver cancer after surgical resection and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE). Many studies， by us and domestic and foreign scholars， have shown that the long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of RFA in the treatment of small HCC is close to that of surgical resection, with a&#xD;
      5-year survival rate of 50%-60%. Therefore，RFA has been recommended as a frontline treatment&#xD;
      for small HCC by many international guidelines. The recurrent lesion is usually detected when&#xD;
      it's small and is the best indication for RFA. Our previous study showed that for recurrent&#xD;
      small HCC(≤5cm), RFA has the efficacy equivalent to re-excision, with the advantages of small&#xD;
      trauma, quick recovery, low cost, and high quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of radiotherapy equipment and the precision imaging technology,&#xD;
      especially the emergence of stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), the status of radiotherapy in&#xD;
      the treatment of HCC is increasing. SBRT is defined as the use of external irradiation&#xD;
      technology, which is divided into several fractions, and the high dose of radiotherapy is&#xD;
      accurately delivered into the tumor. As a result, tumor is subjected to high dose and the&#xD;
      normal tissue around the tumor is exposed to relatively low dose. Compared with conventional&#xD;
      fractionated radiotherapy (CRT), SBRT possessed fewer segmentation times (1 to 6 F), higher&#xD;
      fractional doses (5 to 20 Gy), and steeper gradients at the edge of the target region, so it&#xD;
      has stronger biological effect. Meanwhile, SBRT can also protect the normal organs better,&#xD;
      especially for the radiotherapy of smaller tumors. Multiple clinical studies and&#xD;
      meta-analyses have shown that SBRT is superior to traditional CRT in the treatment of HCC,&#xD;
      and the side effects are lower in the acute phase. SBRT has become a mainstream technology&#xD;
      for HCC, and has been recommended as a routine local treatment for HCC by National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and NCI radiotherapy guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both RFA and SBRT have been recommended by the NCCN guidelines as a routine local treatment&#xD;
      for liver cancer. They are also widely used in the treatment of liver cancer, and their&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy and safety have been widely approved. However, which treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent small HCC is superior is still unknown.This project is to conduct a prospective,&#xD;
      open, randomized, controlled clinical study of RFA versus SBRT for the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      small HCC(1-2 lesions, Sum of diameter≤ 5.0 cm). The primary end point is the 2-year local&#xD;
      progression-free survival. Secondary end points include 1-, 2-, 3- progression-free survival,&#xD;
      overall survival rate, local control rate, and rate of complications.. Stratified analysis&#xD;
      will also be performed according to Sum of tumor diameter (≤2.0 cm; 2.1-5.0 cm). The results&#xD;
      of these study will help to further improve the long-term treatment efficacy of HCC and&#xD;
      establish a rational and effective treatment model for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this clinical trail received either SBRT or RFA depending on the&#xD;
      randomization allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for SBRT group, the treatment follows the protocol below.Immobilization: Patients are&#xD;
      immobilized with vacuum bags or styrofoam in the supine position, with the arms raised above&#xD;
      the head. 4 dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) scanning: Simple breathing training is&#xD;
      conducted before simulation, so that the patient can keep breathing quietly and evenly. A&#xD;
      plastic box with reflective marker is placed on the patient's anterior abdominal surface&#xD;
      where the respiratory amplitude is relatively large, approximately midway between the xiphoid&#xD;
      and the umbilicus. The movement of the marker is recorded by an infrared camera, which is&#xD;
      converted into breathing curve by computer software. After the breathing curve becomes&#xD;
      stable, the CT data of different respiratory phases is collected by 4DCT in axial cine mode.&#xD;
      CT scanning region: From 3-4 cm above the diaphragm to the 4th lumbar vertebra. The&#xD;
      intravenous contrast is administered during CT scanning and the slice thickness is 3.0 mm.&#xD;
      After 4DCT scanning, images are sorted into 10 phases by the software. Each respiratory cycle&#xD;
      is divided into 10 respiratory phases. Delineation of the target volumes and organs at risk:&#xD;
      Gross tumor volume (GTV) and organs at risk (OARs) are contoured on the 20% CT image&#xD;
      (mid-exhalation). Then the GTV is registered to the other respiratory phases of 4DCT scan by&#xD;
      a physicist using Atlas-based Auto-segmentation (ABAS, Electa CMS), and the target volumes&#xD;
      are modified and confirmed by a radiation oncologist using the standard window/level&#xD;
      settings. GTV is defined as the intrahepatic lesion on images. Internal target volume (ITV)&#xD;
      is defined as the combined volume of GTVs on 10 respiratory phases. Planning target volume&#xD;
      (PTV) is generated by adding a 6-mm margin to the ITV. OARs include liver, kidney, stomach,&#xD;
      small intestine, and spinal cord. Normal liver volume is defined as the entire liver minus&#xD;
      GTV. Treatment planning: The plan of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is designed on&#xD;
      the 20% CT image using an optimization algorithm based on a combination of radiobiological&#xD;
      and physical cost functions. Monte Carlo algorithm (MC) is performed in the optimization&#xD;
      process and a single arc is conducted. Dosimetric evaluation: For PTV, 95% ≥95%, max &lt; 110%,&#xD;
      min &gt;90%. For OARs, dose mean dose to normal liver (MDTNL) &lt; 13 Gy, 15 Gy of liver &lt; 35%;&#xD;
      dose mean of kidneys &lt;6 Gy, D0.5cc of esophagus &lt; 21 Gy; D0.5cc of stomach &lt; 21 Gy; D0.5cc of&#xD;
      small intestine &lt; 21 Gy; D0.5cc of colon &lt; 24 Gy; D0.5cc of heart &lt; 30 Gy; D0.5cc of ribs &lt;&#xD;
      39 Gy; Dose max of spinal cord &lt; 18 Gy. The planning is evaluated according to the dose&#xD;
      volume histogram (DVH) and the dose distribution of each layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for RFA group, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) was carried out for all patients&#xD;
      before treatment.RFA is carried out under intravenous anesthesia/epidural anesthesia/general&#xD;
      anesthesia, with CT or B-ultrasound guidance, through percutaneous or laparoscopic means as&#xD;
      far as possible. The ablation range requires complete coverage of the tumor, and has a&#xD;
      certain &quot;safe margin&quot;. CT/MRI/sonography will be performed 1 month after RFA. If residual&#xD;
      tumor was found after treatment, RFA will be carried out again. If there are still residual&#xD;
      tumor after two or more RFA treatments, the RFA treatment will be determined to be a failure&#xD;
      and stopped. After the local progression of the tumor, surgical treatment or other treatment&#xD;
      methods are considered according to the specific condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to complete enrollment in 2 years and to follow up for 2 years. The&#xD;
      primary analysis is performed in the intention-to-treat population. Kaplan-Meier curves will&#xD;
      be used to describe the patient's local recurrence-free survival, and the corresponding&#xD;
      statistical dates are calculated, such as median local progression-free survival (LPFS) and&#xD;
      bilateral 95% confidential interval(CI). The secondary analysis used hypothesis test and&#xD;
      two-sided 95% CIs to compare the time of first local recurrence. Kaplan-Meier curves will&#xD;
      also be used to describe the patient's disease progression, and calculated the corresponding&#xD;
      statistical data, such as the median overall survival(OS) and bilateral 95% CIs. Safety&#xD;
      assessments will be also performed by comparing adverse events in the two groups of patients.&#xD;

    <description>The planned target volume (PTV) was constructed by adding a 5-mm geometric uncertainty margin around the clinical target volume (CTV). The dose-volume constraints used during SBRT planning are fairly standardized: care was taken to ensure that at least 700 cm3 of normal liver parenchyma was exposed to &lt;15 Gy over the course of SBRT, consistent with published recommendation. Radiotherapy dose was prescribed to the isodose surface covering 99.5% of the PTV, typically 75% to 85% of the maximum PTV dose, accepting regional underdosing when necessary to satisfy normal tissue limits.</description>
