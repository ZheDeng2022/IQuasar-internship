  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigatior believe that implementing camera capsule endoscopy as a filter test to&#xD;
      colonoscopy will increase screening participation, increase the number of individuals with&#xD;
      detected intermediate- high risk adenomas or cancer, reduce the colonoscopy demand and reduce&#xD;
      the number of complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Danish national colorectal cancer screening program includes all citizens aged 50-74&#xD;
      years, who are invited biennially to a fecal test for invisible blood in the stool. If the&#xD;
      test is positive the citizen is invited for a colonoscopy. 90% of the test-positive undergo&#xD;
      colonoscopy. The detected cancers are at a significant earlier stage and survival from&#xD;
      screening detected cancer is higher. It is also expected that cancer incidence will drop due&#xD;
      to removal of the advanced adenomas before they develop into cancer. Although initial results&#xD;
      are positive, there is room for improvement. Additionally there are rare but serious&#xD;
      complications to colonoscopy in the form of bleeding or bowel perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through four years the investigators have tested the colon capsule endoscopy method, and find&#xD;
      that the investigation is associated with significantly less discomfort and that the&#xD;
      diagnostic ability to find polyps &gt; 1 cm is better than colonoscopy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will include 124.214 consecutive citizens from the Region of Southern Denmark when they are invited for screening. The participants will be randomized into two groups using an automated randomization tool provided by Odense Patient data Explorative Network (OPEN). The randomization will be based on Zelen's pre-randomization principle and will take place prior to citizens receiving the invitation. The individuals are randomized into 62.107 people allocated in the intervention group and 62.107 allocated in the control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>If the FIT test is returned and positive the individual can choose either Camera Capsule Endoscopy (CCE) or Optical colonoscopy (OC) as the primary bowel investigation. If OC is chosen, it is performed as standard and the participant outcomes remains analyzed in the intervention group as intention to treat.&#xD;
If CCE is chosen an out-clinic CCE will be done at one of four regional sites. Overall and segmental bowel preparation grade (Leighton-Rex 1-4) and all pathological findings are reported. If the anal verge is identified without video blackout in the colon the transit is considered complete. Any incomplete CCE investigation will be followed by standard optical endoscopy to the extent needed to investigate the proportion of the colon not visualized by the capsule and remove any detected polyps. If the CCE is complete with complete transit and adequate preparation, individuals with more than two polyps or one polyp over 9 mm will be referred for colonoscopy.</description>
