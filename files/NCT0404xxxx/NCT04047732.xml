  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an intra-patient comparison of KB105 and placebo-administered Target Areas. The&#xD;
      primary objectives of this study are to evaluate safety and Investigator Global Assessment&#xD;
      (IGA) scale improvement of topically administered KB105.&#xD;

      Up to six adult subjects are planned for the Phase I portion of this study. Subjects are&#xD;
      enrolled upon obtaining consent and meeting entry criteria. This study is an intra-patient&#xD;
      comparison of KB105 and placebo-administered Target Areas. Patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety, and Target Areas will be assessed individually with the IGA and VIIS scales. Target&#xD;
      Areas will be imaged and evaluated for safety and efficacy. Subjects will be on-trial for&#xD;
      approximately 3.5 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genetic diagnosis of TGM1-deficient ARCI with a null TGM-1 mutation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of lamellar ichthyosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 18 years old or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individual site IGA score of 3 to 4 at the target areas&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is, in the opinion of the Investigator, able to understand thestudy, cooperate&#xD;
             with the study procedures, and is willing to return to the clinic for all required&#xD;
             follow-up visits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Except for their moderate-to-severe ARCI, subject is in good general health; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give consent/assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical instability limiting ability to travel to the investigative center;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical illness expected to complicate participation, such as an active infection&#xD;
             with: HIV, hepatitis B (as determined by hepatitis B surface antigen screening),&#xD;
             hepatitis C (as determined by detection of hepatitis C antibodies or a positive result&#xD;
             of hepatitis C);&#xD;
&#xD;
