  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dietary supplement being investigated is a formula containing a combination of eight&#xD;
      probiotic strains. The combination formula was developed to support general gastrointestinal&#xD;
      and immune health. Each of the strains in the formula have previously been studied in human&#xD;
      subjects, including several clinical populations. However, the present eight strain&#xD;
      combination formula has not previously been evaluated in human subjects. This prospective&#xD;
      study will evaluate the tolerability of the eight strain formula in healthy adults.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary supplement being investigated is a formula containing a combination of eight&#xD;
      probiotic strains. The combination formula was developed to support general gastrointestinal&#xD;
      and immune health. Each of the strains in the formula have previously been studied in human&#xD;
      subjects, including several clinical populations. However, the present eight strain&#xD;
      combination formula has not previously been evaluated in human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will evaluate the tolerability of the eight strain formula in healthy&#xD;
      adults over a 10-day period. The primary aim of the study is to assess tolerability as&#xD;
      determined by the frequency of study participants who withdraw from the study due to adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
