  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well abemaciclib and letrozole work in treating patients&#xD;
      with endometrial cancer and determines whether there are changes in patients' cancer cell&#xD;
      biomarkers (a genetic feature or specific protein) for cell growth before and after&#xD;
      treatment. Antihormone therapy with aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, may lessen the&#xD;
      amount of estrogen made by the body. Abemaciclib blocks the activities of a class of proteins&#xD;
      called cyclin-dependent kinase, which are involved in cell duplication. Giving letrozole and&#xD;
      abemaciclib together may slow down cancer cell growth in patients with endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether there are changes in Ki-67 expression from the pretreatment specimen&#xD;
      (e.g. biopsy or dilation and curettage [D&amp;C]) to the post-treatment hysterectomy specimen&#xD;
      following treatment with letrozole and abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the proportion of tumors with complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA) response as&#xD;
      measured by Ki-67 expression between the pre-treatment tumor and the posttreatment tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify biological characteristics of tumors (e.g. mismatch repair [MMR] status, PTEN&#xD;
      mutational status, etc.) correlating with decreased Ki-67 expression induced by the letrozole&#xD;
      and abemaciclib combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the frequency of adverse events associated with use of abemaciclib and&#xD;
      letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation of the expression of Ki-67 with that of cyclin D1, p16, pRB,&#xD;
      and PTEN as well as with MMR deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) and abemaciclib PO twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on days 1-14. Patients then undergo standard of care hysterectomy on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 2 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
