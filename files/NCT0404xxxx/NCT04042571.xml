  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) monitoring and CT-scanner perfusion are useful but&#xD;
      imperfect tools to identify vasospasm and allow intervention to avoid infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permanent monitoring of cerebral tissue oximetry (rSO2) by NIRS, a noninvasive method could&#xD;
      allow better vasospasm detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate diagnostic accuracy of cerebral oxymetry (NIRS) -by rSO2 measurement&#xD;
      - in order to detect vasospasm in patient with severe subarachnoid hemorrhage compare to&#xD;
      standard monitoring tools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delayed vasospasm is a serious complication of aneurismal subarachnoid haemorhage (SAH)&#xD;
      significantly influencing morbidity and mortality. Mostly observed between days 4 and 10&#xD;
      after aneurismal rupture, its incidence is higher in cases of severe SAH. Vasospasm strongly&#xD;
      affects prognisis generating delayed cerebral ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical deterioration (focal neurological deficit) is the best way to detect severe&#xD;
      vasospasm. Unfortunately, most of severe SAH are intubated and sedated prohibiting&#xD;
      neurological evaluation. In these frequent situations, Transcranial Doppler (TCD), clinical&#xD;
      and biological monitoring, CT-scanner (angio-CT and Perfusion-CT), MRI and cerebral&#xD;
      angiography are routinely used to detect vasospasm. Yet, these tools have imperfect&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificty delaying diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive method measuring tissue oxygenation by&#xD;
      regional saturation of capillary-oxygenated hemoglobin (rSO2). This technology demonstrated&#xD;
      ability to measure cerebral oxygenation and has previously been reported to monitor carotid&#xD;
      and pediatric surgery. To date a few studies also reported NIRS monitoring feasability in&#xD;
      post-SAH vasospasm. Our aim is here to evaluate NIRS monitoring for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      vasospasm in severe SAH.&#xD;
