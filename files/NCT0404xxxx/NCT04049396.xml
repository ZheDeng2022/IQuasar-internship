  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common liver dysfunctions, affects&#xD;
      about one-fourth of the global adult population and has a significant mortality rate between&#xD;
      6.3% and 33%.NAFLD can lead to other serious illnesses. The disease is associated with a&#xD;
      group of metabolic comorbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension, and hyper-cholesterolemia, which are potential risk factors for progressive&#xD;
      liver disease.This study sought to evaluate the therapeutic effect of berberine on the liver&#xD;
      function and metabolic profiles of patients with NAFLD. In this context,A six week,&#xD;
      open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in a single medical center at Takestan&#xD;
      Hospital, Iran. A total of 281 patients with NAFLD were enrolled and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment arm with (n=24) or without (n=24) berberine. All patients had received&#xD;
      pre-randomization lifestyle training including recommendations on low-fat diet. Blood&#xD;
      examinations were performed to evaluate glucose, lipid profile, and liver enzymes both at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study and upon the completion of the trial (day 45). To assess tolerability&#xD;
      of the study intervention and any possible adverse events, patients in both groups were&#xD;
      required to attend weekly follow-up visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A seven-week (45-day), open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a medical&#xD;
      center affiliated with the Ministry of Welfare and Social Security in Iran to study the&#xD;
      impact of berberine on liver function and metabolic profiles of patients with NAFLD. Hospital&#xD;
      employees who met the enrollment criteria were identified through electronic health records&#xD;
      (EHRs) available in a human resource database of employee routine annual examinations. Using&#xD;
      a computer-generated random-allocation sequence, eligible employees were equally assigned&#xD;
      (1:1) to berberine 6.25 g per day (arm A) or no intervention (Arm B). Berberine was&#xD;
      administered orally (100 g dried berberine in 5 Liter water boiled at 167°F until 4Liter).).&#xD;
      To control the potential impact of confounders on outcome measures, and to balance the daily&#xD;
      dietary and physical activity among the study groups, all participants were trained by&#xD;
      skilled experts on lifestyle and behavior improvement.&#xD;
