    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and any locally-required authorization (EU Data Privacy&#xD;
             Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject prior to performing any&#xD;
             protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow&#xD;
             up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age over or equal to 18 years at time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the lung stage IIIB/IV according to UICC7&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One or two previous lines of systemic therapy including maintenance for advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic NSCLC. Patients should be offered standard therapy regimens as recommended&#xD;
             by current local Clinical Practice Guidelines. Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapies are&#xD;
             permitted, provided that disease progression/relapse occurred more than 6 months after&#xD;
             cessation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expected life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with measurable disease (at least one uni-dimensionally measurable target&#xD;
             lesion by CT-scan or MRI) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST 1.1) are eligible. If a potential target lesion has been irradiated&#xD;
             previously, clear evidence of progression at target site must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue block (archival or recent) or&#xD;
             approx. of 10-15 unstained slides of tumor sample (slices must be recent and collected&#xD;
             on slides provided by the sponsor) must be available for PD-L1 and other biomarker&#xD;
             evaluation. Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle&#xD;
             aspiration is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapies and surgeries are allowed if completed 2 weeks (for minor surgery) or&#xD;
             4 weeks (palliative radiotherapy for bone pain; major surgeries with complete wound&#xD;
             healing), respectively prior to start of treatment and patient recovered from toxic&#xD;
             effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate blood count, liver-enzymes, and renal function (obtained no later than 14&#xD;
             days prior to start of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months (30&#xD;
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last&#xD;
             dose of nivolumab. Since the effect of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of&#xD;
             contraceptives has not been investigated, barrier methods should be applied as a&#xD;
             second form of contraception, to avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 24 hours prior to the start of study treatment and monthly throughout treatment&#xD;
             until 5 months after last dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7&#xD;
             months after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as&#xD;
             azoospermic men do not require contraception.&#xD;

             weeks prior to enrollment. In addition, subjects must be either off corticosteroids,&#xD;
