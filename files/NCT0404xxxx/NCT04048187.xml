  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Devices pass through different development and study phases. At an early&#xD;
      stage, feasibiltiy studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and&#xD;
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then&#xD;
      investigated regarding interpendency between all available algorithms, features and functions&#xD;
      running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, resulting from the&#xD;
      pre-validation studies, they get optimized. Prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing&#xD;
      Systems get reviewed by a final quality control in terms of clinical trials. This is a&#xD;
      pre-validation study, investigating improved algorithms, features, functions and wearing&#xD;
      comfort. This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova&#xD;
      AG Headquarters based in St채fa (Switzerland).&#xD;

      This study will prove the overall performance and system context of the functionality in the&#xD;
      mobile application in combination with hearing devices under real life conditions with&#xD;
      experienced hearing aid users. The enduser should be able to adjust their hearing aid&#xD;
      settings by App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app allows the user to change e.g. the loudness of the hearing aids and to create hearing&#xD;
      scenarios by themselves. The users also shall be able to accept a conferecene call, which&#xD;
      they will receive from the investigator via App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a clinical investigation which will be conducted mono centric at Sonova AG&#xD;
      Headquarters based in St채fa (Switzerland).&#xD;
