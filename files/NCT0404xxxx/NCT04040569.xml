      The purpose of this phase I trial is to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity while dose escalating&#xD;
      single-fraction preoperative S-PBI to a presumed radioablative dose over 3 cohorts, starting&#xD;
      with 30Gy in 1 fraction and advancing to 34Gy and 38Gy in 1 fraction.&#xD;

      Preoperative stereotactic breast radiation may be beneficial as it offers the ability to&#xD;
      target smaller treatment volumes than what has been achievable with adjuvant PBI (Nichols&#xD;
      IJROBP 2010), track radiobiological response to radiation at time of surgical pathology, and&#xD;
      allow the removal of all irradiated tissue to potentially minimize late effects.The purpose&#xD;
      of this phase I trial is to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity while dose escalating&#xD;
      single-fraction preoperative S-PBI to a presumed radioablative dose over 3 cohorts, starting&#xD;
      with 30Gy in 1 fraction and advancing to 34Gy and 38Gy in 1 fraction. This would be&#xD;
      accomplished on the CyberKnife or GammaPod. The GammaPod is a novel device dedicated to S-PBI&#xD;
      utilizing a Cobalt-60 source (Yu Med Phys 2013), which offers a highly reproducible prone&#xD;
      setup with a mean of 1.8mm of mismatch reported in 15 patients at the University of Maryland&#xD;
      on consecutive scans (Yu JCO 2011). Implications of this research are far reaching, including&#xD;
      determination of the maximally tolerated dose for preoperative S-PBI, pathologic complete&#xD;
      response rates of early stage breast cancer to a predicted radioablative dose, radiographic&#xD;
      markers of treatment response (radiomics), and translational research assessing mechanisms of&#xD;
      immune and radiation response.&#xD;

    <description>Done by escalating the dose of SBRT toward the tumorcidal dose of 38 Gy in fraction. Doses will be escalated an additional 3.5-4 Gy per treatment. The phase I portion of the study will be completed when either of the following events occur: 1) the MTD for a cohort is reached or 2) when delivery of a pre-determined highest dose of radiation (38 Gy) that has been deemed likely to be efficacious for treatment of early stage breast cancer is attained.Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.</description>

    <description>Photographs of both breasts will be taken and cosmesis form will be graded by the patient, and the radiation oncologist, at twelve months from the start of therapy and at yearly intervals thereafter for up to 5 years after treatment. In addition, an independent panel established at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center will evaluate cosmesis at the end of study based on photography.</description>

    <description>The primary objective is to escalate the dose of 1 fraction stereotactic partial breast radiotherapy utilizing the MR Linac,Gammapod or Cyberknife system to an ablative dose in the pre-operative setting to the primary tumor without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in patients with early stage breast cancer.</description>

    <intervention_name>Radiomics on MRI</intervention_name>
    <description>Through extracting and analyzing a large number of features from medical imaging, radiomics has shown promising results in treatment outcome prediction for many diseases including breast cancer (45-50). UTSW physics group has developed several new radiomic approaches and radiomic features, such as a multi-objective radiomics model(51) and a new radiomic &quot;Shell&quot; feature(52). As an exploratory end point for this trial, the investigators will explore the application radiomics using pre-treatment MRI, treatment parameters and clinical characteristics as input to predict pathological response of radiation therapy (XRT) based on pathology report of surgical tissues and local recurrence.</description>
