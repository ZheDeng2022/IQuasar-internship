             daily life), usually associated with one or more of the following: lid retraction ≥ 2&#xD;
             mm, moderate or severe soft tissue involvement, exophthalmos ≥ 3 mm above normal for&#xD;
             race and gender, and/or inconstant or constant diplopia.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Patients must be euthyroid with the baseline disease under control or have mild hypo-&#xD;

             levels &lt; 50% above or below the normal limits) at Eligibility review. Every effort&#xD;
             should be made to correct the mild hypo- or hyperthyroidism promptly and to maintain&#xD;
             the euthyroid state for the full duration of participation.&#xD;

             first infusion of teprotumumab or tocilizumab (Actemra® or Roactemra®) within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to the first infusion of teprotumumab. Use of any other non-steroid&#xD;
             immunosuppressive agent within 3 months prior to the first infusion of teprotumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Use of an investigational agent for any condition within 60 days prior to the first&#xD;
