  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing 2 symptom management programs&#xD;
      for older adults with self-reported memory problems and chronic pain, Active Brains 1 and&#xD;
      Active Brains 2. We will assess how each program may help in improving coping with pain and&#xD;
      coping with cognitive functioning. We will explore feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      credibility and within group changes in physical, emotional and cognitive functioning.&#xD;

      We aim to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing 2 symptom management programs&#xD;
      for older adults with self-reported memory problems and chronic pain: Active Brains 1 Active&#xD;
      Brains 2. We will assess how each program may help in improving coping with pain and coping&#xD;
      with cognitive functioning. We will explore feasibility, acceptability, and credibility and&#xD;
      within group changes in physical, emotional and cognitive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group meets for 8 90 minute sessions over a secure video platform. Each group has 5-8&#xD;
      participants. Participants receive a treatment manual. There are 2 assessment points:&#xD;
      baseline, and post program. Assessments involve questionnaires, a walk test, and objective&#xD;
      step count with ActiGraphs for 1 week.&#xD;

    <description>Active Brains uses a multimodal approach to introduce and reinforce new skills, including didactics, in-session activities, discussions, and weekly practice assignments (homework). The Active Brains sessions reflect a purposeful integration of the three treatment approaches (relaxation methods, stress appraisal &amp; coping, and growth enhancement). The format is an 8-week program with weekly meetings and a focus on relaxation response strategies, cognitive behavioral training, positive psychology and mind-body interactions. Active Brains 1 uses a digital monitoring device (i.e., Fitbit) for recording of physical activity.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This active comparison condition controls for the effect of time spent, group member support/feedback, and interventionist support/feedback. The original HEP was adapted to provide population-specific information on chronic pain and MCI/MRP symptoms. Participants also receive lifestyle education consistent from public health recommendations and standards for health promotion (e.g., &quot;Sleep&quot;, &quot;Nutrition&quot;, &quot;Healthy Weight&quot;, and &quot;Medical appointments&quot;). The HEP program consists on 8 group sessions (each session is 90 minutes) that occur concurrently with the active intervention condition. The HEP is conducted in the same format as Active Brains-Fitbit but are not taught the mind-body, walking, or cognitive-behavioral skills. HEP participants are encouraged to set lifestyle goals instead of quota-based walking goals aided by the Fitbit as in the Active Brains-Fitbit condition.</description>
