      The One tooth - One time (1T1T) innovative approach is a straightforward and cost-effective&#xD;
      protocol to replace a missing tooth in the posterior region (Lambert and Mainjot 2017) (see&#xD;
      Appendix). The digital impression of single unit implants right after the implant placement&#xD;
      and the direct manufacturing of a Polymer-Infiltrated Ceramic Network (PICN) screw-retained&#xD;
      crown allows the delivery of a final tooth in occlusion within the same day. The absence of&#xD;
      lab procedures reduces the number of appointments, providing immediate results and high&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. The prosthesis material choice is crucial in this procedure. Indeed,&#xD;
      PICN high resilience, i.e. damping effect, could reduce peri-implant strain compared to&#xD;
      ceramic materials (Magne, Silva et al. 2013) (Maminskas, Puisys et al. 2016), moreover its&#xD;
      elastic modulus is close to tooth tissues, while other CAD-CAM composites value is too low&#xD;
      and ceramic materials are too high. The rapid milling and manufacturing process, without any&#xD;
      firing procedure, and the ease of adjustments (particularly to adjust proximal and occlusal&#xD;
      contact points), make also PICNs well-adapted to chair-side systems. The material low&#xD;
      stiffness and hardness can improve patient comfort and promote adaptation of the restorations&#xD;
      to occlusal relationships with time. The 1T1T approach was presented as a proof of concept in&#xD;
      a first international publication using tissue level implants from Straumann, which describes&#xD;
      the whole protocol (Lambert and Mainjot 2017). Currently, a case series including 10 teeth is&#xD;
      on-course, showing a 100% survival rate of implants and restorations after a 2-yr follow-up.&#xD;
      These results are very promising but further clinical research is needed to validate such a&#xD;
      protocol on a larger number of patients, on other implant systems as well as to compare this&#xD;
      approach to conventional protocols.&#xD;

      The present study is designed as a single center comparative controlled trial. This study&#xD;
      aims to compare immediate (1T1T) versus delayed loading with a final PICN screw-retained&#xD;
      crown (DL-PICN), performed with CAD-CAM system. A total of 28 consecutive patients (56 teeth)&#xD;
      above the age of 18 and presenting two single-unit edentulous space in the posterior region&#xD;
      (molars or premolars, upper or lower jaw), will be considered for possible inclusion in the&#xD;
      study, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (patients with high occlusal stress&#xD;
      will be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the different protocols will be tested in terms of (1) prostheses and&#xD;
      implants survival and success rates following international standards (2) Patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures (PROMs); (3) time and cost. Moreover, restorations and antagonistic teeth&#xD;
      wear will be studied trough ex-vivo analysis by profilometry of replica. The evaluations will&#xD;
      be carried out at a follow-up period of 7 days, 2, 6 months and then every year up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that the type of loading technique with a final PICN crown (1T1T or DL-PICN)&#xD;
      does not influence prostheses and implants survival and success rates, but that 1T1T protocol&#xD;
      improves patient-centered outcomes as well as time and cost effectiveness in comparison with&#xD;
      DL-PICN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall cost of the restoration treatment will be 1600€ (instead of 2100€), which&#xD;
      represents a saving of 500€ for the patient.&#xD;
