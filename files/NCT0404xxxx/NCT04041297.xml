  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries cancer has become the second leading cause of death after&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The lung is a particularly exposed organ since broncho-pulmonary&#xD;
      cancers rank second in terms of incidence, and the first rank in terms of mortality of all&#xD;
      cancers listed in like reported in United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung resection surgery is currently the recommended curative treatment for the early stages&#xD;
      of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite this preferred indication, some patients can&#xD;
      not be eligible for surgery because of their cardiovascular or respiratory comorbidities or&#xD;
      their impaired functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the evaluation of aerobic capacity through cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) of&#xD;
      patients estimated at risk of postoperative complication is now recommended to estimate the&#xD;
      level of predictive risk associated. The American Thoracic Society and the European&#xD;
      Respiratory Socitety agree on thresholds of &lt;10 and&gt; 20 ml/kg/min of maximum oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (VO2peak) respectively determining a high or low postoperative risk, between these two&#xD;
      thresholds risk is considered moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic capacity is traditionally expressed in terms of maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max or&#xD;
      VO2peak) evaluated during an incremental CPET. In patients with significant respiratory&#xD;
      impairment, these tests are often limited by ventilation and sub-maximally on the metabolic&#xD;
      or cardiac parameters. However, the analysis of the VO2 kinetic during a constant-intensity&#xD;
      test of moderate intensity is also a relevant way of measuring aerobic conditioning. Indeed,&#xD;
      the time constant (τ) of phase II of VO2 kinetics (VO2τ) is a marker that closely reflects&#xD;
      the adjustment of oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle. Analysis of the kinetic parameters&#xD;
      of the cardio-respiratory response to exercise has been shown to be reproducible and&#xD;
      training-sensitive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The value&#xD;
      of VO2τ was also reported to be strongly correlated with markers of severity and prognosis in&#xD;
      COPD patients. Previous work has shown that exercise training can improve the speed of the&#xD;
      VO2 kinetic response in COPD patients as well as in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no study to our knowledge has evaluated the kinetics of the cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      response during moderate intensity constant-load test in patients with NSCLC. In this&#xD;
      context, this work aims to evaluate the applicability of this measure as well as its&#xD;
      evolution during a preoperative exercise training program in patients with NSCLC.&#xD;

    <description>Each prehabilitation session will last approximately 90 minutes and will include:&#xD;
Endurance training at the ventilatory threshold, determined according to the initial CPET. The first session will last for 15 to 20 minutes then increase by 5 minutes each session to reach 45 minutes in total (including a 5-minute warm-up and 5 minutes of active recovery). The intensity will then increase by 5 or 10 W, as could be tolerated;&#xD;
Peripheral muscle strengthening at 60% to 70% of the 1-repetition maximum of 3 main components (quadriceps press, whole-leg extension, and upper limb pull down). Three sets of 12 movements will carry out for each exercise and the load will increase weekly as tolerated;&#xD;
Inspiratory muscle training using a threshold calibrated to at least 30% of the MIP. Patients will be encouraged to carry out 15 minutes of independent training daily and to increase the resistance regularly.&#xD;
Education to bronchial drainage techniques as well as directed coughing.</description>
