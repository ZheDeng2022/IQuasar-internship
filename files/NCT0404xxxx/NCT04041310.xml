      Ref: Protocol v5.0, dated 1Jul2021. NOUS-209-01 is a multicenter, open-label, multiple&#xD;
      cohorts, clinical study, designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      to detect any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity of Nous-209 genetic polyvalent&#xD;
      vaccine plus pembrolizumab combination therapy in adult subjects with unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or MSI-H CRC, gastric, or gastro-esophageal&#xD;
      junction (G-E junction) tumors. Nous-209 is based on a heterologous prime/boost regimen&#xD;
      composed of the Great Ape Adenovirus GAd20-209-FSP used for priming and Modified Vaccinia&#xD;
      virus Ankara MVA-209-FSP used for boosting. The Phase I portion of the study is a&#xD;
      first-in-human (FIH) clinical study with a primary objective to elucidate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Nous-209 in addition to establishing the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D),&#xD;
      whereas the Phase IIa was introduced to assess efficacy as the primary objective. The Phase I&#xD;
      stage of the study has been conducted in US; the Phase II will be conducted in US and in EU&#xD;
      (pending authorization).&#xD;

      Ref: Protocol v5.0, dated 1Jul2021. Both Frame Shift Peptide (FSP) neoantigen-encoding&#xD;
      genetic vaccines are administered intramuscularly using 1 prime with the GAd20-209-FSP and 3&#xD;
      boosts with MVA-209-FSP in combination with the licensed programmed death receptor-1&#xD;
      (PD-1)-blocking antibody pembrolizumab in adult subjects with unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) or MSI-H colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric, or G-E junction&#xD;
      tumors. In Phase I, GAd20-209-FSP prime will be administered on the day of 2nd pembrolizumab&#xD;

      pembrolizumab infusion (weeks 7 and 10 and 13). In Phase IIa, GAd20-209-FSP prime will be&#xD;
      administered on the same day as the 1st pembrolizumab infusion (day 1, week 1); MVA-209-FSP&#xD;
      boosts will be administered on the day of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pembrolizumab infusion (weeks 4&#xD;
      and 7 and 10).&#xD;
