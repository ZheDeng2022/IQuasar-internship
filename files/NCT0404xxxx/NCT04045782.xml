  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, phase IV, prospective, interventional cohort study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of switching from Originator (Humira®) to Biosimilar (Imraldi®)&#xD;
      adalimumab in routine clinical practice. The study will include approximately 170 patients&#xD;
      (100 patients treated in OLV Aalst and 70 patients treated in AZ Maria Middelares Gent). The&#xD;
      study collects baseline clinical characteristics and assessment of parameters regarding&#xD;
      switch and overall satisfaction. For patients who are willing to switch, there is a 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up (study) period. During the follow-up (study) period patients will continue their&#xD;
      treatment with adalimumab, i.e. Imraldi®, except if good clinical practice for the patient&#xD;
      would oblige the treating physician to change treatment regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physicians and IBD nurses working with IBD patients in the participating centres will be&#xD;
      informed by the Principal Investigator (PI) with up-to-date information regarding this trial&#xD;
      and regarding biologicals and biosimilars, with a specific emphasis on the data available for&#xD;
      Imraldi®. The information will be given at an especially organized meeting for this purpose,&#xD;
      which will take about two hours. Only physicians attending this meeting will be able to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All IBD patients with a diagnosis of CD or UC, followed by a physician who attended the&#xD;
      meeting and who are currently on maintenance therapy with Humira® for at least 8 weeks, are&#xD;
      eligible to be invited to enter the study. The acceptance rate will be measured at baseline&#xD;
      as the proportion of patients who accept the switch among all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the outpatient clinic, the subject of switching from Humira® to Imraldi® can be discussed&#xD;
      with the patient. All patients on Humira® will be informed about the possibility to switch to&#xD;
      Imraldi® and to participate in this trial. Irrespective of their intention to switch, all&#xD;
      patients will be offered a standardized evaluation of their current disease status, with - if&#xD;
      necessary - adjustment of their therapy. The information is initially given by the treating&#xD;
      physician and - if necessary - can be further fine-tuned by the IBD-nurse or physician in&#xD;
      consecutive follow-up visits. All patients will be provided with patient information and&#xD;
      consent form. Informed consent must be obtained prior to baseline procedures. A unique&#xD;
      subject identification number will be assigned to each patient and used throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From all included patients (i.e. those agreeing to switch and those declining to switch),&#xD;
      baseline clinical characteristics (year of birth, gender, year of IBD diagnosis, previous&#xD;
      treatment and previous surgery, smoking status, Montreal Classification, co-immunomodulatory&#xD;
      drug use and corticoid co-administration), Humira® treatment details and visual analogue&#xD;
      scale assessment of parameters regarding switch and overall satisfaction with current&#xD;
      treatment, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the patients willing to switch, prospective data on effectiveness and safety and&#xD;
      subjective satisfaction on different aspects of Imraldi® use, will be obtained at 3&#xD;
      predefined timepoints: 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after switch to Imraldi®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who switch to Imraldi® will have blood samplings at 4 different timepoints&#xD;
      (baseline, Week 8, Month 6 and Month 12) for analysis of ADA trough level and anti-drug&#xD;
      antibodies, peripheral blood count (plus leucocyte differentiation) and CRP. At the same&#xD;
      timepoints, faecal calprotectin will be measured, CDAI / Mayo clinical subscore will be&#xD;
      assessed and patient weight recorded. A PGA will be performed, in order to get a subjective&#xD;
      feeling of disease status/response, in order to avoid unnecessary further examinations.&#xD;
