      MOSAIC is a single-blind experimental medicine study to determine the extent to which&#xD;
      different prime-boost combinations of model immunogens based on HIV-1 envelope proteins&#xD;
      influence the diversity of B and T cell responses.&#xD;

      One of the most effective arms of the human immune system is the ability of very low&#xD;
      concentrations of antibody proteins to bind to viruses, bacteria and toxins and &quot;neutralise&quot;&#xD;
      their activity or ability to infect. In contrast to cellular immunity, which may cause tissue&#xD;
      destruction and pathology, antibody-mediated immunity can be very passive, while completely&#xD;
      preventing infection. How antibodies bind their targets varies enormously, ranging from&#xD;
      unhelpful &quot;blocking&quot; antibodies or narrowly focussed neutralising antibodies, to highly&#xD;
      protective &quot;broadly neutralising&quot; antibodies (bNAbs) that can neutralise a wide range of&#xD;
      strains of the same pathogen. Such bNAbs are especially sought after in virus infections such&#xD;
      as HIV, influenza and others where the virus mutates to evade immune responses that are too&#xD;
      narrow or focussed. Antibodies arise when an &quot;immunogen&quot; (an immunogen is anything that&#xD;
      induces an immune response, typically a foreign protein) is taken up by the immune system and&#xD;
      shown to white blood cells - T and B cells - by specialised immune cells. In some cases the T&#xD;
      and B cells bind the immunogens to receptors on their surface, triggering an immune response&#xD;
      in which T cells &quot;help&quot; B cells to manufacture specific antibodies. The events around how the&#xD;
      protein is processed into manageable pieces, shown to the T and B cells, and the pattern of&#xD;
      chemical signals produced by the immune cells is highly complex, but eventually determines&#xD;
      how broad the antibody response will be (its breadth). For infections like HIV and influenza,&#xD;
      decades of research and clinical vaccine trials have had limited or no success. To take HIV&#xD;
      as an example, we have an almost complete lack of understanding of how immunogens interact&#xD;
      with the naive human B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire and the pathways required to induce&#xD;
      bNAbs during an infection or after an immunisation. Animal models have failed as the na√Øve,&#xD;
      germline encoded, B cell antibody receptor repertoires of non-human species are sufficiently&#xD;
      different from those of humans to render design and selection of vaccine based on non-human&#xD;
      species problematic. Additionally, bNAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals have&#xD;
      structural features that occur rarely or not at all in other mammals, such as unusually long&#xD;
      loop-binding regions (CDRH3 loops) required to penetrate past glycans on the surface of the&#xD;
      envelope spike that shield key neutralising epitopes (Mascola JR 2013). There is therefore a&#xD;
      critical need to better understand, in human experimental medicine models of immune&#xD;
      challenge, how immunogens and B/T cells interact in the development of protective bNAb&#xD;
      anti-viral responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach to resolving this impasse is to challenge the human immune system with&#xD;
      rationally-designed model immunogens to determine the structural and other characteristics&#xD;
      required to drive human B cell antibody responses towards neutralisation breadth. We have&#xD;
      selected HIV as an experimental model as there is a reasonable understanding about the&#xD;
      specificity and function of anti-HIV bNAbs, as well as an urgent need to identify novel&#xD;
      immunisation approaches following decades of failed or poorly successful trials. There is&#xD;
      also a huge database of safety using HIV proteins as immunogens, and the technological&#xD;
      expertise to design and manufacture HIV viral proteins. Assays for HIV neutralising activity&#xD;
      are also well established in our laboratories. Although focussed on HIV, our findings will be&#xD;
      applicable to other viral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model immunogens we propose to use in these experimental medicine studies are unlikely to&#xD;
      be suitable as vaccines, and any clinical development would require iterative cycles of&#xD;
      design refinement and development based on immunological insights gleaned from these&#xD;
      experimental investigations. Therefore, the focus is on in-depth characterisation of the&#xD;
      elicited immune response to rationally-designed model immunogens that may inform the design&#xD;
      process of actual vaccines. This experimental medicine approach is only now possible due to&#xD;
      unprecedented progress in our abilities to study the human immune system and to obtain&#xD;
      complete information on immune responses to vaccination, since performing research on the&#xD;
      human immune system is now almost as easy as it has been in mice. The main focus of this&#xD;
      study will be to determine which of the design strategies is able to prime human germline&#xD;
      (naive) B cells and drive antibody responses towards induction of neutralising antibody&#xD;
      breadth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our range of model immunogens will be based on the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of HIV-1,&#xD;
      which is the only target of neutralising antibodies, and therefore the only virally-encoded&#xD;
      immunogen relevant for induction of such antibodies by immunisation. To ensure&#xD;
      reproducibility of results and the highest level of volunteer safety, all immunogens will be&#xD;
      manufactured under cGMP, using techniques applied to vaccine immunogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Env has extensive amino acid variation, structural and conformational instability, and&#xD;
      immunodominance of hypervariable regions (Kwong PD, 2011; Sattentau QJ, 2013). We will design&#xD;
      soluble immunogens that closely mimic the native viral trimer in situ, but that incorporate&#xD;
      design strategies that may alter the intrinsic viral immune evasion mechanisms (Sanders RW,&#xD;
      2013). Env is made up of three identical complexes (trimers) each of which contains two&#xD;
      molecules, gp120 and gp41 that can be modified to make a soluble molecule called gp140, upon&#xD;
      which our immunogens are based. We have developed model consensus gp140 Env trimers&#xD;
      (consensus of all global strains) designed to prime B cell responses to common epitopes&#xD;
      represented in all HIV-1 subtypes. We have utilised two design strategies to stabilise these&#xD;
      in a native-like conformation: ConM SOSIP and ConS UFO. The ConM SOSIP trimer includes novel&#xD;
      mutations that include the incorporation of a disulphide linkage between the gp120 and gp41&#xD;
      ectodomain (making up gp140) which prevents their disassociation into monomer subunits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ConS UFO includes a short flexible amino-acid linker to tether the gp120 and gp41&#xD;
      subunits together as an alternative strategy to prevent dissociation of the Env trimer. We&#xD;
      wish to test both designs to determine the effect on B cell repertoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical adjunct to our consensus-based model design is to use a cocktail of three mosaic&#xD;
      gp140 Env trimers designed to overcome the immunodominance of hypervariable regions of Env&#xD;
      and to determine whether they will focus antibody responses towards conserved neutralisation&#xD;
      epitopes. While designed using computer algorithms, these mosaics represent authentic Env&#xD;
      structures that are fully functional and native in their conformation. Our novel designs aim&#xD;
      to eliminate unwanted immunodominant antibody responses and focus B cells towards highly&#xD;
      conserved supersites of vulnerability on Env, with particular emphasis on quaternary bNAb&#xD;
      epitopes (Julien, JP, 2013; Kong L, 2013; Lyumkis D, 2013). Like the ConM SOSIP and ConS UFO&#xD;
      trimers described above, the mosaic trimers have disulphide linkage which prevents&#xD;
      disassociation of gp120 and gp41 into monomer subunits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MOSAIC study groups, we will explore the use of the three mosaic immunogens used&#xD;
      sequentially (in a series of different orders), or as a cocktail, to focus B cell responses&#xD;
      towards conserved areas of Env. To amplify these responses we intend to give a final boosting&#xD;
      immunization with both consensus immunogens (ConM and ConS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent to which these different strategies may induce neutralising breadth, and the&#xD;
      identification of the mechanisms and drivers involved, can only be determined empirically&#xD;
      through human immunogen challenge studies.&#xD;
