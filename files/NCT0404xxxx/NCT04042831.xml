    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with biliary tract&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and with aberrant DNA repair&#xD;
      gene mutations. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy (objective response rate) of olaparib monotherapy in advanced&#xD;
      biliary tract cancer (BTC) with mutations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with&#xD;
      mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression free survival of patients with advanced biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      with mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events in advanced biliary tract cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the duration of response for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer with&#xD;
      mutations in DNA repair genes treated with olaparib who experience an objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the prevalence of mutations including those targeting DNA repair pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify mutational signatures associated with pathogenic process in advanced biliary&#xD;
      tract cancer samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate the presence of mutations and mutational signatures linked to mutations in DNA&#xD;
      repair genes and homologous recombinant repair with clinical responses to olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate putative biomarkers related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iva. De novo sensitivity. IVb. Tumor evolution and resistance, to PARP inhibition from&#xD;
      olaparib in BTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
