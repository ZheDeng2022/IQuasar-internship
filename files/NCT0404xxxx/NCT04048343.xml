      This is open-label, single arm study designed to evaluate the safety of tezepelumab in adults&#xD;
      and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma on medium to high-dose ICS and at least one&#xD;
      additional asthma controller medication with or without OCS. Approximately 66 subjects will&#xD;
      be dosed in Japan. Subjects will receive tezepelumab administered via subcutaneous injection&#xD;
      at the study site, over a 52-week treatment period. The study also includes a post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
