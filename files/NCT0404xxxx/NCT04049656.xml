  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is intended to be a prospective clinical performance validation study&#xD;
      designed to confirm the clinical utility of HFVI-guided fentanyl administration during&#xD;
      sevoflurane anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of HFVI-guided&#xD;
      analgesic administration in comparison to standard clinical practice. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint will be the amount of postoperative pain reported in the PACU, as measured using a&#xD;
      nurse administered Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HFVi was designed to provide a standardized measure of the parasympathetic component (p∑) of&#xD;
      the Autonomous Nervous System (ANS). It tracts changes of the p∑ tonus induced by each&#xD;
      respiratory cycle (spontaneous or artificial) to measure the relative balance of&#xD;
      parasympathetic and sympathetic tone as reflected in the EKG signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These rapid changes of the p∑ tonus express themselves at the sinus node level by changes of&#xD;
      the time interval separating two R waves of the electrocardiogram. The following normal RR&#xD;
      intervals constitute the tachogram (displayed as respiratory pattern on the monitor). The p ∑&#xD;
      component is evaluated after filtering, standardization and re-sampling of the R-R series, by&#xD;
      measuring the surface generated by respiratory cycles on the tachogram. Higher p∑ tonus is&#xD;
      reflected as a larger measured surface area. In contrast, the measured surface decreases when&#xD;
      the p∑ decreases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HFVi, a measure of the surface area, is expressed in the form of a dimensionless index&#xD;
      ranging from 0 to 100. This index reflects the relative activity of the parasympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. It expresses the relative quantity of the present p∑ tonus compared to the&#xD;
      Para and sympathetic tonus. The measure of HFVi displayed represents the average of a&#xD;
      sequence of measurements: each elementary measure is realized on 64 seconds of data, updated&#xD;
      each second using a sliding window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During development, a probabilistic interpretation of the HFVi was used to relate index&#xD;
      values to a clinical state in an anesthetized subject. A significant hemodynamic response&#xD;
      (increase of the heart rare or blood pressure of 20% compared to the baseline) within 10&#xD;
      minutes was used as an indicator of nociception/inadequate analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a measure of parasympathetic tone, HFVi may be influenced by many factors and thus be&#xD;
      difficult to interpret in many of the following situations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no breathing (ex : apnea due to intubation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate lower than 9 cycles/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tidal volume variable on the measuring time, thus 64 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Irregular breathing (when the patient speaks, laugh or cough)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pace maker (some types)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug use having a significant effect on the sinus cardiac activity&#xD;

    <description>The change in numerical pain scores reported during the first hour (scores at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes) of recovery. The NPS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of pain, with 0 being 'no pain' and 10 being 'the worst pain.' Subjects and clinical pain assessors will remain blinded to treatment group assignment.</description>
