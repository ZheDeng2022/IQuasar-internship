      The objectives of this VA Merit application are to identify a neural target unique to&#xD;
      Veterans with co-occurring alcohol use disorder and mild traumatic brain injury (AUD+mTBI)&#xD;
      and to test the efficacy of this target as a stimulation site for repetitive transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment to maximize functional recovery. rTMS will soon be a&#xD;
      treatment option at 30 VAs nationwide and preliminary studies show promise for AUD and mTBI&#xD;
      treatment. A better understanding of how AUD+mTBI impacts the brain needs to occur in order&#xD;
      to advance rTMS to optimize function. This research is aligned with the VA RR&amp;D's mission to&#xD;
      generate knowledge and innovations to advance the rehabilitative health and care of Veterans,&#xD;
      to effectively integrate clinical and applied rehabilitation research, and translate research&#xD;
      results into practice. This research is also aligned with the goal of the Psychological&#xD;
      Health &amp; Social Reintegration portfolio to develop interventions improving psychological&#xD;
      health status of Veterans enabling them to function more fully in society.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) impact functional&#xD;
      abilities. AUD occurs in up to 35% of Veterans with mTBI. Evidence suggests that&#xD;
      co-occurrence of AUD and mTBI (AUD+mTBI) leads to an exacerbation of brain dysfunction,&#xD;
      symptom manifestation, and ultimately, functional disability. Alcohol-related characteristics&#xD;
      are operationally defined per AUD symptoms and outcomes including, but not limited to,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, alcohol craving, and AUD severity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory treatment that will soon be a treatment&#xD;
      option at 30 VAs nationwide. Preliminary rTMS efficacy is demonstrated for AUD alone and mTBI&#xD;
      alone using a variety of neural targets. rTMS is, thus, a promising treatment for AUD+mTBI.&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to 1) identify neural targets (i.e. site of stimulation)&#xD;
      associated with both alcohol-related characteristics and self-reported functional disability,&#xD;
      and 2) assess preliminary efficacy and sustainability of a high frequency rTMS protocol&#xD;
      applied to these customized neural targets relative to the commonly used left dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) site. Addressing these objectives are essential steps towards the&#xD;
      long-term research goal [to customize and clinically implement a rTMS treatment] that can&#xD;
      improve brain function resulting in optimal recovery for Veterans with AUD+mTBI. To address&#xD;
      the first study objective, Veterans will be recruited and classified into one of two groups&#xD;
      based on structured-interviews, self-report measures, and neuropsychological assessments: 1)&#xD;
      AUD+mTBI, and 2) [Veteran controls] without a history or symptoms of mTBI or AUD.&#xD;
      Alcohol-related characteristics will be assessed through objective measures of alcohol use,&#xD;
      self-report measures, and structured interviews. Self-reported functional disability will be&#xD;
      assessed using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS).&#xD;
      Neuroimaging metrics will be assessed through a multi-modal, functional and structural&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Participants will complete a functional MRI (fMRI)&#xD;
      protocol where brain activation will be measured in response to viewing images related to&#xD;
      alcohol, compared to neutral images. Advanced neuroimaging procedures to determine the&#xD;
      structural integrity of white matter fibers in the brain and spontaneous activity in brain&#xD;
      networks, a process called resting state functional connectivity (rsFC), will also be&#xD;
      conducted. To address the second study objective, AUD+mTBI Veterans will receive rTMS at one&#xD;
      site randomly assigned from a set of 4 sites: 3 customized neural targets identified in this&#xD;
      study, and the commonly used left DLPFC. AUD+mTBI Veterans will complete 10 PLACEBO, then 10&#xD;
      ACTIVE rTMS sessions in a within-subjects design. Follow-up WHODAS assessments will occur at&#xD;
      2-weeks, 1-month and 6-months post-ACTIVE rTMS. Aim 1 will identify unique neural targets for&#xD;
      rTMS to treat AUD+mTBI by determining which multi-modal neuroimaging metrics are most&#xD;
      strongly associated with both alcohol-related characteristics and functional disability. Aim&#xD;
      2 will [test preliminary efficacy of high-frequency rTMS administered over the customized&#xD;
      neural targets] to treat functional disability among Veterans with AUD+mTBI. Aim 3 will&#xD;
      assess sustainability of rTMS effects on functional disability for Veterans with AUD+mTBI.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that for Veterans with AUD+mTBI, there are neural substrates of&#xD;
      AUD related to functional disability, and that neuromodulation of these substrates will be&#xD;
      related to gains in functional disability. The investigators' innovative approach represents&#xD;
      an advancement in the field of neurorehabilitation because a neural target will be&#xD;
      systematically defined, using multi-modal neuroimaging, prior to preliminary rTMS efficacy&#xD;
      and sustainability testing. These steps are necessary to customize rTMS treatment for a&#xD;
      population of Veterans with co-occurring conditions and unique health care needs. Thus, the&#xD;
      outcomes of this research will optimize function for Veterans with AUD+mTBI.&#xD;

PLACEBO and ACTIVE rTMS will be delivered with the Magventure MagProX100 with MagOption stimulator and Magpro Cool Coil B65 A/P, which can be switched to active or placebo (A/P). The PLACEBO rTMS looks, sounds, and feels like ACTIVE rTMS. Each rTMS treater will be assigned a specific site of stimulation (Group 1, 2, 3, or 4) and will be blinded to the anatomical location of the other 3 sites. rTMS treaters and assessment administrators will be different people for each participant.</masking_description>
