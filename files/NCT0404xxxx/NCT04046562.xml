  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric weight management efficacy is impacted by failure to complete treatment protocols&#xD;
      and, for those that do complete treatment, a return to unhealthy behaviors. This project&#xD;
      tests whether treating pain, a common comorbid condition to pediatric obesity, will enhance&#xD;
      treatment. This study will generate results that can be translated into immediate&#xD;
      improvements in care for families seeking treatment for pediatric obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a major public health crisis in the United States, affecting 16.9% of&#xD;
      youth aged 2-19 and 20.5% of youth aged 12-19. While current family-based interventions are&#xD;
      effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) in adolescents; the majority of adolescents&#xD;
      regain their excess weight within 2 years. In addition, there is a high rate of drop out from&#xD;
      weight management programs, with 27% to 73% of families not completing the full treatment&#xD;
      protocol. One possible mechanism influencing pediatric weight management outcomes is chronic&#xD;
      pain. Although chronic pain affects 25 to 46% of all youth, among youth with obesity, the&#xD;
      prevalence is upwards of 70%. The causal relationship between pain and obesity is not well&#xD;
      understood. In some cases, chronic pain may be a precipitant that causes youth to develop&#xD;
      obesity by limiting their activities or altering their eating habits. A more common scenario&#xD;
      is that obesity places mechanical stresses on the body that can cause pain. With time, pain&#xD;
      may become &quot;centralized.&quot; Either mechanism may impact youth's participation in a weight&#xD;
      management program. However, interventions that address the relationship between chronic pain&#xD;
      and obesity in youth are needed, yet no such interventions exist. We expect that co-treating&#xD;
      these conditions -obesity and pain- rather than treating just the obesity, will lead to&#xD;
      improved pediatric weight management outcomes. The proposed study will take place at the&#xD;
      Pediatric Obesity Center at Connecticut Children's Medical Center (CCMC), as an adjunct to&#xD;
      our Fit5 program. Fit5 is CCMC's family-based, group weight management treatment program for&#xD;
      youth between the ages of 10-18. Consisting of 13 sessions, this multidisciplinary program&#xD;
      focuses on behavior changes, nutrition education and physical activity within a cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) framework. A brief 4 session adjunctive CBT intervention, Pain and&#xD;
      Weight treatment (PAW), will be trialed in a group of youth entering weight management&#xD;
      treatment and endorsing musculoskeletal pain. This will be done in three phases. First a&#xD;
      focus group will be held to review the PAW curriculum which has already been created for this&#xD;
      study. In phase two, a small randomized (n = 25 per condition) controlled trial (RCT) will be&#xD;
      conducted to pilot PAW. Finally, exit interviews to obtain preliminary feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and retention data on PAW as compared to an information only control condition&#xD;
      will be conducted. There is much work that continues to be needed to improve treatment for&#xD;
      youth with obesity. The findings of this study will advance a line of research much needed to&#xD;
      better understand outcomes and treatment for adolescents with obesity by shifting from&#xD;
      focusing on obesity as an independent condition, and instead, treating it in the context of&#xD;
      its comorbid conditions that may be important determinants of engagement, adherence, and&#xD;
      outcomes. This proposal will focus on pain and obesity as a model with the intention that&#xD;
      this could expand to other comorbidities such as sleep disturbances. The pilot data obtained&#xD;
      through this R21 grant proposal will be used to modify the intervention and to seek R01&#xD;
      funding to support a large scale RCT of PAW.&#xD;
