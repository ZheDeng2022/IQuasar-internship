  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a procedure that has been shown to improve pain in&#xD;
      chronic sufferers. It is a well-tolerated procedure that can be performed on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis. It uses a plastic covered coil that sends a magnetic pulse through the skull into the&#xD;
      brain and by targeting particular areas in the brain it can be used to help modulate the&#xD;
      perception of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intends to use this technique to treat such a disabling symptom in patients who&#xD;
      suffer from Parkinson's Disease (PD). Initially the aim is to study this technique in 48&#xD;
      patients who are suffering from pain and have PD. These patients would require an EEG before&#xD;
      and after the stimulation. The stimulation would be performed over ten sessions and the&#xD;
      patients would be assessed by a clinician using well recognized clinical tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that there will be a meaningful improvement in pain. It is also anticipated&#xD;
      that TMS is a safe technique to use in patients with PD. The study will be used to help plan&#xD;
      a future study that compares TMS with sham technique to prove whether TMS could be an option&#xD;
      in the treatment of such a disabling condition.&#xD;

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method that uses electromagnetic induction to produce electric currents in the cortex that are strong enough to depolarise neurons sufficiently to trigger action potentials. It is an outpatient based procedure that when used in conjunction with a neuro-navigation system, specific cortical areas can be targeted for greater accuracy and efficacy. In clinical studies, TMS is delivered as trains of pulses (repetitive TMS, rTMS) to prolong its effects. While the exact mechanism of TMS-induced analgesia is unknown, it is thought to regulate the activity of the complex cortical and subcortical networks involved in the processing of painful signals and possibly strengthening the endogenous descending pain modulation system</description>
