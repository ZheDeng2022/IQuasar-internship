  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a regular meditation and breath work practice&#xD;
      started before surgery and continued through post-surgical recovery can improve anxiety and&#xD;
      pain related to breast cancer and its treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women in the United States and the majority are managed&#xD;
      surgically as part of their primary treatment. Annually over 800 women at Hoag are treated&#xD;
      surgically for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety and fear are commonly associated with breast cancer diagnosis, with as many as 20% of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients suffering from full blown depressive disorder and 10% from an anxiety&#xD;
      disorder.(1) Mindfulness practices have demonstrated improvements in self reported well&#xD;
      being, reductions in stress and fatigue, reduced reactivity to distressing thoughts and&#xD;
      improvements in both sensory and affective pain components in a variety of chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions including arthritis and chronic pain syndromes. (2) Adoption of Mindfulness Based&#xD;
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) has shown improvements in psychological health for breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors, (3) but significant reductions in pain levels have not been demonstrated. The&#xD;
      limitations of MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) include significant time investment&#xD;
      for patients as well as time and cost of care providers and health care systems. The effect&#xD;
      of meditation and specific yogic breath work practices on pain has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid addiction is a growing social problem. In 2016 over 2 million Americans over the age&#xD;
      of 12 were estimated to suffer from addiction to prescription pain medications, leading to&#xD;
      over 20,000 overdose related deaths. (4) The majority of these patients were women. Indicated&#xD;
      use narcotic exposure has been reported as an initiation event for some patients in the&#xD;
      development of opioid addiction, with over 5% of patients who initiated prescription pain&#xD;
      medication at the time of surgery continuing to use the medications after the acute surgical&#xD;
      process has resolved. (5) We propose to study the effect of meditation and breath work&#xD;
      practice on the distress and perioperative pain of breast cancer patients undergoing primary&#xD;
      surgical treatment for breast cancer. The benefit of meditation and breath work practice over&#xD;
      standard MBSR practice includes lower burden on patients of time and therefore higher&#xD;
      potential cost effectiveness and long term sustainability of patients adopting and committing&#xD;
      to a regular practice. The breath work and specific meditation practices that will be taught&#xD;
      could be a novel method to address perioperative pain, plus improve management of anxiety and&#xD;
      stress during this period and beyond. If successful, this pre recorded meditation guidance&#xD;
      that patients can utilize in home practice could be a cost effective addition to improve&#xD;
      overall perioperative patient experience.&#xD;

    <measure>Will daily meditation change pain in undergoing primary surgical treatment for newly diagnosed breast cancer, utilizing the MD Anderson Cancer Center Brief Pain Inventory (short form)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline pain assessment will be administered after informed consent is obtained. One week before definitive breast cancer surgery research subjects will complete a one on one education session regarding meditation practice with a wellness coach (AW), and complete a baseline NCCN distress survey. They will begin a daily meditation practice.&#xD;
Two guided meditations will be provided to participants. They will be asked to meditate twice daily, once in the morning once before bed, for a total time of 12 minutes per day. Surgical treatment and postoperative care will be provided by surgeon preference and usual practice, including post-operative pain medications. For 12 weeks patients will maintain a daily meditation log, medication log and complete daily pain assessment questionnaire using the MD Anderson Cancer Center Brief Pain Inventory (short form)</description>
