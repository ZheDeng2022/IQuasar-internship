  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study investigating exhaled breath condensate analyses to&#xD;
      quantify the variability over time of various biomarkers associated with symptomatic&#xD;
      pneumonitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To quantify the intra-person variability of concentrations of TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-1α, and&#xD;
      IL-10 measured in exhaled breath condensate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the associations between differences in pre-treatment and post-treatment&#xD;
           exhaled breath condensate concentrations of TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-10 and the&#xD;
           development of CTCAE grade 2+ symptomatic pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the associations between serum measures of TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-10&#xD;
           and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled breath condensate measures of the same biomarkers, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The development of CTCAE grade 2+ symptomatic pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the association between microbiome signatures found in pre-treatment exhaled&#xD;
           breath condensate and the development of CTCAE grade 2+ symptomatic pneumonitis.&#xD;

    <description>Concentrations of TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-10 (ng/mL) will be measured in exhaled breath condensate at baseline, at 2 weeks and after chemotherapy start and 6 weeks after chemotherapy start (the end of chemotherapy) and 1 month after completion of chemotherapy using a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05 with detectable standard deviation units from baseline to post treatment.</description>

    <measure>Concentrations of Biomarkers in Exhaled Breath Condensate</measure>
    <time_frame>One month after completion of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-10 (ng/mL) measured in exhaled breath condensate to compare mean change levels from (baseline), at 2 weeks after CRT start, 6-weeks after CRT start (the end of CRT), and 1 month after completion of chemotherapy using t-tests comparing mean change levels in each marker.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentrations of Biomarkers in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>One month after completion of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>TGF-β1, IL-6, IL-1α, and IL-10 (ng/mL) will be used to determine what degree serum levels of biomarkers correlate with the same exhaled breath condensate biomarkers and how well they predict symptomatic pneumonitis. To examine the association between differences in pre-treatment and post-treatment exhaled breath condensate concentrations of biomarkers and development of symptomatic pneumonitis, investigators will conduct 2-group independent t-tests comparing mean change levels. Measured at (baseline), at 2 weeks after CRT start, 6-weeks after CRT start (the end of CRT), and 1 month after completion of chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Cluster analysis methods will be used to determine whether there is any association of any groups of patients who share similar marker profiles at baseline and post-chemotherapy, or change from pre- to post- for metabolic measures in developing symptomatic pneumonitis.</description>
