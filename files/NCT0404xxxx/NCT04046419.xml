      Providers and Impairment Relationship Scale HC (HC-PAIRS)'' developed by Dr Rainville.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Low back pain is one of the reasons for applying to health institutions. Low back pain, which&#xD;
      seriously affects patients' lives and leads to major financial losses, causes serious&#xD;
      deficiencies in both developing and developed countries. Health professionals' perception of&#xD;
      pain, factors associated with pain and fear avoidance attitudes of patients affect the&#xD;
      success of treatment. The aim of this study is to determine the Turkish version, validity and&#xD;
      reliability of ''Health Care Providers and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS)''. 165&#xD;
      physiotherapist working with chronic low back pain were included in the study. In order to&#xD;
      determine the reliability of the scale, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be&#xD;
      used to determine the level of the relationship between the results of the first and second&#xD;
      measurements. Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be used for homogeneity of the questions in&#xD;
      the scale. For concurrent validity, correlation coefficient will be used to determine the&#xD;
      agreement between the previously validated scales and the Turkish version of HC PAIRS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Care Providers' Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS) is a questionnaire for assessing the attitudes and beliefs of health care providers about functional expectations for CLBP patients.17 It consists of 15 statements rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;totally disagree&quot; to &quot;totally agree.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Turkish version of Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>TSK was used for the assessment of kinesiophobia. The items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1=definitely disagree, 4=completely agree) and the total score is between 17 and 68 points. Higher total score indicates higher level of kinesiophobia.</description>

    <measure>Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute.</time_frame>
    <description>This tool was developed to distinguish between biomedical and biopsychosocial orientations toward the treatment of low back pain in physiotherapists. The scale uses a 6-point Likert-type scale (1=definitely disagree, 6=definitely agree). Treatment orientation is measured on the biomedical (factor 1) and biopsychosocial (factor 2) subscales. Subscale scores are calculated by simply adding the scores corresponding to the selected response for each item. The subscale with the highest score indicates the respondent's dominant treatment orientation</description>
