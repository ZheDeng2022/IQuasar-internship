  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled (propofol) phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial. The study plans to enroll approximately 46 eligible subjects. Among them, 40&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to HSK3486 treatment group (30 cases) and propofol control&#xD;
      group (10 cases) in a ratio of 3:1. The subjects will be enrolled competitively at all study&#xD;
      sites. Upon enrollment of the 40 subjects, 6 more subjects will be enrolled by West China&#xD;
      Hospital of Sichuan University. These 6 subjects will not be randomized, but will directly&#xD;
      enter into propofol induction + HSK3486 maintenance group for study.&#xD;

The range of the initial maintenance dose is 1 (± 0.5) mg/kg/h, i.e. the minimum initial maintenance dose should not be less than 0.5 mg/kg/h, and the maximum should not be more than 1.5 mg/kg/h.</description>
