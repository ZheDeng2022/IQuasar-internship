      The aim of the present study is to assess the best echocardiographic parameters (GLS, GLS&#xD;
      rate and standard echocardiographic parameters) predicting LCOS in on-pump mitral surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) is a common complication in cardiac surgery after weaning&#xD;
      from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) associated with high morbidity and mortality. Its prompt&#xD;
      recognition and management may mitigate the effect of LCOS on the outcome. To date, advanced&#xD;
      age, prolonged CPB, urgent surgery and impaired left ventricular function assessed by left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are commonly considered strong predictors of&#xD;
      postoperative LCOS. Nevertheless, LVEF has several limitations including image quality,&#xD;
      operator experience, limited reproducibility, inter- and intra-observer discrepancy and&#xD;
      load/volume dependency. Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS), with automated speckle-tracking&#xD;
      echocardiography (STE) may overcome several of the LVEF limitations. In fact, while the LVEF&#xD;
      detects changes in left ventricular chamber volume, GLS reflects myocardial longitudinal&#xD;
      deformation due to contraction. The rate of myocardial deformation over time (expressed as&#xD;
      1/s) is called GLS Rate. Global Longitudinal Strain, mostly evaluated from transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography (TTE), has shown lower inter- and intra-observer variability, a better&#xD;
      reproducibility and prognostic value compared to LVEF in a generic cardiac population. In&#xD;
      addition the results of the GLS with TTE (GLS-TTE) may not be shifted in cardiac surgery due&#xD;
      to the effect of the general anesthesia (GA) and positive pressure ventilation. Thus, these&#xD;
      factors should be considered when the global longitudinal strain, evaluated from&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography (GLS-TEE) is used as predictor of early outcome. Amabili et&#xD;
      al. have shown that GLS-TEE is better than LVEF in predicting LCOS in a general cardiac&#xD;
      surgery population. Similarly Sonny et al. in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery for&#xD;
      stenosis have reported that a GLS-TEE and GLS-TEE Rate are superior to standard&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters in predicting a complicated course. To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, there are no studies investigating the role of intraoperative evaluation of&#xD;
      GLS-TEE and GLS-TEE Rate as predictors of LCOS in mitral valve surgery. In this setting LVEF&#xD;
      is not a reliable marker of cardiac function due to a systematic overestimation of the&#xD;
      ejection fraction. Moreover these patients are at high risk of postoperative cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction and LCOS owing to the afterload mismatch after mitral surgery. For the reasons&#xD;
      mentioned above, more effective predictors are advocated. In the present study we try to fill&#xD;
      the gap. Thus, aim of present study is to assess the role of GLS-TEE, GLS-TEE Rate and&#xD;
      standard echocardiographic parameters in predicting LCOS in on-pump mitral surgery. In doing&#xD;
      so, the best cut-off for each echocardiographic parameter will be provided. Finally to detect&#xD;
      the effect of the GA, the echocardiographic parameters calculated after the induction of GA&#xD;
      will be compared with those collected preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephonic follow-up will be performed at 30 days and 12-months investigating mortality and&#xD;
      rehospitalization due to heart failure.&#xD;
