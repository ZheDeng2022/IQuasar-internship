  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunotherapeutic activity of&#xD;
      cemiplimab in participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) on suppressive antiviral therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of up to three cemiplimab dose cohorts (n=10 participants each). The&#xD;
      cohorts will open sequentially, based on the safety of the previous cohort. Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      open first to examine the lowest dose. When Cohort 1 participants have completed study week&#xD;
      18 visit and there are no safety concerns, Cohort 2 will open for enrollment. A similar&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted with Cohort 2 to make a decision on opening Cohort 3. In each&#xD;
      cohort, participants enter the study 6 weeks prior to initiation of treatment. The 6-week&#xD;
      lead-in period is followed by a 6-week treatment period where two infusions of cemiplimab are&#xD;
      administered 6 weeks apart, at study weeks 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration per participant is 90 weeks, including 78 weeks of follow-up after&#xD;
      the treatment period. Study visit schedule includes visits at entry, and weeks 6, 7, 8, 10,&#xD;
      12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 24, 30, 36, 54, 72 and 90. Evaluations include: a medical and&#xD;
      medication history; assessment of HBV antiviral therapy adherence; physical exam; blood,&#xD;
      urine, and fecal collection; rectal swab; liver biopsy and fine needle aspiration; and&#xD;
      optional leukapheresis.&#xD;
