  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are a growing population, with projections to reach 83.7 million by 2050.&#xD;
      Furthermore, older adults are the most sedentary and least physically active adult&#xD;
      population. It is estimated that nearly 90% of older adults 65 years of age or older do not&#xD;
      meet the recommended levels of physical activity. Evidence suggests great health benefits can&#xD;
      be achieved for older adults who are the most sedentary, and that replacing sitting with even&#xD;
      light intensity walking can be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of the project is to develop an inexpensive and scalable tool to&#xD;
      increase volume of physical activity in our target population, older adults living in a&#xD;
      residential facility. MapTrek is a web-based application that allows participants to take a&#xD;
      virtual walk in interesting locations around the world while tracking their progress against&#xD;
      the progress of other older adults living in a retirement community. Steps are counted using&#xD;
      a commercially available accelerometer (e.g., Fitbit), and participants see their progress&#xD;
      overlaid on Google Maps.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be provided with a Fitbit activity monitor and instructed to wear it 24&#xD;
      hours/day (except for bathing/swimming time) on their wrist for 12 weeks. Participants will&#xD;
      participate in four team-based walking races, each two weeks long. Participants will view&#xD;
      their team progress on TV monitors placed in various locations at the Oaknoll facility. The&#xD;
      Oaknoll leadership has given the research team approval to do this at their facility. The&#xD;
      monitors will present aggregated team data and will not report any individual data that could&#xD;
      link back to the individual participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 8 week active intervention, research team members will meet with&#xD;
      participants at Oaknoll to administer an exit/process evaluation survey. The exit survey will&#xD;
      ask about psychosocial predictors of physical activity as well as participants thoughts and&#xD;
      opinions of the MapTrek game. This survey should take approximate 10-15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      The participants will then be asked to wear the Fitbit for four more weeks without playing&#xD;
      MapTrek, which will act as a control condition since this is a single-arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the efficacy of MapTrek for improving physical activity levels of older&#xD;
           adults living in a residential facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the efficacy of MapTrek for improving psychosocial outcomes(e.g.,&#xD;
           self-efficacy, social support, outcome expectations) among older adults living in a&#xD;
           residential facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the acceptability of MapTrek among older adults living in a residential&#xD;
           facility.&#xD;
