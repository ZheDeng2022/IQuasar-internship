      CC-90010-GBM-001 is a multi-center, open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and CNS penetration of CC-90010 following short-term interval therapy&#xD;
      (4 daily doses ) prior to surgery, in subjects with progressive or recurrent WHO Grade II&#xD;
      Diffuse Astrocytoma, Grade III Anaplastic Astrocytoma and recurrent Glioblastoma who have&#xD;
      failed radiation and chemotherapy, and who are candidates for surgical tumor resection as&#xD;
      part of their salvage regimen (planned salvage resection).&#xD;
