  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well Vyxeos works in treating patients&#xD;
      with intermediate and high-risk acute myeloid leukemia who have failed an initial cycle of&#xD;
      standard cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy. Vyxeos is a combination of both&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin contained in a liposome. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Cytarabine and daunorubicin given together in liposomes may have fewer&#xD;
      side effects and work better than cytarabine and daunorubicin given alone in patients with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate the safety and estimate the efficacy of liposome-encapsulated&#xD;
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (Vyxeos) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who have failed to&#xD;
      achieve a hypocellular marrow after an initial course of 7+3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AND/OR EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determination of rate of morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS). II. Determination of&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Mass cytometric measurement relative clearance of quiescent leukemia stem/repopulating&#xD;
      cells (LSCs) and blasts as compared to the same patient's preceding cycle of 7+3 and to a&#xD;
      separate control population receiving re-induction with traditional 7+3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Measurement of blast cell cycle fraction before and after Vyxeos treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIb. Relative clearance immunophenotypically abnormal blast and stem cells after Vyxeos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIc. Comparison of efficacy of blast cell and LSC elimination in patients receiving Vyxeos&#xD;
      re-induction compared to similar blast cells and LSCs in patients receiving standard 7+3 or&#xD;
      5+2 re-induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14-26 days after the start of previous cycle of chemotherapy, patients receive&#xD;
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1,&#xD;
      3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 60 days, then at&#xD;
      least monthly for 2 years.&#xD;
