    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide data that will assess the role of ventilatory&#xD;
      chemosensitivity (respiratory drive) in determining postoperative respiratory depression due&#xD;
      to opioids. In a group of patients requiring surgery and admission to hospital, before&#xD;
      surgery, ventilatory chemosensitivity will be assessed in the presence or absence of an&#xD;
      infusion of remifentanil. Parameters will be correlated with ventilatory depression events&#xD;
      after surgery. A secondary aim is to determine whether respiratory depression is more likely&#xD;
      during specific phases of sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low respiratory drive is predictive of opioid-induced respiratory depression as defined by&#xD;
      end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) &gt;50 mmHg, ventilation &lt;20% below baseline or pulse oximeter reading&#xD;
      (SpO2) &lt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory depression is more likely during certain sleep stages, specifically slow wave&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Drive. Before surgery each patient's hypercapnic ventilatory response under&#xD;
      conditions of mild hypoxia and mild hyperoxia. Using this technique, the patient first&#xD;
      voluntarily hyperventilates to a PETCO2 value of 20-25 mmHg, then undergoes a rebreathing&#xD;
      test allowing the PCO2 to rise to 55-60 mmHg while end-tidal PO2 (PETO2) is maintained at 150&#xD;
      mmHg. The procedure is then repeated with PETO2 clamped at 50 mmHg. Parameters derived from&#xD;
      this method include slopes of the ventilatory response during hyperoxia and hypoxia. The&#xD;
      slope during mild hypoxia is felt to be an index of peripheral chemoreceptor function, while&#xD;
      the hyperoxic slope is more indicative of central respiratory drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These two maneuvers will then be repeated during an infusion of the ultra-short acting&#xD;
      opioid, remifentanil. Remifentanil will be administered to achieve a specified effect site&#xD;
      concentration selected to produce a 30% decrease in ventilation using a standard&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic model implemented on a widely-used shareware program (TIVATrainer,&#xD;
      www.eurosaver.eu). Recovery from ventilatory depression occurs within 10 minutes of&#xD;
      discontinuation of the infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Test. During a night before surgery a sleep test based on peripheral arterial tone will&#xD;
      be performed at home (WatchPAT™, Itamar Medical, Franklin, MA) and will provide a formal&#xD;
      measure of obstructive sleep apnea. This test requires only a device mounted on a finger that&#xD;
      assesses SpO2 and peripheral tone, and an accelerometer on the chest to assess breathing&#xD;
      movements. Respiratory indices calculated using this technology correlates with those&#xD;
      calculated from standard polysomnography. The same testing will be used postoperatively from&#xD;
      the time the patient enters the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) until the following morning.&#xD;
      Recording of the same variables will then continue: inter-breath interval, respiratory minute&#xD;
      volume (using an electrical impedance device: ExSpiron™, Respiratory Motion, Waltham, MA),&#xD;
      abdominal strain gauge recording, transcutaneous PCO2 (SenTec, Fenton, MO), and sleep&#xD;
      measures. The data stream will then be divided into 5 minute epochs. During each epoch the&#xD;
      sleep state (awake, stages 1-4 slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep), opioid&#xD;
      consumption, respiratory variables and apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) will be assessed. Subjects&#xD;
      will have the option to opt in or out of participation in the overnight sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Pulse Oximetry. For the entire postoperative period until discharge we will record&#xD;
      opioid consumption and SpO2/heart rate using a wrist oximeter (WristOx™, Nonin Medical,&#xD;
      Plymouth, MN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative parameters of respiratory depression include hypercapnia (transcutaneous PCO2),&#xD;
      hypoxemia, apneas, low respiratory minute volume and sleep state.&#xD;
