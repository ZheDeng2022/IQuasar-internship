    <textblock>
      The aims of this proposal are to (1) examine the feasibility of providing a training course&#xD;
      of Auricular Point Acupressure (APA) for clinical oncology nurses who can integrate APA into&#xD;
      real-world nursing care settings and (2) examine the effectiveness of APA on cancer-related&#xD;
      pain (CRP) under the usual conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cancer-related pain (CRP) is considered one of the most challenging symptoms that cancer&#xD;
      patients experience. Opioid use is the most common strategy to manage pain. However,&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments are associated with a variety of adverse side effects, including&#xD;
      drowsiness, constipation, dry mouth, and the potential for addiction. As a result, up to 52%&#xD;
      of cancer patients do not receive adequate analgesic medication. The high prevalence of pain&#xD;
      and ineffective CRP management highlight the limitations of current CRP strategies. An&#xD;
      effective, nonpharmacological patient-managed strategy-that has potential to provide quick&#xD;
      and low-cost pain relief without new side effects-is an essential next step to manage CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auricular point acupressure (APA), a non-invasive and nonpharmacological patient-managed&#xD;
      strategy, can be an innovative solution for CRP. APA is derived from Chinese Medicine and is&#xD;
      different from auricular acupuncture, which is an invasive (using needles) and passive&#xD;
      treatment (administered by a licensed practitioner). APA is a non-invasive and active&#xD;
      treatment for patients with pain and other symptoms. It involves needleless, acupuncture-like&#xD;
      stimulation of ear points. Small seeds are taped on specific ear points for stimulation by&#xD;
      patients. Once the seeds have been taped on the patient's ear by the skilled provider, the&#xD;
      patient is able to co-manage patient's treatment at home. APA is popular in Taiwan, China,&#xD;
      and Europe. Though its use is limited in the U.S., a limited number of clinical trials have&#xD;
      supported APA. To achieve pain relief, the participant presses on the seeds to stimulate ear&#xD;
      points three times daily, three minutes per time, for a total of nine minutes per day. APA&#xD;
      provides pain relief within 1-2 minutes after ear stimulation and also sustains pain relief&#xD;
      for one month after a 4-week APA intervention. The rapid pain relief makes APA an attractive&#xD;
      strategy to manage CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' team has conducted a series of APA studies among patients with (1) chronic&#xD;
      low back pain, (2) aromatase inhibitor musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS), (3) persistent&#xD;
      post-mastectomy pain, and (4) chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN). All of the&#xD;
      investigators' pilot studies demonstrated better than a clinically significant pain reduction&#xD;
      (30% reduction) after 4 weeks of APA and sustained effects for 1-month. Significant plasma&#xD;
      inflammatory changes (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor α, and IFNγ) were found after&#xD;
      4 weeks, indicating that APA may affect brain macrophage-cells resulting in inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines alterations, leading to sustained pain relief at 1-month follow-up. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, the investigators believe APA would be particularly suitable to reduce CRP. More&#xD;
      importantly, easy implementation of APA and its immediate and lasting pain relief can empower&#xD;
      and motivate cancer patients to adhere to APA treatment and allows patients to engage other&#xD;
      forms of pain intervention, such as maintaining and/or increasing physical activity as a&#xD;
      by-product of improved analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses are the patient's first line of support in managing CRP; however, nurses have limited&#xD;
      tools available to accomplish this. The most common treatments that nurses have at nurses'&#xD;
      disposal are the usage of analgesics or referrals to specialty consultations. Once patients&#xD;
      are referred, the role of nurses as cohesive guides and caretakers is often lost. To address&#xD;
      this dilemma, patients and nurses need access to a therapy that can quickly relieve the pain,&#xD;
      which, in turn, reduces the analgesic use and encourages patients and nurses to engage in&#xD;
      other pain interventions. Due to the non-invasive characteristic of APA, nurses can learn APA&#xD;
      and incorporate it into nurses' practice to provide pain relief and augment the effects of&#xD;
      other pain interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this proposal are to (1) examine the feasibility of providing a training course&#xD;
      of APA for clinical oncology nurses which can integrate APA into real-world nursing care&#xD;
      settings and (2) examine the effectiveness of APA on CRP under the usual conditions.&#xD;
