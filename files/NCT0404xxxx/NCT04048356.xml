      This is a randomized controlled trial to determine if there is a difference between&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine vaginal preparations for urogynecological surgery&#xD;
      post operative infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether there is a difference&#xD;
      in efficacy of two of the most common commercially available vaginal surgical preparations.&#xD;
      The first objective is to determine whether chlorhexidine gluconate is non-inferior to&#xD;
      povidone iodine with respect to post-operative infections including urinary tract infections&#xD;
      (both culture proven and empirically treated) and surgical site infections (as defined by the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control). The second objective is to determine whether chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate is non-inferior to povidone iodine with respect to vulvar and vaginal irritation.&#xD;
