        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Escalation Cohorts: Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced malignant&#xD;
             solid tumor that is refractory to or intolerant of all standard therapy or for which&#xD;
             no standard therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Expansion and 1000 mg BID Dose Escalation Cohorts: Individuals must have&#xD;
             available sufficient and adequate formalin fixed tumor sample preferably from a biopsy&#xD;
             of a tumor lesion obtained either at the time of or after the diagnosis of advanced&#xD;
             disease has been made and from a site not previously irradiated. Alternatively,&#xD;
             individuals must agree to have a biopsy taken prior to entering the study to provide&#xD;
             adequate tissue. For the 1000 mg BID dose escalation cohort, individuals with&#xD;
             melanoma, Merkel cell, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers, and classical&#xD;
             Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) are not required to have archival or fresh biopsy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Escalation Biopsy Substudy and 1000 mg BID Dose Escalation Cohorts: Documented&#xD;
             ligand 1 of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1) expression in the tumor (tumor&#xD;
             proportion score (TPS) ≥ 10% or combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10). In the 1000 mg&#xD;
             BID Cohort, PD-L1 expression will not be required for Merkel cell, melanoma, MSI-H&#xD;
             cancers, and cHL.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor would pose a risk to individual&#xD;
             safety or interfere with the study evaluations, procedures, or completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Escalation Cohorts: History of ≥ Grade 3 Adverse Events (AEs) during prior&#xD;
             treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or history of discontinuation of&#xD;
             treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor due to AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dose Escalation 1000 mg BID and Dose Expansion Cohort: Prior treatment with an immune&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti- ligand 2 of programmed cell&#xD;
             death protein 1 (PD-L2) antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease (for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with&#xD;
             antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, Sjögren's syndrome, Bell's palsy,&#xD;
             Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, vasculitis,&#xD;
