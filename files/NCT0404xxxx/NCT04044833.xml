      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of training given to obese female students&#xD;
      in mid-adolescence period for improving nutrition, physical activity, and menstrual symptoms&#xD;
      on the improvement of their healthy lifestyle behaviors and menstrual symptoms. The research&#xD;
      sample consisted of 128 obese female students divided into groups as intervention and&#xD;
      control. In this randomized controlled trial, pretest-posttest control group and random&#xD;
      process were used. In the first stage of the study, total of 12 hours of training, 120&#xD;
      minutes for each course per week, was provided. In the second stage, 120 minutes of&#xD;
      reinforcement training were given every month for three months. The study lasted 16 weeks&#xD;
      totally. Personal Information Form, Healthy Lifestyle Behavior Scale II (HLBS-II), Menstrual&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) and Student Follow-up Schedule were used as data collection&#xD;
      tools. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics 23 Version. Hypotheses were&#xD;
      (i) there was a difference between the total HLBS-II and MSQ scores of the students before&#xD;
      and after the training and (ii) there was a correlation between the scales.&#xD;

      Method The research was carried out as a randomized controlled trial to identify menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms and healthy lifestyle behaviors of obese adolescent girls and to determine the&#xD;
      effects of planned trainings given to them for improving nutrition, physical activity, and&#xD;
      menstrual symptoms on the improvement of their healthy lifestyle behaviors and menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses: H1: There is a difference between the mean scores of Healthy Lifestyle&#xD;
      Behavior Scale II (HLBS-II) and H2: Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire (MSQ) before and after&#xD;
      the trainings given to obese adolescent girls. H3: There is a correlation between the mean&#xD;
      scores of HLBS-II and MSQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and data collection tools: The study was carried out in three state high&#xD;
      schools providing full-time education in a district of Ankara on September 1, 2017-January&#xD;
      21, 2018 and included 128 obese female students who accepted to participate voluntarily.&#xD;
      These schools were chosen because the number of students was high and there were students&#xD;
      from different socioeconomic levels. The study was approved by Yıldırım Beyazıt University&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (decision numbered 12.04.2017/15 and coded 522). We obtained corporate&#xD;
      permission from Ankara Provincial Directorate of National Education and informed consents of&#xD;
      the students and their parents. Personal Information Form, HLBS-II, MSQ, and Student&#xD;
      Follow-up Schedule, which were created by the researcher in accordance with the literature,&#xD;
      were used as data collection tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Information Form was prepared by examining the literature on the relevant age group&#xD;
      to examine the demographic, nutritional, physical activity, and menstrual characteristics of&#xD;
      the participants.10,11,14,16-19,22,23 Student Follow-up Schedule was developed for the&#xD;
      students to record their menstrual pain and symptoms, weight and body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      measurements during the specified periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire was developed by Chesney and Tasto to assess menstrual pain&#xD;
      and symptoms in 1975, and the usability of the questionnaire on adolescents was assessed by&#xD;
      Negriff et al.24 and they updated the questionnaire in 2009. In 2013, Güvenç et al.24&#xD;
      conducted the reliability and validity study. Following the adaptation process, the&#xD;
      questionnaire was prepared as 5-point Likert type and to involve 22 items. The MSQ score is&#xD;
      calculated by taking the average of the total scores of the items in the scale. The increase&#xD;
      in the mean score indicates that the severity of menstrual symptoms increases. The Cronbach's&#xD;
      Alpha value of the scale is 0.86. In our study, it was found to be 0.91 and 0.92 before and&#xD;
      after the trainings, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Lifestyle Behavior Scale II (HLSB-II): The scale was developed by Walker et al.25 in&#xD;
      1987 and updated in 1996 and named as Healthy Lifestyle Behavior Scale II. Bahar et al.26&#xD;
      studied the validity and reliability of its Turkish version in 2008. The 4-point Likert type&#xD;
      scale consists of 52 items. Cronbach's Alpha value of the scale is 0.92. In our study, the&#xD;
      Cronbach's Alpha value of the scale was found to be 0.91 and 0.92 before and after the&#xD;
      trainings, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and control groups: The study population covers all female high school students.&#xD;
      Study sample: In accordance with BMI-for-Age Percentile for Girls (kg/m2) determined by WHO,2&#xD;
      the study population was determined via two stages and consisted of volunteer female obese&#xD;
      students aged 14 (BMI 26,7), 15 (BMI&gt; 27,6) and 16 years (BMI&gt; 28,2), who were currently at&#xD;
      ninth, 10th and 11th grade in high school. In the first stage, BMIs, heights, and weights of&#xD;
      1300 female students who participated in the study voluntarily were measured and the students&#xD;
      who met the criteria were included in the study. In the second stage, students, who agreed to&#xD;
      participate in training and monitoring, were determined and they were, then, randomly divided&#xD;
      into two groups, namely intervention (n=63) and control (n=65) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steps in the Implementation Phase are as follows: a) Sampling: measuring the BMIs,&#xD;
      heights, and weights of 1300 female students, determining the sample group, and obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent from them and their parents; b) Before the Training: applying Personal&#xD;
      Information Form, HLBS-II, and MSQ to the intervention and control groups determined randomly&#xD;
      and distributing the Student Follow-up Schedules; c) Providing trainings to the intervention&#xD;
      group; d) Monitoring the weights, BMIs, and menstrual symptoms of intervention and control&#xD;
      groups; and e) After the Training: Applying HLBS-II and MSQ scales to intervention and&#xD;
      control groups, collecting the follow-up schedules, and providing training to the control&#xD;
      group and all other students. Trainings: First stage: 120 minutes basic training per week for&#xD;
      four weeks (40 minutes on diet, 40 minutes on physical activity, and 40 minutes on menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms) . Second stage: Reinforcement trainings of 120 minutes were given once a month for&#xD;
      three months. Periodic follow-up of intervention and control groups was carried out by&#xD;
      recording their BMIs (Tanita BC 730 branded calibrated professional body analyzer was used to&#xD;
      determine weight and BMI , which were measured three times in three periods) and menstrual&#xD;
      symptoms ( participants were asked to mark Menstrual Pain and Symptoms in the first three&#xD;
      days of menstruation in five periods) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Data was analyzed by using SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0&#xD;
      (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Descriptive data was&#xD;
      compared using Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U tests, while Wilcoxon's and McNemar's tests were&#xD;
      used to compare the menstruation findings of the students before and after the training.&#xD;
      Dependent Samples t-Test was used in the intragroup comparison of total HLBS-II, MSQ, and&#xD;
      sub-dimension scores. Comparison of differences between groups was performed by using the&#xD;
      Independent Samples t-Test. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the&#xD;
      relationship between total HLBS-II and MSQ scores.&#xD;
