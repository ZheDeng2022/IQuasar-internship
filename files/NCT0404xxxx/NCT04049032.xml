      To compare maternal and newborn outcomes among pregnant women with OUD receiving care via&#xD;
      telemedicine versus in-person.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: Pregnant women with OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants were seen weekly for four weeks, every two weeks for four weeks&#xD;
      and monthly thereafter and provided relapse-prevention therapy and buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A cohort derived from a prospectively collected database including 98 women receiving&#xD;
      perinatal OUD treatment in an obstetric practice by telemedicine or in-person and followed&#xD;
      until 6-8 weeks postpartum from September, 2017 to December, 2018. Logistic regression with&#xD;
      propensity score adjustment was applied to reduce group selection bias and control for&#xD;
      potentially confounding variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Four outpatient obstetric practices in the southeast.&#xD;
