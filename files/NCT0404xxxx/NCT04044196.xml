    <textblock>
      The occurrence of a postoperative frozen shoulder after tendon repair of the rotator cuff of&#xD;
      the shoulder is a devastating complication. It causes stiffness and slows down recovering. It&#xD;
      associates a synovitis and a capsular retraction generating a transient but very&#xD;
      incapacitating passive and active joint stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of capsulitis occurs in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first phase or cold phase is distinguished mainly by pain. The stiffness settles&#xD;
           gradually. This phase lasts 2 to 9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second phase or frozen phase lasting 4 to 12 months, the pain is less severe, but&#xD;
           the rigidity is substantial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the third phase, the function is gradually recovered and the pain disappears. This&#xD;
           phase can last up to two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients will get back full mobility of their shoulder in 12 to 18 months, while others&#xD;
      may have persistent symptoms for several months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopedic Sports Medicine&#xD;
      recently codified the clinical diagnosis: active anterior elevation less than 100 °, external&#xD;
      rotation elbow to body less than 10 °, internal rotation less than L5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So if the diagnosis is better codified , prevention is the main concern. Some etiologies have&#xD;
      been clearly identified. Systemic etiologies are reported: diabetes, thyroid pathologies,&#xD;
      Dupuytren's disease and other factors such as ipsilateral breast surgery and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological predispositions have long been suggested as risk factors for capsulitis, but a&#xD;
      significant relationship has not been clearly established. The fear of having pain or an&#xD;
      apathetic temperament could lead to a stay of the pains and curb the reeducation. In 1953,&#xD;
      Coventry already evoked a &quot;so called periarthritic personality&quot; associating apathy, muscle&#xD;
      contractures and a threshold of low pain. In 2014, De Beer investigated whether personality&#xD;
      traits favored the occurrence of a retractable capsule primary or secondary to surgery but&#xD;
      did not identify specific personality significantly more prone to stiffening of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the fear of pain during movement or kinesiophobia and the avoidance behaviors&#xD;
      generated are known factors in the persistence of pain and chronic limitations of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to determine whether preoperative anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      kinesiophobia are risk factors for retractile capsulitis after arthroscopic rotator cuff&#xD;
      repair to best support these patients. patients postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that there is a psychological ground predisposing to the postoperative&#xD;
      occurrence of a retractile capsulitis of the shoulder.&#xD;
