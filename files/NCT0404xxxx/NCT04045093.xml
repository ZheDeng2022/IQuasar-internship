  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrythmia encountered in&#xD;
      clinical practice and patients suffer from this are at increased risk of ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      systemic thromboembolism due to the formation and embolism of left atrial thrombi. Current&#xD;
      international guidelines recommend non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke&#xD;
      prevention amongst these patients with non-valvular AF at significant ischemic stroke risk,&#xD;
      given the superior safety and comparable efficacy of NOACs over warfarin. However, warfarin&#xD;
      therapy remains in the stroke prevention strategy for AF patients with mitral stenosis (MS)&#xD;
      as NOACs lack of evidence for safety and efficacy amongst this group of patients. A local&#xD;
      study is initiated to compare and evaluate the safety and efficacy among the two groups of&#xD;
      anticoagulants - NOACs and traditional Warfarin therapy - in AF patients with underlying&#xD;
      moderate to severe MS.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the stroke risk amongst AF patients appears heterogeneous, patients with underlying&#xD;
      valvular heart diseases particularly MS are at very high risk for stroke if left&#xD;
      un-anticoagulated. However, this group of patients were typically excluded in randomized&#xD;
      control trials. As a result, current international guidelines for management of AF do not&#xD;
      recommend NOACs for stroke prevention in AF patients with underlying moderate or severe MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a stark contrast to developed countries, mitral stenosis remains prevalent in many Asian&#xD;
      countries. Together with the much higher intracranial haemorrhage risk in Asians on Warfarin,&#xD;
      NOACs appear to be a very attractive and promising alternative. Nonetheless off-label use of&#xD;
      NOACs in patients with MS is not uncommon in the real world practice. This study refers as a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, open-label trial with blinded end-point adjudication, aiming at&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dabigatran for stroke prevention in AF patients with&#xD;
      underlying moderate or severe mitral stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in this study will be randomized into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio, to receive&#xD;
      either Dabigatran (150mg or 110mg according to creatinine clearance level, twice daily) or&#xD;
      Warfarin (targeting in the international normalized ratio (INR) range 2-3) in an open-label&#xD;
      design. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed, including ischemic stroke, systemic&#xD;
      embolism, haemorrhagic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, major bleeding and death. The&#xD;
      estimated sample size is approximately 686 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will contribute to the stroke prevention strategy for patients with mitral&#xD;
      stenosis and may be immediately translatable to real clinical practice. Ultimately, this&#xD;
      study will provide the necessary evidence for establishing universal guidelines for this&#xD;
      group of patients.&#xD;
