  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Researchers have found a new way to treat cancer. The therapy used in this study&#xD;
      is called E7 TCR T cell therapy. This therapy is a type of treatment in which a participant s&#xD;
      T cells (a type of immune system white blood cell) are changed in the laboratory to attack&#xD;
      cancer cells. This treatment might help people with human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer. Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer that happens in&#xD;
      the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth, including the soft palate,&#xD;
      the base of the tongue and the tonsils). Certain types of the HPV virus can cause this kind&#xD;
      of cancer and this study is looking at those cause by HPV-16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of this study is to find out if injecting E7 TCR T cells directly into&#xD;
      cancer tumor(s) can be done without delaying standard treatment for stage I oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer, which may include surgery or radiation therapy with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: People aged 18 and older with borderline resectable or unresectable Stage I,&#xD;
      HPV-16 associated oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will be screened with HLA typing (a blood test needed for eligibility)&#xD;
      and HPV testing of the cancer tumor (to determine if the cancer is HPV-16 positive). A new&#xD;
      biopsy may be needed if tumor from an outside location is not available for HPV testing.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will come to the NIH campus to have a screening evaluation which will&#xD;
      include physical exam, review of medical history and current medications, blood and heart&#xD;
      tests, imaging (X-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET scan), and evaluation of participant s veins that&#xD;
      are used for drawing blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is eligible for the study based on the screening evaluation, they will&#xD;
      have a baseline evaluation prior to receiving the experimental treatment which may include&#xD;
      additional laboratory or imaging tests. A biopsy of the primary tumor may be performed before&#xD;
      getting the cell injection and approximately 4 weeks after the cell injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a large IV catheter inserted into a vein to undergo a procedure called&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is the removal of the blood by a machine to collect specific&#xD;
      white blood cells. The remaining blood is returned to the body. This procedure is needed to&#xD;
      collect the cells that will be modified to target the cancer. The cells are grown in the lab&#xD;
      and given back to the participant through an injection into the participant's tumor. It takes&#xD;
      11-15 days to grow the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the cells are ready, participants will receive an injection of E7 TCR T cells directly&#xD;
      into the primary tumor and any lymph nodes that can be seen or felt on physical exam. The&#xD;
      injection will be done in the clinic or the operating room and may require general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Participants will recover in the hospital until they are well enough to go home,&#xD;
      which will be about 1-2 days after the cell injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits starting 2 weeks after cell injection. These will be&#xD;
      visits to monitor the safety of the treatment and to evaluate the response of the cancer to&#xD;
      the treatment. If the cancer appears to be growing at the 2-week visit, participants will go&#xD;
      back to their local doctor for further care. If the cancer is not growing, participants will&#xD;
      return for another follow-up visit 4 weeks after cell injection to see how the cancer is&#xD;
      responding. Regardless of whether the cancer is shrinking or not, all participants will be&#xD;
      referred to their home physician for further care after the 4-week visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving cell therapy, participants will be followed on a long-term gene therapy&#xD;
      protocol. Participants will have blood drawn periodically to test if the cells have grown or&#xD;
      changed. These blood tests will take place immediately before the cells, and then at 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      months for the first year and then annually. These tests can be drawn locally and sent to the&#xD;
      NIH. Participants will be asked to return to the NIH annually for a physical examination for&#xD;
      5 years after they receive the cell injection. If participants are not able, to return to the&#xD;
      NIH annually, they may be contacted at home and asked to have records sent from their local&#xD;
      doctor. After that time, participants will be asked to fill -out a questionnaire for the next&#xD;
      ten years, for a total follow-up period of 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human papillomavirus (HPV)+ oropharyngeal cancer is an increasingly common type of&#xD;
           cancer that frequently affects young patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the prognosis of early-stage cancer is favorable, the treatments can result in&#xD;
           significant life-long morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neoadjuvant therapy is an active area of investigation. The goal of neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
           in this setting is to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and permit the study of de-&#xD;
           intensified definitive treatment of early-stage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E7 TCR T cells have demonstrated safety and clinical activity in treatment-refractory&#xD;
           metastatic HPV+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the feasibility of intratumoral injection of E7 TCR T cells as neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy for borderline resectable and unresectable stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with borderline resectable or&#xD;
      unresectable stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II, single arm, feasibility study of neoadjuvant E7 TCR T cell therapy&#xD;
           for borderline resectable and unresectable stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive intratumoral injection of E7 TCR T cells into the primary tumor&#xD;
           and involved regional lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will not receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen or systemic aldesleukin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be referred for definitive standard of care therapy following completion&#xD;
           of protocol therapy&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed stage I (AJCC 8th edition) oropharyngeal&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma that has not been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HPV16+ tumor and HLA-A*02:01+ HLA type (p16+ by THC and HLA-A*02 is also acceptable&#xD;
             for enrollment but not for treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Borderline/marginally resectable or unresectable oropharyngeal cancer. Resectability&#xD;
             will be determined by the referring physician and confirmed by otolaryngologists at&#xD;
             the NTH (confirmation is not needed for enrollment but is required prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by RECTST v1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient age greater than 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of E7 TCR T cells in patients &lt;18 years of age,&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to&#xD;
             60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 X institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients&#xD;
                  with creatinine levels above institutional normal (calculated by the Chronic&#xD;
                  Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential are defined as all women who are not post-menopausal or who&#xD;
             have not had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the age of&#xD;
             55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of E7 TCR T cells on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (intrauterine device, hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence, tubal ligation or vasectomy) prior to study entry and for up to 4 months&#xD;
             after treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she&#xD;
             or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen and hepatitis C antibody. If hepatitis C antibody&#xD;
             test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the presence of antigen by&#xD;
             RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to participate in Gene Therapy Long Term Follow-up Protocol&#xD;
             (20-C-0051), which will follow patients for up to 15 years per Food and Drug&#xD;
             Administration (FDA) requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations at the time of treatment that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR T cells, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any form of systemic immunodeficiency, including acquired deficiency&#xD;
             such as HIV or primary immunodeficiency such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease, are ineligible. The experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol&#xD;
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may&#xD;
             be less responsive to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent systemic steroid therapy if greater than the equivalent of 5 mg prednisone&#xD;
             PO daily. Patients previously on steroids must be off steroids for four weeks prior to&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active cardiac ischemia or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
             are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a second active invasive cancer are not eligible if it may confound&#xD;
             assessment of response to the current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not have a physician to provide standard therapy post cellular&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
