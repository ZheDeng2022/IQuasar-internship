  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are potent teratogens associated with a spectrum of physical and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental anomalies to the exposed fetus. Particular risks include congenital&#xD;
      malformations, impaired motor and cognitive functioning, autism and poorer educational&#xD;
      attainment. Fetal exposure to drugs that bind to central nervous system targets as part of&#xD;
      their therapeutic effect (e.g. neurotransmitter receptors and neuronal channels) appear to&#xD;
      alter brain structure and function in both animal models and humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal magnetic resonance imaging offers an approach to investigate these effects in vivo,&#xD;
      identifying biomarkers, defining the onset of abnormalities and dose response. Fetal MRI may&#xD;
      offer risk stratification and identify patients that may benefit from intervention early in&#xD;
      development. The overall aim of this study is to contribute to improving developmental&#xD;
      outcomes following the inevitable exposure during treatment of maternal epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel study aims to explore the central nervous system with state-of-the-art&#xD;
      non-invasive multimodal magnetic resonance imaging consistent with the University of&#xD;
      Nottingham Precision Imaging Beacon, so as to improve outcomes in patients at risk of long&#xD;
      term complex neuropsychiatric conditions.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND There are approximately 50 million people with epilepsy worldwide, with&#xD;
      approximately 3-5 births per thousand to women with epilepsy; in the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      there are 2500 births per year to women with epilepsy. The teratogenic effects of&#xD;
      anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) on the fetus is a major public health concern. In 2016 UK&#xD;
      national prescribing data showed around 18,000 women of child-bearing age were taking Sodium&#xD;
      Valproate. for which current evidence suggests has the most potent teratogenic effects of all&#xD;
      AEDs. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has formulated a&#xD;
      specific prevention programme aimed at reducing the rates of valproate-associated&#xD;
      teratogenicity. Longitudinal studies of fetal AED exposure show increased rates of congenital&#xD;
      malformations, abnormal motor development, lower intelligence quotient, and poorer&#xD;
      educational attainment. However, to date there is a major lack of research on the underlying&#xD;
      neuroanatomical basis for such alterations in cognitive function, whether pre or post-natal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early exposure to neuromodulatory drugs likely induces abnormalities in structural brain&#xD;
      development, neuromotor behaviour, and functional networks. Fetal MRI presents a novel&#xD;
      multimodal approach for interrogating the effects of pathological exposures, identify&#xD;
      biomarkers, define onset of abnormalities, and the dose response. This may aiding risk&#xD;
      stratification, identify candidates for earlier intervention, and improve neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited strategies available to the clinician to assess the risk to the fetus'&#xD;
      brain health. Current guidance recommends Ultrasound Scan (USS) to screen for physical&#xD;
      defects. However, USS is limited in its ability to comprehensively understand brain&#xD;
      development. Fetal MRI presents an advance that is of clinical utility to neurologists,&#xD;
      psychiatrists and obstetricians who routinely prescribe AEDs for a range of neurobiological&#xD;
      conditions. Advances in fetal MRI have identified biomarkers for disease that may guide&#xD;
      clinical management, and offers the potential of a multi-dimensional characterisation of the&#xD;
      developing nervous system by analysing brain structure, neuronal networks, expression of&#xD;
      metabolites and behavioural analysis, which may also provide the basis for long-term adverse&#xD;
      outcomes. A small unpublished case series from the Chief Investigator's doctoral study&#xD;
      elucidated several promising features of fetal MRI : (i) MRI confirms USS findings and can&#xD;
      improve the characterisation of brain structure; (ii) longitudinal in utero imaging is&#xD;
      feasible and sometimes necessary; (iii) brain anomalies are present and may be attributable&#xD;
      to exposure to AEDs; (iv) clinical management of pregnancies and the postnatal period is&#xD;
      directly impacted by fetal MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will undertake a pilot study using fetal MRI on 20 pregnant women with the aim of&#xD;
      developing a tool to further characterise in utero brain development. This is a pilot study&#xD;
      which will include 2 cohorts: women with epilepsy taking AEDs (WWE) (N=10), and age-matched&#xD;
      healthy pregnant controls (HC) with no known neurological disorder (N=10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS The aim of this study is to investigate the adverse neurological effects&#xD;
      on a fetus exposed to Anti-Epileptic Drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This case control observational study aims to characterise fetal brain&#xD;
      development in the context of exposure to Anti-Epileptic Drugs. Participants will attend a&#xD;
      single session at the SPMIC, University of Nottingham, in addition to their clinical&#xD;
      antenatal care. Pregnancy outcome will be collated from clinical records. At their SPMIC&#xD;
      session, they will complete a simple demographics data collection questionnaire on their&#xD;
      personal medical history, followed by a 3 Tesla MRI Fetal MRI scan. There is no requirement&#xD;
      for randomization or blinding. Each participant will be assigned a study identity code&#xD;
      number, allocated at randomisation for use on study documents and the electronic database.&#xD;
      The documents and database will also use their initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator has overall responsibility for the study and shall oversee all study&#xD;
      management. The data custodian will be the Chief Investigator. The Chief Investigator and&#xD;
      co-investigators will meet regularly for the duration of the study to discuss the project&#xD;
      implementation and overall progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to be implemented over over 5 years from 2019. This will allow for&#xD;
      recruitment and scanning of participants, and then a period of allowing participants to&#xD;
      deliver the fetus, and post-partum outcome information to be collected. The end of the study&#xD;
      will be marked by the final outcome from the last participant to deliver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging will all take place at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (SPMIC; University&#xD;
      Park, University of Nottingham). Before commencing the scan the pregnant woman will be asked&#xD;
      to fill in the SPMIC safety form to screen for any contraindications of MRI. The MRI will&#xD;
      take up to one hour to perform and women will be in the centre for about 1-2 hours.&#xD;
      Demographic and outcome data from the pregnancy will be collected by the research staff&#xD;
      during the study. Women will be asked if they wish to be informed of the results of the study&#xD;
      and asked to leave contact information for this purpose (Email or address).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI data will acquired using sequences including, but not limited to, T2-weighted structural,&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and Cine (for motor analysis).&#xD;
      Structural data will be acquired in 3 orthogonal planes, registered and reconstructed for&#xD;
      further automated tissue segmentation. Segmented tissues will be used for volumetric analysis&#xD;
      and the development of shape analysis methods. The fMRI data will analysed for resting state&#xD;
      network differences between cohorts, and differences in Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent response&#xD;
      during motor activity. DTI data will be analysed according to an analysis pipeline described&#xD;
      recently, and will allow comparison of differences in tract formation between cohorts. Motor&#xD;
      behaviour will be analysed according to principles of General Movement analysis between&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is a safe, non-invasive and non-ionizing clinical imaging modality. Concerns naturally&#xD;
      arise when using any imaging modality in the fetus, both in terms of immediate teratogenicity&#xD;
      and long term development effects. In this regard, UK guidelines do not recommend MRI prior&#xD;
      to 18 weeks gestation, unless there are exceptional clinical concerns. The magnitude of the&#xD;
      primary magnetic field does not occur in natural phenomena, however there are no known&#xD;
      adverse biological effects due to such interactions. However repeated radiofrequency pulses&#xD;
      result in energy deposition in tissues and can lead to heating effects. This is measured by&#xD;
      the specific absorption rate and the distribution of thermal energy deposition has been&#xD;
      investigated in pregnancy. Animal models have demonstrated that thermal energy generated by&#xD;
      metabolic processes in the fetus dissipate through two routes: thermal energy transfer from&#xD;
      fetal to maternal blood in the placenta and directly from the fetal tissues into the&#xD;
      surrounding amniotic fluid. Clinical studies into the long term effects of MRI exposure to&#xD;
      fetuses have also shown no adverse outcomes in terms of growth deficits, or changes in&#xD;
      physiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be produced of the variables collected. Graphical displays will&#xD;
      be generated as appropriate. Data summaries for continuous variables will be expressed as&#xD;
      median and interquartile ranges and for categorical variables will be expressed as n (%).&#xD;
      Further statistical testing will depend on the distribution of the data. Parametric (e.g. t&#xD;
      tests) and non-parametric statistics (e.g. Mann-Whitney U-test) will be used to compare&#xD;
      differences in the continuous and non-continuous variables respectively, between groups.&#xD;
      Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to examine associations between&#xD;
      categorical variables. Limits of agreement and Bland-Altman plots will be used to examine&#xD;
      intra- and inter-observer reliability of measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING Demographic and medical history will be collected from two sources: hospital&#xD;
      records, and directly from a patient administered questionnaire on the day of the SPMIC&#xD;
      visit. MRI data will be acquired using the 3 Tesla wide-bore MRI scanner at SPMIC, University&#xD;
      of Nottingham. The choice of scanner permits greater participant comfort particularly later&#xD;
      in gestation where changes in body habitus would benefit from a larger circumference scanner.&#xD;
      There is also a substantial amount of experience for scanning pregnant women on this scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from a single site at the Joint Obstetrics-Epilepsy Service at&#xD;
      Nottingham University Hospitals, which has specifically designed to manage women with&#xD;
      epilepsy that are both considering or are currently pregnant. The clinical team consists of&#xD;
      Consultant Obstetricians, Consultant Neurologists/Epileptologists, Obstetrician Specialist&#xD;
      Trainees, Physician Specialist Trainees, and Specialist Nurses.&#xD;
