    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of rectal&#xD;
      administration of a tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/elvitegravir (EVG) insert at two dose levels&#xD;
      in HIV-uninfected individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of rectal administration of a&#xD;
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/elvitegravir (EVG) insert at two dose levels in HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive a single TAF/EVG Insert at Study Visit 3. After a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 7 days, participants will receive two TAF/EVG Inserts at Study Visit 7.&#xD;
      The inserts will be administered rectally by study staff. After each dosing visit, samples&#xD;
      will be collected over a 3-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend 10 study visits and will be followed for approximately 6 to 13&#xD;
      weeks. Study visits may include physical and rectal examinations; collection of blood, urine,&#xD;
      rectal and vaginal fluid; and interviews. The total duration of the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 11 months.&#xD;
