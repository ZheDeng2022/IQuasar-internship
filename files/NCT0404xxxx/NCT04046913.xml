  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) results in chronic intestinal inflammation, is of increasing incidence&#xD;
      both in the developed and developing world and has a marked impact on patient quality of&#xD;
      life. The prevalence of CD is 10.6 per 100,000 people in the UK and represents a significant&#xD;
      annual financial burden of around €16.7 million in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A wide range of nutrients and food components have been investigated for their role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and course of CD. A common theme suggests that CD risk is associated with a&#xD;
      &quot;Western diet&quot;, including high fat, high sugar and processed foods. However, intervention&#xD;
      studies that exclude specific aspects of the diet such as sugar or that compare low and high&#xD;
      fat diets have failed to show effectiveness in practice. Observational human and experimental&#xD;
      animal studies suggest that certain food additives used extensively by the food industry play&#xD;
      a role in the pathogenesis and natural history of CD. However, to date no evidence exists for&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a diet low in these food additives in CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a diet low in certain food&#xD;
      additives compared to a normal UK diet on CD activity, health-related quality of life, gut&#xD;
      bacteria, gut permeability, gut inflammation and dietary intake, in patients with mildly&#xD;
      active, stable CD. We will recruit patients with mildly active CD and will randomise them to&#xD;
      receive either the diet low in the food additives of interest, or the diet representative of&#xD;
      a normal UK diet. Patients will follow their allocation diet for 8 weeks and will attend&#xD;
      study visits at the start and end of the trial, at which points questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed and samples will be collected. Crohn's disease (CD) results in chronic intestinal&#xD;
