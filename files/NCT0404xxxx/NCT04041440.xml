  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      clEAR's auditory brain training has been shown to be effective in improving childrens'&#xD;
      abilities to recognize the speech of generic talkers in a laboratory setting. In the proposed&#xD;
      research, the researchers will build upon these results and assess the extent to which&#xD;
      auditory brain training delivered via the web enhances children's abilities to recognize the&#xD;
      speech of a potential classroom teacher and diminishes their communication challenges that&#xD;
      are associated with significant hearing loss. First, investigators will conduct focus groups&#xD;
      with children who have undergone training with the research version of clEAR's pediatric&#xD;
      games, then they will recode the games from LabView to Java Script, making changes in the&#xD;
      games in response to the focus group comments, and finally, they will collect data from 20&#xD;
      children to assess whether web-based auditory brain training improves their abilities to&#xD;
      recognize the speech of their (hypothetical) upcoming school year's classroom teacher.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imagine that someday, children with hearing loss can prepare for an upcoming school year by&#xD;
      playing computer games with their new teacher's voice throughout the summer. Then, on the&#xD;
      first day of class, children would have that &quot;Oprah Winfrey effect&quot;, the sense that they know&#xD;
      the teacher. Children would be able to recognize their teacher's voice much better than they&#xD;
      would have otherwise, and importantly, they would experience less anxiety because of the&#xD;
      talker familiarity effect. clEAR is making that &quot;someday&quot; a reality today. clEAR has created&#xD;
      a new web-based clinical tool for audiologists and teachers to provide customized auditory&#xD;
      brain training to their patients (www.clearforears.com). Auditory brain training includes&#xD;
      traditional analytic and synthetic training as well as training to develop those auditory&#xD;
      cognitive skills that are necessary to decode spoken language regardless of the content&#xD;
      (i.e., auditory working memory, auditory attention, and auditory processing speed). The&#xD;
      centerpiece of the clEAR website is a set of auditory brain training games that patients&#xD;
      play, with oversight and coaching from their hearing healthcare provider or from one of&#xD;
      clEAR's inhouse audiologists. Currently, clEAR caters to adult patients, and the games&#xD;
      require some reading ability and a vocabulary that includes the most common words of the&#xD;
      English language (N=800 words). clEAR has been enrolling paying adult subscribers since May&#xD;
      of 2017. In the laboratory, a research version of pediatric games is being tested. The&#xD;
      pediatric games are &quot;childfriendly&quot; and require only a limited vocabulary and no reading&#xD;
      skills. In this Phase 1, the investigators will first conduct focus groups with 10 children&#xD;
      who have undergone training with the research version of clEAR's pediatric games, then they&#xD;
      will recode the games from LabView to Java Script, making changes in the games in response to&#xD;
      the focus group comments, and finally, they will collect data from 20 children to assess&#xD;
      whether web-based auditory brain training improves their abilities to recognize the speech of&#xD;
      their (hypothetical) upcoming school year's classroom teacher. The experimental design will&#xD;
      be a within-subjects A1-A2-B1-B2 design, where children will serve as their own controls.&#xD;
      Participants will be tested two times before training with a one-week interval separating the&#xD;
      test sessions (A1 and A2), to establish a baseline performance, and then immediately after&#xD;
      training (B1) to establish immediate gains and three weeks later to assess whether gains&#xD;
      begin to decline following training (B2). All testing and training will occur during the&#xD;
      summer so the experimental results will not be confounded by benefits possibly accrued&#xD;
      through school-related activities. Children will complete a total of 16 hours of training and&#xD;
      will follow the same schedule (i.e., play the games in a prescribed order and for a set&#xD;
      amount of time each). Outcome measures will come from a comprehensive speech perception test&#xD;
      battery, questionnaires, and from data collected during training and stored on the children's&#xD;
      training tablets. In Phase II, the pediatric games will be transferred to the clEAR website&#xD;
      and develop their commercial potential.&#xD;

    <description>clEAR Questionnaire is given to provide researchers feedback and suggestions about the clEAR games from the child's perspective. The questionnaire used 7-point Likert scales, yes-no questions, open ended questions. Average scores across all of the Likert scale questions are reported here because they are quantifiable. Here are the questions analyzed.&#xD;
How much did you like the home training program?&#xD;
Do you think playing the games improved your speech discrimination abilities? (how well you understand speech)&#xD;
Do you think playing the games improved your confidence in conversation?&#xD;
Did you enjoy playing the games in your home?&#xD;
How likely would you be to tell your friends who have hearing loss about this program?&#xD;
Participants were asked to respond to each item using this scale:&#xD;
(very little) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (very much)</description>

        <title>Subjective Assessment of clEAR Games on a 7-Point Scale</title>
        <description>clEAR Questionnaire is given to provide researchers feedback and suggestions about the clEAR games from the child's perspective. The questionnaire used 7-point Likert scales, yes-no questions, open ended questions. Average scores across all of the Likert scale questions are reported here because they are quantifiable. Here are the questions analyzed.&#xD;
How much did you like the home training program?&#xD;
Do you think playing the games improved your speech discrimination abilities? (how well you understand speech)&#xD;
Do you think playing the games improved your confidence in conversation?&#xD;
Did you enjoy playing the games in your home?&#xD;
How likely would you be to tell your friends who have hearing loss about this program?&#xD;
Participants were asked to respond to each item using this scale:&#xD;
