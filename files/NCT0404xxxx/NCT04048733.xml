      In this study, the investigators compare timely acquirement of 12-lead ECG using patchy-type&#xD;
      wireless versus using standard 12-lead ECG system among patient with chest pain in ED. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the difference of timely acquirement of 12-lead ECG&#xD;
      using two different systems and the difference of hospital delay in ED between two groups.&#xD;
      The participants were randomly divided into 2 groups: one performing an ECG examination using&#xD;
      the standard 12-lead ECG and the other using the patch-type mobile 12-lead ECG.The 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG will be taken 2 times serially in every 15 minutes.&#xD;

      1. research background Electrocardiography (ECG) is the most important diagnostic tool for&#xD;
           rapid detection of acute coronary syndrome, and should be performed and interpreted&#xD;
           promptly on appearance of symptoms. Early detection of ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
           infarction (STEMI) on a 12-lead ECG, within 10 minutes after the first medical contact&#xD;
           before hospitalization not only minimizes the time taken for diagnosis and reperfusion&#xD;
           therapy but also increases the chances of patient survival and preservation of&#xD;
           myocardial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, it is challenging to perform a 12-lead ECG promptly using the standard 12-lead&#xD;
           ECG system for several reasons. First, it is difficult to identify the landmarks for the&#xD;
           10-electrode configuration of the standard ECG. Second, electrodes on the extremities&#xD;
           often cause artifacts due to body and muscle movements. Moreover, most of the standard&#xD;
           12-lead ECG systems have cables connected to the precordial and limb leads, which&#xD;
           frequently get entangled and disorganized, and can be difficult to manage.Most&#xD;
           importantly, its accuracy is dependent on the operators' experience; not just that of&#xD;
           the nurses or emergency medical technicians, but also of cardiologists.These&#xD;
           difficulties might increase the time taken to perform an ECG especially in pre-hospital&#xD;
           situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective The purpose of this study is to determine the difference of timely acquirement&#xD;
           of 12-lead ECG using two different systems and the difference of hospital delay in ED&#xD;
           between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design : Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Setting : ED at the Samsung medical center&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Enrollment : 36 patients who visited the ED with chest pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intervention Standard 12-lead ECG will be performed at the time of visiting ED to the&#xD;
           participants with chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED physicians will prescribe to perform second and third 12-lead ECG in every 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group : Second and third 12 lead ECG will be taken using standard 12-lead ECG&#xD;
           device as a doctor's order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study group :Second and third 12 lead ECG will be taken using patchy-type 12-lead ECG&#xD;
           device as a doctor's order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. scoring To measure, interval from the anticipated time to take 12-lead ECG to the time&#xD;
      actually performed will be measured. The duration from the anticipated time to the time of&#xD;
      verification by physician will be also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. study period The experiment ends when patient who agreed to participate in the study&#xD;
      discharged the ED.&#xD;
