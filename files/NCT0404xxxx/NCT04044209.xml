  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators aim to evaluate safety and efficacy of combination Ivosidenib&#xD;
      (AG-120) and nivolumab in the context of adult patients with Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1&#xD;
      (IDH1) mutated acute myeloid leukemias (AML) or Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the overall response rate of (CR/CRi) of combination ivosidenib (AG-120)&#xD;
           and nivolumab in patients with high risk MDS and relapsed/ refractory AML&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the duration of response of combination ivosidenib (AG-120) and nivolumab&#xD;
           in patients with high risk MDS and relapsed/ refractory AML 2.2 Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To determine the progression free survival of patients treated with combination ivosidenib&#xD;
      (AG- 120) and nivolumab. 2) To determine the overall survival of patients treated with&#xD;
      combination ivosidenib (AG-120) and nivolumab. 3) To determine hematological response rate of&#xD;
      patients treated with combination ivosidenib (AG- 120) and nivolumab. 4) To establish the&#xD;
      duration of response to treatment of patients treated with combination ivosidenib (AG-120)&#xD;
      and nivolumab. 5) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination ivosidenib (AG-120)&#xD;
      and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the relationship between treatment response and correlative studies such as&#xD;
           plasma and bone marrow 2-HG levels, and IDH variant allele frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Genomic characterization by assaying specimens obtained from patients using an MDS/AML&#xD;
           specific panel through the duration of therapy to longitudinally assess mutational&#xD;
           burden before and during therapy, and correlating this mutational data with patient&#xD;
           outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate exploratory biomarkers including PD-L1 expression, circulating myeloid-derived&#xD;
           suppressor cells and interferon gamma signatures to response&#xD;
