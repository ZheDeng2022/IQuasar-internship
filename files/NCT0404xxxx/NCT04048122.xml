  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) affects over 1 million Americans and causes considerable personal and&#xD;
      socioeconomic costs (&gt;$34 billion/year in the US) that are expected to rise as the population&#xD;
      ages. Cognitive impairment produces disability and reduced quality of life among non-demented&#xD;
      people with PD. Surgical and pharmacologic treatments for PD do not prevent or treat&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and may even exacerbate the problem. As such, cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatments that mitigate its negative functional consequences are a top research priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, existing cognitive rehabilitative programs for PD, which focus on restoring&#xD;
      deficient cognitive processes through process training (repetitive practice of tasks that&#xD;
      challenge specific cognitive processes), have had limited effect on daily function. To&#xD;
      overcome this limitation, the investigators take a strategy training approach. Trained&#xD;
      occupational therapists teach people targeted strategies to use in everyday life to&#xD;
      circumvent cognitive deficits and accomplish meaningful daily activities. Contemporary&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation evidence supports this approach for people with chronic&#xD;
      neurocognitive dysfunction from stroke and brain injury; however, it has not been studied in&#xD;
      PD. By teaching strategies for everyday cognition and using training techniques to support&#xD;
      transfer of learning beyond the training context, the investigators hypothesize that our&#xD;
      strategy training interventions will produce better functional outcomes for people with PD&#xD;
      compared to process training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed MultiContext for PD (MC4PD) to enable people with PD to apply&#xD;
      strategies in their everyday lives to cope with cognitive decline and improve or maintain&#xD;
      daily function. MC4PD is an individualized, community-based intervention that focuses on the&#xD;
      attainment of personally meaningful functional goals using training techniques known to&#xD;
      enhance strategy learning and transfer. In an iterative case series, the investigators&#xD;
      fine-tuned the treatment protocol, established good participant acceptance and engagement,&#xD;
      and provided preliminary data on its benefits for daily cognitive function. The next step is&#xD;
      to confirm MC4PD's feasibility in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In this project, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess feasibility and treatment fidelity and generate data in preparation&#xD;
      for a definitive RCT by conducting a single-blind pilot RCT comparing MC4PD to a&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment (Control). Individuals with PD will complete pre-treatment&#xD;
      testing, randomization to treatment group, 10 treatment sessions, and immediate and 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment testing.&#xD;

      compared to process training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed MultiContext for PD (MC4PD) to enable people with PD to apply&#xD;
      strategies in their everyday lives to cope with cognitive decline and improve or maintain&#xD;
      daily function. MC4PDis an individualized, community-based intervention that focuses on the&#xD;
      attainment of personally meaningful functional goals using training techniques known to&#xD;
      enhance strategy learning and transfer. In an iterative case series, the investigators&#xD;
      fine-tuned the treatment protocol, established good participant acceptance and engagement,&#xD;
      and provided preliminary data on its benefits for daily cognitive function. The next step is&#xD;
      to confirm MC4PD's feasibility in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In this project, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess feasibility and treatment fidelity and generate data in preparation&#xD;
      for a definitive RCT by conducting a single-blind pilot RCT comparing MC4PD to a&#xD;
      standard-of-care treatment (Control). Individuals with PD (N = 60) will complete&#xD;
      pre-treatment testing, randomization to treatment group, 10 treatment sessions, and immediate&#xD;
      and 3 months post-treatment testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the feasibility of MC4PD within an RCT. H1: Study recruitment will be 4&#xD;
      participants/month, retention in both treatment groups will be 4 participants/month,&#xD;
      retention in both treatment groups will be &gt; or equal to 85%, and greater than or equal to&#xD;
      85% of participants in both groups will complete the intervention in 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators will track recruitment, retention, intervention duration, and reasons for&#xD;
      non-enrollment or attrition throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: H2a: Therapists will deliver MC4PD with high adherence and competence. Blinded raters&#xD;
      will rate therapist adherence and competence for a random sample (30%, n=180) of MC4PD and&#xD;
      Control treatment sessions. The investigators will calculate adherence and competence (to&#xD;
      MC4PD) for each therapist; adherence &gt; or equal to 80% and competence greater than or equal&#xD;
      to 3 (of 4 possible, indicating at least &quot;Well done&quot;) will be benchmarks for good treatment&#xD;
      integrity. H2b: MC4PD participants will have good acceptance, receipt, and enactment of&#xD;
      treatment. MC4PD participants will complete the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) at&#xD;
      post-treatment, and blinded raters will rate participants' session participation (Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Participation Scale; PRPS) and homework completion. CSQ-8 scores greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 24 (of 32 possible, indicating all positive responses), PRPS scores greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 4 (of 6, indicating at least &quot;Good&quot;), and homework completion rates greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 80% will be benchmarks for good acceptance, receipt, and enactment, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Obtain preliminary estimates of MC4PD's effect on patient-reported functional&#xD;
      cognition. H3 (exploratory): MC4PD participants will report greater improvement in functional&#xD;
      cognition than Control participants immediately and 3 months after treatment. The&#xD;
      Investigators will use the Bangor Goal Setting Interview (BGSI), a reliable and responsive&#xD;
      rehabilitation outcome measure, to identify 3-5 functional cognitive problems and set related&#xD;
      goals for each participant. Participants will rate their attainment of each goal at pre,&#xD;
      post, and follow-up (10-point scales, higher is better, scores are averaged across problems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that MC4PD can enable people with PD to manage everyday&#xD;
      cognitive challenges so they can perform and participate in desired activities and roles.&#xD;
      Such an intervention could improve function and quality of life, reduce caregiver burden, and&#xD;
      enhance clinical care for this population. This specific study is part of a rigorous&#xD;
      developmental process designed to optimize MC4PD for clinical trials and eventual translation&#xD;
      into clinical practice. It is significant because it will provide us with feasibility data,&#xD;
      fidelity enhancements, clinical trials infrastructure, experience training and monitoring&#xD;
      therapists, and an estimate of treatment effect-all essential elements for efficiency, rigor,&#xD;
      reproducibility, and payoff in future clinical trials as well as for implementation and&#xD;
      sustainability in real-world clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete pre-treatment assessment and then will be randomized to treatment&#xD;
      arm: MC4PD or Control (Standard of Care). Both arms will consist of 10 individualized&#xD;
      treatment sessions within a 12-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatments consist of 10, 1-hour sessions over 12 weeks delivered in an individual,&#xD;
      face-to-face format in participants' homes and/or communities by trained licensed&#xD;
      occupational therapists (OTs). All treatment sessions will be audiotaped to assess the&#xD;
      therapists adherence and competence to the cognitive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - MC4PD: This treatment focuses on improving functional performance by enhancing the&#xD;
      generation and use of strategies-which can be internal (e.g., self-talk, planning) or&#xD;
      external (e.g., checklist, alarm)-to circumvent cognitive processing limitations caused by&#xD;
      PD. It uses a standardized approach across and within sessions for all clients while being&#xD;
      tailored to each client's cognitive problems and goals. The first session begins with a&#xD;
      discussion of pre-treatment cognitive test results from the recruitment source study. The&#xD;
      purpose of this is to (1) begin building the client's awareness of cognitive strengths and&#xD;
      limitations and how they may relate to daily function and (2) inform individualized goal&#xD;
      setting and treatment planning. Then the OT explains MC4PD purpose and process, conducts the&#xD;
      Bangor Goal Setting Interview to collaboratively identify functional cognitive problems and&#xD;
      set related treatment goals, and &quot;assigns&quot; the first homework (record and reflect on daily&#xD;
      cognitive lapses). All subsequent treatment sessions consist of a review of prior sessions&#xD;
      and learning, homework review, treatment activities, homework provision, and session recap.&#xD;
      Each session's treatment activities are selected collaboratively based on the client's goals&#xD;
      and preferences and the OT's assessment of the client's cognitive and functional status. They&#xD;
      involve the performance of simulated functional activities with OT mediation to help the&#xD;
      client anticipate performance problems, generate and use strategies to support performance,&#xD;
      evaluate and modify performance and strategy use, and transfer these principles to other&#xD;
      activities. The OT's expertise in functional cognition, task and performance analysis, and&#xD;
      task grading guides this process. Treatment activities also involve in-depth discussion of&#xD;
      these issues, including making explicit connections between the simulated functional&#xD;
      activities, strategies, and the client's real-life experiences, to promote generalization of&#xD;
      learning. Homework consists of action plans for using the strategies generated and practiced&#xD;
      during the treatment session in specific everyday life situations. Clients record instances&#xD;
      of strategy use (or missed opportunities) along with their evaluation of strategy&#xD;
      effectiveness and potential modifications on a structured worksheet, which is reviewed&#xD;
      collaboratively in the next session. In this way, homework not only supports real-life&#xD;
      strategy application and practice, but it also reinforces self-monitoring, self-evaluation,&#xD;
      problem solving, strategy self-generation, and strategy optimization. Treatment progresses&#xD;
      through three general phases (1: Understand and define problems and goals, 2: Generate,&#xD;
      execute, and evaluate strategies, 3: Generalize and reinforce strategy use) and increases in&#xD;
      difficulty, but progression is flexible depending on the client's goals and abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 - Control: This treatment is task-oriented training, a widely-used approach in&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation, that parallels the cognitive process training used in PD to-date but&#xD;
      with simulated functional tasks (vs. computer or paper &amp; pencil tasks). It has the same basic&#xD;
      protocol as MC4PD, but it is therapist-directed, and the OT does not address strategies,&#xD;
      metacognition, generalization, or use mediation or action plans. Therefore, this is a&#xD;
      standard-of-care approach that includes all but the proposed critical elements of MC4PD. The&#xD;
      OT reviews pre-treatment cognitive test scores with the client but without discussion to&#xD;
      build awareness. The OT selects treatment activities based on the client's cognitive profile&#xD;
      and goals from a published set of activities designed for use in cognitive interventions.&#xD;
      Graded task practice with OT feedback on performance accuracy is used to produce&#xD;
      neurocognitive improvement (or possibly independent strategy development). The OT assigns&#xD;
      practice of specific cognitively challenging everyday life activities for homework (but&#xD;
      without action plans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete assessments related to cognition, goal-attainment, participation&#xD;
      one-week and three-months post-treatment sessions.&#xD;
