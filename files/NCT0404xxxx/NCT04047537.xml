  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 12 week placebo-controlled study evaluates the safety and impact of 2 different&#xD;
      strengths of the medical food formulation WBF-0011.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical food formulations being tested in this study contain butyrate-producing organisms&#xD;
      plus a microbial strain that contributes to the integrity of the colonic mucin barrier. The&#xD;
      microbes have been fully characterized, certified as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) and&#xD;
      manufactured to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards using excipients that are also&#xD;
      GRAS qualified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive their randomized formulation twice a day for 12 weeks.The target&#xD;
      population will be patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are not treated with anti-diabetic&#xD;
      agents or are treated with metformin alone.&#xD;
