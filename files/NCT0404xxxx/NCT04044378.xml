  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results of previous study showed high objective response but short-term activity of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced osteosarcoma. Given the recent&#xD;
      success of immunotherapies, combinations of antiangiogenics with immune checkpoint blockers&#xD;
      have become an attractive strategy. The investigators had completed an prospective phase 2&#xD;
      trial of the combination of apatinib and camrelizumab on advanced osteosarcoma and showed&#xD;
      prolonged progression-free survival for this combination. Famitinib is a novel tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2, -3 and FGFR-1, -2, -3, -4 with high affinity, which&#xD;
      showed broad antitumor activity against a variety of xenograft models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Levatinib with or without Ifosfamide and&#xD;
      Etoposide in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults With Relapsed and Refractory Osteosarcoma&#xD;
      showed promising median PFS of 11.3 months. Thus we also try to investigate the combination&#xD;
      efficacy of TKIs with chemotherapy in advanced osteosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the recommended phase 2 dose for pediatric use of famitinib in&#xD;
      combination with camrelizumab and trys to explore the efficacy and safety for single drug&#xD;
      famitinib, famitinib and camrelizumab and famitinib and ifosfamide in patients with&#xD;
      inoperable high-grade osteosarcoma progressing after chemotherapy.&#xD;

Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was defined as the highest dose at which no more than 30% patients experience a DLT in the first two courses.&#xD;
In the phase II portion, famitinib will be orally taken daily with RP2D together with camrelizumab intravenous infusion at a dose of 200 mg over 30 minutes, once every two weeks (Q2W), 4 weeks (28 days) as one treatment cycle.</description>
