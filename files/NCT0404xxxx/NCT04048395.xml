      This retrospective study was proposed by the investigators to analyze treatment status and&#xD;
      outcome in patients with early relapsed follicular lymphoma. In patients with follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma who experienced disease progression within 24 months after initiation of treatment,&#xD;
      the second-line therapy, stem cell transplantation, tumor response, progression free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma is the second most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Western countries,&#xD;
      but it is relatively less frequent in Asia. As a result, the prognosis and treatment status&#xD;
      in Korean patients with follicular lymphoma have been rarely studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the recent addition of monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 into existing cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, the overall life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma has improved a&#xD;
      lot. However, nearly 20% of these patients experience early worsening of disease within the&#xD;
      first 24 months of treatment, followed by poor prognosis. Since patients with early relapse&#xD;
      within 24 months usually experience worsening of disease during treatment with rituximab&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy or during rituximab maintenance therapy, optimal treatment for&#xD;
      such patients is unknown, but remission induction therapy followed by stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, bendamustine combined with obinutuzumab, PI3K inhibitors, and lenalidomide&#xD;
      are possible options. However, most of these drugs are limited for use in Korea, and there is&#xD;
      little information with regard to treatment guidelines for patients with early relapsed&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma or their treatment outcome in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective study was proposed by the investigators to analyze treatment status and&#xD;
      outcome in patients with early relapsed follicular lymphoma. This study will provide basic&#xD;
      data for follicular lymphoma study in Korea and for future clinical trial design.&#xD;
