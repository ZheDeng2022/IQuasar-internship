  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, open label and dose escalation clinical study of&#xD;
      anti-CD147 CART cells in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients autologous T cells are activated and then engineered to express chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and&#xD;
      returned to the patient by Ommaya Reservoir at specific cell doses. Three CD147-CART doses&#xD;
      patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Serum cytokine level and CAR-T cell number will be&#xD;
      measured in whole treatment session.&#xD;
