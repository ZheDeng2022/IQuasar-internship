  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      (DLTs), and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FF-10850 (topotecan liposome injection) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose-escalation Phase: Approximately 48 patients are planned for the dose-escalation phase,&#xD;
      with at least 6 patients treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort Expansion Phase: Four additional cohorts of 12 patients each are planned. Cohort E1:&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer; Cohort E2: advanced cervical cancer, Cohort E3: advanced sarcomas,&#xD;
      and Cohort E4: advanced neuroendocrine tumors including small cell lung cancer. Each cohort&#xD;
      will be treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cohort, FF-10850 will be administered intravenously (IV) until progression of&#xD;
      disease, observation of unacceptable AEs, or, after discussion between the Investigator and&#xD;
      the Medical Monitor, changes in the patient's condition that prevent further study&#xD;
      participation. A sufficient number of cohorts will be enrolled to identify the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 initial dose levels in this study. FF-10850 will be diluted and infused over&#xD;
      60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 96 patients are planned for the entire trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that approximately 4 centers will participate in the dose-escalation phase,&#xD;
      with an expansion to approximately 10 centers in the cohort expansion phase. Accrual for the&#xD;
      dose-escalation and expansion phases is expected to be approximately 3 years, with patients&#xD;
      followed every 3 months from the last dose of study treatment to assess survival.&#xD;
