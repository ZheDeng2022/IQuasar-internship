      This project will develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of a urine-based assay&#xD;
      to monitor adherence to Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns within Soil-transmitted&#xD;
      helminthiasis (STH) control programs, evaluating the urine and serum pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      ALBENDAZOLE (ABZ) and its metabolites across a variety of food/fast conditions, age, gender&#xD;
      and body weight. The final goal is to obtain a field ready tool for the measurement of&#xD;
      adherence to anthelmintic treatment at a community level that serves as a coverage/adherence&#xD;
      indicator and a reference standard for other monitoring tools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soil-Transmitted-Helminthic (STH) infections are a major public health issue affecting the&#xD;
      world's poorest populations. Control strategies for STH have been focused on the use of mass&#xD;
      chemotherapy often delivered to school-aged-children; although there is strong interest in&#xD;
      considering community wide MDA to achieve transmission interruption of STH. In these&#xD;
      programs, directly observed treatment is not consistently or frequently achieved and so the&#xD;
      verification of reported adherence is crucial to understanding of the impact of these&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to differentiate a lack of adherence to treatment with albendazole (ABZ) from&#xD;
      absorption/metabolism/resistance-related therapeutic failures. In that context, tools to&#xD;
      evaluate, by means of non-invasive measures, treatment adherence either in adults or&#xD;
      children, should be developed. In addition, drug absorption and metabolism among people may&#xD;
      vary enormously depending on different factors such as genetics, age, gender, diet, weight&#xD;
      and disease. Any of those factors may alter the ABZ/metabolites disposition kinetics and,&#xD;
      consequently, the exposure of the target STH to the active drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research project proposes to establish evidence for the feasibility and usability&#xD;
      of such a tool within MDA programs from the perspectives of the end-user (community),&#xD;
      implementing partners, National Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) program and the World&#xD;
      Health Organization. The proposed use case for this currently developed assay is to confirm&#xD;
      the findings of the standard coverage survey (based on self-report) in the context of&#xD;
      community MDA. Further validation and technical development of a field ready tool for&#xD;
      monitoring adherence to albendazole, in addition to the identification of key factors&#xD;
      affecting drug therapeutic response is proposed within this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main goals of the current proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess key factors affecting the feasibility of using a urinary assay to monitor&#xD;
           adherence to MDA within STH control programs, including tool acceptability, tool&#xD;
           learnability, system capacity to deliver, timing of administration, frequency of&#xD;
           administration, adequate breadth of administration, sustainability of use,&#xD;
           responsiveness of health systems to tool output, and efficiency of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the influence of diet, fasting, age, gender and body weight on the serum&#xD;
           disposition kinetics and pattern of urinary excretion of ABZ/metabolites in non-infected&#xD;
           human volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the relationship between drug serum/urine concentrations with potential&#xD;
           factors affecting ABZ/metabolites disposition kinetics in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To characterize the pattern of amino-ABZSO2 urinary excretion in non-infected human&#xD;
           volunteers treated with ABZ and to determine the longest period of time after ABZ&#xD;
           treatment where amino-ABZSO2 can be measured in urine (alternatively to ABZSO) as an&#xD;
           indirect assessment of an individual's adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine drug/metabolites chemical stability in urine samples at different&#xD;
           temperatures (reproducing environmental conditions of tropical weather).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve (12) healthy adult volunteers (body weight between 45 and 75 kg, women n=6 and men&#xD;
      n=6) will participate in a crossover design with three (3) different experimental phases. In&#xD;
      Phase I, volunteers will be assigned to either Group I, Group II or Group III (n=4 each, two&#xD;
      female and two male individuals). In the following 2 Phases of the study, volunteers will be&#xD;
      cross-over between the other 2 Groups, with a 14-day washout period between Phases. All&#xD;
      groups and phases will receive 400 mg of ABZ (Glaxo SmithKline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I (heavy meal):30 minutes after a high-fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 g).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II (light meal):30 minutes after a light meal (infusion tea). Group III (fasted):at&#xD;
      8-hours fasting condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to ABZ treatment (sampling time =0), a baseline blood (5 mL) and urine (10 mL) samples&#xD;
      will be obtained in each phase. Venous blood samples will be collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24,&#xD;
      36, 48 and 72 h, after ABZ administration. Urine samples will be collected at 2, 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      24, 36, 48 and 72 h post-treatment. Samples will be stored at -20ºC until HPLC analysis of&#xD;
      ABZ/metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples from time 4-hours will be aliquoted in 3 in order to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      storage at 32°C (in an incubator) for 12 and 24 hours before freezing at -20°C in the&#xD;
      measurement of drug/metabolite levels. A total of 12 samples from Group 1 will be included in&#xD;
      this sub-sample analysis which will provide information on the stability of the samples at&#xD;
      temperatures in tropical environments.&#xD;
