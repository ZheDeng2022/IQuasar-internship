  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomised Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of ATP128 alone or in combination with BI 754091 and of heterologous prime-boost ATP128 +&#xD;
      VSV-GP128 in combination with BI 754091.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATP128 is a self-adjuvanted chimeric recombinant protein vaccine being developed in&#xD;
      combination with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade for the treatment of microsatellite&#xD;
      stable (MSS) patients not responding to PD-1 blockade. The PD-1 inhibitor being tested with&#xD;
      ATP128 is the BI 754091 (Ezabenlimab) compound which belongs to the human immunoglobulin G4&#xD;
      (IgG4) subclass of antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VSV-GP is a recombinant chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain&#xD;
      Rhabdoviridae) which carries the envelope glycoprotein (GP) of the visceral non neurotropic&#xD;
      WE-HPI strain of the Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV, Arenaviridae) instead of the&#xD;
      native VSV glycoprotein (G) and is developed as integral part of the prime-boost regimen&#xD;
      together with ATP128.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor plans to enrol 96 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage&#xD;
      IV colorectal cancer coming form three different patient populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1a: 6 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) having failed standard of&#xD;
           care (SoC) therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohorts 1b, 2a, 2c: 30 patients with stage IV microsatellite stable/mismatch&#xD;
           repair-proficient (MSS/MMRp) CRC being in stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR)&#xD;
           after first line of SoC (4-6 months duration at minimum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohorts 2b, 4b: 30 patients with stage IV MSS/MMRp liver-limited disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for this study will be enrolled in one of the 8 cohorts depending on their&#xD;
      disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Cohort 1a will receive ATP128 as single agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Cohorts 1b, 2a, 2b, 2c will receive ATP128 in combination with BI 754091&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in Cohorts 3, 4a, 4b will receive ATP128 and VSV-GP128 in combination with BI&#xD;
           754091&#xD;

             colorectal cancer, however the adjuvant treatment for stage II and III will not be&#xD;
             considered as a prior line of therapy in case of relapse more than 6 months after the&#xD;
             end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion by computed tomography or magnetic resonance&#xD;

             be biopsied twice, at baseline and on D36), ideally not the one being used for&#xD;
             measuring. However, liver lesions must be prioritized. Non-liver metastatic lesion&#xD;
             biopsies may be collected only if the patient has no liver lesion or if the liver&#xD;
             lesion is not amenable to paired biopsies (e.g. due to its size or location) or if the&#xD;
             liver biopsy represents a risk or an undue inconvenience for the patient&#xD;
             health/condition per Investigator judgment. In such cases, where a patient has no&#xD;
             lesion amenable to biopsy at all, the paired biopsies may be waived by the Sponsor on&#xD;
             a case-by-case basis.&#xD;

             Investigator judges the biopsies to be a risk or an undue inconvenience for the&#xD;
             patient health/condition, they may be waived by the Sponsor on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG performance status 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.&#xD;

             parameters ≤ 7 days before study treatment initiation.&#xD;

             bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the Investigator) in&#xD;
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle&#xD;
                  branch block, third degree heart block.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic&#xD;
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;

                  institutional guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ejection fraction (EF) &lt; 55% or the lower limit of normal of the institutional&#xD;
                  standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating&#xD;
                  physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF will&#xD;
                  the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to&#xD;
                  local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g. echocardiogram [ECHO], multi-gated&#xD;
                  acquisition scan [MUGA]. A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months&#xD;
                  prior to first study treatment administration can be accepted provided that there&#xD;
                  is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in&#xD;
                  the opinion of the Investigator or the treating physician or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific to Cohorts 3, 4a, 4b:&#xD;
