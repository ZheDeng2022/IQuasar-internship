    <textblock>
      Evidence is lacking about scalable, effective and sustainable interventions to increase&#xD;
      physical activity and concomitant outcomes in young children. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a large cluster randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of&#xD;
      physical activity professional development of preschool staff on preschool physical activity&#xD;
      practices and child health and development over 6 and 18 months. The aim is to recruit 60&#xD;
      preschools and 1200 children aged 3-5 years in one county in the western part of Norway to&#xD;
      allow for detecting small to moderate effect sizes and ensuring a heterogeneous sample of&#xD;
      preschools for the study of implementation. Children's physical development, children's&#xD;
      socio-emotional and cognitive development, and intervention implementation will be&#xD;
      investigated. The intervention will be developed with strong user involvement from&#xD;
      municipalities and relevant stakeholders to facilitate the development of sustainable&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are growing concerns about low physical activity levels among preschoolers. As 97% of&#xD;
      3-5-year-olds in Norway attend preschool, preschools are unique arenas for intervention,&#xD;
      laying the foundation for equitable development of health, human capital, and life&#xD;
      opportunities. Yet, evidence of scalable, effective and sustainable interventions to increase&#xD;
      physical activity and concomitant outcomes in preschoolers is lacking. Specifically, there is&#xD;
      a need to study how the purposeful use of the preschool instructional context can be used to&#xD;
      increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity across a wide range of motor competences to&#xD;
      enhance development, cognitively engaging play, and physically active learning. These&#xD;
      aspects, in combination, have the potential to simultaneously affect various developmental&#xD;
      and learning outcomes, but implementing such a program requires a highly coordinated effort&#xD;
      by highly trained individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of an education module, which is designed to result in highly competent preschool staffs&#xD;
      having a good understanding of development of motor competence, provision of cognitively&#xD;
      engaging play, physically active learning, and pedagogic/didactic approaches and teaching&#xD;
      principles to foster physically active and learning preschoolers, on child developmental&#xD;
      outcomes. Hopefully, this professional development will promote a physically active lifestyle&#xD;
      in the early years that will favorably influence cognition and learning, and provide an&#xD;
      efficient, acceptable, and feasible venue to build human capital and provide an early&#xD;
      solution to lifelong public health and developmental challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main research questions will be tested using both quantitative and qualitative methods,&#xD;
      applied to both the child and organizational levels: 1) How does the intervention affect&#xD;
      children's physical activity, physical fitness, motor competence, socio-emotional health,&#xD;
      self-regulation, executive functions, and learning? 2) How does the intervention interact&#xD;
      with different preschool contexts to produce various individual and organizational outcomes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research questions will be investigated using a cluster RCT with randomization&#xD;
      at the preschool level, including short- (6-month) and long-term (18-month) follow-up. The&#xD;
      intervention development will include strong involvement from preschool owners and staff to&#xD;
      provide broad support and anchor the project in the preschool sector. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to combine a large-scale experimental study with continuous improvement effort in this&#xD;
      sector allowing each preschool's contextual factors to be reflected within the larger cluster&#xD;
      RCT. In this model, to make adaptations within each preschool is not considered a lack of&#xD;
      fidelity; rather it is a desired process of institutionalization that balances internal and&#xD;
      external validity. This balance also overcomes a common criticism of clinical trials as it&#xD;
      increases the value for later scaling and dissemination to the real-world settings. In this&#xD;
      way, the aim is to create sustainable solutions for improved child development and public&#xD;
      health that can be disseminated in the long-term. Thus, the intervention's development,&#xD;
      implementation, and evaluation are framed within a &quot;realist RCT&quot; approach. The intervention&#xD;
      model is further framed within a socioecological model, placing the preschool as an&#xD;
      influential factor for children's health and development. The intervention has two levels;&#xD;
      the preschool level and the child level. In response to the challenge of low staff&#xD;
      qualifications to implement physical activity, the main component will be a 7-month&#xD;
      professional development offered to preschool staff. The intervention is structured as a&#xD;
      15-credit continuing education module that provide staff the opportunity to achieve credits&#xD;
      for their efforts. The study is based on the logic model that this professional development&#xD;
      will change preschool practices, which will in turn increase and improve children's physical&#xD;
      activity opportunities and levels and lead to child developmental effects. Thus, the main aim&#xD;
      of the professional development is to provide preschool staff the necessary expertise and&#xD;
      resources to intervene on the child level. Researchers will not directly take part in the&#xD;
      delivery of the intervention on the child level. The intervention at the child level is&#xD;
      derived from hypotheses, theory and evidence relating to the beneficial effects of physical&#xD;
      activity on physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive development and have four core&#xD;
      components. Central to the ACTNOW intervention is opportunities for children to engage in a&#xD;
      variety of meaningful physically active play that brings joy and supports the development of&#xD;
      the whole child. By the integration of the four core components, the aim is to provide&#xD;
      children opportunities to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity across a wide range&#xD;
      of motor competencies to enhance development, cognitive engaging play/games, and physically&#xD;
      active learning. As such, the core components and dosages promoted are 1) developmentally&#xD;
      appropriate moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (60 min/day), 2) motor challenging&#xD;
      physical activity (90 min/week), 3) cognitive engaging play/games (90 min/week), and 4)&#xD;
      physical activity integrated with learning activities (90 min/week). The intervention will be&#xD;
      delivered by the preschool teachers and staff through the use of a wide specter of types of&#xD;
      physically active play; from child-initiated and directed free-play at the one end, to&#xD;
      adult-initiated child-directed guided play, and adult-directed and initiated structured&#xD;
      teacher-led physical activity at the other end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study have 2 waves, the first running from August 2019 to June 2021, and the second from&#xD;
      August 2020 to June 2022. The professional development provided in Wave 2 will be adjusted&#xD;
      based on experiences and findings from Wave 1. Data collection will have 3 main phases;&#xD;
      pre-testing performed before randomization, 6-month follow-up performed at the end of the&#xD;
      professional development, and 18-month follow-up performed 1 year after completing the&#xD;
      professional development. In addition, process evaluation measures will be taken throughout&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Derived from a conservative sample size calculation using standard formulas, including&#xD;
      correction for the cluster RCT design, it is an aim to recruit a minimum of 60 preschools and&#xD;
      1200 children to the study. This sample size will allow for uncovering statistical&#xD;
      significant standardized effect sizes (Cohen's d) of 0.25-0.30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of measures will be taken to examine the interventions effectiveness on a child level&#xD;
      (physical activity, physical fitness, motor skills, adiposity, socio-emotional health,&#xD;
      self-regulation, executive functions, and learning) and to describe the implementation and&#xD;
      adaptation processes taking place in the preschools over 18 months. The realist evaluation&#xD;
      includes both quantitative and qualitative data.&#xD;
