  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for improved access to effective autism treatments. With advances in&#xD;
      technology, distance learning models have particular promise for families who cannot access&#xD;
      evidence-based parent training locally or may be on long wait-lists for behavioral&#xD;
      treatments. Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) is an established treatment for autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD); however, a telehealth PRT model has not yet been evaluated in a controlled&#xD;
      trial. This study will examine the effects of training parents in PRT via secure video&#xD;
      conferencing and investigate 1) whether parents can learn via telehealth to deliver PRT in&#xD;
      the home setting (PRT-T) and 2) whether their children will show greater improvement in&#xD;
      functional communication skills compared to children in a waitlist control group.&#xD;
      Participants will include 40 children age 2 to 5 years with ASD and significant language&#xD;
      delay. Eligible children will be randomly assigned to either PRT-T (N=20) or waiting list&#xD;
      (N=20). Weekly 60-minute parent training sessions will be delivered for 12 weeks via secure&#xD;
      video conferencing software by a PRT-trained study therapist. The effects of PRT-T on parent&#xD;
      fidelity of PRT implementation, child communication deficits including frequency of&#xD;
      functional verbal utterances, and parent-report of communication skills on standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires will be evaluated. This research will provide a foundation for wider&#xD;
      dissemination of technology-based solutions to improve access to ASD treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: Participants will include children ages a) 2:0 to 5:11 years, b)&#xD;
        diagnosed with ASD (based on history, review of available medical records including&#xD;
        diagnostic testing, e.g., ADOS) or suspicion of ASD diagnosis and confirmed with Autism&#xD;
        Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R; completed by phone), c) with significant adaptive&#xD;
        communication deficits (i.e., either a Vineland-3 Communication subscale 2SD below average&#xD;
        for 2 and 3 year olds and 3 SD below for 4 and 5 year olds or a Vineland-3 Expressive&#xD;
        V-scale Score 2 SD below average for 2 and 3 year olds, or 3 SD below for 4 and 5 year old,&#xD;
        and at least moderate severity on the CGI-S language subscale), d) able to vocalize with&#xD;
        communicative intent during home video observation, e) stable treatment for at least 2&#xD;
        weeks prior to baseline (e.g., ABA, special education) with no more than 60 minutes per&#xD;
        week 1:1 speech therapy and no anticipated changes during study participation, and f) an&#xD;
        English-speaking parent able to consistently participate in study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        a) children who have a primary language other than English, b) parent or child diagnosed&#xD;
        with severe psychiatric disorder or unstable medical problem, c) child participating in &gt;15&#xD;
        hours per week of 1:1 ABA treatment at home, d) unstable medical condition such as severe&#xD;
        seizures, e) Severe behavioral difficulties (e.g., self-injury or aggression that could&#xD;
        present a safety risk to the child or family members during implementation of the&#xD;
        intervention), f) previous adequate trial of pivotal response treatment, or g) living&#xD;
        within 200 miles of Stanford University.&#xD;
