  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the response of the endometrial lining after subcutaneous administration of the&#xD;
      medication AMD3100. This medication mobilizes stem cells and will be used in a population of&#xD;
      infertile women with a thin endometrium who are undergoing frozen-thawed embryo transfer. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess associations between response to stem cell mobilization and&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to help each participant build a better endometrial lining which is suitable&#xD;
      to implantation and maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. While animal models demonstrating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of stem cell recruitment on improved endometrial thickness and pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes are plentiful, human studies are lacking. The use of stem cells from the peripheral&#xD;
      circulation in humans could potentially allow for enhanced endometrial proliferation. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to perform a prospective randomized, controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the response of the endometrial lining after subcutaneous administration of AMD3100&#xD;
      (plerixafor). AMD3100 is an immunostimulant used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells in the&#xD;
      bloodstream. This intervention will be studied in a population of infertile women with a thin&#xD;
      endometrium who have failed previous embryo transfer cycles and are undergoing a&#xD;
      frozen-thawed embryo transfer. This study seeks to evaluate both the endometrial response to&#xD;
      stem cell mobilization via AMD3100 as well as pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
