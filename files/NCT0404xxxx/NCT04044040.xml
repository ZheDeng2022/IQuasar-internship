  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is defined as multidisciplinary care that increases quality of life (QOL) for&#xD;
      patients with a life-threatening illness. Although it is known that patients with the most&#xD;
      severe physical and psychological symptoms have the greatest need for palliative care, these&#xD;
      patients are often not referred to palliative care services in a timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a system called STEP (Symptom screening with Targeted Early Palliative&#xD;
      care) that identifies patients with high symptom burden in order to offer them timely access&#xD;
      to palliative care. The investigators are conducting a single-arm trial at Princess Margaret&#xD;
      Cancer Centre to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized trial of STEP versus usual&#xD;
      care and to establish specific parameters for its planning.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown when patients with advanced cancer were&#xD;
      referred early to specialized palliative care teams, they had improved QOL, symptom control,&#xD;
      and greater satisfaction with their cancer care. Such routine specialized palliative care&#xD;
      intervention, while effective, may be challenging to enact broadly with widespread shortages&#xD;
      of palliative care physicians. STEP systematically identifies patients with the greatest&#xD;
      need, using symptom screening at every outpatient visit, with triage and targeted referral to&#xD;
      palliative care. This could reduce resource use while directing care to the most vulnerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from Breast, Lung, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, and Gynecology&#xD;
      medical oncology clinics. Consenting participants will complete questionnaires measuring&#xD;
      outcomes of QOL, symptom control, depression, and satisfaction with care at recruitment, 2, 4&#xD;
      and 6 months. The objectives of the study are to assess the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      larger phase III trial and to collect information to assist in trial planning and sample size&#xD;
      calculation for such a trial. Feasibility criteria are: i) ≥100 patients accrued in 12&#xD;
      months; ii) ≥70% complete screening for ≥70% of visits; iii) ≥60% of those for whom a call is&#xD;
      triggered meet at least once with the EPC team; iv) ≥60% complete measures at each endpoint.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient Heath Related Quality of Life (HRQL) as measured by the FACIT-Sp.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Sp encompasses the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) and FACIT spiritual well-being subscale to measure physical, social/family, emotional, functional and existential well-being.</description>

    <measure>Patient Heath Related Quality of Life (HRQL) as measured by the FACIT-Sp.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Sp encompasses the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) and FACIT spiritual well-being subscale to measure physical, social/family, emotional, functional and existential well-being. Scores range from 0-156 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Heath Related Quality of Life (HRQL) as measured by the QUAL-E.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The QUAL-E (Quality of Life at the End of Life) measures quality of life domains including life completion, symptoms impact, relationship with health care provider, and preparation for end of life. Scores range from 21-105 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom control</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom control is measured by the 11-item ESAS-r-CS (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised plus constipation and trouble sleeping). All 11 items are summed for the ESAS-r-CS Total Distress Score (TDS), where higher scores indicate worse symptom burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Depression is measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Scores range from 0-27 with higher scores indicating worse depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with care</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with care is measured by the FAMCARE-P16 (Family Satisfaction with Cancer Scale modified for patients). Scores range from 16-80 with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction with care.</description>
