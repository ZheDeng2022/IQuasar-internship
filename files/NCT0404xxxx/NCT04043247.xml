  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting(PONV) refers to at least one nausea, retching or vomiting&#xD;
      after operation, or any combination of the above symptoms. The incidence of PONV in high-risk&#xD;
      patients can reach 61%-79%. PONV can not only cause dizziness and headache, but also cause&#xD;
      disturbance of acid-base balance of water and electrolyte, wound dehiscence, formation of&#xD;
      incisional hernia, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia, leading to prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, increased medical expenses, and reduced surgical satisfaction. At present,&#xD;
      the guidelines for prevention and treatment of PONV and the consensus of experts suggest that&#xD;
      identifying high-risk patients according to Apfel risk score ≥3 points, reducing baseline&#xD;
      PONV risks, and implementing multimodal PONV prophylaxis. However, the incidence of PONV in&#xD;
      high-risk patients is still as high as 20% even if 2-3 drugs are combined used for prevention&#xD;
      and treatment. It is difficult to further reduce the incidence of PONV by adding different&#xD;
      kinds or dosages of drugs, while drug-related side effects are increasing gradually.&#xD;
      Acupuncture (electroacupuncture, transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulationTEAS,&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, etc.) is a safe, effective, non-toxic&#xD;
      side-effect non-drug treatment method. A large number of studies have confirmed that&#xD;
      acupuncture can reduce the incidence of PONV, and it is expected to become an important&#xD;
      supplement to drug treatment of PONV, but there are quality defects such as small sample&#xD;
      size, inaccurate intervention and so on. At the same time, most acupuncture studies aim to&#xD;
      compare the efficacy of PONV with drug therapy, without considering the clinical situation,&#xD;
      using acupuncture treatment based on drug standard treatment to further reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of PONV, thus limiting the clinical application value of acupuncture. On the basis of&#xD;
      standardized drug prevention and treatment of PONV, TEAS will be used to further reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of PONV and promote rapid recovery of patients. This study will strongly&#xD;
      demonstrate that acupuncture can break through the bottleneck of drug treatment and provide&#xD;
      evidence for the application of acupuncture in modern perioperative clinical medicine.&#xD;

      This study intends to carry out a high-quality clinical research with design specifications,&#xD;
      large sample, multi-center, evaluator blinded, randomized and controlled methods. From&#xD;
      September 1, 2019 to October 30, 2020, patients undergoing laparoscopic non-gastrointestinal&#xD;
      surgery under general anesthesia will be recruited, based on the combination of dexamethasone&#xD;
      and 5-HT3 antagonist, the efficacy of TEAS stimulation Neiguan (P6) and Zusanli (ST36) in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of PONV will be verified. In TEAS group, bilateral P6 and ST36 TEAS&#xD;
      intervention after removal tracheal intubation and on the first day after surgery, a total of&#xD;
      2 times, 30 minutes each time, 2/10 Hz low frequency sparse wave, 6-9 mA. The patients will&#xD;
      be given maximum intensity stimulation at all points during the intervention.To ensure the&#xD;
      blindness of the evaluator, the time of evaluation will be on the afternoon of the first and&#xD;
      the second day, and the 30 days after the operation, and three evaluations will be made. The&#xD;
      main indicators are the incidence of PONV 24 hours after operation, and the secondary&#xD;
      indicators are the quantitative indicators of PONV and the indicators of rapid recovery after&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
