  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a psychoeducational group curriculum specifically for new in&#xD;
      vitro fertilization (IVF) patients (both male and female) to improve their treatment&#xD;
      knowledge, to allow them to engage more in their care, to offer a support network, to improve&#xD;
      satisfaction, and to provide them with tools to help reduce their stress and anxiety while&#xD;
      undergoing the IVF process. The investigators plan to have four to eight infertility patients&#xD;
      and their partners participate in a group at a time, for which they will attend three 1-1.5&#xD;
      hour interactive sessions that are scheduled throughout their first IVF cycle. These sessions&#xD;
      will provide additional time for discussion about treatment with providers, learning&#xD;
      opportunities on topics of interest to fertility patients, and stress reduction techniques.&#xD;
      They will do several surveys before and after the intervention for comparison, including&#xD;
      assessment of quality of life, depression, anxiety, resilience, and a knowledge assessment.&#xD;
      The investigators will also track the patients to see if they pursue additional treatment in&#xD;
      the instance of a negative pregnancy test compared to patients undergoing the standard&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators plan to recruit a control group that receives the standard of&#xD;
      care treatment here at the University of Iowa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients and their partners will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to two different treatment&#xD;
      arms: A) standard of care in vitro fertilization (IVF) at the investigational institution as&#xD;
      well as participating in an additional psychoeducational group or B) standard of care IVF at&#xD;
      the investigational institution. The intervention group will consist of three additional&#xD;
      evening visits for 1-1.5 hours per session. The sessions will include an interactive&#xD;
      educational component addressing usual questions and concerns of IVF patients, such as&#xD;
      reviewing common IVF myths, and also more information regarding treatment and technologies.&#xD;
      Each session will also include teaching of coping strategies (such as awaiting the pregnancy&#xD;
      test, how to cope with insensitive remarks from friends and family) as well as relaxation&#xD;
      exercises, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be consented at their new IVF visit and will take their initial assessments&#xD;
      (FertiQoL, GAD-7, PHQ-9, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and a knowledge assessment)&#xD;
      within 24 hours of the new visit. The patients will be assigned into groups based on when&#xD;
      they are going through their IVF stimulations, so they will have similar experiences at&#xD;
      similar times. Patients will take their final assessments on the third day after egg&#xD;
      retrieval, regardless of group assignment.&#xD;
