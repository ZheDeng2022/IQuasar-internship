    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well encorafenib, binimetinib, and&#xD;
      nivolumab work in treating patients with microsatellite stable, BRAFV600E gene-mutated&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Encorafenib and&#xD;
      binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Giving encorafenib, binimetinib, and nivolumab may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with colorectal cancer compared to standard treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe overall response rate (ORR) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with BRAFV600E, microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of nivolumab, encorafenib, and binimetinib in&#xD;
      patients with BRAFV600E, MSS mCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate median progression-free survival (PFS) upon treatment with encorafenib,&#xD;
      binimetinib, and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate median overall survival (OS) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib,&#xD;
      and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate median time to response (TTR) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib,&#xD;
      and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate median duration of response (DoR) upon treatment with encorafenib,&#xD;
      binimetinib, and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate disease control rate (DCR) upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY (CORRELATIVE) OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess genomic and immune changes upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and&#xD;
      nivolumab in tumor tissue, blood and stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate genomic and immune changes upon treatment with encorafenib, binimetinib, and&#xD;
      nivolumab in tumor tissue, blood and stool with radiographic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging for disease burden that&#xD;
      is not measurable by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST)&#xD;
      and to correlate location and patterns of metastatic disease with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, binimetinib PO twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1-28, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days for a maximum of 24 cycles of treatment. If disease progression or recurrence occurs,&#xD;
      treatment may be resumed outside of the context of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days, then every&#xD;
      3 months thereafter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known history of acute or chronic pancreatitis (history of acute pancreatitis with no&#xD;
             recurrent events in the prior 24 months are permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis&#xD;
             and Crohn?s disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients with a history of&#xD;
             symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive&#xD;
             sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g.,&#xD;
             Wegener?s granulomatosis]); central nervous system (CNS) or motor neuropathy&#xD;
             considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome and myasthenia gravis,&#xD;
             multiple sclerosis). Patients with Graves? disease will be allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function or disease that may significantly alter the&#xD;
             absorption of study drug (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled vomiting,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection with decreased intestinal absorption)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent neuromuscular disorder that is associated with elevated creatine kinase&#xD;
             (CK) (e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
             sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors&#xD;
             for RVO (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity&#xD;
             or hypercoagulability syndromes); history of retinal degenerative disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events =&lt; 12 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment. Examples include transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accidents, hemodynamically significant (i.e. massive or sub-massive) deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis or pulmonary emboli&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients with either deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli that does not&#xD;
                  result in hemodynamic instability are allowed to enroll as long as they are on a&#xD;
                  stable dose of anticoagulants for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients with thromboembolic events related to indwelling catheters or&#xD;
                  other procedures may be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would, in the investigator?s judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient?s participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery =&lt; 6 weeks prior to starting study drug or failure to recover from side&#xD;
             effects of such procedure at the discretion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a&#xD;
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners or persons who are involuntarily incarcerated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical, psychiatric, cognitive or other conditions that may compromise the patient's&#xD;
             ability to understand the patient information, give informed consent, comply with the&#xD;
             study protocol or complete the study&#xD;
