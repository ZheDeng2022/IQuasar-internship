    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of therapeutic Virtual Reality (VR) on quality of life of 60&#xD;
      patients with non-specific chronic low-back pain. 30 patients will be included in the&#xD;
      intervention group. These patients will use Reducept, a therapeutic virtual reality&#xD;
      application based on diverse cognitive therapies (ACT, mindfulness, EMDR, hypnotherapy), at&#xD;
      home over a period of 28 days, for at least 10 minutes each day. This will be an add-on&#xD;
      intervention next to standard care, while the patient is waiting to receive actual treatment&#xD;
      for chronic pain. 30 patients in the control group will only receive standard care, whilst&#xD;
      waiting to receive actual treatment for their chronic pain. Intervention and control group&#xD;
      will be compared on a number of outcome measures related to quality of life before using VR,&#xD;
      during VR use, just after use and 4 months after final use. This explorative study is&#xD;
      necessary to get first insights as a basis for a confirmative study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      21,2% of the Dutch population is suffering from chronic low-back pain. 90% of these patients&#xD;
      suffers from chronic low-back pain not attributable to a recognisable, specific pathology&#xD;
      (non-specific low-back pain). 30-40% of all patients suffering from chronic pain visit their&#xD;
      GP for treatment. Treatment includes mostly analgesics, in particular NSAIDs and opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate treatment of chronic pain is important as chronic pain negatively impacts, amongst&#xD;
      others, quality of life, activities of daily living and feelings of helplessness. A&#xD;
      systematic review by Bala et al. however shows that chronic pain treatment is often&#xD;
      inadequate. Moreover, each different type of analgesic has its own associated side effects.&#xD;
      NSAIDs increase the risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications. Common side&#xD;
      effects of opioid analgesics include sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation,&#xD;
      physical dependence, and even cases of hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, more attention has been given to psychological interventions for relieving chronic&#xD;
      pain. A systematic review by Castelnuovo et al. shows the efficacy of a range of&#xD;
      psychological interventions, including acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT),&#xD;
      mindfulness-based interventions, hypnotherapy, eye movement and desensitization and&#xD;
      reprocessing (EMDR) therapies and virtual reality based interventions. All of these&#xD;
      psychological interventions focus on changing people's attitudes, feelings and behaviors on&#xD;
      chronic pain, to improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first psychological intervention is the commonly used acceptance and commitment therapy&#xD;
      (ACT). ACT is a cognitive behavioral therapy for treating chronic pain that uses&#xD;
      exposure-based and experiential methods aiming at improving patients' abilities to cope with&#xD;
      their chronic pain. Several systematic reviews indicate that ACT is effective in improving&#xD;
      health outcomes of chronic pain patients. Mindfulness-based interventions seem to work as&#xD;
      well for chronic pain relief. This set of interventions aims at learning strategies for pain&#xD;
      awareness and acceptance. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is a mind-body based intervention that&#xD;
      uses hypnoses to learn patients to cope with their pain. It focuses attention away from pain,&#xD;
      thereby blocking its experience. Hypnotherapy seems effective in reducing pain experience.&#xD;
      Then, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is another psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      approach in treating chronic pain. EMDR has already shown to be effective in treating&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder, and has recently as well been introduced as a treatment for&#xD;
      chronic pain. Early research findings indicate EMDR to be effective in treating chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, one of the most recent fields of inquiry in treating chronic pain by means of&#xD;
      psychological interventions is Virtual Reality. VR consists of a Head Mounted Device (HMD)&#xD;
      and a sound system which immerses the user in a three-dimensional (3D) virtual world. There&#xD;
      are multiple mechanisms behind the efficacy of VR in treating chronic pain. The most commonly&#xD;
      studied mechanism is distraction. VR seems to be effective in reducing pain via distraction&#xD;
      as it diverts attention away from pain. As both the VR application and the pain require&#xD;
      attention and the brain has only limited attentional capacity, less attention is available&#xD;
      for pain processing. In this manner, it reduces current feelings of pain, anxiety and stress.&#xD;
      Though, the distraction mechanism only diverts attention away from pain shortly. To actually&#xD;
      treat chronic pain by means of VR, it seems that other strategies, apart from distraction,&#xD;
      are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies aimed to find alternative mechanisms behind pain reduction by VR. The use of&#xD;
      psychological interventions in VR, such as ACT or hypnosis, appears to be effective. Although&#xD;
      the context of VR is different from traditional psychotherapy, the idea of how change occurs&#xD;
      is not. Moreover, the immersiveness of VR provides opportunities to even better influence&#xD;
      cognitions and emotions of patients suffering from chronic pain. Multiple virtual reality&#xD;
      interventions have been designed with this knowledge in mind. A proof-of-concept study by&#xD;
      Gromala et al., for example, looked into the application Virtual Meditative Walk (VMW). VNW&#xD;
      focuses on mindfulness-based stress reduction via VR. The user study shows VNW's efficacy&#xD;
      compared to non-VR interventions. Likewise, Guarino et al. proved that using virtual&#xD;
      mindfulness therapy eight times over a period of a month is effective in chronic pain&#xD;
      reduction. Therapeutic hypnosis has as well been tested in several case report studies. All&#xD;
      conclude that virtual reality hypnosis seems to be effective in dealing with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR serious game Reducept is a novel psychological VR intervention for treating chronic&#xD;
      pain. It incorporates several psychological therapies into one application: hypnotherapy,&#xD;
      mindfulness, ACT and EMDR. Reducept has been made in co-creation with patients, researchers,&#xD;
      psychologists and developers and can be installed and played on a VR goggles. It consists of&#xD;
      an education module and three games.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education: Reducept provides its players with information about the biological&#xD;
           mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Learning about chronic pain helps to cope with it in&#xD;
           daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: Reducept's first game has been based on the mechanisms of hypnotherapy. The&#xD;
           patient should shoot away painful stimuli in the nervous system. By visualizing their&#xD;
           pain, they learn to control and cope with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relaxation: the second game within Reducept is a mindfulness-based intervention. It&#xD;
           takes place in the spinal cord. Players should collect positive neurotransmitters and&#xD;
           focus on their respiration rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Processing: game three has been based on the mechanisms of ACT and EMDR. It asks players&#xD;
           to recover negative patterns in the brain. Players have to switch attention between the&#xD;
           pain and the game, helping them to decrease their experience of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to gain a first understanding in the ability of the therapeutic VR&#xD;
      intervention Reducept to treat chronic low-back pain. It will define a wide range of outcome&#xD;
      measures, including quality of life indicators, pain, stress and anxiety measures and&#xD;
      measures on ability to execute daily activities. What outcome measures does it affect? What&#xD;
      outcome measures will be left unaffected? Moreover, tolerability, feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of Reducept in relation to different patient characteristics (age, gender,&#xD;
      Motivaction profiling) will be measured to understand which patients might benefit most from&#xD;
      virtual reality based psychological interventions. The study focuses on patients with&#xD;
      non-specific chronic low-back pain as this group represents a large part of all chronic pain&#xD;
      patients. This explorative study is necessary as an input for future studies on the actual&#xD;
      effects of therapeutic virtual reality interventions on quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether a therapeutic virtual reality application can improve the quality of&#xD;
      life of people suffering from non-specific chronic low-back pain, compared to a control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This explorative study uses a randomised controlled parallel design (1:1). Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either the control group or the intervention group. In the control&#xD;
      group, participants are placed on the waiting list to receive the common treatment to handle&#xD;
      their chronic pain. As they are placed on the waiting list, they will receive no therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment yet (apart from the during intake prescribed physiotherapy and medication).&#xD;
      Participants placed in the intervention group, who are also placed on the waiting list and&#xD;
      only receive, when prescribed, physiotherapy and medication, will use the therapeutic virtual&#xD;
      reality intervention meanwhile at home during a period of 28 days for at least ten minutes&#xD;
      each day and in addition the education module at least during day 1 (which lasts 25 minutes).&#xD;
      The randomisation is not blinded: both researchers and participants know which participants&#xD;
      are part of the intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients, males and females, suffering from daily non-specific chronic low-back pain&#xD;
      are eligible for this study. Patients' pain should have last for at least three months.&#xD;
      Patients should report a pain score of ≥4 during the intake questionnaires filled in before&#xD;
      intake at the Rijnstate Pijncentrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive virtual reality glasses with the&#xD;
      Reducept application. They are asked to use the therapeutic virtual reality intervention at&#xD;
      home over a period of 28 days starting the day after collecting the virtual reality goggles.&#xD;
      Participants are asked to use the therapeutic virtual reality intervention at least once a&#xD;
      day for ten minutes. In addition, they should, on the first day, and preferably during more&#xD;
      days, watch the whole education program which lasts 25 minutes. Participants can decide&#xD;
      themselves to use the application more often. Participants assigned to the control group will&#xD;
      receive no intervention, they are, just as the intervention group, placed on the waiting list&#xD;
      to receive normal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide all patients with the opportunity to use the&#xD;
      virtual reality application, as the design requires a control group that does not use it over&#xD;
      the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study the possibility of continuing the virtual reality treatment for&#xD;
      all participants want-ing to after finishing this study. At least they will be able to buy&#xD;
      themselves the virtual reality glasses for using the therapeutic virtual reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no risk involved in exposure to the therapeutic virtual reality application.&#xD;
      Participants can leave the study at any time for any reason if they wish to do so without any&#xD;
      consequences. As mentioned before, the burden for participants associated with this study is&#xD;
      mainly related to measurements of endpoints, which will take approximately 30-45 minutes&#xD;
      three times over a period of five months. The intervention group will spend at least ten&#xD;
      minutes a day on the therapeutic virtual reality application and in addition on day 1 25&#xD;
      minutes.. As explained in the rationale, no or only minimal adverse effects from this&#xD;
      intervention are expected.&#xD;
