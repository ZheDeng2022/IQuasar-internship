      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women can get a DNA analysis of their blood. The test tells a woman and her doctor&#xD;
      about the DNA of her unborn baby. But some women get test results that are abnormal or not&#xD;
      reportable. Researchers want to learn more about the relationship between these test results&#xD;
      and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand prenatal DNA test results and how they can predict cancer, if present,&#xD;
      in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women 18 and older who got prenatal DNA test results that were abnormal or not reportable and&#xD;
      suggested the abnormality was in the woman and not her baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be screened by phone or in person. They will talk about their&#xD;
      medical history and send copies of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will have a physical exam and medical history. The will give blood and&#xD;
      stool samples. They will have a Pap smear. They may have a pregnancy test. They will talk to&#xD;
      a specialist about the test results they got when they were pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
      For CT, a small amount of radiation is used to make a picture of the body. For MRI, they will&#xD;
      lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal tube, taking pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a paper or electronic survey. It will assess their emotional and&#xD;
      physical well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a list of any possible diagnoses and treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have yearly follow-up visits at NIH for 2-5 years. They will complete&#xD;
      surveys. They may give blood samples and copies of their medical records. They may do some&#xD;
      visits by phone or email.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starting in 2011, analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood of pregnant&#xD;
           women began to be offered clinically as a prenatal screen for trisomies 13, 18, and 21.&#xD;
           Owing to its superior sensitivity and positive predictive values compared to serum&#xD;
           biochemistry and ultrasound markers, the cfDNA test became rapidly incorporated into&#xD;
           prenatal clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By 2013, however, reports began to appear that described examples of false-positive test&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cfDNA analysis is performed on maternal plasma samples taken any time between 10 and 40&#xD;
           weeks of gestation and called noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). The maternal plasma&#xD;
           contains circulating DNA from the placenta (which serves as a proxy for the fetus) as&#xD;
           well as the maternal hematopoietic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective studies evaluated the DNA profiles of women in whom a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
           of malignancy was already known. Solid tumors shed cfDNA into the circulation. With&#xD;
           increased understanding of maternal malignancy as the underlying basis for unusual cfDNA&#xD;
           analysis, case reports have been published that suggest that the tumor cfDNA is the&#xD;
           underlying basis for the false-positive test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prenatal genomic testing provides proof-of-principle that cfDNA analysis works as a&#xD;
           screen to detect neoplasia, even when it was not designed to do so; and, clinical&#xD;
           sequencing laboratories can find the women who are potentially at risk. There are clear&#xD;
           and consistent professional guidelines regarding follow-up of the fetus with a&#xD;
           diagnostic test such as an amniocentesis or a chorionic villus sampling (CVS). However,&#xD;
           if the fetus has a normal karyotype, there are no guidelines as to follow-up of the&#xD;
           pregnant woman. We propose here a study to determine the best approach for clinical&#xD;
           follow-up if the test results are suggestive of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the natural history of women with prenatal testing results that suggest an&#xD;
      incidental detection of maternal neoplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women who had prenatal cfDNA tests during pregnancy to screen for fetal chromosomal&#xD;
      aneuploidies,with non-reportable or abnormal results inconsistent with a viable fetus. Follow&#xD;
      up testing shows a normal-appearing fetus on ultrasound examination and/or a normal fetal or&#xD;
      neonatal karyotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo an initial evaluation at the Clinical Center to diagnose&#xD;
           possible neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All collected information will be discussed in multidisciplinary meetings. If neoplasia&#xD;
           is discovered, the results will be shared with participants and referring physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be followed to collect all available medical information.&#xD;
