    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, open label single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study&#xD;
      enrolling at least 32 subjects. The study aims to characterize the PK of CAZ AVI and assess&#xD;
      its safety and tolerability following a single intravenous (IV) infusion. Subjects will be&#xD;
      hospitalized pediatric patients who are receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected&#xD;
      or confirmed nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The&#xD;
      study will consist of a Screening visit (Visit 1, Day 1), during which consent will be&#xD;
      obtained and subject eligibility will be confirmed, a Baseline/Treatment visit (Visit 2, Day&#xD;
      1) during which subjects will receive a single IV infusion of CAZ AVI, and then two follow up&#xD;
      assessment visits at 24 hours (Visit 3, Day 2) and 48 hours (Visit 4, Day 3). Blood samples&#xD;
      for PK analyses (0.5 mL per sample) will be obtained over 22 hours for Cohort 1 (7 samples),&#xD;
      over 13 hours for Cohort 2 (6 samples), and over 6 hours for Cohorts 3 and 4 (4 samples).&#xD;
      Additionally, for subjects who are undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical&#xD;
      purposes and for whom informed consent is obtained specifically for BAL, an epithelial lining&#xD;
      fluid (ELF) sample will be collected for estimation of CAZ AVI concentrations.&#xD;

             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Past or current history of epilepsy or seizure disorder (excluding childhood febrile&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Any condition (eg, septic shock, burns, cystic fibrosis, acute hemodynamic&#xD;
             instability, including those conditions not responding to pressor support) that would&#xD;
             make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study (eg,&#xD;
             would place a patient at risk; compromise the quality of the data; or interfere with&#xD;
             the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of CAZ AVI).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receipt of a blood or blood component or scheduled for transfusion within the PK&#xD;
             sampling period (eg, red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets) transfusion&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Body mass index (BMI) below the 5th percentile or above the 95th percentile for&#xD;
             height, age, and weight except for children &lt;2 years of age as BMI is not considered a&#xD;
             screening tool for healthy weight in children under 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Treatment with ceftazidime within 12 hours of CAZ AVI administration or treatment with&#xD;
             ceftazidime within 24 hours of CAZ AVI administration in subjects with renal&#xD;
             impairment (CrCL ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Treatment with potent inhibitors of OAT1 and/or OAT3 (eg, probenecid, p aminohippuric&#xD;
             acid (PAH), or teriflunomide).&#xD;
