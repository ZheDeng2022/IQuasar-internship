  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men diagnosed with significant cancer confined to the prostate currently undergo radical&#xD;
      therapy directed to the whole prostate (radiotherapy or prostatectomy). These provide good&#xD;
      cancer control but can cause significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal Therapy involves targeting the cancer alone, whilst leaving healthy prostate gland&#xD;
      alone. Case series have shown similar cancer control over 5 years with a much better side&#xD;
      effect profile. However, there have been no randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing the&#xD;
      success in cancer control and the quality of life in patients that undergo radical therapy vs&#xD;
      those that undergo focal therapy. Further, there is a need to assess the use of additional&#xD;
      therapies that may improve the cancer control outcomes following focal therapy. By having a&#xD;
      trials platform with two RCTs (CHRONOS-A and CHRONOS-B) that reflect best patient and&#xD;
      physician preferences/ equipoise, the investigators aim to answer these questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve acceptability, recruitment and compliance, the investigators have an embedded&#xD;
      study aimed at reviewing clinician and patient perspectives and trial acceptability.&#xD;
      CHRONOS-A will compare radical therapy to focal therapy, whilst CHRONOS-B will compare focal&#xD;
      therapy alone to focal therapy with various therapies targeting the testosterone pathway that&#xD;
      can shrink the cancer before it is treated. The investigators think this might improve&#xD;
      outcomes further for men that definitely want focal therapy.&#xD;

      AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHRONOS-A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot: To determine if men will agree to participate in a randomised controlled trial that&#xD;
      randomly assigns them to focal therapy alone or radical therapy (radiotherapy or&#xD;
      prostatectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main: To determine if focal therapy alone is non-inferior when compared to radical therapy&#xD;
      (radiotherapy or surgery) in terms of progression-free survival at 5 years in men with&#xD;
      clinically significant non-metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHRONOS-B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot: To determine if men expressing a preference for focal therapy will agree to&#xD;
      participate in a multi-arm, multi-stage Randomised Controlled Trial that randomly assigns&#xD;
      them to focal therapy alone or focal therapy in combination with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main: To determine if focal therapy combined with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant agents,&#xD;
      compared to focal therapy alone, will improve failure-free survival at 5 years, in men with&#xD;
      clinically significant non-metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES To deliver a trials framework that fits with existing patient and physician&#xD;
      equipoise so that the investigators can answer the next generation of research questions to&#xD;
      evaluate medium-term outcomes following minimally invasive focal therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      clinically significant, non-metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embedded internal pilot objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine patient acceptance to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct an embedded qualitative study of patient and clinician acceptance and experience&#xD;
           of the linked randomised controlled trial CHRONOS design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the feasibility of an economic evaluation alongside the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine acceptability and completeness of resource use and utility measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the relevant NHS and non-NHS resource use to be collected alongside the main&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the relevant items to populate the Cost and Consequences framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform preliminary analysis of pattern of missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;

      time from randomisation to further focal therapy session or salvage whole-gland or systemic&#xD;
      therapy or prostate cancer metastases or prostate cancer-specific mortality.&#xD;

             in those men who undergo focal therapy prior to focal therapy as a baseline for&#xD;
             comparison during follow-up. In the absence of a compliant MRI (for clinical or other&#xD;
             reasons), a transperineal template mapping biopsy using a 5-10 mm sampling frame will&#xD;
             be required&#xD;

          -  Histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overall Gleason score of 7 (either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7) of any length or Gleason 3+3=6&#xD;
             provided &gt;/=6mm cancer core length in any one core. Patients with Gleason 4+4=8 in&#xD;
             some cores but where the overall Gleason score is 7 will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral histologically proven prostate cancer is permissible provided the following&#xD;
             criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The index lesion to be treated if focal therapy is used meets the above&#xD;

                  lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Secondary areas of Gleason 3+3=6 of &lt;/=5mm cancer outside of the treatment field&#xD;
                  can be monitored, if present, and patient undergoes focal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a Likert or PIRADS score 3,4 or 5 mpMRI lesion is present in an area outside&#xD;
                  of the treatment field with a negative biopsy for cancer then pathology must be&#xD;
                  reviewed and confirm the presence of inflammation or atrophy if the patient is to&#xD;

             lobe for either unilateral or bilateral ablation, patients with tumour volume &gt;/=50%&#xD;
             of one lobe will require central review prior to enrolment. Final decisions on&#xD;
             suitability of focal therapy will lie with the trial central review in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No restriction exists in CHRONOS-A on previous or current use of 5-alpha reductase&#xD;
