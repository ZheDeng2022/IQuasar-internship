    <textblock>
      This two-part study will include a dose escalation part to determine the recommended dose for&#xD;
      expansion of DS8201a and pembrolizumab and a dose expansion part to evaluate efficacy,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of the combination.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1b, open-label, 2-part, multicenter, non-randomized, multiple-dose study will&#xD;
      evaluate DS-8201a in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation part of the study, escalating doses of DS-8201a in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will be assessed. DS-8201a and pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered on Day&#xD;
      1 of every 21-day cycle. The initial dose administered for DS8201a will be 3.2 mg/kg Q3W.&#xD;
      Escalation to the next dose (5.4 mg/kg Q3W) will be based on acceptable safety signals based&#xD;
      on the earlier dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of dose escalation with the recommended dose of escalation (RDE) established,&#xD;
      the dose expansion part of the study will begin. The dose expansion part will include 4&#xD;
      cohorts: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) breast cancer participants with&#xD;
      prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), HER2 low breast cancer participants with prior&#xD;
      failed standard treatments, HER2-expressing NSCLC participants who have not received any&#xD;
      prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or HER2 agents, and HER2-mutant NSCLC&#xD;
      participants who have not received any prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or HER2&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
