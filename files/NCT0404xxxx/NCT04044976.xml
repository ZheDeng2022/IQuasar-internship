      Background. In recent years, particular attention has been paid to all interventions that&#xD;
      could help reduce the need for mechanical ventilation MV and, therefore, the risk of BPD.&#xD;
      However, early application of non-invasive respiratory supports and early treatment with&#xD;
      surfactant fail in 45-50% of cases. Failure frequently depends on the onset of apnea episodes&#xD;
      and, therefore, it has been proposed to treat very preterm infants with caffeine already in&#xD;
      the delivery room in the first min of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and objectives of the study. Our aim is to verify the hypothesis that it is&#xD;
      possible to administer caffeine in the delivery room intravenously and enterally via an&#xD;
      orogastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. Infants 25-29 weeks of gestational age will be enrolled and will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive 20 mg/kg of caffeine citrate intravenously, via the umbilical vein, or enterally,&#xD;
      through an orogastric tube, within 10 min of birth. The dosage of plasma caffeine&#xD;
      concentration will be performed 60+15 min after administration to measure its peak and 60+15&#xD;
      min before the next dose (5 mg/kg/day i.v.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints. The primary endpoint will be the evaluation of the success rate of intravenous or&#xD;
      enteral administration of caffeine in the delivery room. Secondary endpoints will be the&#xD;
      evaluation of: number of infants in whom caffeine will be successfully administered by&#xD;
      intravenous versus enteral route; number of infants where caffeine will be successfully&#xD;
      administered that reached the therapeutic plasmatic range the first dose, confirming the&#xD;
      success of the administration; comparison of caffeine blood level obtained with intravenous&#xD;
      and enteral administration; frequency of successes in obtaining the therapeutic range after&#xD;
      the second dose; frequency of MV within the first 72 hours of life in studied infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. In the absence of previous studies to use as a reference and this study&#xD;
      being a feasibility study, it was decided arbitrarily to study 20 infants treated in the&#xD;
      delivery room with caffeine administered intravenously and 20 infants treated in the delivery&#xD;
      room with caffeine administered enterally. The clinical characteristics of the two groups&#xD;
      will be described by calculating the mean value and the standard deviation or the rate and&#xD;
      percentage. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by calculating the percentage of cases in&#xD;
      which caffeine will be successfully administered. The comparison between the number of&#xD;
      infants in which caffeine will be successfully administered intravenously versus the enteral&#xD;
      route and the comparison between the caffeine plasma level obtained with intravenous and&#xD;
      enteral administration will be performed using the Student &quot;t&quot; test for continuous parametric&#xD;
      variables, the Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-parametric continuous variables and the Ï‡2 test&#xD;
      for categorical variables. A p &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Background Mechanical ventilation (MV) is one of the most important risk factors&#xD;
      for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the preterm infant, due to the&#xD;
      early pulmonary inflammation from volume- and baro-trauma and the secondary 1. Despite this,&#xD;
      around 80% of infants born with gestational age &lt;27 weeks must be treated with MV 2 for a&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and in about 65% of cases it starts already in the&#xD;
      delivery room in the first min of life 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in recent years particular attention has been paid to all interventions that could&#xD;
      help reduce the need of MV, thus reducing the risk of BPD. Among these interventions, the&#xD;
      early application of non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the use of&#xD;
      sustained lung inflation (SLI), and early treatment with surfactant with INSurE (Intubation-&#xD;
      Surfactant-Extubation) or LISA (less invasive surfactant administration) 1,4. These&#xD;
      interventions have the common objective of promoting lung recruitment by promoting the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of alveolar residual functional capacity (CFR), improving&#xD;
      pulmonary compliance, reducing work of breathing and favoring gas exchange 1,4.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these treatments are not always effective and recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      CPAP in combination or not with surfactant administration fails to prevent MV in about 45-50%&#xD;
      of treated infants 3; similarly the SLI strategy in association with non-invasive CPAP and&#xD;
      with the possible administration of surfactant fails to prevent MV in approximately 60% of&#xD;
      treated infants 5. In fact, in many cases the failure of MV prevention does not depend on&#xD;
      severity of RDS, which also remains a very important factor, but especially in mild-moderate&#xD;
      forms of RDS is due to the onset of relapsing episodes of apnea. Therefore, it has been&#xD;
      proposed to treat very preterm infants with caffeine in the delivery room already in the&#xD;
      first min of life. This drug is very effective in the preterm infant in whom it has been&#xD;
      shown to decrease the frequency of apnea, the risk of BPD, the duration of non-invasive&#xD;
      respiratory supports, and the risk of re-intubation 6, also in infants without previous&#xD;
      crisis of apnea 7.In fact, caffeine stimulates spontaneous respiratory activity, improves&#xD;
      lung compliance and minute volume, reduces airway resistance, and increases diaphragm&#xD;
      contractility, together with a good safety profile and without significant side effects at&#xD;
      current doses 6. In a recent pilot study, Katheria et al. randomized 21 infants with&#xD;
      gestational age &lt;29 weeks to receive 20 mg/kg of caffeine citrate within 2 h of life or at 12&#xD;
      hours of life obtaining in treated infants a decrease, although not statistically&#xD;
      significant, of the need of VM (27 vs. 70%) in association with an overall hemodynamic&#xD;
      improvement 8. Subsequently, Dekker et al. randomized 23 infants of 24-29 gestational weeks&#xD;
      to receive 10 mg/kg of caffeine in the delivery room or immediately after arrival in neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (4.4 vs. 48 min of life) demonstrating that early treatment is associated&#xD;
      with a significant increase in tidal volume and a lower need for oxygen-therapy 9. Although&#xD;
      the results were promising, neither study measured the plasma concentration of caffeine or&#xD;
      had sufficient statistical power to assess whether caffeine administered in the delivery room&#xD;
      is effective in reducing the risk of mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis The present feasibility study aims to evaluate the possibility of&#xD;
      administering caffeine in the delivery room intravenously and enterally through an orogastric&#xD;
      tube during the postnatal stabilization of the preterm infant. It is preliminary to the&#xD;
      planning of a subsequent randomized controlled trial of adequate size, which will aim to&#xD;
      assess whether caffeine administered so early can actually reduce the risk of MV in preterm&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study Primary objectives of the study. The primary objective will be the&#xD;
      evaluation of the feasibility of the administration of intravenous or enteral caffeine in the&#xD;
      very preterm infant in the delivery room during assistance for cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      stabilization of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study. The secondary objectives will be to compare the&#xD;
      feasibility of administering caffeine intravenously vs. enteral and evaluation of the need&#xD;
      for MV in treated infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients. The study will be conducted in 2 Third Level Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units after approval by local ethics committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria. Once the written informed consent of the parents or legal guardians has&#xD;
      been obtained, inborn infants of 25+0-29+6 weeks of gestational age at high risk of&#xD;
      developing &quot;respiratory distress syndrome&quot; (RDS), who do not require MV in the delivery room,&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria will be: maternal consumption of caffeine before&#xD;
      giving birth (&gt; 2 cups of coffee in the 6 hours before birth), major congenital&#xD;
      malformations, chromosomal syndromes, fetal hydrops, and inherited metabolic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study. Infants will be electronically randomized to receive 20 mg/kg (1 mL=20&#xD;
      mg) of caffeine citrate (PeyonaÂ®, Chiesi Farmaceutici Spa, Parma, Italy) intravenously, via&#xD;
      the umbilical vein, or enterally, through an orogastric tube, within 10 min of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous administration may take place via an umbilical venous catheter or a &quot;butterfly&quot;&#xD;
      needle inserted into the umbilical vein. The bolus of caffeine will be followed by the&#xD;
      administration of a 2 mL &quot;flush&quot; of saline both in the case of administration by venous and&#xD;
      enteral route. Successes and failures of the administration with the two different methods&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of plasma caffeine concentration will be measured 60+15 min after the&#xD;
      administration to evaluate its peak and 60+15 min before the administration of the second&#xD;
      dose (5 mg/kg/day i.v.) which will be given after admission in neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      10. The plasma level will be measured using the &quot;dried blood spots&quot; method with spectrometry&#xD;
      and &quot;tandem-mass&quot; liquid chromatography 11 in the Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry and&#xD;
      Pharmacology of the A. Meyer Pediatric Hospital of Florence. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      with heel punctures commonly performed for monitoring these patients and stored at -80Â°C&#xD;
      until to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary, resuscitation in the delivery room will be performed following the guidelines&#xD;
      of the AAP/ AAH 12. After admission in neonatal intensive care, infants who have not required&#xD;
      VM in the delivery room will be assisted with the following non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
      supports: nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), &quot;bi-level&quot; NCPAP (BiPAP), nasal&#xD;
      intermittent mandatory ventilation (N-IMV) using a CDP/ PEEP of 5-8 cmH2O. Surfactant&#xD;
      (Curosurf Â®, Chiesi, Parma, Italy) will be given (200 mg/kg) according to the INSURE&#xD;
      (Intubation-SURfactant-Extubation) or LISA (Less-Invasive-Surfactant-Administration)&#xD;
      technique in infants requiring FiO2 &gt;0.30 to maintain a SpO2 90-95% and in all infants who&#xD;
      will need MV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MV will be started in the case of pCO2 &gt;65 mmHg and pH &lt;7.20, or pO2 &lt;50 mm Hg with FiO2&#xD;
      &gt;0.50 after surfactant administration or in case of apnea (&gt; 4 episodes in 1 hour or&gt; 2&#xD;
      episodes in 1 hour requiring manual ventilation), and will be conducted with the aim of&#xD;
      maintaining a pCO2 of 55-65 mmHg and a SpO2 of 90-95% 9, using synchronized VM (patient&#xD;
      triggered ventilation: PTV), or the volume controlled VM, or high frequency ventilation&#xD;
      (HFV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data. For each infant will be recorded: gestational age; birth weight; birth weight&#xD;
      &lt;10th percentile; gender; type of delivery; Apgar score at 5 min; main disorders of pregnancy&#xD;
      (pre-eclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, clinical chorioamniositis, placental&#xD;
      abruption); RDS, whose diagnosis will be based on the occurrence of oxygen-dependence,&#xD;
      tachypnea, dyspnea, exclusion of other causes of respiratory failure, and the presence of a&#xD;
      typical radiological pattern; treatment with surfactant and nitric oxide; need, type and&#xD;
      duration of respiratory assistance (oxygen therapy, NCPAP, BiPAP, N-IMV, PTV, HFV); prenatal&#xD;
      and postnatal steroid treatment. In addition, common complications of prematurity will be&#xD;
      recorded: patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring drug therapy, bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (ICH) of 3-4 grade 13, periventricular&#xD;
      leukomalacia (LPV) 14, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) of grade &gt;3 15, necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC) &lt;2 grade 16, and sepsis. In addition, mortality and the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permitted concomitant pharmacological treatments. The enrolled patients can be treated with&#xD;
      the following drugs: surfactant, caffeine, doxapram, ibuprofen, paracetamol, indomethacin,&#xD;
      dopamine, dobutamine, milrinone, adrenaline, diuretics, antibiotics, glucocorticoids,&#xD;
      immunoglobulins, antiepileptics, nitric oxide, analgesics, sedatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of participating centers. Patients will be enrolled at the neonatal intensive care units&#xD;
      of Careggi University Hospital of Florence and of IRCCS Foundation - Ospedale Maggiore&#xD;
      Policlinico Mangiagalli and Regina Elena of Milan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint. The primary endpoint will be the evaluation of the number of&#xD;
      infants in whom the administration of caffeine intravenously or enterally will occur&#xD;
      successfully in the delivery room delivery within 10 min of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints. Secondary endpoints will be the evaluation of: number of infants in whom&#xD;
      caffeine will be successfully administered by intravenous versus enteral route; number of&#xD;
      infants where caffeine will be successfully administered that reached the therapeutic&#xD;
      plasmatic range the first dose, confirming the success of the administration; comparison of&#xD;
      caffeine blood level obtained with intravenous and enteral administration; frequency of&#xD;
      successes in reaching the therapeutic range after the second dose; frequency of VM within the&#xD;
      first 72 hours of life in studied infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample size. In the absence of previous studies to use as a reference&#xD;
      and this study being a feasibility study, it was decided arbitrarily to study 20 infants&#xD;
      treated in the delivery room with caffeine administered intravenously and 20 infants treated&#xD;
      in the delivery room with caffeine administered enterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description and analysis of data. The clinical characteristics of the two groups will be&#xD;
      described by calculating the mean value and the standard deviation or the rate and&#xD;
      percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be evaluated by calculating the percentage of cases in which&#xD;
      caffeine will be successfully administered. Similarly, the secondary endpoints, represented&#xD;
      by the number of cases in which the therapeutic plasmatic range will be reached after the&#xD;
      first and the second dose of caffeine and the frequency of VM within the first 72 hours of&#xD;
      life, will be evaluated. The comparison between the number of infants in which caffeine will&#xD;
      be successfully administered intravenously versus the enteral route and the comparison&#xD;
      between the caffeine plasma level obtained with intravenous and enteral administration will&#xD;
      be performed using the Student &quot;t&quot; test for continuous parametric variables, the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      rank sum test for non-parametric continuous variables and the Ï‡2 test for categorical&#xD;
      variables. A p &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
