  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CORINTH trial is for patients with more advanced (stage 3 and 4) anal cancer. The numbers&#xD;
      of patients with anal cancer is increasing and only 65% patients with this later stage anal&#xD;
      cancer have not had a recurrence 3 years after treatment. Anal cancer responds well to&#xD;
      chemo-radiation (CRT) and this would be the treatment used for standard clinical care. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy in CORINTH will be the same as standard of care (Mitomycin and 5FU or&#xD;
      capecitabine) and the radiotherapy (RT) will be delivered using a technique where the dose&#xD;
      intensity of RT can be modulated for different areas of the tumor (Intensity Modulated RT -&#xD;
      IMRT). Translational samples (tissue blocks and blood) will be collected at baseline with&#xD;
      further blood and tissue samples during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab, a relatively new drug, is a monoclonal antibody that enhances the body's&#xD;
      immune response to cancer cells by acting on a receptor on the surface of T-cells called&#xD;
      Programmed Death -1 (PD-1). The CORINTH study aims to see whether pembrolizumab, can be added&#xD;
      safely to standard CRT. We will explore how safe the combination is and how well tolerated it&#xD;
      is for patients with stage 3 and 4 anal cancer. If it is tolerable more patients will be&#xD;
      treated to see if there is a similar or better clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed in 3 groups of patients. All patients will receive eight infusions of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab at three weekly intervals. Each infusion lasts approximately 1 hour. The first&#xD;
      group will not get pembrolizumab until they have already had 4 weeks of CRT (Day 29). As long&#xD;
      as this is not found to cause too many extra side effects, the next group will have infusions&#xD;
      at the beginning of the third week of CRT. The final group (cohort 3) will start their&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with the first day of CRT i.e. Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially each group will have 6 patients. Provided each group of patients finds the&#xD;
      treatment tolerable and it is safe, more patients will be recruited into the group that&#xD;
      receives the pembrolizumab earliest during their CRT. This will add further credence to the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the combination and may provide a signal of how effective this&#xD;
      treatment might be in improving outcomes for patients with more advanced anal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CORINTH is a multi center trial with a single arm. Patients will be recruited into 3&#xD;
      successive cohorts followed by an expansion of the final cohort. For each cohort the first&#xD;
      dose of Pembrolizumab will be given at an earlier time point during the chemo-radiation&#xD;
      (CRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemrolizumab will be given as an IV infusion every 21 days, and a total of 8 infusions per&#xD;
      patient at 200mg per infusion. The first dose of Pemrolizumab will be given at the following&#xD;
      times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: beginning at Week 5 day 1 of CRT schedule COHORT 2: beginning at Week 3 day 1 of&#xD;
      CRT schedule COHORT 3: beginning at Week 1 day 1 of CRT schedule** Cohort 2 will be dependent&#xD;
      on a Safety Review Committee (SRC) recommendation. If the SRC are concerned about toxicity in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 but not sufficiently to stop the study, they are able to recommend that Cohort 2 can&#xD;
      change to commence pembrolizumab at week 4. If the SRC are concerned about toxicity in Cohort&#xD;
      2 but not sufficiently to stop the study, they are able to recommend that Cohort 3 can change&#xD;
      to commence pembrolizumab at week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be under the care of a consultant who specializes in the&#xD;
      treatment of anal cancer and the patient will have been identified as requiring CRT treatment&#xD;
      for their anal cancer. They will be assessed for eligibility before being consented and&#xD;
      allocated to the current cohort. # Patients will be monitored for Adverse Events which will&#xD;
      be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.03.&#xD;
      Treatment guidelines are given for any immune related or infusion related events. Adverse&#xD;
      Event review will take place weekly during CRT and at every Pembrolizumab visit as well as&#xD;
      key time during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes will be assessed using the European Organisation for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) tool during CRT, pembrolizumab treatment and follow up. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.)&#xD;
