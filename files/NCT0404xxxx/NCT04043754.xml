  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the most positive documented outcomes of periodontal regenerative therapy (PRT) in&#xD;
      intrabony defects (IBDs) have been achieved with a combination of bone grafts ( BGs) and a&#xD;
      regeneration material like membranes in guided tissue regeneration ( GTR) technique. Among&#xD;
      the graft materials only autogenous bone grafts ( ABGs).and demineralized freeze-dried bone&#xD;
      allografts (DFDBA), are considered regenerative materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polypeptide growth factors revealed a potential application in PRT periodontal because are&#xD;
      the biological mediators during wound healing and regeneration and autologous platelet&#xD;
      concentrates ( PC) constitute a safe and convenient approach to deliver them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among PC, platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF) belongs to a group of second-generation blood&#xD;
      autologous products prepared by peripheral blood centrifugation without any nonclotting&#xD;
      agent, so to obtain a dense three-dimensional clot architecture that concentrates platelets,&#xD;
      fibrin, leukocytes, cytokines, and sustain cellular migration. This clot is then compressed&#xD;
      to obtain elastic and very strong membranes that can be used directly as membranes or as an&#xD;
      agent, after chopping, alone or in combination with BGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrate that PRF is effective in promoting bone regeneration (BR) when&#xD;
      used alone or in combination with BG during oral/ periodontal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are very few published clinical controlled trials that compare the results of&#xD;
      PRF + BGs to the outcomes of PRF / BG alone in the treatment of IBDs and no study about PRF +&#xD;
      ABG in the same defects. Only one case report tested the use of PRF + ABG mixed with bovine&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite in the treatment of insufficient alveolar ridge width in aesthetic area. The&#xD;
      aim of the present study is to verify if the combined use of PRF + ABG in the management of&#xD;
      IBDs may be a treatment modality clinically &quot;not inferior&quot; to that with Membrane + ABG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical and radiographic outcomes 12 months after two treatment modalities of IBDs: PRF +&#xD;
      ABG into defects in the test subjects( TS); membrane + ABG in the control subjects ( CS). The&#xD;
      patients enrolled exhibit unfavourable IBDs and all experimental sites will be accessed with&#xD;
      a simplified papilla preservation flap ( SPPF) procedure. The filling material (ABG) is&#xD;
      common to both treatments: therefore, the investigation will focus on the addictive effect of&#xD;
      PRF used in place of MEMBRANE. MEMBRANE is chosen as the active control ( AC) as it is&#xD;
      currently considered as the biological &quot;gold standard&quot; agent for the treatment of IBDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-inferiority trial ( NIT) is designed to prove that using PRF instead of MEMBRANE could&#xD;
      achieve a similar result, reducing the treatment's cost and allowing the clinicians to use&#xD;
      autogenous material only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AC (comparator) is present, but the investigators do not include a third experimental arm,&#xD;
      a group of IBDs treated using Open Flap Debridement ( OFD) alone, as it is widely accepted in&#xD;
      NITs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimate of the AC effect vs. placebo is assumed from a recent meta-analysis, by the&#xD;
      Lower Bound of a 95% Confidence Interval ( CI) of the mean of MEMBRANE + ABG, while an OFD&#xD;
      estimate from the corresponding 95%.. The difference between estimates is set as the added&#xD;
      benefit of the AC and as a ground for the assay sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      44 patients affected by moderate-to-severe chronic periodontitis, will be selected for the&#xD;
      study. Each patient will participate in the study with a single experimental site. The&#xD;
      participants will receive verbal and written information and they will sign a consent form&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the G. DAnnunzio University of Chieti - medical faculty.&#xD;
      The study protocol is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, revised in&#xD;
      Tokyo in 2004. Four months before the surgical treatment, all 44 patients will undergo SRP by&#xD;
      ultrasonic instruments and hand curettes and motivational instructions on oral home care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inferiority margin. A reliable estimate of the expected clinical attachment level ( CAL)&#xD;
      gain from an MEMBRANE+ ABG treatment is drawn from a recent meta-analysis, reporting on 548&#xD;
      IBDs in 434 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By literature, CAL gain obtainable by OFD surgical treatments alone is 2.47 mm. The&#xD;
      differential effect of using MEMBRANE amounts about 1 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each defect will be assigned a defect number and will be randomly allocated to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment regimens. Assignment will be performed by a custom made computer-generated table.&#xD;
      To conceal allocation, opaque envelopes will be assigned to the specific experimental site&#xD;
      and will be opened during surgery Preoperative and 3- 6- 12-months postoperative intraoral&#xD;
      standardized radiographs will be taken by the paralleling technique using an individual&#xD;
      film-holder device consisting of a bite block rigidly connected to an acrylic dental splint&#xD;
      to achieve identical film placement at each evaluation. Pre- and postoperative radiographs&#xD;
      will be evaluated by two experienced clinicians who will be masked with respect to the&#xD;
      provenience of the radiographs and the clinical measurements. The positions of alveolar crest&#xD;
      level and of the bottom of the defect distance and will be marked by a pencil on the&#xD;
      radiographs and bottom of the defect will be measured by a millimeter grid. Linear distances&#xD;
      between the most coronal interproximal alveolar crest level and the bottom of the defect will&#xD;
      be obtained by counting the walls&#xD;
