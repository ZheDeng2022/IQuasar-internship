  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate, prospectively, the potential impact, on myHealth&#xD;
      Rewards wellness program enrollment prior to the 2019 November submission deadline, of&#xD;
      sending different messages via email to Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) members who have just&#xD;
      been hired.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The myHealth Rewards wellness program managed by GHP rewards those GHP members who carry&#xD;
      their insurance through employment at Geisinger with reduced health insurance premiums over&#xD;
      the course of the following year, if members register for the program and have their health&#xD;
      measures on file by the enrollment deadline and are then able to meet their health goals by&#xD;
      the respective due date. In spite of the potential savings to health plan members and the&#xD;
      wellness program's potential to motivate engagement in healthy activities (with consequent&#xD;
      improvement in health outcomes), about 23% of eligible existing GHP members did not enroll&#xD;
      during the primary 2019 enrollment period, even after receiving promotional email&#xD;
      communications and reminders. Therefore, the current study was developed to test whether a&#xD;
      revised version of a standard welcome email is more effective than the standard email in&#xD;
      increasing myHealth Rewards login and enrollment rates. The standard welcome email is what&#xD;
      would typically be sent by GHP to encourage enrollment among new hires; it mentions the&#xD;
      benefits of enrollment (maintaining good health and saving money on insurance premiums), the&#xD;
      average premium savings, the ease of the registration process, and the deadline for&#xD;
      registering and having health measures on file, plus it provides registration steps and&#xD;
      hyperlinks for registering and finding free health screenings where health measures can be&#xD;
      collected and registered at one convenient time and location. The loss frame email recommends&#xD;
      that GHP members not &quot;throw away&quot; a precise monetary amount in savings by not participating&#xD;
      and that they can therefore avoid missing out on substantial gains (i.e., savings) by taking&#xD;
      action. It is hypothesized that, on average, the loss frame email will increase enrollment&#xD;
      compared with the standard email, among this population of new hires for whom this is only&#xD;
      the second time that they have been informed about myHealth Rewards. Findings will help&#xD;
      inform how best to increase enrollment in a wellness program among health plan members who&#xD;
      are new to the system.&#xD;

    <description>The loss frame email recommends that GHP members not &quot;throw away&quot; a precise dollar amount in savings (over $2,000) by not participating and that they can therefore avoid missing out on substantial gains (i.e., savings) by taking action.&#xD;
This intervention frames the status quo as a state from which recipients, via inaction, are slated to forfeit a sizable and precise monetary amount to which they should otherwise feel entitled (via loss aversion and the endowment effect). People tend to be risk-seeking in the domain of losses; therefore, this intervention is hypothesized to increase enrollment in the hope of achieving zero loss by meeting program goals, as opposed to a sure loss via inaction.</description>
