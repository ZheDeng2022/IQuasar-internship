    <textblock>
      A screening modality to help categorize obese pregnant women as high or low probability for&#xD;
      heart failure would be helpful in the evaluation of the obese pregnant women with dyspnea.&#xD;
      Outside of pregnancy, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or amino-terminal&#xD;
      pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is recommended in the evaluation of acute dyspnea&#xD;
      and in the diagnosis of heart failure. During pregnancy, elevated BNP has been associated&#xD;
      with adverse cardiovascular events, while normal BNP levels have been observed in healthy&#xD;
      pregnancies. While BNP levels outside of pregnancy have been shown to be lower in obese&#xD;
      patients variations in BNP levels by body mass index (BMI) in pregnancy have not been&#xD;
      studied. Before BNP can be deemed a reliable screening test for heart failure in obese&#xD;
      pregnant women, normal BNP values in the setting of obesity and pregnancy need to be&#xD;
      established. We therefore propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Compare mean plasma NT-proBNP levels in the third trimester, immediately&#xD;
      postpartum, and at 4-6 weeks postpartum between obese pregnant women without cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and non-obese pregnant women without cardiovascular disease. We hypothesize that mean&#xD;
      plasma NT-proBNP levels in obese pregnant women without pre-existing cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      will be significantly lower than levels in non-obese pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Assess whether plasma NT-proBNP levels in pregnancy correlate with BMI. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be an inverse correlation between plasma NT-proBNP levels and BMI&#xD;
      in our pregnant cohort similar to that seen outside of pregnancy.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, cross-sectional observational study of pregnant women &gt;=&#xD;
      18-years-old receiving prenatal care through the Duke University Health System. Potential&#xD;
      study subjects will be approached by obstetric providers or by trained research staff at&#xD;
      routine prenatal visits. Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled, accounting for a&#xD;
      potential 10% loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 will be considered obese, while women with BMI &lt;30 will be&#xD;
      included in the non-obese control group. Extremely obese (BMI≥40), obese (30≤BMI&lt;40),&#xD;
      overweight (25≤BMI&lt;30), and non-obese subjects (BMI&lt;25) will be recruited in a 1:1:1:1&#xD;
      fashion. Subjects will not be matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent to participate in the study has been obtained and a patient has been deemed&#xD;
      eligible to participate, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (collected into a&#xD;
      PST tube), maternal weight, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be collected at&#xD;
      the given timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Third-trimester - 27-28 weeks' gestation with third-trimester lab work (CBC, HIV,&#xD;
           glucola)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Admission to labor and delivery (for labor, rupture of membranes, or scheduled delivery)&#xD;
           with admission lab work&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immediate postpartum: 24-48 hours postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Delayed postpartum (4-6 weeks' postpartum to coincide with postpartum visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following additional data will be collected from the electronic medical record: maternal&#xD;
      age, maternal height, maternal pre-pregnancy weight, maternal weight at each time point, best&#xD;
      obstetric estimate of due date, patient-reported race/ethnicity, gravida, para, smoking&#xD;
      status, mode of delivery, delivery date, date of hospital discharge, minimum and maximum&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures during labor admission, type of anesthesia used,&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit at 3rd-trimester lab draw, admission, and immediately postpartum&#xD;
      (if available), and blood loss at delivery. At each visit, subjects will also be questioned&#xD;
      about symptoms and signs of heart failure, including dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, chest&#xD;
      pain, and lower extremity edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PST tubes will be collected by trained research staff at the timepoints listed above. These&#xD;
      will then be sent to the Duke Clinical Lab for analysis, at which point the samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged and the plasma analyzed for NT-proBNP. NT-proBNP will be analyzed using an&#xD;
      electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on the Roche cobas e411 analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit time point, subjects will be asked about any symptoms related to heart&#xD;
      failire. Should they answer yes to any of the questions, the study team will notify their&#xD;
      clinical care team.&#xD;
