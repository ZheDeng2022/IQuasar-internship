  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumor and occur in 20-40% of&#xD;
      all oncological patients. The most common primary cancer in brain metastases is lung cancer,&#xD;
      followed by melanoma, breast cancer, renal cancer and colorectal cancer. The incidence of&#xD;
      brain metastases has been increasing but the occurrence of brain metastases is still&#xD;
      associated with high morbidity and poor prognosis. The main treatment methods are&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), microsurgical resection and whole brain irradiation (WBRT).&#xD;
      The stereotactic Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) is a non-invasive method, applying high dose&#xD;
      radiation into an exact defined volume within the cranium, and thereby associated with&#xD;
      significantly decreased neurotoxicity. It is the only treatment method for multiple&#xD;
      disseminated and thereby non-resectable brain metastases. A novel treatment method of brain&#xD;
      metastases is the combination of GKRS and systematic immunotherapy (IT), targeted therapy&#xD;
      (TT) or chemotherapy, which showed significant improvements in survival. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients with brain metastases often develop cerebral edema, which is commonly treated with&#xD;
      glucocorticoids to relieve the symptoms and decrease the fluid accumulation, but the&#xD;
      long-term use was shown to be unfavorable due to various side effects. One of the potentially&#xD;
      concerning side effect of glucocorticoids is the immunosuppressive properties. This raises&#xD;
      the question of whether glucocorticoids might influence the effect of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim. The aim of the study is to evaluate if the use of glucocorticoids before, during and&#xD;
      after treatment with gamma knife radiosurgery and immunotherapy effect the overall survival&#xD;
      in patients with brain metastases, in contrast to patients undergoing gamma knife&#xD;
      radiosurgery and immunotherapy alone. In addition, the effect of glucocorticoids on&#xD;
      progression-free survival and clinical outcome will be evaluated. For the evaluation of the&#xD;
      modern oncological treatment, patients with gamma knife radiosurgery, receiving&#xD;
      immunotherapy, will be compared to patients not receiving immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods. The investigators plan to conduct a observational prospective&#xD;
      preliminary study including about 200 radiosurgically treated patients with brain metastases.&#xD;
      Patients will be included to our study, if they were diagnosed with one of two most common&#xD;
      primary cancers (lung cancer or melanoma) and were treated with at least one Gamma Knife&#xD;
      radiosurgical treatment for at least one brain metastasis. For the outcome evaluation of the&#xD;
      different treatment options, a comprehensive database will be established. The study&#xD;
      participations will not interfere with any clincally indicated therapeutic decisions and the&#xD;
      study participants will not be exposed to any additional risks.&#xD;
