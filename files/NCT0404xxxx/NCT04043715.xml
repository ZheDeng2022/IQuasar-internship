  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incomplete spinal cord injuries (SCI) are the most frequent neurologic category, comprising&#xD;
      66.7% of all SCI cases. People with incomplete SCI may retain some ability to move the legs&#xD;
      and therefore the capacity to regain walking. Studies that show functional improvement in&#xD;
      locomotion via electrical stimulation of lumbosacral circuits suggest that the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms are neuromodulation of lumbosacral spinal cord automaticity and sensory feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both epidural and transcutaneous spinal stimulation are demonstrating exciting potential to&#xD;
      improve limb function for people after chronic SCI. Available treatment options for SCI are&#xD;
      less than satisfactory and most often do not achieve full restoration of function. Recent&#xD;
      experimental results suggest an exciting new approach of using electrical spinal stimulation&#xD;
      to enable users to regain control of their weak or paralyzed muscles. Using&#xD;
      surgically-implanted electrodes, epidural stimulation results in remarkable improvements of&#xD;
      lower extremity function as well as autonomic functions such as bladder function and sexual&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to epidural stimulation, over only the last few years a novel strategy of skin&#xD;
      surface electrical spinal stimulation has also demonstrated exciting potential for improving&#xD;
      walking function. Using a high-frequency stimulation pulse, current can pass through the skin&#xD;
      without discomfort and activate the spinal cord; this results in patterned stepping movements&#xD;
      for people without SCI and improved lower extremity function following SCI. This study will&#xD;
      directly compare skin-surface transcutaneous stimulation with implanted epidural stimulation&#xD;
      for improving lower extremity function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal method for delivering spinal&#xD;
      stimulation to improve walking in people with incomplete spinal cord injury. By directly&#xD;
      comparing non-invasive transcutaneous (TransQ) stimulation with implanted epidural&#xD;
      stimulation, investigators hope to guide the field toward the most beneficial method for&#xD;
      restoration of lower extremity function. In addition, the investigators may identify&#xD;
      subgroups of people that respond better to each type of stimulation, informing personalized&#xD;
      treatment for people with different types of spinal cord injury. The research team will&#xD;
      explore the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Evaluate the improvements in lower extremity and autonomic function via transcutaneous&#xD;
      spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy for people with chronic SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Quantify additional improvements in lower extremity and autonomic function via&#xD;
      epidural spinal stimulation and intensive physical therapy for people with chronic SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that epidural stimulation leads to greater&#xD;
      improvements than an equal dose of transcutaneous stimulation. To compare these 2 stimulation&#xD;
      methods the study team will evaluate voluntary control of muscle activity via EMG and&#xD;
      kinematic parameters of locomotion, as well as improvements in bladder and other autonomic&#xD;
      functions and overall quality of life.&#xD;
