  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaesthesia is often performed using a balanced technique by administering both opioids and&#xD;
      anaesthetics agents. Intraoperative opioid administration is still relying on simple&#xD;
      parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure variations. However, many studies in both&#xD;
      adults and children have shown the poor accuracy of those parameters in predicting pain&#xD;
      because of their sensibility to other intraoperative events such as depth of anaesthesia and&#xD;
      volaemic variations. Consequently, intraoperative analgesia is still inadequately managed&#xD;
      with periods of under dosage or over dosage of opioid agents. This has been hypothesized to&#xD;
      cause postoperative hyperalgesia related to both intraoperative pain (in case of under&#xD;
      dosage) or to opioid agents (in case of over dosage). The main resulting effect is an&#xD;
      increase of postoperative opioid consumption and the inadequate postoperative rehabilitation&#xD;
      because of adverse effects of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last decade, many pain-monitors have been investigated. Most of these devices are&#xD;
      relying on the determination of the sympathetic-to the parasympathetic systems balance. Among&#xD;
      those monitors, the Analgesia Nociceptive Index (ANI) quantifies the parasympathetic system.&#xD;
      The ANI device can produce two parameters the instantaneous ANI (ANIi), derived from 60&#xD;
      seconds analysis and the mean ANI (ANIm) derived from 4 minutes analysis. Studies have shown&#xD;
      the accuracy of ANIi to detect both experimental and clinical pain in various populations.&#xD;
      Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial during spine surgery in adults has found ANIi&#xD;
      to decrease the intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption when used&#xD;
      intraoperatively for guiding the administration of opioid agents&#xD;
