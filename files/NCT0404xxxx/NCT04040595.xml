      Obesity is a major risk factor for Type 2 diabetes. However, two obese people of the same&#xD;
      height and weight can have very different risks of the condition. As a greater proportion of&#xD;
      the population is becoming obese, scientists need to understand more about why some people&#xD;
      develop Type 2 diabetes at lower weight and why some people stay healthy despite being obese.&#xD;
      The investigators and others provided evidence for genetic factors associated with higher&#xD;
      weight for a given height but lower risk of diabetes, lower cholesterol and fat levels, lower&#xD;
      blood pressure and lower risk of heart disease. The investigators showed that people who&#xD;
      carry these genetic factors are able to store extra fat in a safe place, which is under the&#xD;
      skin, as they gain weight. The proposed project aims to establish whether or not these&#xD;
      genetic factors are associated with better development and function of fat tissue in storing&#xD;
      extra fat. It is thought that a healthy and functional fat tissue in the human body has a key&#xD;
      role in modifying the risk of diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers from Exeter 10,000 who gave their permission to contact them about further&#xD;
      research will be recruited to the study. In those that agree, detailed body size measures,&#xD;
      including body composition assessments by the BodPodTM machine will be recorded, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected, and a small subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsy will be collected to&#xD;
      measure fat cell size and from which a sample will be stored for future analyses. The results&#xD;
      between people with and without the particular genetic changes of interest will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing more about these genetic changes and how fat cells work could help to improve&#xD;
      understanding of the factors that predispose, delay or protect obese individuals from Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and other metabolic disturbances.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is the most common chronic metabolic disease and is a major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. It is one of the biggest healthcare challenges facing the United Kingdom's (UK)&#xD;
      National Health Service (NHS) with more than 2.6 million adults diagnosed in the UK, with the&#xD;
      vast majority (90%) having Type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is anticipated that the numbers will&#xD;
      continue to rise, in part due to the increasing levels of obesity in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes is characterised by high blood glucose levels in the context of increasing&#xD;
      insulin resistance and reduced beta cell function, and this can develop over several years&#xD;
      with individuals unaware of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research groups in Exeter are leading efforts to identify the genetic factors that influence&#xD;
      why some people develop Type 2 diabetes despite relative leanness, whilst many obese people&#xD;
      do not get the disease. The investigators have identified many such factors but now wish to&#xD;
      study them in more detail to understand the role of a healthy and functioning adipose tissue&#xD;
      in the disease mechanism. This study builds on a previous 'recruit by genotype' study to&#xD;
      explore the size of fat cells in people carrying the most genetic factors for being fatter&#xD;
      but healthier (fATDIVA (for Adipose Tissue DIabetes VAriants) NCT02505321). The investigators&#xD;
      will expand on the range of genetic variations to be undertaken in the research volunteers.&#xD;
      The preliminary data from fATDIVA helped to secure prestigious funding from Diabetes UK to&#xD;
      expand this work to improve understanding of the complex processes that lead to Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are trying to understand how genetic variations cause differences in the&#xD;
      human ability to store fat. The hypothesis to be tested is that individuals carrying&#xD;
      different genetic variations have different abilities to store fat under the skin as&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat tissue. This could lead to an improved understanding of subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      storage. It is very unlikely that scientists will be able to reverse substantially the rising&#xD;
      numbers of people becoming overweight or obese as they age, therefore this study's findings&#xD;
      could be important in identifying how to reduce the risk of disease caused by obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study that will take place over a 30 month period (March&#xD;
      2019 to August 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be identified from existing research cohorts managed by the National&#xD;
      Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Exeter Clinical Research Facility (Exeter CRF) and&#xD;
      recruitment will be facilitated within the Exeter CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under over-arching ethical approval 09/H0106/75, approximately 8900 anonymised DNA samples&#xD;
      have whole genome genotype data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will provide the Exeter Clinical Research Facility (Exeter CRF) with a list&#xD;
      of the sample numbers that fulfil the inclusion criteria. The Exeter CRF will approach these&#xD;
      individuals on the researcher's behalf to ask if they would be willing to provide body fat&#xD;
      measures, a blood sample and an abdominal fat biopsy. Participants would be invited to a&#xD;
      single visit lasting up to 2 hours at the Exeter CRF for data and sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will then be contacted directly by a member of the study team who&#xD;
      will be responsible for the recruitment process, providing more detailed verbal and written&#xD;
      project-specific information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will aim to target men only to increase power for two reasons. First, men&#xD;
      and women have different body shape and different fat distribution. Men tend to store the&#xD;
      extra fat in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue while women tend to store it in the lower&#xD;
      body. Second, the study of fat biopsy samples in women could be affected by menopause which&#xD;
      could cause bias in the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as the target sample size is 500 and the number of men who fulfil the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria is approximately 3000, this will be reviewed after a year. If projections indicate&#xD;
      that the target sample size will not be met, women will also be recruited in the second year.&#xD;
