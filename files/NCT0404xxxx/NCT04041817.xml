  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure support ventilation allows intubated ICU patients to breathe spontaneously. Among&#xD;
      specific settings, the adjustment of the trigger value (or threshold for triggering the&#xD;
      ventilator) has not been explored to date. The trigger threshold corresponds to the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the ventilator to detect patient's inspiratory effort and then deliver the&#xD;
      predefined pressure support to inflate the lungs and deliver a tidal volume. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to explore the influence of trigger level on pulmonary and ventilatory physio&#xD;
      (-patho)logical parameters in spontaneously breathing ICU patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of invasive mechanical ventilation is one of the most frequent therapies in intensive&#xD;
      care units (ICUs). There are several types of indications, depending on the failure:&#xD;
      essentially neurological, hemodynamic or respiratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the notion of lung damage induced by mechanical ventilation (VILI) has led&#xD;
      to major changes in ventilator settings in both ICUs and operative rooms (Ors). The reduction&#xD;
      of the tidal volume (TV) to 6-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight, the use of an individualized&#xD;
      positive end-of-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the possible use of pulmonary aeration&#xD;
      optimization therapies (alveolar recruitment manoeuvres, prone positioning sessions...) have&#xD;
      become essential to increase patient's survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of invasive mechanical ventilation remains a daily issue and traditionally&#xD;
      requires the transition from fully controlled ventilation to pressure support ventilation.&#xD;
      Among specific settings of the latter, the adjustment of the trigger value (or threshold for&#xD;
      triggering the ventilator) has not been explored to date. The trigger threshold corresponds&#xD;
      to the sensitivity of the ventilator to detect patient's inspiratory effort and then deliver&#xD;
      the predefined pressure support to inflate the lungs and deliver a tidal volume. The lower&#xD;
      (or more sensitive) the trigger threshold, the smallest patient's effort will be rewarded. On&#xD;
      the other hand, the higher the threshold, the greater the inspiratory effort required from&#xD;
      the patient. Usually, this value is set by default to the minimum level to avoid&#xD;
      self-triggering of the ventilator. With the objective to optimize pulmonary aeration, the use&#xD;
      of higher trigger levels could increase diaphragmatic work (with a potential re-training and&#xD;
      reinforcement effect) and contribute to better alveolar recruitment in the postero-inferior&#xD;
      territories that are traditionally the most impacted, following a higher diaphragmatic&#xD;
      motion. The authors propose to explore the impact of different trigger levels on pulmonary&#xD;
      aeration (evaluated by electrical impedance tomography) and ventilatory parameters, in order&#xD;
      to validate our hypotheses and before considering a trial with the objective of defining&#xD;
      individualized trigger levels, according to patient's respiratory mechanics and pulmonary&#xD;
      parenchyma morphology, with potential benefits on ventilator weaning.&#xD;
