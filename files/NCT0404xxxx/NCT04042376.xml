    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib based on overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) (partial response [PR] or better) by investigator assessment per the modified&#xD;
      Consensus Response Criteria from the Sixth International Workshop on Waldenstrom's&#xD;
      Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) (NCCN 2019), in Chinese participants with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.&#xD;
