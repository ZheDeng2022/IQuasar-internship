      1. Background &amp; Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over 650,000 endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) procedures are&#xD;
           performed annually in the United States alone. ERCP is universally performed using a&#xD;
           highly specialized type of flexible endoscope called a duodenoscope. Though critical for&#xD;
           the successful completion of ERCP, the design of duodenoscopes makes them among the most&#xD;
           complicated medical devices that require routine disinfection and reprocessing. In&#xD;
           recent years, several ERCP-related infectious outbreaks have occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, it is clear that novel strategies need to be developed in order to prevent future&#xD;
           ERCP-related outbreaks. Specialized duodenoscopes with disposable caps have been&#xD;
           developed, and these represent a promising new modality with the potential to&#xD;
           drastically reduce the rates of duodenoscope-related infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Questions &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are two co-primary outcomes in this study; the first is to determine the clinical&#xD;
           efficacy of a novel duodenoscope with a disposable elevator cap (DEC) system compared&#xD;
           with a duodenoscope with a traditional design. The second co-primary objective is to&#xD;
           determine the rate of persistent pathogenic contamination of the novel duodenoscope&#xD;
           following standardized disinfection and reprocessing protocols compared with a&#xD;
           traditional duodenoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, consecutive, randomized controlled study. The intervention arm will&#xD;
      comprise use of the ED34-i10T2 duodenoscope with DEC, along with any required standard ERCP&#xD;
      accessories, whereas the control arm will comprise use of the ED34-i10T duodenoscope with any&#xD;
      required ERCP accessories. All procedures will be performed by expert endoscopists with&#xD;
      adequate training, or by advanced endoscopy trainees under direct supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data will include primary endpoints listed above, in addition to patient&#xD;
      demographics, endoscopist and trainee data, sedation used, procedural details, and&#xD;
      peri-procedural data. Data will be collected at index procedure and at 30-day follow-up. All&#xD;
      data will be recorded on REDCap.&#xD;

      There are two co-primary objectives of this study; the first is to determine the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel duodenoscope with a disposable elevator cap (DECTM) system compared with&#xD;
      a duodenoscope with a traditional design. The second is to determine the rate of persistent&#xD;
      pathogenic contamination of the novel duodenoscope following standardized disinfection and&#xD;
      reprocessing protocols, compared with a traditional duodenoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, consecutive, randomized controlled study which will assess 1) the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of DEC versus standard duodenoscopes and 2) the persistent bacterial&#xD;
      contamination rate of DEC versus standard duodenoscopes. The intervention arm will comprise&#xD;
      use of the ED34-i10T2 duodenoscope with DEC, along with any required standard ERCP&#xD;
      accessories, whereas the control arm will comprise use of the ED34-i10T duodenoscope with any&#xD;
      required ERCP accessories. The study will take place at a single high-volume tertiary ERCP&#xD;
      referral center in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where over 1,500 ERCPs are performed annually.&#xD;
      All procedures will be performed by trained endoscopists having each performed over 1,000&#xD;
      ERCPs or by advanced therapeutic endoscopy trainees under direct supervision of the expert&#xD;
      endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients at the study center who meet the eligibility criteria below will be&#xD;
      invited for participation in the study. Patients who sign the informed consent form will be&#xD;
      considered enrolled. In cases where it is determined that the patient failed to meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria after the patient has agreed to participate in the study and/or has&#xD;
      signed the informed consent, the study personnel will complete screening forms as well as&#xD;
      indicate the specific inclusion/exclusion criterion that was not met. Such a patient will be&#xD;
      considered a screen failure and will not count towards the final analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria above will be randomized following&#xD;
      consent in a 1:1 ratio. Permuted block randomization will be utilized in blocks of 8&#xD;
      patients. Allocation will be to one of two groups: 1) ERCP using ED34-i10T2 duodenoscope with&#xD;
      DEC or 2) ERCP using a conventional duodenoscope (ED34-i10T). Confidential random number&#xD;
      allocation will be accessed via a secure internet software. The study investigators, outcome&#xD;
      adjudicators and patients will be blinded to allocation. The endoscopist will not be blinded.&#xD;
      In cases where additional or alternate duodenoscope(s) is/are required to achieve the desired&#xD;
      goal of the ERCP procedure, the choice(s) of device(s) will be left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      endoscopist, regardless of the study arm to which the patient has been allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously designed and implemented the Calgary Registry for Advanced&#xD;
      and Therapeutic Endoscopy (CReATE, University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board 18-0410). CReATE is a high-fidelity prospective database that seeks to answer questions&#xD;
      in ERCP outcomes research. As such, over 400 data fields are collected in real-time for each&#xD;
      ERCP procedure, including detailed patient-, endoscopist- and procedure-based variables.&#xD;
      Therefore, CReATE serves as the ideal data collection platform for this prospective&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are inputted by a full-time research assistant, and stored and managed on a secure web&#xD;
      application specializing in healthcare database implementation and maintenance, REDCap.19&#xD;
      This web portal allows for facile access to secure data. The web portal is secured by the&#xD;
      latest security technology. Study participants will be identifiable on the secure platform&#xD;
      for purposes of patient contact, follow-up and potential withdrawal. For the purposes of this&#xD;
      randomized study, an additional tab will be created in the electronic interface that will&#xD;
      allow for entry of the arm to which the patient has been randomized. Whenever data are&#xD;
      exported for analysis, they will be de-identified and assigned unique study codes only. The&#xD;
      primary investigator will be the custodian of the identifiable electronic data, which will be&#xD;
      stored only on a secure server accessible only via combination of password protection and&#xD;
      temporary electronic fob.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients undergoing ERCP will be flagged as potentially eligible for study&#xD;
      participation. On the day of the procedure, the patient will be approached by a research&#xD;
      assistant (RA), who will explain the study, confirm eligibility, and answer any potential&#xD;
      questions. If the patient agrees to participate, the relevant informed consent form is signed&#xD;
      and witnessed. If the patient decides not to participate, the ERCP proceeds as per the usual&#xD;
      standard of care, with or without the use of DEC as per the endoscopist's discretion (and the&#xD;
      sequence that follows does not apply).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The RA collects any relevant patient-related and pre-procedural data through combination&#xD;
           of direct patient interview and review of the medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient is randomized to one of the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The patient enters the endoscopy/fluoroscopy room and the procedure commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During the ERCP procedure, relevant peri-procedural data are recorded by the RA by&#xD;
           direct observation, and/or, if necessary, in consultation with the procedural&#xD;
           physician(s) and/or nurse(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After the procedure is complete, the patient is moved to the recovery room for&#xD;
           observation. Depending on their disposition and the course of the procedure, observation&#xD;
           times and protocols differ. During this stage, the RA collects any relevant&#xD;
           post-procedural data, and any missing pre- or peri-procedural data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Any peri- or immediate post-procedural adverse event(s) is/are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The patient is examined by the endoscopist prior to discharge and provided with written&#xD;
           post-procedure information, including a phone number to call in the event of any issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The RA meets with the patient prior to their discharge from the unit to answer any final&#xD;
           potential questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ERCP is complete, the in-room nursing team will carry out standardized&#xD;
      post-endoscopy manual cleaning and disinfection of the DEC or traditional duodenoscope. In&#xD;
      cases where the DEC was used, the cap will be disposed of. These processes will be timed by&#xD;
      the research assistant. Following this, the scope will be portered to the automated&#xD;
      reprocessing room for disinfection and reprocessing, which will also be timed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reprocessing, staff will then observe the following sequence to determine whether there&#xD;
      is any persistent bacterial contamination despite standardized disinfection and reprocessing.&#xD;
      These samples will then be shipped for microbiologic analysis. The protocol for duodenoscope&#xD;
      sampling that will be utilized for this study is adapted from the Duodenoscope Surveillance&#xD;
      Sampling and Culturing Protocols, which were developed jointly by the Department of Health&#xD;
      and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC), and American Society for Microbiology (ASM).24 The procedure is summarized&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two staff are needed to conduct sampling from duodenoscope channels; one person (the&#xD;
           sampler) will maintain aseptic handling and conduct brushing steps, while the second&#xD;
           person (the facilitator) will open packages and handle the unsampled portions of the&#xD;
           duodenoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The staff will label the sterile sample containers with relevant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The staff will don their personal protective equipment (PPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The staff will set the duodenoscope on a sterile drape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Two samples will be collected and combined. First, an instrument channel sample (from&#xD;
           the biopsy port to the distal scope end) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Second, an elevator recess sample will be taken by flushing and brushing of the elevator&#xD;
           recess (in the case of the disposable cap, the distal scope tip to which the disposable&#xD;
           cap attaches will be sampled instead, ensuring sampling of the joint line between cap&#xD;
           and scope).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The duodenoscope will then be handled and transported back to the endoscopy unit&#xD;
           according to our local institutional policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Samples will be packed in appropriate biohazard containers, packaged, and transported&#xD;
           for microbiologic analysis. The samples will be assigned a unique study number so that&#xD;
           the microbiologic analysts will be blinded to the type of duodenoscope that was used for&#xD;
           the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of any post-reprocessing bacterial population(s) will be assessed using plating&#xD;
      for growth aerobic and anaerobic conditions. If after 72 hours there is no growth, the sample&#xD;
      will be deemed negative, and will be discarded. Positive samples will further be&#xD;
      characterized using serial dilutions to establish colony-forming unit (CFU) counts and&#xD;
      sequenced for characterization of bacterial communities using a 16S rRNA amplicon&#xD;
      Next-generation sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by the RA by telephone 30 days following their ERCP to assess for&#xD;
      any ongoing symptoms and advise of any adverse events, including unplanned emergency&#xD;
      department visits or inpatient admissions. The patient's medical record is also reviewed at&#xD;
      30 days for complete details of any unplanned emergency department visits, inpatient&#xD;
      admissions or prolonged admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use&#xD;
      Good Practice Guidelines, a participant is free to withdraw from participation in the study&#xD;
      at any time, for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician&#xD;
      or the institution. The investigator(s) may also withdraw the participant at any time in the&#xD;
      interests of patient safety. Participants may be removed from the study if one or more of the&#xD;
      following events occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  withdrawal of consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decision is made by the investigator(s) that removal from the study is in the patient's&#xD;
           best medical interest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study is stopped by ethics/regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the primary or any additional&#xD;
      reason(s) shall be reported. All applicable case report forms up to the point of subject&#xD;
      withdrawal, including an End of Study form, should be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are &quot;lost-to-follow-up&quot; will have three documented attempts to contact them&#xD;
      prior to completion of the End of Study form. If withdrawal is due to investigator's&#xD;
      discretion, the investigator should describe what follow-up activities the investigator shall&#xD;
      perform. Unless the withdrawal is due to a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), additional subject&#xD;
      data will not be collected after the point at which the subject has been withdrawn or&#xD;
      withdraws consent from the study. Data collected up to the point of withdrawal may be used by&#xD;
      the investigators as permitted in the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be considered complete when participants are no longer being&#xD;
      examined or the last participant's final 30-day follow-up check has occurred. A participant&#xD;
      will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed the index procedure&#xD;
      in addition to the follow-up phone assessment at the 30-day timepoint.&#xD;
