    <textblock>
      This study is a non-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial designed to compare the&#xD;
      effect of outpatient oral antibiotics (i.e., amoxicillin and azithromycin) on the length of&#xD;
      time (days) that pregnancy continues after a patient's water bag has ruptured prematurely. If&#xD;
      a patient has been diagnosed with rupture of their water bag between 18 0/7 weeks and 22 6/7&#xD;
      weeks and there are no other associated complications with the pregnancy, the patient is&#xD;
      eligible for initial consideration for this study. Patients will be admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      for a 24-hour monitoring period. If the patient remains without further complications during&#xD;
      this monitoring period, the patient will be eligible for enrollment. If enrollment is&#xD;
      desired, the patient will be randomly assigned to receive either antibiotics (treatment arm&#xD;
      of the study) or no antibiotics (control arm of the study). The treatment arm will receive an&#xD;
      outpatient, 7-day course of oral antibiotics (azithromycin and amoxicillin) with the first&#xD;
      dose given in the hospital to ensure no side effects. The control arm will not receive&#xD;
      outpatient antibiotics. Both groups will have weekly, office follow-up visits with high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancy specialists to ensure no further complications. Both groups will be admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital if the patients reach 23 0/7 weeks without complications. At this time the patients&#xD;
      will receive all medications and therapies recommended by the governing board of OBGYNs.&#xD;
      Subjects of both groups will also be admitted before 23 0/7 weeks if further complications&#xD;
      noted either at their clinic follow up visits or anytime outside of the hospital. The&#xD;
      duration of time that the patient remains pregnant after breaking of the water bag will be&#xD;
      compared in each group. The investigators will also see if there is a difference in the&#xD;
      number of patients able to reach 23 0/7 weeks between each group (treatment versus control).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout this detailed description, patient and subject will be used interchangeably.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting to either an acute care setting (Woman's Hospital Assessment Center) or&#xD;
      outpatient clinic setting with concerns for rupture of membranes will be clinically evaluated&#xD;
      by an obstetrician (including private physicians, resident faculty and resident physicians).&#xD;
      Exam findings including either/or 1) visualization of amniotic fluid passing from the&#xD;
      cervical canal and pooling in the vagina via sterile speculum examination, 2) a basic pH&#xD;
      (i.e., positive nitrazine) test of vaginal fluid, 3) arborization (ferning) of dried vaginal&#xD;
      fluid identified via microscopic examination by the examining physician, or 4) an amniotic&#xD;
      fluid index (AFI) of less than 4cm between 18 0/7 and 22 6/7 weeks gestation are to be&#xD;
      diagnostic of previable, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Eighteen weeks&#xD;
      gestational was arbitrarily chosen as the lower limit of gestational ages included based on&#xD;
      review of currently available retrospective studies on previable PPROM. If patient meets all&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria as listed above specimens to be collected at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis include a catheterized urinalysis with reflex urine culture if indicated, wet prep&#xD;
      (i.e., vaginitis panel), group B strep DNA recto-vaginal swab, complete blood count and PCR&#xD;
      testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomonas via endocervical swab. An ultrasound to&#xD;
      determine amniotic fluid index (AFI) should also be performed at this time (either by&#xD;
      radiology or Maternal-Fetal Medicine). These will be collected according to current standard&#xD;
      of care practices for preterm prelabor rupture of membranes. Patient will then be admitted to&#xD;
      the Woman's Hospital Labor and Delivery unit for a 24-hour observation period. Acetaminophen&#xD;
      and ibuprofen will be withheld during this 24-hour observation period in order to ensure that&#xD;
      no signs or symptoms of underlying infection or preterm labor are masked. A repeat complete&#xD;
      blood count will be performed the morning of hospital day 2, and repeat AFI on hospital day 2&#xD;
      to be performed with full obstetric ultrasound by Maternal Fetal medicine physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, during the 24-hour observation period, the subject is without signs of chorioamnionitis,&#xD;
      preterm labor, or placental abruption with vaginal bleeding as determined by the MFM staff,&#xD;
      and if patient continues to meet both inclusion and exclusion criteria, subject will then be&#xD;
      offered enrollment in the study. The consenting process will be performed by the MFM staff&#xD;
      physicians or by Felicia LeMoine, MD, or Kaitlyn Taylor, MD, the co-investigators. The&#xD;
      consenting process will be performed within the patient's private hospital room (designated&#xD;
      at the time of admission). Once the subject as agreed to voluntary participation and&#xD;
      in-formed consent has been signed, the subject will then be assigned an individual study&#xD;
      identifier that includes the study acronym OAPPPROM patient initials, and unique number&#xD;
      (randomly generated using the sample () function in R statistical software). All blood&#xD;
      samples and specimens collected prior to admission, at admission and future blood samples and&#xD;
      specimens will be available to the treating physician and reported within the patient's chart&#xD;
      as is current standard practice. The samples and specimens will also be referenced using the&#xD;
      patient's unique identifier for the sake of research data collection. The enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will then be randomized using a computer-generated sample without replacement from the&#xD;
      patient ID numbers into either the control (no antibiotics) or treatment (antibiotics) arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 24-hour observation period and randomization, those subjects enrolled into the&#xD;
      treatment (antibiotics) arm of the study will be thoroughly counseled on the risks and&#xD;
      adverse side effects associated with the use of azithromycin and amoxicillin and which of&#xD;
      those side effects should prompt emergency evaluation at Woman's Hospital Assessment Center&#xD;
      or the nearest emergency department with obstetrical care. The subjects of the treatment arm&#xD;
      will also receive the first dose of antibiotics while in the hospital to ensure no immediate&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms of the study will receive, at the time of discharge, a &quot;Patient Information&#xD;
      Pamphlet&quot; along with a thermometer to take home. All subjects will be instructed on proper&#xD;
      methods to measure body temperature with the thermometer. All subjects will be thoroughly&#xD;
      counseled on symptoms or findings which should prompt immediately follow-up at Woman's&#xD;
      Hospital or the nearest emergency department with obstetrical care. Such symptoms include,&#xD;
      but are not limited to, vaginal bleeding, fevers, chills, purulent vaginal discharge,&#xD;
      contractions, pelvic pain or cramping, abdominal pain or cramping, or any other concerns.&#xD;
      Subjects will be counseled on avoidance of sexual intercourse and avoidance of overt&#xD;
      exertion, yet, strict bed rest will not be advised. Subjects will be instructed to keep the&#xD;
      &quot;Patient Information Pamphlet&quot; with them at all times while enrolled in this study. If&#xD;
      patient either reports a lost or misplaced pamphlet at any point during the study or presents&#xD;
      to any scheduled follow up appointment in the MFM clinic without the pamphlet, the patient&#xD;
      will be provided with a new copy. The pamphlet includes a daily temperature log, an&#xD;
      adverse/side effect log, and emergency contact information for key figures involved in this&#xD;
      study. The pamphlet also includes a table in which dates and findings (i.e., EGA, maternal&#xD;
      heart rate, fetal heart rate, maternal blood pressure, maternal temperature, and AFI) from&#xD;
      follow-up MFM appointments are to be logged. The initial MFM follow-up appointment will be&#xD;
      scheduled prior to discharge from the hospital for all subjects enrolled. Documentation of&#xD;
      scheduled time and date will be noted on patient's discharge paperwork. Follow-up for both&#xD;
      arms of the study will be scheduled within the MFM outpatient clinic weekly until subjects&#xD;
      either reach 23 0/7 weeks gestation or show signs of change in clinical condition. Weekly&#xD;
      follow-up visits will consist of vital signs (maternal heart rate, maternal blood pressure,&#xD;
      temperature and weight), a physical examination of subject, an obstetric ultrasound to assess&#xD;
      fetal well-being, calculate amniotic fluid index, and determine fetal heart rate, and weekly&#xD;
      complete blood counts (lab draws). Patients will also be instructed to bring the antibiotic&#xD;
      pill bottles the initial follow up appointment. The number of pills remaining will be counted&#xD;
      to assess degree of antibiotic compliance. The results of these assessments, along with a&#xD;
      copy of the &quot;Patient Information Pamphlet&quot;, will be made at each follow up visit and stored&#xD;
      within a data collection sheet. Each patient will be assigned an individual data collection&#xD;
      sheet which will be marked with the patient's medical record number and unique subject&#xD;
      identifier (determined as mentioned above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the data collection sheets will be stored within a secure research binder. This binder&#xD;
      will be kept secure in a locked desk drawer, within a locked office (MFM office located at&#xD;
      100 Woman's Way, Baton Rouge, LA 70817), when not in use. Access to study data will only be&#xD;
      granted to Robert Clifton Moore, MD, Felicia LeMoine, MD, and Kaitlyn Taylor, MD during the&#xD;
      study period. Following completion of the study, a final Excel spreadsheet will be created&#xD;
      which will include all data previously collected, including the patient's unique identifier&#xD;
      but excluding the patient's medical record number (de-identified). The final, compiled&#xD;
      spreadsheet with de-identified data will be made available to Andrew Chapple, PhD for final&#xD;
      data analysis. Upon completion of finalized data spreadsheet, the hard copies contained&#xD;
      within the designated research binder will be disposed of in a secured, locked shred bin on&#xD;
      Woman's Hospital campus. The spreadsheet will be encrypted and stored on an&#xD;
      password-protected and encrypted laptop, property of the investigator Felicia LeMoine, MD.&#xD;
      The spreadsheet will not be stored or saved onto any of the various, available internet&#xD;
      storage services (i.e., DropBox, Google Drive, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any point during the study, subjects of either arm show signs of infection (fever,&#xD;
      rigors, chills, pain), labor, abruption (vaginal bleeding), or fetal distress, subjects will&#xD;
      be admitted to Woman's Hospital for induction of labor/delivery as recommended per&#xD;
      established standards of care. Delivering physician will be either the patient's primary&#xD;
      obstetrician or MFM specialist if subject received prenatal care at facility outside of&#xD;
      Woman's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subject and the fetus show signs of continued stability with no adverse events/side&#xD;
      effects, signs of chorioamnionitis, infection, labor, or placental abruption, from the time&#xD;
      of rupture until 23 0/7 weeks gestation, the subject will be readmitted to Woman's Hospital's&#xD;
      Labor and Delivery Unit at 23 0/7 for continued inpatient management until delivery. At the&#xD;
      time of readmission, both treatment and control arms will receive fetal neuroprotective&#xD;
      magnesium sulfate (6 gram loading dose, 6g in 100mL in-fused over 15- 20 minutes, followed by&#xD;
      maintenance dose of 2g/hour at rate of 50mls/hr of 20g/500mL for a minimum of 12 hours),&#xD;
      betamethasone course for fetal lung maturity (12mg intramuscular admin-istered every 24 hours&#xD;
      for total of two doses), and latency antibiotics (a single dose of azithromycin 1g orally&#xD;
      with 48-hour course of ampicillin 2g intravenously every 6 hours followed by amoxicillin&#xD;
      500mg orally every 9 hours for 5 days) as guided by current standard of care practices.&#xD;
      Duration of treatment with magnesium sulfate will be standardized to a total of 12 hours on&#xD;
      readmission and a plan for restart of medication if delivery is felt to imminent and at a&#xD;
      gestational age of less than 34 weeks. While subjects are receiving magnesium sulfate,&#xD;
      routine evaluations to assess for signs of magnesium toxicity will be performed as is&#xD;
      outlined in the hospital policy regarding magnesium administration in pregnancy. Briefly this&#xD;
      includes monitoring for signs and symptoms of magnesium overdose and therapy with calcium&#xD;
      gluconate as need for magnesium toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other orders to be instituted at the time of readmission include a repeat culture of urine,&#xD;
      complete blood cell count, Maternal Fetal Medicine consultation, fetal ultrasound, regular&#xD;
      diet, IV with saline lock, bed rest with bathroom privileges and fetal non-stress testing&#xD;
      twice per day. Obstetric ultra-sounds will be repeated by the Maternal-Fetal medicine&#xD;
      specialists within 24 hours of readmission and at least once every 7 days till delivery is&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rescue course of betamethasone (single dose of 12mg intramuscularly) will be administered&#xD;
      if the subject does not deliver within 14 days of completion of the initial 2-dose course of&#xD;
      betamethasone and if delivery is suspected within the next seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery following readmission will be at the discretion of the attending obstetrician in&#xD;
      regards to evidence of maternal or fetal infection, labor, non-reassuring fetal assessment or&#xD;
      placental abruption in addition to any other standard indication for delivery (ie.,&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia) or if patient reaches 34 0/7 weeks gestational age. Route of delivery will be&#xD;
      determined by routine obstetrical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigational products (study drugs) will be stored under appropriate storage&#xD;
      conditions in a secure area according to local regulations. The investigator is responsible&#xD;
      for ensuring that it is dispensed only to study subjects and only from official study sites&#xD;
      by authorized personnel, as dictated by local regulations. The investigator is responsible&#xD;
      for ensuring that the investigational product is stored under the appropriate environmental&#xD;
      conditions (temperature, light, and humidity), as noted in the product labeling. Labels will&#xD;
      be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory&#xD;
      guidelines for labeling.&#xD;
