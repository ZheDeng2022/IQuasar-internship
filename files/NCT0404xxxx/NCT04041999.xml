      HYPOTHESIS In older adults who receive a direct intervention from the perspective of&#xD;
      occupational therapy with a &quot;Training Program in Daily Cognition&quot;, there are greater&#xD;
      benefits, both in the overall cognitive performance and in the levels of daily cognition,&#xD;
      that in the older adults who receive an intervention based on a &quot;Traditional Cognitive&#xD;
      Stimulation Program&quot;, achieving not only an improvement or maintenance of cognitive&#xD;
      functions, but a generalization and transfer of that improvement in their daily lives and&#xD;
      occupational performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a &quot;Training Program in Daily Cognition&quot; in the&#xD;
      elderly, to improve the levels of daily cognition and global cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the difference in levels of daily cognition between the participants of the control&#xD;
      group who carry out a &quot;Traditional Cognitive Stimulation Program&quot; and the participants of the&#xD;
      experimental group who carry out a &quot;Training Program in Daily Cognition&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze if there is a difference in the levels of global cognitive performance between the&#xD;
      participants of the control group that carry out a &quot;Traditional Cognitive Stimulation&#xD;
      Program&quot; and the participants of the experimental group that carry out a &quot;Training Program in&#xD;
      Daily Cognition&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the relationship between standard psychometric tests that measure cognitive&#xD;
      performance and the ECB Daily Cognition Battery Recognition Test that measures daily&#xD;
      cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyze if there is a relationship between age and cognitive performance and the daily&#xD;
      cognition of the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the relationship between the educational level that the participants possess and the&#xD;
      cognitive performance and their daily cognition Evaluate the impact of gender in the elderly&#xD;
      with cognitive performance and daily cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Check whether or not physical activity influences the cognitive performance and daily&#xD;
      cognition of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Experimental, randomized, stratified, prospective, longitudinal study using a&#xD;
      parallel scheme of fixed allocation experimental group and control group.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Check whether or not physical activity influences cognitive performance and daily&#xD;
           cognition of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Experimental, randomized, stratified, prospective, longitudinal study using a&#xD;
      parallel scheme of fixed allocation experimental group and control group; in which the&#xD;
      evolution of cognitive performance in individuals who voluntarily enrolled in the&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy Program offered by HE. Salamanca City Council in different Senior&#xD;
      Centers in the city of Salamanca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was carried out over four years with three phases without intervention between&#xD;
      them. Each intervention phase lasted 12 weeks. Participants were assessed at the beginning&#xD;
      and at the end of each intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The realization of this research study in older adults was approved by the Bioethics&#xD;
      Committee of the University of Salamanca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SITE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of the study was ten Senior Centers belonging to HE. Salamanca City Council,&#xD;
      participating in the Occupational Therapy Program, which is carried out by the Department of&#xD;
      Physiotherapy of the University of Salamanca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SELECTION Population under study The study involved healthy older adults, of both&#xD;
      sexes, not institutionalized, from the town of Salamanca who voluntarily carried out the&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy Program, taught from the University of Salamanca, in its corresponding&#xD;
      Senior Center, during the years 2014- 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION The randomization process of the groups of participants was carried out with&#xD;
      respect to the order of the centers where the program was carried out. It was carried out by&#xD;
      the simple random assignment method, for this a random number table generated using the&#xD;
      Microsoft Excel 2016R program was used. By means of said random number table, the centers&#xD;
      that obtain an even number from the experimental group were assigned to the centers that&#xD;
      obtained an odd number from the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE The sample of the study was formed by all users of the different centers of&#xD;
      greater affiliation to the Occupational Therapy Program offered from the University of&#xD;
      Salamanca, who met the inclusion / exclusion criteria, who authorized their participation in&#xD;
      the study voluntarily, through the signature of an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDEPENDENT VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Direct intervention from the perspective of occupational therapy in the improvement of&#xD;
      daily cognition through a &quot;Daily Cognition Training Program&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEPENDENT VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily cognition: Measured with the Everyday Cognition Battery (ECB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive performance: Measured with the Rapid Evaluation of Cognitive Functions (ERFC).&#xD;
           The ERFC in addition to a total score will provide us with other variables that are:&#xD;
           Temprospatial orientation, attention and memory, mental calculation, reasoning and&#xD;
           judgment, similarities, comprehension, denomination, repetition, written order, verbal&#xD;
           fluency, praxies, visual recognition and writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENING VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity DATA ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS As indicated in detail&#xD;
           later in the process description section, each participant carried out a total of 8&#xD;
           assessments, 2 for each of the 4 of the intervention phases. An initial and another&#xD;
           final. The first assessment of the study coincides with the assessment of the beginning&#xD;
           of the Occupational Therapy Program for the 2014-2015 period, and the last assessment&#xD;
           corresponds to the assessment of the end of the 2017-2018 program. The evaluations were&#xD;
           carried out by five qualified occupational therapists, of which only one subsequently&#xD;
           performed the intervention. In this way it is achieved that 80% of the evaluations are&#xD;
           carried out by an external evaluator, to control, as far as possible, possible&#xD;
           interferences or biases in the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the different types of variables, the following registration sheets, scales and&#xD;
      questionnaires have been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEPENDENT VARIABLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the dependent variables, in both groups, participants will be evaluated with two&#xD;
      heteroadministered questionnaires; the Everyday Cognition Battery (ECB) Test and the Rapid&#xD;
      Assessment of Cognitive Functions (ERFC) Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION Process description&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First, participants interested in carrying out the Occupational Therapy Program must&#xD;
           submit an access request, voluntarily registering in the corresponding Senior Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the period from May to June, the Department of Elders of the City of Salamanca&#xD;
           proceeds to collect these requests from the elderly, from the Associations of Elders of&#xD;
           the municipality who wish to participate in the following course in the Occupational&#xD;
           Therapy Program. In the Municipal Centers for the Elderly &quot;Juan de la Fuente&quot; and&#xD;
           &quot;Tierra Charra&quot; the call for applications is held approximately one month before the&#xD;
           program begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After acceptance of admission to the program, the sample is determined taking into&#xD;
           account that participants of the Occupational Therapy Program meet the inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria previously established to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Delivery and reading of the participant information sheet (ANNEX 4), where all the&#xD;
           questions about the study and the tests and scales that will be carried out in the&#xD;
           assessments are explained. After the clarifications requested, the informed consent is&#xD;
           read and signed (ANNEX 5) if they agree to be part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assignment of groups randomly belonging to the experimental group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Initial Assessment or Assessment 1 (V-1): performed before beginning the intervention by&#xD;
           qualified occupational therapists. This assessment is the same both in the experimental&#xD;
           group and in the control group and consists in formalizing the clinical history and in&#xD;
           carrying out the tests indicated above that assess the cognitive performance of the&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intervention phase 1 (FI-1): with a total of 20 sessions, making 2 weekly sessions,&#xD;
           which is approximately 3 months long. Being annually the work period from October to&#xD;
           May. Taking into account that it is intervened in 10 groups: In total, 200 work sessions&#xD;
           are held distributed in 20 sessions in each of the 10 groups. FIGURE 6 shows the&#xD;
           distribution over time of the different groups. 7) At the end of this intervention&#xD;
           period, Valuation 2 (V-2) is carried out, consisting of the same tests that are&#xD;
           performed on V-1. The time between V-1 and V-2 is the 1st STAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8) After V - 2, in each center, a period is established in which participants do not receive&#xD;
      intervention. We will call this period Phase of non-intervention 1 (FNI-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each period of non-intervention lasts approximately one year. And in each center (FIGURE 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9) The 2nd STAGE begins with Assessment 3 (V-3), followed by Intervention Phase 2 (FI-2), and&#xD;
      ends with Assessment 4 (V-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10) The process continues with the Non-intervention Phase 2 (FNI-2), which gives way to the&#xD;
      3rd STAGE; which begins with Assessment 5 (V-5), continues with intervention phase 3 (FI-3)&#xD;
      and ends with Assessment 6 (V-6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      11) We would continue with the Non-intervention Phase 3 (FNI-3), reaching the last stage of&#xD;
      the study, 4th STAGE. This stage is comprised of Assessment 7 (V-7), an Intervention Phase 4&#xD;
      (FI-4), and the last evaluation, which is Assessment 8 or Final Assessment (V-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 10 intervention groups the same scheme is followed. Each of the four intervention&#xD;
      phases has an identical duration of approximately 3 months with 20 sessions. The three phases&#xD;
      of non-intervention are 1 year each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention The intervention is carried out in 10 groups, with the timing&#xD;
      that we have seen previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group there are 2 sessions per week on random days, with a duration of 60 minutes,&#xD;
      each group receiving a total of 20 sessions. In total, 200 intervention sessions are&#xD;
      distributed in 20 sessions in each of the 10 groups, in each intervention phase. As in total,&#xD;
      4 intervention phases are carried out in the study: 800 intervention sessions are carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention sessions differ in terms of the procedures used in the experimental group&#xD;
      and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Control group: An intervention is carried out based on a &quot;Traditional Cognitive&#xD;
      Stimulation Program&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      · In the &quot;Traditional Cognitive Stimulation Program&quot;, tasks are carried out to work various&#xD;
      cognitive functions: orientation, gnosias, executive functions (mainly working memory&#xD;
      decision making, planning, reasoning and temporal estimation), praxies, attention, language&#xD;
      and memory .&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Experimental group: An intervention is carried out based on a &quot;Daily Cognition Training&#xD;
      Program&quot;. Tasks are carried out in which the subject has to exercise different cognitive&#xD;
      functions (praxies, attention, language, memory orientation, gnosias and executive functions;&#xD;
      mainly working memory decision making, planning, reasoning and temporal estimation) during&#xD;
      the development of AIVD For this, similar materials are used to those that the elderly could&#xD;
      find in daily tasks or when solving day-to-day problems.&#xD;
