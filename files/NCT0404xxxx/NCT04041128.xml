  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study involves surgery for cytoreduction or laparoscopy to determine if you are a candidate&#xD;
      for tumor debulking or a tissue biopsy. Following this surgery you will receive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      This study will administer 7 days of treatment with a targeted therapy called Lynparza.&#xD;
      Lynparza and/or other PARP inhibitors have been FDA approved for the treatment of ovarian and&#xD;
      breast cancer. Tissue biopsy will be done before a 7 day course of Lynparza in order to&#xD;
      correlate molecular changes to response to treatment. Participation in this trial will&#xD;
      require an additional tumor biopsy which will occur either before or after treatment of&#xD;
      Lynparza.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have cytology/ biopsy proven diagnosis of a mullerian carcinoma,&#xD;
             high clinical index of suspicion for ovarian cancer OR triple negative, BRCA mutated&#xD;
             breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received prior treatment for breast or ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be of at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance status must be 0,1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received a prior PARP inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;

          -  Platelets &gt; /= 100,000 /mcl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;/= 8 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;

             checkpoint inhibitor treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be receiving any other investigational agents for the treatment of&#xD;
