  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab plus apatinib in patients&#xD;
      with high-risk chemo-refractory or relapsed GTN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively binds to and&#xD;
      inhibits VEGF receptor 2. Novel immunotherapy using the immune checkpoint inhibitors such as&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody has received much attention. Camrelizumab as one of the anti-PD-1 drug&#xD;
      have impressive clinical activity.&#xD;
