             ICF. Only subjects who have signed the ICF will be enrolled into the study. The ICF&#xD;
             will include elements required by Mayo IRB and FDA in US 21CFR50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a calculated creatinine clearance of greater than 30 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;

             completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must provide written ICF and authorization for use of and disclosure of PHI.&#xD;
&#xD;

             88%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant illness with manifestations of significant organ&#xD;
             dysfunction which in the judgment of the PI or co-investigator would render the study&#xD;
             subject unlikely to tolerate the MSC infusion or complete the study&#xD;

             pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiolitis, interstitial&#xD;

             weeks on enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had exacerbation of COPD requiring hospitalization within 12 weeks of&#xD;
             enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject uses or used prednisone (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) within&#xD;
             12 weeks of enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has evidence or history of malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has evidence or history of autoimmune disorders independent of COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of HIV, Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has evidence of liver dysfunction manifested as alkaline phosphatase greater&#xD;
             than 345 u/L, total bilirubin greater than 1.65 mg/dL, ALT greater than 275 units/L&#xD;
             and/or AST great than 240 units/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has evidence of significant cardiac dysfunction, e.g. acute myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within 3 months of screening, patients with the diagnosis of unstable&#xD;

             heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction and patients with a history&#xD;
             of congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with pulmonary lobectomy or lung volume reduction surgery or lung&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically significant bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject received an experimental therapy (drug or biologic) for any indication within&#xD;
