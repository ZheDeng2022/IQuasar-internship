  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to assess whether the beneficial effect of liraglutide on weight&#xD;
      is mediated by changes in the composition of the intestinal Microbiome. The main mechanisms&#xD;
      of action of liraglutide were traced to a reduction in the secretion of glucagon and slowing&#xD;
      gastric emptying resulting in decreased appetite and body weight. It also seems that&#xD;
      liraglutide is capable of increasing the satiety signals thanks to a dual mechanism of&#xD;
      stimulation and inhibition induced by medication. Pomc neurons (opiomelacortin) present in&#xD;
      hypothalamic arcuate nuclei, stimulated by liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
      receptor expressed by inhibiting intensely appetite. At the same time through the GABAergic&#xD;
      neuronal activity is inhibited neuropeptide Y(NPY) deputies to the production of orexins that&#xD;
      are powerful promoters of appetite. Alterations in the composition of the human gut&#xD;
      microbiome occur in metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes. Liraglutide has been&#xD;
      reported to switch microbiome composition towards lean-related bacterial phylotypes in animal&#xD;
      studies. This leads to hypothesize that the switch of microbiome by liraglutide may be one of&#xD;
      the mechanisms through which liraglutide may exert its effect. In particular the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that liraglutide could restore a healthy microbiome or at least&#xD;
      improve the microbiome composition through slowing gastrointestinal motility. Moreover, the&#xD;
      liraglutide-related change of microbiome could be an additional mechanism that contribute to&#xD;
      the beneficial metabolic effect of liraglutide. To test this hypothesis the investigators&#xD;
      will investigate if there will be any change of gut microbiome assessed as&#xD;
      Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio after liraglutide treatment. In order to understand if the&#xD;
      change of gut microbiome after liraglutide treatment occurs as an association or contributes&#xD;
      to the effect of liraglutide ,the investigators will correlate the&#xD;
      Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios with the changes of Body Mass Index, Body Composition,&#xD;
      appetite parameters, chronic inflammation parameters, lipid profile and insulin resistance.&#xD;
      All the subjects will follow the same diet in order to avoid any bias.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      liraglutide 3.0 mg with placebo both administered subcutaneously once-daily in subjects with&#xD;
      established obesity. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either liraglutide&#xD;
      3.0 mg or placebo as an adjunct to standard-of-care.All baseline assessments will be done&#xD;
      prior to administration of the first dose of trial product while all the follow up&#xD;
      assessments will be done at the end of the trial. Dose escalation of liraglutide/placebo will&#xD;
      take place during the first 4 weeks after randomisation as described. All subjects will aim&#xD;
      at reaching the recommended target dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide once-daily or the corresponding&#xD;
      volume of placebo. In this trial approximately 70 subjects will be randomly assigned to trial&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
