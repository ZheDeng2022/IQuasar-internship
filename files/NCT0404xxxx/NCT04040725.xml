  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the safety, tolerability, and tumor activity of the study&#xD;
      drug known as rogaratinib as a possible treatment for bladder cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved rogaratinib as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying rogaratinib in bladder cancer that has&#xD;
      not responded to BCG and overexpresses a protein called FGFR1 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations in FGFR help bladder cancer grow. In metastatic cancers that express FGFR 1 or&#xD;
           3, rogaratinib and other inhibitors of FGFR have shown to be an effective treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rogaratinib is an oral drug that inhibits FGFR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To date, no therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling bladder cancer after&#xD;
           BCG does not work.&#xD;

             Grade Ta and/or CIS) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Subjects with tumors&#xD;
             of mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histology are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In subjects with Ta and T1, have undergone complete TURBT as characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Attainment of a visually complete resection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Residual CIS not amenable to complete transurethral resection is acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The most recent cystoscopy / TURBT must have been performed within 8 weeks prior&#xD;
                  to the first dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been treated with adequate BCG therapy and have developed NMIBC that is&#xD;
             unresponsive to BCG therapy. Adequate BCG therapy must include: An induction course&#xD;

             instillations of BCG within 9 months of the first instillation of adequate induction&#xD;
             therapy. BCG unresponsive high risk NMIBC is defined as: Stage progression at 3 months&#xD;
             (±4 weeks) despite adequate induction therapy (e.g., Ta to T1, or CIS to T1; note:&#xD;
             adequate induction therapy only, defined above, is required in this case); or&#xD;

             Recurrent high risk NMIBC within 9 months of the last BCG instillation despite&#xD;
             adequate BCG therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have elected not to undergo, or are considered ineligible for radical cystectomy, as&#xD;
             determined by the treating surgeon. Reasons for ineligibility or refusal of radical&#xD;
             cystectomy should be discussed with the subject as part of the informed consent&#xD;
             process and should be captured on the appropriate case report form. Ineligibility&#xD;
             factors for radical cystectomy may include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiovascular disease (e.g. recent acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, heart&#xD;
                  failure)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Prior major abdominal and pelvic surgery, that would preclude a safe surgical&#xD;
                  procedure, as determined by the treating surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;

             testing. Patients who don't have archival tissue specimens meeting eligibility&#xD;
             requirements may undergo a biopsy. Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for&#xD;
             deep tumor tissue (minimum three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps&#xD;
             biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and signing of the written patient information/informed consent&#xD;
             form (PI/ICF) for FGFR testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and signing of the written PI/ICF for study treatment&#xD;
             eligibility. Signed informed consent form must be available before any study-specific&#xD;

             eligibility must be offered only after positive results in FGFR testing study received&#xD;
             by site.)&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note: at the investigator's discretion, an estimated creatinine clearance result &lt;60&#xD;

        collection or using EDTA, inulin, GFR scan. INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN and PTT or activated PTT (aPTT)&#xD;
        ≤ 1.5 x ULN. Patients being treated with anticoagulant, e.g. warfarin or heparin, will be&#xD;

             days before the first treatment). Negative results must be available before the first&#xD;
             study drug administration. Females are considered of childbearing potential unless&#xD;
             they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,&#xD;
             or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12&#xD;

             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent form and until at least 5 months after the last study drug administration. The&#xD;
             definition of adequate contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
             and on local requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, (i) condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent; (ii)&#xD;
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide; (iii) intra-uterine device; (iv)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Therapies that are known to increase serum calcium or phosphate levels (i.e.&#xD;
                  antacids, phosphate-containing laxatives oral/rectal, potassium phosphate)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may not receive other investigational treatment or other approved&#xD;
                  anti-tumor therapy while on this protocol (excluding anti-VEGF therapy for&#xD;
                  ophthalmologic disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant therapies that should be avoided:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Narrow therapeutic index drugs that are CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP substrates (e.g.&#xD;
                  alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide,&#xD;
                  quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) should be avoided, because drug&#xD;
                  interactions caused by irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP by&#xD;
                  rogaratinib cannot be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fluconazole is considered a moderate to strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 and should be&#xD;
                  avoided, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No results are available from human interaction studies between rogaratinib and&#xD;
                  other chemotherapies. No data are available to evaluate the interaction between&#xD;
                  rogaratinib and radiation. Therefore, when administering these agents after study&#xD;
                  drug has been withdrawn, it should be taken into consideration that rogaratinib&#xD;
                  plasma concentrations may be detectable for a few days (depending on half-life)&#xD;
                  and the physiologic consequences that could interact with chemotherapy and&#xD;
                  radiotherapy may last even longer following discontinuation of rogaratinib.&#xD;
