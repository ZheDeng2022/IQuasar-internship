  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects&#xD;
      approximately 1 million people in the United States with total annual costs approaching 11&#xD;
      billion dollars. The most common symptoms of PD are tremor, stiffness, slowness, and trouble&#xD;
      with balance/walking, which lead to severe impairments in performing activities of daily&#xD;
      living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective,&#xD;
      expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of&#xD;
      practical and effective add-ons to current therapeutic treatment approaches would have many&#xD;
      benefits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation&#xD;
      technique that can affect brain activity and can help make long-term brain changes to improve&#xD;
      functions like walking and balance. While a few initial research studies and review articles&#xD;
      involving tDCS have concluded that tDCS may improve PD walking and balance, many results are&#xD;
      not meaningful in real life and several crucial issues still prevent tDCS from being a useful&#xD;
      add-on intervention in PD. These include the selection of stimulation sites (brain regions&#xD;
      stimulated) and tDCS electrode placement. Most studies have targeted the motor cortex (brain&#xD;
      region that controls intentional movement), but there is evidence that the cerebellum - which&#xD;
      helps control gait and balance, is connected to several other brain areas, and is easily&#xD;
      stimulated with tDCS - may be a likely location to further optimize walking and balance in&#xD;
      PD. There is also evidence that certain electrodes placements may be better than others.&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of cerebellar tDCS stimulation&#xD;
      using two different placement strategies on walking and balance in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities&#xD;
      (for example, 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently used in most tDCS research are less&#xD;
      than 2 mA, which is sufficient to produce measurable improvements; but, these improvements&#xD;
      may be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still&#xD;
      being established for human subjects, careful and moderate stimulation approaches were&#xD;
      warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities (for example, up to 4&#xD;
      mA) have been performed in different people and were found to have no additional negative&#xD;
      side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established,&#xD;
      studies exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e., 2 mA) and higher&#xD;
      (i.e., 4 mA) intensities are necessary to determine if increasing the intensity increases the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the desired outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will include 10 people with mild-moderate PD that will be recruited&#xD;
      to complete five randomly-ordered stimulation sessions, separated by at least 5 days each.&#xD;
      Each session will involve one visit to the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and&#xD;
      will last for approximately one hour. Data collection is expected to take 4-6 months. Each&#xD;
      session will include walking and balance testing performed while wearing the tDCS device.&#xD;
      Total tDCS stimulation time for each session will be 25 minutes.&#xD;

      to the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and will last for approximately one&#xD;
      hour. Data collection is expected to take 4-6 months. Each session will include gait&#xD;
      (30-meter walk test [30mWT], 6-minute walk test [6MWT], Timed Up and Go [TUG]) and balance&#xD;
      testing (standing on a force platform with either a firm surface or a foam surface) performed&#xD;
      in conjunction with one of the five randomly-ordered stimulation conditions (SHAM, unilateral&#xD;
      2 mA, unilateral 4 mA, bilateral 2 mA, and bilateral 4 mA). Total tDCS stimulation time for&#xD;
      each session will be 25 minutes. Gait characteristics (i.e., gait speed, stride length, step&#xD;
      length, toe-off angle, etc.) and distance walked during the 30mWT and 6MWT will also be&#xD;
      determined with inertial sensors (OPAL motion sensors).&#xD;
