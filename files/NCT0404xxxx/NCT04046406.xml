  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic pain syndromes have a high prevalence of up to 8% in the general population and up to&#xD;
      50% following pelvic trauma and pelvic surgery. While medical management is the initial&#xD;
      therapeutic step, it is often ineffective with surgical decompression and resection of the&#xD;
      putative nerves being the ultima ratio. Cryoablation can induce long-lasting nerve conduction&#xD;
      blocks with resultant pain relief for several months. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) neurography-guided cryoanalgesia for&#xD;
      the treatment of pelvic and associated pain syndromes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic pain syndromes including meralgia paresthetica, inguinodynia, and deep gluteal&#xD;
      syndrome and others, which are caused by nerves including the the lateral femoral cutaneous&#xD;
      nerve (LFCN), genitofemoral nerve (GFN), ilioinguinal nerve (IIN), iliohypogastric nerve&#xD;
      (IHN), pudendal nerve (PN), obturator nerve (ON), posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (PFCN),&#xD;
      and others, have a high prevalence of up to 8% in the general population and up to 50%&#xD;
      following pelvic trauma and pelvic surgery, including episiotomy, orthopedic instrumentation&#xD;
      and surgical hernia repair. While medical management is the initial therapeutic step, it is&#xD;
      often ineffective with surgical decompression and resection of the putative nerves being the&#xD;
      ultima ratio. Cryoablation of sensory nerves at temperatures of approximately 40 degrees&#xD;
      Celsius and below (Cryoanalgesia) can induce long-lasting nerve conduction blocks with&#xD;
      resultant pain relief for several months, which could be an effective treatment option for a&#xD;
      large number of patients in this group before, instead of, and after failed surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Cryoablation affords several advantages over other thermal or chemical ablation&#xD;
      techniques, including direct visualization of the ablation zone, decreased intraprocedural&#xD;
      and postprocedural pain, and the ability to simultaneously use multiple probes in variable&#xD;
      configurations to create tailored additive overlapping ablation zones. In contrast to&#xD;
      surgical or heat-mediated ablation, cryoablation does not disrupt the acellular epineurium or&#xD;
      perineurium, which reduces the risk of neuroma formation and may allow eventual nerve&#xD;
      regeneration, after which the cryoanalgesia can be repeated. Interventional MR neurography at&#xD;
      3 Tesla describes the combined use of high-resolution MRI for the visualization of smallest&#xD;
      nerves that are located deep inside the pelvis, targeting, placement of needles and probes,&#xD;
      and process monitoring, such as growth of the ice ball and relationship to the target nerves.&#xD;
      The use of interventional MR neurography is thus ideally suited to perform cryoanalgesia with&#xD;
      the highest technical accuracy and safety. The objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MR neurography-guided cryoanalgesia for the treatment of pelvic and&#xD;
      associated pain syndromes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 to 100 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic pelvic pain for at least 3 months and no adequate pain relief defined as&#xD;
             persistent worst pain 4 or above on an 11-point visual analogue scale of 0 (no pain)&#xD;
             to 10 (pain as bad as subject can imagine) despite conservative treatments, including&#xD;
             but not limited to oral pain medication including NSAIDs and narcotics, physical&#xD;
             therapy, and nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The 'worst pain' must be reported to be 4 or above on an 11-point visual analogue&#xD;
             scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as subject can imagine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pain must be from a single lumbosacral nerves confirmed with selective nerve blocks&#xD;
             providing adequate temporary pain. The selectivity of the nerve block will be&#xD;
             confirmed on MR images documenting that the injected local anesthetic immerses the&#xD;
             targeted nerve and that there is absence of spread of local anesthetic to adjacent&#xD;
             nerves to exclude confounding anesthesia. Adequate pain relief will be defined by pain&#xD;
             relief of greater 50% after the nerve block and rest and with aggravating exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target nerve is amenable to cryoablation with MRI guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cryoablation should be performed within 3 months of the nerve block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No debilitating medical or psychiatric illness that would preclude giving informed&#xD;
             consent or receiving optimal treatment and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known coagulopathy or bleeding disorders are controlled&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confounding pain syndromes or conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous nerve surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant, nursing, or wishing to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical illness, including any of the following: uncontrolled congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, uncontrolled angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event within 6&#xD;
             months prior to the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent participation in other studies that could affect the primary endpoint&#xD;
