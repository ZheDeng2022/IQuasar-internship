  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer in developing countries face considerable challenges in obtaining access&#xD;
      to care due to a lack of human resources and infrastructure. This is particularly pressing&#xD;
      for vulnerable populations such as older adults. In this setting, many patients receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy are unable to report the presence of toxicities, and adverse events can go&#xD;
      unnoticed for considerable amounts of time. The goal of this study is to assess the accuracy&#xD;
      of an objective patient-centered measure of physical function (the number of steps taken per&#xD;
      day measured using an accelerometer-equipped smartphone) for the remote detection of&#xD;
      chemotherapy toxicity in older adults. This study builds on a pilot trial showing that&#xD;
      monitoring older patients remotely utilizing an accelerometer-equipped smartphone is feasible&#xD;
      and acceptable, and that a decline in the number of steps detected using the device can be an&#xD;
      early sign of chemotherapy toxicity. The hypothesis of this study is that a decline in the&#xD;
      number daily steps from a prechemotherapy baseline, measured using an accelerometer-equipped&#xD;
      smartphone, will be accurate for detecting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the ability of a patient-centered measure (a decline in the number&#xD;
      of daily steps compared with a pre-chemotherapy baseline) to identify the presence of&#xD;
      clinically-significant chemotherapy-related toxicity in Mexican older adults with cancer&#xD;
      starting first line chemotherapy. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer-equipped&#xD;
      smartphone with an installed pedometer application. Baseline steps per day will be obtained&#xD;
      and recorded before starting chemotherapy. The patients' steps will be monitored daily for&#xD;
      the first three chemotherapy cycles and compared with baseline recordings. Patients will be&#xD;
      contacted daily and chemotherapy toxicity will be assessed by a physician. If significant&#xD;
      toxicities are identified, the patient will be prompted to seek medical attention. The&#xD;
      optimal cutoff point for detecting chemotherapy toxicity utilizing a decline in the number of&#xD;
      daily steps will be chosen and validated. The adherence and satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention will also be evaluated. This study could improve current methods and transform&#xD;
      the way in which cancer care is delivered by demonstrating that a simple patient-centered&#xD;
      measure obtained using a commercially available smartphone can aid in the accurate&#xD;
      identification of clinically significant toxicities among a vulnerable population such as&#xD;
      older adults with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be provided with a Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) accelerometer-equipped Android smartphone (specific model to be decided) with an installed open source, freely available pedometer application (Google Fit, Google, CA, United States) which will record their daily steps. Patients will receive daily calls from a research assistant to document the presence of clinically significant chemotherapy-related toxicity.</description>

    <description>Patients will be instructed to carry the smartphone around their hips during waking hours, regardless of whether they are at home or outside (a nylon hip holster will be provided) and to keep it turned on at all times.&#xD;
Daily steps will be recorded for at least seven days before the start of chemotherapy, and the median baseline number of daily steps will be calculated for each patient.&#xD;
On the first day of chemotherapy, patients will receive side effect education as per standard of care. Patients will be instructed to continue carrying the smartphone daily as indicated for the entire duration of the first three chemotherapy cycles.&#xD;
At the end of the follow-up period (or sooner in cases of early interruption of chemotherapy due to toxicity or disease progression; a change in chemotherapy regimen; or hospitalizations lasting ≥3 days), patients will rate their satisfaction with the intervention using a Likert-scale questionnaire and open-ended questions.</description>
