  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of chronic heart rhythm disease worldwide,&#xD;
      with significant associated co-morbidities. Although there have been advances in&#xD;
      understanding the mechanisms of AF, the underlying cause of AF and factors which perpetuate&#xD;
      it remain incompletely understood. This is particularly the case for persistent AF (persAF).&#xD;
      Drug treatments for persAF have a role but can have undesirable side effects with relatively&#xD;
      limited efficacy. Furthermore, current invasive therapies for persAF remain suboptimal,&#xD;
      requiring significant resources, and with potentially serious complications for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter ablation is an effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. For persistent AF (persAF),&#xD;
      however, catheter ablation does not provide similar results. This is because there remains a&#xD;
      poor understanding of the electrophysiological mechanisms driving persAF. Part of this study&#xD;
      aims to further explore the specific locations that represent important substrates which&#xD;
      would guide more effective catheter ablation. There have been several different ablation&#xD;
      approaches explored in the past (see below), however, these did not improve the outcome post&#xD;
      procedure compared with pulmonary vein isolation alone. A pilot study has already been&#xD;
      carried out and I aim to expand this further with a larger cohort of patients (10-20) over 2&#xD;
      years. In this study the investigators want to explore whether stable high dominant frequency&#xD;
      (HDF) sites (with a high organisation index) act as potential drivers of Atrial Fibrillation.&#xD;
      Thus, targeting these sites may results in prolongation of the cycle length and thus possible&#xD;
      termination of the arrhythmia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are an estimated 1.4 million people in the UK with atrial fibrillation (AF), which&#xD;
      accounts for 2.4% of the adult population.1 It is well established that AF is a major&#xD;
      causative factor for ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism.2 In addition, strokes resulting&#xD;
      from AF carry the highest morbidity and mortality of any other form of stroke. AF is also&#xD;
      associated with increased morbidity in relation to heart failure.3,4,5 The UK 2016/7 Sentinal&#xD;
      Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) reported that in 7,483 patients with known AF who&#xD;
      were not anticoagulated before their stroke, there was a 26% mortality and 45% were&#xD;
      discharged with moderate-severe disability.6 AF, therefore, is not only associated with&#xD;
      increased mortality and morbidity but also significant healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broadly speaking AF is characterized by a rapid erratic depolarization of the atrial&#xD;
      myocardium which manifests clinically as an irregular pulse which can be rapid. This is&#xD;
      diagnosed initially on clinical suspicion by palpation of the pulse and then definitively by&#xD;
      an ECG which will show irregular intervals between the QRS complex and absence of a P-wave.&#xD;
      Clinically patients may be asymptomatic, however typical associated symptoms include&#xD;
      palpitations, (exertional) dyspnoea, syncope/presyncope and chest pains. The patient may&#xD;
      experience a variation of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classification of AF is dependent on several factors: presentation, duration and&#xD;
      spontaneous termination. There are 5 defined patterns of AF: First diagnosed AF is that which&#xD;
      has not been previously diagnosed irrespective of duration and severity of AF-related&#xD;
      symptoms. Paroxysmal AF which self terminates, usually within 48 hours. This includes AF&#xD;
      episodes which are cardioverted within 7 days. Persistent AF, which lasts longer than 7 days.&#xD;
      Long standing persistent AF, continuous AF lasting &gt;1 year when it is decided to adopt a&#xD;
      rhythm control strategy. Permanent AF implies that AF has been accepted by both the patient&#xD;
      and the physician, therefore there would be no further pursuit of rhythm control&#xD;
      intervention. [2016 ESC Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of AF is two-fold. Where clinically indicated the patient should be&#xD;
      anticoagulated. Over the last seven years four non-VKA OACs (NOACs)-dabigatran, a direct&#xD;
      thrombin inhibitor and rivaroxaban, apixaban and Edoxaban, factor Xa inhibitors-have been&#xD;
      tested against warfarin in large randomised controlled trials.7-10 These NOACs have been&#xD;
      shown to be at least as effective as warfarin in stroke prevention, with a superior safety&#xD;
      profile, consistently reducing intracranial haemorrhage.11 Other practical advantages of the&#xD;
      NOACs include very few drug interactions and a predictable onset and offset that eliminates&#xD;
      the requirement for regular anticoagulation monitoring. This has led to the 2014 NICE AF&#xD;
      Guideline giving an equal first-line recommendation for NOACs alongside warfarin for stroke&#xD;
      prevention.12 NICE also recommends that the options for anticoagulation should be discussed&#xD;
      with the patient and the choice should be based on their clinical features and preferences.&#xD;
      The second treatment option is pursuit of either a rhythm or rate control strategy. Rate&#xD;
      control is achieved via drug therapy. When aiming for rhythm control the option are 1)&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs) or 2) Invasive catheter ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, current AADs have limited efficacy in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with&#xD;
      AF. In addition, there side effect profiles may prevent their long term use in some patients,&#xD;
      even where they are maintaining sinus rhythm.13 The most common drug used for maintenance of&#xD;
      sinus rhythm is Amiodarone which carries a significant side effect profile. In particular&#xD;
      there is a risk posed from long term use of thyroid dysfunction (hyper- or hypothyroidism),&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis and lung fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have intolerable symptomatic AF which is not responding to medical therapy can&#xD;
      be offered invasive treatment in the form of an ablation. The two methods of ablation are&#xD;
      cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation. The procedure is carried out under sedation or&#xD;
      general anaesthesia. Catheters are introduced via sheaths placed in the femoral vein and&#xD;
      guided up to the right atrium. Catheters are usually placed at the level of the His and CS.&#xD;
      The patient is given heparin and a transeptal puncture is performed to gain access to the&#xD;
      left atrium. The pulmonary veins are located and radiofrequency energy or the cryoballoon is&#xD;
      applied to specific areas of the left atrial myocardium and around the pulmonary veins. The&#xD;
      patients cardiac rhythm is monitored via body surface ECGs and intracardiac electrograms&#xD;
      (EGMs). Piccini et al published a meta-analysis in 2009 which showed that PVI increased&#xD;
      freedom from AF at 1 year, compared with a non-ablation treatment strategy in those patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal AF.14 Outcomes in persAF are less encouraging. Patients may require multiple&#xD;
      procedures to gain true symptom control. Catheter ablation is not without it risks. These&#xD;
      include Stroke, cardiac tamponade, diaphragmatic paralysis secondary to damage to the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve and oesophageal perforation. Appropriate patient selection is therefore incredibly&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained AF perpetuates further AF. Simply put, this occurs because with sustained AF the&#xD;
      atria become fibrosed and therefore exhibit scar. Over time the atria become electrically and&#xD;
      structurally remodeled causing further perpetuation of the arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paper by Ha√Øssaguerre et al. in 1998 showed that when the atria and pulmonary veins were&#xD;
      mapped with intracardiac catheters isolated ectopic activity was a trigger for a pAF episode.&#xD;
      Theses site then underwent RF ablation. The pulmonary veins were found to be the predominant&#xD;
      sites of earliest activation and RF ablation at these sites prevented further pAF.15&#xD;
      Pulmonary vein isolation is now the cornerstone of therapy for patients with symptomatic drug&#xD;
      refractory pAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the mechanisms of persAF is still needed to improve catheter&#xD;
      ablation outcomes. Over the last decade, different ablation approaches have been proposed&#xD;
      including i) an anatomical one, with ablation lines mimicking the Cox Maze procedure, and ii)&#xD;
      electrical strategies which aim at identifying critical atrial sites with electrical&#xD;
      signatures that harbour areas of relevant remodeling believed to perpetuate or drive the&#xD;
      chaotic fibrillatory rhythm, whereby their ablation would terminate AF and prevent its&#xD;
      induction. Early results appeared promising ablating at sites where the recordings indicated&#xD;
      complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) and also with a signal processing approach&#xD;
      to identify focal and /or rotor activity (FIRM mapping) but these results were proved to be&#xD;
      difficult to replicate and a more recent randomised study (STAR-AF II) showed that generic&#xD;
      linear and CFAE ablation did not improve the ablation outcome over and above pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI) alone.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, heterogeneity in patient characteristics would explain the variable results and&#xD;
      precision medicine approaches are needed to design patient specific therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
      Better ways to identifying relevant atrial substrate are needed and to demonstrate that&#xD;
      targeting these locations improve ablation outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are specific locations within the atria (left atrium specifically) which exhibit&#xD;
      electrical characteristics which act as drivers in persistent atrial fibrillation. These&#xD;
      sites can be analysed by non-contact mapping techniques which will more accurately guide&#xD;
      catheter ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of USURP-II AF is to expand upon the work carried out in USURP-I and that is to be&#xD;
      able to determine driver characteristics and mechanisms of persistent atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
      The investigators still need to better understand the electrophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying persistent AF so that the investigators can have a guided approach to ablation in&#xD;
      persistent AF. Limitations of USURP-I included too shorter data analysis times (30 seconds&#xD;
      only from 5 minutes of exported data) purely due to lack of computer processing power. In&#xD;
      addition, only centre of gravity of DF clouds were analysed and no comparison of rotor&#xD;
      behaviour was done. The latter analysis is now possible. In the original study both&#xD;
      prolonging of the cycle length and termination of the arrhythmia were end points in&#xD;
      determining successful vs. unsuccessful ablation. Analysis of both DF and rotor behaviour at&#xD;
      successful vs. unsuccessful sites in longer recordings would allow refinement of the&#xD;
      characteristics and criteria for ablation which the investigators plan to apply prospectively&#xD;
      in this new study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that this is not a clinical trial and that I am studying the different&#xD;
      mechanisms of PersAF after applying the below ablation strategy, rather than outcomes. The&#xD;
      patients recruited will be on a standard care pathway and will not be recruited for the sole&#xD;
      purposes of the study. The following is broad overview of the how I intend to carry out the&#xD;
      clinical aspect of the study.&#xD;
