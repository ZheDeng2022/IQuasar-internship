    <measure>change in Fabry-Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire (FPHPQ)scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months; Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FPHPQ includes questions about Fabry disease-specific symptoms (eg, sweating, pain, dizziness and tiredness, heat and cold intolerance, swollen eyelids, gastrointestinal symptoms, feeling thirsty, difficulty hearing, ringing or buzzing noise in the ears, and ability and enjoyment to participate in sports). The frequency of these symptoms will be rated using a 5-point Likert scale (always (worse), often, sometimes, seldom, never (better)). Pain intensity is measured on a 10-point scale, numeric responses are given for onset of pain and school days missed, and yes/no questions are posed about difficulty hearing and other problems not specifically mentioned. There are 2 age-specific self-report versions for children 8 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years, respectively.</description>

    <measure>change in Pediatric and Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months; Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL™ is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. It consists of 23 items and includes questions about physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning relative to the prior 7 days, using a 5-point scale (never (better), almost never, sometimes, often and almost always (worse)). Both parents or legally-authorized representatives and subjects complete the appropriate version of the PedsQL independently of one another. Parents or legally-authorized representatives and subjects may self-administer the questions after introductory instructions are given by study site personnel.</description>
