  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      investigational Ebola vaccine given by intramuscular (IM) injection to healthy adults. The&#xD;
      study is a dose escalation of VRC-EBOADC086-00-VP, a chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3 vector&#xD;
      vaccine, which encodes wild type (WT) glycoprotein (GP) from the Sudan strain of Ebolavirus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that about 100 volunteers will be screened in order to enroll a total of 40&#xD;
      participants. The 40 participants will be evenly split, with 20 in each of the two dosage&#xD;
      groups for cAd3-EBO S. The dose escalation plan includes daily review of any new safety data&#xD;
      by a study clinician, regular review of safety data by the protocol team and a staged&#xD;
      enrollment plan with required interim safety reviews. The study will begin with enrollment of&#xD;
      3 participants into Group 1 at a rate of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of&#xD;
      follow-up for the first 3 vaccinated participants, an interim safety review will occur before&#xD;
      enrollment of additional participants into the group. If no safety issues are identified, an&#xD;
      additional 17 participants will be enrolled to complete Group 1. When there is a minimum of&#xD;
      seven days of follow-up safety data from the last enrolled participant in Group 1, an interim&#xD;
      safety review will occur. Once no safety issues are identified, enrollment of participants&#xD;
      into the next dose level (Group 2) will begin with the enrollment of 3 participants at a rate&#xD;
      of 1 participant per day. After at least 7 days of followup for the first 3 vaccinated&#xD;
      participants in Group 2, an interim safety review will occur before the enrollment of&#xD;
      additional participants into Group 2. If no safety issues are identified, an additional 17&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled to complete Group 2.&#xD;
