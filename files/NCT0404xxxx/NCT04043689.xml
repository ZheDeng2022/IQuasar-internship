      Background: The most common visual field deficit after retro-chiasmatic lesions is homonymous&#xD;
      hemianopia (HH), defined as the impossibility of seeing the contralesional visual hemisphere&#xD;
      without ocular injury. HH affects between 90000 and 120 000 new cases per year in the United&#xD;
      States and Europe HH was reported in 30% of patients after stroke (National Audit Office) (in&#xD;
      France, with 130,000 strokes per year, 39,000 patients with HH). Despite the 30-year decline,&#xD;
      the rehabilitation techniques have a low level of evidence of their effectiveness and few are&#xD;
      used in routine clinical practice in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Alternate Current Stimulation (tACS) is a method of Alternative Current&#xD;
      stimulation that can modulate neural activity by imposing local oscillatory activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational study of occipital tACS in patients with optic nerve lesions showed an&#xD;
      increase in visual field size, power, and occipital alpha synchrony. Two transorbital tACS&#xD;
      studies showed visual improvements , and compensations for abnormally weak oscillatory&#xD;
      activity by temporal resynchronization. Our team has demonstrated a role of noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation in right hemisphere frontal eye fields on cortical beta-high (~ 30 Hz)&#xD;
      oscillatory activity, improving the visual perception of both hemi-fields and the&#xD;
      fronto-parietal synchrony of the right hemisphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to compare, on the same patient population, two tACS stimulation&#xD;
      strategies, with the aim of increasing the attentional orientation towards the blind visual&#xD;
      hemi-field and thus the visual detection of stimuli in this hemi-field. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, The investigator team will evaluate on the one hand an occipital stimulation&#xD;
      (V1-IPS) contralateral to the lesion, at a alfa frequency (10 Hz), which induces the&#xD;
      desynchronization of the contralateral hemisphere with the aim of improving the visual&#xD;
      perception of targets in the blind visual hemi-field. the study will compare this&#xD;
      intervention to a stimulation of the frontal region (FEF) of the right hemisphere at a&#xD;
      high-beta frequency (30 Hz), which showed effects of facilitation of endogenous and exogenous&#xD;
      attentional orientation. The two previous strategies will be compared to a placebo tACS&#xD;
      stimulation session.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focusing on low-level perceptual activities, and robust, controlled explorations with&#xD;
      medium-sized cohorts, several studies have shown tACS effects related to oscillatory activity&#xD;
      and inter-regional synchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, in healthy subjects, occipital tACS showed an increase in posterior alpha power&#xD;
      following tACS alpha (10-14 Hz). At higher frequencies, the 60 Hz tACS showed a sustained&#xD;
      reduction in visual contrast sensitivity threshold . Two studies in 2014 have also shown&#xD;
      following 40 Hz tACS stimulation of occipital or parietal brain regions in healthy humans,&#xD;
      sustained dependent on synchrony of posterior interhemispheric gamma band networks, and&#xD;
      modulation effects of moving target perception Very recently, a 10 Hz occipital tACS&#xD;
      stimulation study coupled with functional magnetic resonance Imaging recording (fMRI) showed&#xD;
      diffuse effects likely to indicate occipito-parieto-temporal synchronization during the&#xD;
      delayed phase of effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients' trials, an observational study of uncontrolled occipital tACS in patients&#xD;
      with optic nerve lesions showed improved visual acuity and visual field size, accompanied by&#xD;
      an increase in power and of occipital alpha synchrony by targeting periorbital regions; More&#xD;
      recently, a double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial in patients with optic nerve lesions&#xD;
      showed, with daily transorbital tACS sessions lasting 10 weeks, a sustained (2.5%) increase&#xD;
      in visual field size versus stimulation placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to compare, on the same patient population, two tACS stimulation&#xD;
      strategies, with the aim of increasing the attentional orientation towards the blind visual&#xD;
      hemi-field and thus the visual detection of stimuli in this hemi-field. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, the study will evaluate on the one hand an occipital stimulation (V1-IPS)&#xD;
      contralateral to the lesion, at a alfa frequency (10 Hz), which induces the desynchronization&#xD;
      of the contralateral hemisphere with the aim of improving the visual perception of targets in&#xD;
      the blind visual hemi-field. This intervention will be compared to a stimulation of the&#xD;
      frontal region (FEF) of the right hemisphere at a high-beta frequency (30 Hz), which showed&#xD;
      effects of facilitation of endogenous and exogenous attentional orientation. The two previous&#xD;
      strategies will be compared to a placebo tACS stimulation session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to modulate visual perception in patients with HH in the&#xD;
      chronic phase using transcranial AC stimulation. The study aim is to evaluate the behavioral&#xD;
      effects of tACS stimulation of the right fronto-parietal network (FEF-IPS) and the occipital&#xD;
      and parieto-occipital region (V1-IPS), contralateral to the lesion, on visual perception in&#xD;
      static and kinetic perimetry. The effects of stimulation of these two targets on brain&#xD;
      activity by electrophysiology (EEG) will be quantified. The hypothesis is that the tACS, by&#xD;
      increasing the functional connectivity (phase synchronism at the frequency delivered during&#xD;
      the stimulation), will make it possible to modulate the threshold of visual perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the hypothesis is that a single session of 30 Hz tACS stimulation of the right&#xD;
      frontal cortex (around the right FEF) will increase fronto-parietal synchrony within the&#xD;
      right hemisphere of patients with lesions acquired brain responsible for chronic HH, thus&#xD;
      improving the static and kinetic visual field in the first 30 minutes post-stimulation. The&#xD;
      investigator team also hypothesize that a single session of tACS stimulation on the occipital&#xD;
      and posterior parietal cortex contralateral to the lesion (around the V1 region) of patients&#xD;
      with acquired brain lesions responsible for chronic HH will improve the visual field in the&#xD;
      first 30 minutes post-stimulation, but this improvement will be less compared to the&#xD;
      improvement caused by the stimulation of the right FEF, which could be accompanied by a&#xD;
      temporary decrease in the visual perception of the targets on the healthy visual hemi-field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocentric comparative randomized controlled, cross-over and blinded study, Major population&#xD;
      (n = 18), acquired brain lesion responsible for homonymous hemianopia, chronic phase of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular accident (between 3 months and 5 years of evolution) and cohort (n = 18)&#xD;
      healthy subjects not treated with tACS to obtain normative data from visual fields,&#xD;
      neuroimaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient or each healthy volunteer will have an inclusion visit including visual&#xD;
           static and kinetic perimetry, EEG recordings, cognitive tests, questionnaire and brain&#xD;
           MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then, each patient will have 3 visits, including a first evaluation period (perimetry&#xD;
           and EEG) then a stimulation session (right frontal active tACS or contralesional&#xD;
           occipito-parietal active tACS, or placebo tACS) then a second evaluation time (EEG,&#xD;
           perimetry , and reading tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator team expect an immediate and significant increase in visual field size and&#xD;
      improved visual detection capabilities of patients treated with active tACS stimulation on&#xD;
      the right frontal region (FEF) and / or contralateral occipital region (V1-IPS) lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will contribute to the development of an innovative treatment to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of HH brain-injured patients, lacking effective treatment options to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TACS is an easily accessible and easily applicable technique in large-scale clinical&#xD;
      practice. Coupled with EEG monitoring, it is the only one that allows efficient and safe&#xD;
      manipulation of oscillatory activity and interregional synchronicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest in these new methods of non-invasive brain stimulation guiding brain plasticity, in&#xD;
      stroke (130,000 new cases / year) or head trauma is very important. The scientific, clinical&#xD;
      and technological implications are major.&#xD;
