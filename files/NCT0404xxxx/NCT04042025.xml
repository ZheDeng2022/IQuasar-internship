  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up safety and efficacy study of participants in clinical trials&#xD;
      for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who were treated with onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi.&#xD;
      Participants will roll over from their respective previous (parent) study into this long-term&#xD;
      study for continuous monitoring of safety as well as monitoring of continued efficacy and&#xD;
      durability of response to onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants who reach developmental milestones</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via the developmental milestone checklist, formed of 10 yes/no questions with video documentation.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The HFMSE was devised for use in children with SMA to give objective information on motor ability and clinical progression. The HFMSE is formed of 33 assessments rated from 0 (unable to perform functional task) to 2 (able to perform functional task unassisted). Higher scores indicated higher levels of motor ability.</description>
