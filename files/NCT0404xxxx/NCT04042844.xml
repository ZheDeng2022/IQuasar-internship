      This is a double-blind, saline-controlled, and randomized study with blinded assessments&#xD;
      using a single dose. Subjects that have a current diagnosis of chronic lumbar disc disease&#xD;
      and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to active treatment will undergo bone marrow harvest for processing into&#xD;
      BRTX-100 for intradiscal injection. Subjects randomized to control will undergo sham bone&#xD;
      marrow harvest and intradiscal injection procedures. Subjects will return to the study site&#xD;
      for a visit at Week 2, Week 12, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104/Early Termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent, chartered, Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review all unblinded&#xD;
      safety data for the first 10 subjects through Study visit 4 (day 14 post dosing) and prior to&#xD;
      dosing of the 11th subject. All subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive either&#xD;
      intradiscal BRTX-100 or saline. A central randomization will be used.&#xD;
