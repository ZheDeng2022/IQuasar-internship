      Background: Giving birth is a critical moment for the mother and the fetus, potentially&#xD;
      accompanied by stress, tissue damage, cell injury, placental hypoxia and sometimes&#xD;
      multisystem vascular syndrome known as preeclampsia. Epidural analgesia with a local&#xD;
      anesthetic is a common anesthetic approach during labor. Local anesthetics inhibit the&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation and impair the synthesis of ATP, resulting in mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species. Especially when the high demand of ATP&#xD;
      during pregnancy cannot be reached, apoptosis will occur in an anaerobic environment. During&#xD;
      apoptosis the cell membrane integrity is disturbed, releasing the cytoplasm into the blood&#xD;
      circulation. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA acts as a damage associated molecular&#xD;
      pattern (DAMP) by activating the innate immune system leading to inflammation. These DAMPs&#xD;
      are evolutionary conserved and have structural similarity to their bacterial ancestor.&#xD;
      Therefore, cell-free mitochondria can act as a potent agent triggering the immune system in&#xD;
      an autoimmune manner as well as a biomarker for cell damage and hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate to role of epidural analgesia during&#xD;
      birth, quantifying the copy number of circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA in maternal&#xD;
      serum and the placenta compared to controls. The investigators hypothesize that epidural&#xD;
      analgesia with a local anesthetic has an effect on cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels,&#xD;
      promoting the pathogenesis of ERMF and early inflammation. In addition, circulating&#xD;
      mitochondrial DNA could be a potent biomarker for cell damage, early placenta&#xD;
      hypoxia/insufficiency or preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: For this study the investigators planned 3 groups each consisting of 15 patients.&#xD;
      The intervention group (group 1) will be women with vaginal delivery having epidural&#xD;
      analgesia and developing fever before delivery. The control group (group 2) will be women&#xD;
      with vaginal delivery having an epidural analgesia without developing fever before delivery.&#xD;
      Women with vaginal delivery without an epidural analgesia will serve as additional control&#xD;
      (group 3). Blood will be taken at arrival at the delivery ward and immediately after delivery&#xD;
      from a peripheral venous line. In addition, venous blood from the umbilical vein will be&#xD;
      drawn postpartum. Axillary temperature will be measured routinely using a thermometer in a&#xD;
      routine clinical fashion. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA and other immunological&#xD;
      markers will be quantified in maternal and umbilical cord (fetal) serum by real time&#xD;
      quantitative PCR and statistical analysis will be performed by non-parametric tests.&#xD;

        Patients must meet inclusion criteria and must give written consent. Informed consent will&#xD;
        be obtained only for conscious patients preoperative. The cause of admission will be noted,&#xD;
        baseline demographics and clinical history will be recorded. Patients included are giving&#xD;
        birth at the Department of Obstetrics and Feto-Maternal Medicine at the Medical University&#xD;
        of Vienna between July 2019 and July 2020. We are expecting to need to observe 15 patients&#xD;
        per group in order to prove our hypothesis in this pilot study.&#xD;
