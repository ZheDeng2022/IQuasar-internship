  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and the&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of poziotinib in two patient cohorts for up to 114 previously treated&#xD;
      NSCLC patients with any systemic therapy (57 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations&#xD;
      and 57 patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Screening period (Day -30 to Day -1) lasts up to approximately 30 days prior to Cycle 1,&#xD;
      Day 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will provide written Informed Consent prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle is 28 calendar days in duration. There will be two patient cohorts and&#xD;
      eligible patients will be enrolled into each cohort in parallel based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20&#xD;
      mutation status:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 : Previously treated patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation positive&#xD;
           NSCLC (N=57)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 : Previously treated patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation positive&#xD;
           NSCLC (N=57) Toxicity will be assessed based on the severity grade of the adverse events&#xD;
           using CTCAE version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poziotinib (16 mg) will be taken orally, once daily (QD) with food and a glass of water at&#xD;
      approximately the same time each morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs), or other protocol-specified reasons for patient withdrawal.&#xD;
