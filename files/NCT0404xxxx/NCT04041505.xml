  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nova Scotia has among the lowest breastfeeding rates in Canada, with less than one quarter of&#xD;
      infants receiving Health Canada's recommended 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Compared&#xD;
      with feeding formula, breastfeeding has been linked with a number of health advantages,&#xD;
      including fewer infections, higher IQ, and a lowered risk of obesity later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How infants consume human milk is changing. Pumping milk has grown in popularity in recent&#xD;
      years because some mothers may feel stigmatized breastfeeding, especially in public, but also&#xD;
      because it allows other caregivers to help with feeding. Although pumped human milk is&#xD;
      considered equal to breastfeeding, there is very little research in this area, especially&#xD;
      around responsive feeding and later health outcomes. Since pumped milk is fed from a bottle,&#xD;
      the health benefits may be lost (for instance, this may impact a baby's ability to understand&#xD;
      if s/he is hungry or full).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if the volume of human milk an infant consumes&#xD;
      differs if they consume milk from a bottle versus the breast. The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      a cross-over trial in which 62 mother-infant pairs will be randomized to feed at the breast&#xD;
      or from a bottle for 24 hours, have a 24 hour wash-out period, and then 'cross-over' to&#xD;
      another 24 hour session with the opposite 'treatment.' The volume of milk consumed at each&#xD;
      feed within the 24 hour window (via indirect weighing, or weighing the baby before and after&#xD;
      eating) will be recorded to determine if there are differences in milk consumption.&#xD;
      Mother-infant pairs will complete this 3-day study three times, at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this study will help to better understand current infant feeding practices&#xD;
      in Nova Scotia, and the potential role this plays in future health outcomes. Evidence from&#xD;
      this study may help to identify means of improving feeding practices and promoting human milk&#xD;
      as the main food for Nova Scotian infants, setting them on a path for the best start in life.&#xD;

    Interim analysis (n=40 24-hr sessions) yielded biologically implausible data. We do not deem&#xD;
    this novel, at-home, participant-led method prudent. Study will continue with only secondary&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a modified, randomized cross-over study. The 'intervention' in this study is simply feeding infants using one of two modalities that are already familiar to the mother and infant: feeding mother's milk from the breast and from a bottle.&#xD;
At each timepoint (6 weeks, 4 months, 6 months) infants will: be randomized using a balanced design (to control for order effect) to consume human milk from a bottle or from the breast for 24 hours; will then undergo a wash-out period in which they will be fed human milk as they usually would for 24 hours; then will complete the second 'treatment' (bottle or breast) for 24 hours. Due to the nature of the intervention, this study will not be blinded.&#xD;
