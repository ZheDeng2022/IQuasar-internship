      The Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) has been a major source of&#xD;
      information on Head Start programs and the children and families these programs serve since&#xD;
      1997, but has historically not included Region XI (programs that serve federally recognized&#xD;
      American Indian and Alaska Native tribes). AI/AN FACES 2019 builds on AI/AN FACES 2015&#xD;
      (NCT03842111), which was the first national study of Region XI Head Start children and&#xD;
      families, to continue to collect information on key Head Start program performance measures.&#xD;

      The Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) has been a major source of&#xD;
      information on Head Start programs and the children and families the programs serve since&#xD;
      1997, but has historically not included Region XI (programs that serve federally recognized&#xD;
      American Indian and Alaska Native tribes). AI/AN FACES 2019 builds on AI/AN FACES 2015, which&#xD;
      was the first national study of Region XI Head Start children and families, to continue to&#xD;
      collect information on key Head Start program performance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design and execution of AI/AN FACES has been informed by close collaboration with members&#xD;
      of the AI/AN FACES Workgroup which includes Region XI Head Start program directors,&#xD;
      researchers with experience working with AI/AN communities, Mathematica Policy Research study&#xD;
      staff, and federal officials from the Office of Head Start, Region XI, and the Office of&#xD;
      Planning, Research and Evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building on FACES as the foundation, members of the AI/AN FACES Workgroup have shared&#xD;
      insights and information on the kinds of information needed about children and families&#xD;
      served by Region XI AI/AN Head Start programs. Members also provided input on recruitment&#xD;
      practices and study methods that are responsive to the unique cultural and self-governing&#xD;
      contexts of tribal Head Start programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI/AN FACES 2019 provides the mechanism for collecting data on a nationally representative&#xD;
      probability sample in Region XI to learn what progress Head Start has made toward meeting&#xD;
      program performance goals and provide valid and reliable information to federal, local, and&#xD;
      tribal stakeholders. AI/AN FACES 2019 focuses on children and families to describe the school&#xD;
      readiness skills, family characteristics, and Head Start experiences of these children, with&#xD;
      a focus on Native culture and language. The investigators will collect information on&#xD;
      programs and classrooms to provide context for children's experiences. Data collection with&#xD;
      Region XI children, families, classrooms, and programs will take place in the Fall of 2019&#xD;
      and the Spring of 2020.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Region XI AI/AN Head Start programs participating in AI/AN FACES were a&#xD;
             probability sample selected from among 146 study-eligible programs on the 2016-2017&#xD;
             Head Start Program Information Report (PIR). To be eligible for the study, a program&#xD;
             had to be providing services directly to children ages 3 to 5, and not be in imminent&#xD;
             danger of losing its grantee status. Probability samples of centers were selected&#xD;
             within each program, classrooms within each center, and children within each&#xD;
             classroom. Teachers associated with selected classrooms were included in the study&#xD;
             with certainty, as were parents associated with selected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Head Start programs in Regions I through X and Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (Region&#xD;
             XII) were not eligible for AI/AN FACES. Other ACF studies (FACES-NCT03971435 and&#xD;
             MSHS-NCT03116243) focus on those programs.&#xD;
