    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine (fluoroethyltyrosine) works in&#xD;
      detecting tumors in participants with intracranial tumors that have come back. Imaging&#xD;
      agents, such as fluoroethyltyrosine, may help doctors see the tumor better during a positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) scan.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) PET can differentiate between benign&#xD;
      treatment-related changes and recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if FET PET can accurately differentiate between low-grade and high-grade&#xD;
      glial neoplasms in population 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes and&#xD;
      recurrence in comparison to pathology or imaging follow-up in population 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if FET PET can differentiate between benign treatment-related changes and&#xD;
      recurrence in comparison to pathology alone in population 1 patients with recurrent low-grade&#xD;
      gliomas (grades 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive F-18 fluoroethyltyrosine intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 minute&#xD;
      and undergo PET over 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>Radiologists will classify lesions based on imaging as either having recurrent disease or not having recurrent disease. True Positives (TP) are defined as an FET PET read positive for tumor and pathology/follow-up demonstrates tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample, False positives (FP) are defined as an FET PET read positive for tumor and pathology/follow-up demonstrates negative tumor recurrence in all of the biopsy samples, True negatives (TN) are defined as an FET PET read as negative for tumor and pathology/follow-up also negative tumor recurrence in all of the biopsy samples and a false negative (FN) is defined as an FET PET read as negative for tumor and pathology/follow-up demonstrates tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample. Misclassification rate = [FP+FN)]/[FP+FN+TP+TN]</description>

    <measure>Misclassification rate for either high grade or low grade in patients with suspected neoplasms (Population 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Readers will have access only to FET PET images for Patients with suspected glial neoplasms (Grade 2-4) planning to undergo biopsy or surgery prior to primary treatment during evaluation and will grade the lesions in a binary fashion as having Grade II glial neoplasms or having Grade III/IV glial neoplasms. True positive (TP2): FET PET read as positive for Grade III/IV neoplasm, pathology demonstrates Grade III/IV neoplasm. False positive (FP2): FET PET read as positive for Grade III/IV neoplasm, pathology demonstrates Grade II neoplasm. True negative (TN2): FET PET read as positive for Grade II neoplasm, pathology demonstrates Grade II neoplasm. False negative (FN2): FET PET read as positive for Grade II neoplasm, pathology demonstrates Grade III/IV neoplasm. Misclassification rate = [FP2+FN2]/[FP2+FN2+TP2+TN2]</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binary characterization of follow-up imaging as positive/negative for tumor recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the absence of pathology, imaging will be used for correlation. Positive for tumor recurrence on follow-up imaging as correlate endpoint will be defined as a greater than 50% increase in the enhancing component of the lesion. If there is less than 50% increase in the enhancing component of the lesion, then it will be considered negative for tumor recurrence on follow-up. Follow-up imaging has to be performed within six months of the FET PET imaging study.</description>

    <measure>Misclassification rate for FET PET in the evaluation of recurrent low-grade gliomas (Population 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Low-grade glioma is defined by low uptake of FET. Radiologists will classify lesions based on imaging as either having recurrent disease or not having recurrent disease. True Positives (TP1L) are defined as an FET PET read positive for low-grade tumor and pathology/follow-up demonstrates low-grade tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample, False positives (FP1L) are defined as an FET PET read positive for low grade tumor recurrence and pathology/follow-up demonstrates negative low-grade tumor recurrence in all of the biopsy samples, True negatives (TN1L) are defined as an FET PET read as negative for low-grade tumor recurrence and pathology/follow-up also negative for low grade tumor recurrence in all of the biopsy samples and a false negative (FN1L) is defined as an FET PET read as negative for low grade tumor recurrence and pathology/follow-up demonstrates low grade tumor recurrence in at least one biopsy sample.
