    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>5-years data were retrieved from insurance claims Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases and were evaluated in 5 months of this retrospective, observational study. Participants who initiated treatment with tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), between January 2014 and September 2016 were involved in this study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>5-years (January 2012 to September 2017) included pre-index of 2 years, 2 years to capture treatment initiation (index date), and 1 year for follow-up post-index. Index date was first prescription date of treatment (tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept) from January 2014 to September 2016.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Pre-index Claims-based Index For Rheumatoid Arthritis Severity (CIRAS)</title>
          <description>CIRAS provided a single value of rheumatoid arthritis severity using the following 9 measures: age, gender, inflammatory marker tests, rehabilitation visits, felty Syndrome, platelet orders, rheumatoid factor tests, chemistry panels, and rheumatologist visits. Type, or amount present, of all 9 measures was used to derive the overall CIRAS score by applying a weighted average. The CIRAS score was observed to range from 0-9.58 in this study, with higher values indicating generally greater severity of RA.</description>

          <title>Quan-Charlson Score</title>
          <description>The Quan-Charlson comorbidity index (QCCI) score predicts the probability of death in participants and was based on the presence of any International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes on medical claims at any time during pre-index period. Total score ranges from 0 to 9.0. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome could result in mortality. Here, participants with QCCI score 0, 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 or more were reported.</description>

          <description>Participants who discontinued index medication without switching or restarting index medication were those who had a gap in index medication therapy of at least 60 days and there were no claims for either the index medication or a different advanced therapy for the remainder of the follow-up period. Index medications were tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept.</description>

        <description>Index medication persistent therapy duration was defined as days to discontinue or immediate switch or end of 12 months post-index follow if participants remained persistent, whichever came first. Index medications were tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept. Persistent with the index medication: not having a gap in the therapy of at least 60 days between prescription fill dates and their administration. Discontinuation from index medication: gap in the index medication therapy of at least 60 days. Immediate switch from index medication: initiation of a non-index advanced therapy before end of a 60-day gap in index medication.</description>

          <description>Participants who initiated index medication in combination with main NB-DMARDSs were analyzed to evaluate percentage of participants who were persistent with main NB-DMARDs use. Main NB-DMARDs considered in the study were methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine. Index medications were tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept. Persistence with main NB-DMARDs was defined as not having a gap of at least 60 days between prescription fill dates and their administration.</description>

          <description>Participants who initiated index medication in combination with main NB-DMARDSs were analyzed to evaluate percentage of participants who discontinued then switched from main NB-DMARDs. Main NB-DMARDS considered in the study were methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine. Index medications were tofacitinib, adalimumab or etanercept. Participants who discontinued main NB-DMARDs then switched from main NB-DMARDS were those who had gap in the main NB-DMARDs medication of at least 60 days and then after the gap switched to other medication than main NB-DMARDs.</description>

        <description>Dose escalation for index medication was defined as: 1) for adalimumab: at least 1 claim in the 12 months post-index follow-up with an average weekly dose of at least 40 milligram per week (mg/week), 2) for etanercept: at least 1 claim in the 12 months post-index follow-up with an average weekly dose of at least 100 mg/week, 3) for tofacitinib: at least 1 claim in the 12 months post-index follow-up with an average weekly dose of at least 20 milligram per day (mg/day) for immediate release and 22 mg/day for extended release. Participants who met dose escalation effectiveness criteria were those who did not have any dose escalation for index medication compared to the starting dose.</description>

        <description>Participants who started only index medication regimen (as monotherapy), but eventually initiated main NB-DMARDs were identified in the 12 months post-index follow-up period as adding new NB-DMARD. Participants who started index medication regimen along with any of the main NB-DMARDs (combination therapy), presence of a different NB-DMARD in 12 months post-index was identified as adding new NB-DMARD. Participants who met NB-DMARD effectiveness criteria were those who did not add a new NB-DMARD in the 12 months post-index follow up.
