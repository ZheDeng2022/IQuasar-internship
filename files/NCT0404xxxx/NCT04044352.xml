      This is a study of a reverse-engineered, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade,&#xD;
      antiviral-sensitive, influenza A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus (A/California/04/2009/H1N1-like)&#xD;
      infection to assess the effect of pre-existing immunity on clinical and immunological&#xD;
      responses. Up to 80 healthy adult subjects will undergo intranasal inoculation with&#xD;
      A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus, and their clinical manifestations, viral shedding and&#xD;
      immunological responses will be characterized. This proposed study will establish a H1N1&#xD;
      influenza virus controlled human infection (CHI) model at the National Institute of Allergy&#xD;
      and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      (DMID)-sponsored Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU) clinical study sites. The&#xD;
      model has been developed and used by NIAID Division of Intramural Research. The proposed&#xD;
      study will expand US research capacity to perform influenza CHI studies to advance the&#xD;
      understanding of influenza pathogenesis and novel vaccine research and development. The&#xD;
      Primary Objective for this study is to evaluate the association of symptomatic Reverse&#xD;
      Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)-positive influenza virus infection&#xD;
      post-challenge and pre-existing Hemagglutinin Inhibition Test (HAI) antibody titers. The&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives for this study are: 1) To describe viral recovery by quantitative RT-PCR&#xD;
      from study subjects at baseline and post-challenge; 2) To describe serum HAI and MN antibody&#xD;
      responses post-challenge in healthy subjects by infection status; 3) To evaluate the&#xD;
      association of asymptomatic RT-PCR-positive influenza virus infection (viral shedding)&#xD;
      post-challenge and pre-existing HAI antibody titers; 4) To evaluate the association of&#xD;
      symptomatic RT-PCR-negative status post-challenge and pre-existing HAI antibody titers; 5) To&#xD;
      determine the frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) post-challenge.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated from available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). MMID is a composite endpoint determined by the presence of viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from a NP swab), accompanied by at least one the following symptoms occurring any time from Day 2 through Day 8; body aches or pain, chest tightness, chills, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, sinus congestion, coryza, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, fever, headache, lymphopenia, nausea, a 3% or more decrease in oxygen saturation from baseline, productive cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and sweats. The percentage of participants that developed MMID was calculated within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated from available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). MMID is a composite endpoint determined by the presence of viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from a NP swab), accompanied by at least one the following symptoms occurring any time from Day 2 through Day 8; body aches or pain, chest tightness, chills, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, sinus congestion, coryza, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, fever, headache, lymphopenia, nausea, a 3% or more decrease in oxygen saturation from baseline, productive cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and sweats.

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) and post-challenge on Days 8, 29 and 61 for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. Seroconversion was defined as a pre-challenge titer 1:10 or greater and a minimum 4-fold rise in post-challenge antibody titer. The percentage of participants achieving seroconversion was calculated within each post-challenge study day and by infection status as observed over the study challenge period (Day 2 to Day 8); RT-PCR Negative (never positive), RT-PCR Positive Asymptomatic (participants with at least one positive PCR result but no symptoms reported), at least once RT-PCR Positive Symptomatic (or MMID).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) and post-challenge on Days 8, 29 and 61 for the MN assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. Seroconversion was defined as a pre-challenge titer 1:10 or greater and a minimum 4-fold rise in post-challenge antibody titer. The percentage of participants achieving seroconversion was calculated within each post-challenge study day and by infection status as observed over the study challenge period (Day 2 to Day 8); RT-PCR Negative (never positive), RT-PCR Positive Asymptomatic (participants with at least one positive PCR result but no symptoms reported), at least once RT-PCR Positive Symptomatic (or MMID).</description>

        <title>Duration of Viral Shedding in Nasopharyngeal (NP) Swab by Baseline HAI Seroprotection Status</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated from available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). Duration of viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from NP swab) was calculated from the day of the initial positive PCR result to the day of the last positive PCR result prior to discharge from the challenge unit facility, regardless of intermittent negative PCR results. The mean duration of viral shedding was calculated among participants with detected virus within each pre-challenge HAI seroprotection status group.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Viral Shedding in NP Swab at Day 4 by Baseline HAI Seroprotection Status</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated for available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). The number of participants with viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from a NP swab) was calculated for each study day post-challenge (Day 2 to Day 8) and at any time during the entire challenge period within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated for available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). The number of participants with viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from a NP swab) was calculated for each study day post-challenge (Day 2 to Day 8) and at any time during the entire challenge period within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Viral Shedding in NP Swab at Day 5 by Baseline MN Seroprotection Status</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the MN assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated for available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). The number of participants with viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from a NP swab) was calculated for each study day post-challenge (Day 2 to Day 8) and at any time during the entire challenge period within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group.</description>

        <title>Time Until Detectable Viral Shedding in NP Swab by Baseline HAI Seroprotection Status</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated from available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). Time until viral shedding (detected by any approved positive RT-PCR test from a NP swab) was calculated as the initial day of viral shedding post-challenge for each participant. Median time to viral shedding was calculated within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group via the Kaplan-Meier estimator.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the HAI assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated from available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). The quantity of viral load copies/mL from NP swab was measured via quantitative RT-PCR result for each post-challenge study day. The mean of each sample's quantitative PCR replicate results was calculated from available results. Total viral shedding, as observed until study discharge, was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC), then log-10 transformed. Peak viral shedding was calculated as the maximum viral load copies/mL observed until study discharge, then log-10 transformed. The mean and median of the log-10 AUC and the mean and median of the log-10 peak viral load were both calculated within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group.</description>

        <title>Magnitude of Viral Shedding in NP Swab by Baseline MN Seroprotection Status</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-challenge (Day -2) for the MN assay conducted with the A/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1 virus as the antigen. The geometric mean of each sample's replicate results was calculated from available results, then grouped by seroprotection status (titer results &gt;= 1:40 vs &lt; 1:40). The quantity of viral load copies/mL from NP swab was measured via quantitative RT-PCR result for each post-challenge study day. The mean of each sample's quantitative PCR replicate results was calculated from available results. Total viral shedding, as observed until study discharge, was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC), then log-10 transformed. Peak viral shedding was calculated as the maximum viral load copies/mL observed until study discharge, then log-10 transformed. The mean and median of the log-10 AUC and the mean and median of the log-10 peak viral load were both calculated within each pre-challenge seroprotection status group.</description>
