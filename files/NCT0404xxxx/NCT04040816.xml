      This is a Phase II, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Multiple Dose&#xD;
      study to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of SAP-001&#xD;
      in Gout Patients with Hyperuricemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multiple dose study will include up to 4 cohorts. Each cohort will be comprised of 15&#xD;
      patients who will be dosed with SAP-001 or placebo once daily (QD) for 28 days. Dose&#xD;
      escalation from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 will occur after preliminary data are partially&#xD;
      unblinded and safety data along with PK and PD parameters are analyzed and reviewed.&#xD;
      Enrollment in Cohort 3 will begin after the last subject is randomized into Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to starting enrollment into Cohort 4, a complete safety assessment of Cohorts 1, 2 and&#xD;
      3 will be performed to select the dose to be used in Cohort 4.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Patients must meet the American College of Rheumatology scoring criteria for the&#xD;
             classification of primary gout (Neogi et al 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be able to take gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine 0.6 mg QD&#xD;

             prophylaxis will be initiated at the Day -1 visit in patients who are sUA-lowering&#xD;
             agent naïve. For patients that discontinue an sUA-lowering agent(s) (ie, washout from&#xD;
             current therapy) during the screening period, gout flare prophylaxis should be&#xD;
             initiated at the time of discontinuation of the sUA-lowering agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is a nonsmoker or light smoker (smokes fewer than 10 cigarettes per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female patients either will be postmenopausal (female patients who state they are&#xD;
             postmenopausal should have had cessation of menses for &gt; 1 year and have serum&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and serum estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL);&#xD;

             drug, the following forms of contraception: double-barrier method, hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives, barrier with spermicide, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide,&#xD;
             intrauterine device, oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives, or a sterile&#xD;
             sexual partner. All female patients, except those with documented surgical&#xD;
             hysterectomy in medical history, will have a negative urine pregnancy test result&#xD;
             prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;

             sterile or agrees to use hormonal contraceptives, female condom with spermicide,&#xD;
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, oral, implantable, or&#xD;
             injectable contraceptives. Male patients will refrain from sperm donation from the&#xD;
             time of check-in (Day -1) until 90 days following the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

             discontinue sUA-lowering agents or a patient not previously taking sUA-lowering agents&#xD;
             during the screening period, gout flare prophylaxis should be initiated with&#xD;
