  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A completely new type of digital dermatoscope has been developed in order to take a&#xD;
      significant step forward in technology for skin cancer imaging. By means of this study a&#xD;
      better insight can be gained of the current performance and workflow in clinical&#xD;
      dermatoscopy. This knowledge will be used to further improve the developed technology.&#xD;
