  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a set of four independent experiments involving for each of them functional and&#xD;
      structural MRI data acquisition. They aim at investigating decision making mechanisms in&#xD;
      bulimia nervosa when participants have to make food or monetary choices under specific&#xD;
      conditions that mimic binge eating episodes or kleptomania which are two major symptoms of&#xD;
      bulimia nervosa. All experiments are cross sectional studies. Each experiment is subdivided&#xD;
      into two parts: a first part without any MRI data acquisition and during which all the tasks&#xD;
      are performed. This part aims at making sure that a behavioral effect is observed before&#xD;
      starting MRI data acquisition. The second part aims at investigating the neural correlates&#xD;
      observed in the first part and additionally, at reproducing the behavioral effects observed&#xD;
      in the first part. Therefore the first part may be regarded as an independent study as&#xD;
      compared to the second part.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each part of each experiment is built of a main task, a set of secondary tasks and&#xD;
      questionnaires. Only the main task changes from one experiment to another. Within each&#xD;
      experiment, the only difference between the two parts is that the main task is performed&#xD;
      while participants are being scanned in an MRI scanner. Details of the tasks are provided&#xD;
      below. Each part of each experiment is performed over one visit only and is a cross sectional&#xD;
      study. The visit is dedicated to the tasks. Questionnaires may be filled during the visit or&#xD;
      at participant's home within the week following the visit for questionnaires which are not&#xD;
      assessing participant's state. Questionnaires assessing participant's state are filled during&#xD;
      the visit at appropriate time. The total number of participants mentioned below is the sum of&#xD;
      the planned number of participants within each group, i.e. patients and healthy participants,&#xD;
      within each part of each experiment.&#xD;

    <description>The EDE is a semi-structured interview conducted by a trained clinician to assess the psychopathology associated with the diagnosis of an eating disorder.
