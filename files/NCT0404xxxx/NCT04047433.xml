  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in connective tissue components are associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The investigators expect to find a difference&#xD;
      in SNP's frequency between women who had Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) and in the&#xD;
      healthy population. The fact that pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and OASIS occurs in the same&#xD;
      anatomic region and the well-known association between few SNP's and the risk for POP,&#xD;
      suggests for a common pathophysiology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The perineum consists of skin, muscles and connective tissue. A connective tissue disorder&#xD;
      related to POP has been reported in biochemical and molecular studies. OASIS are considered a&#xD;
      severe complication of vaginal delivery that may lead to a great deal of morbidity. Familial&#xD;
      history is known as a risk factor for OASIS. Currently, there is no established genetic link&#xD;
      between connective tissue components and OASIS. Therefore, the investigators assume that&#xD;
      studying the genetic predisposition factors of women who experience OASIS, might generate a&#xD;
      stronger tool to predict severe occurrence of vaginal laceration. It may also help to consult&#xD;
      women before vaginal delivery about the risk of OASIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to find an association between genetic variation and increased risk&#xD;
      for OASIS.&#xD;
