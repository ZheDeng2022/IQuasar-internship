  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low glycemic index and low glycemic load diets have been shown to improve glycemic control&#xD;
      and cardiometabolic risk factors in randomized controlled trials in people with diabetes and&#xD;
      are associated with reduced incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies inclusive of people with diabetes. These benefits have been recognized in the&#xD;
      most recent updates of the clinical practice guidelines for the management of diabetes from&#xD;
      the U.S., Canada, UK, and Australia. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes&#xD;
      (EASD) also recommends low-GI/GL diets but has not updated their guidance in 15 years. To&#xD;
      support the update of the EASD clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the totality of the&#xD;
      available evidence from randomized controlled trials of the effect of low GI/GL dietary&#xD;
      patterns on glycemic control and other established cardiometabolic risk factors in&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes. The findings generated by this proposed knowledge synthesis will&#xD;
      help improve the health of consumers through informing evidence-based guidelines and&#xD;
      improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating&#xD;
      industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The prevalence of diabetes continues to rise globally and remains a major cause&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of death. Diet and lifestyle remain the&#xD;
      cornerstone of therapy for diabetes prevention and management. Approaches that target&#xD;
      postprandial glycemic excursions may have particular advantages. Low glycemic index (GI) and&#xD;
      low glycemic load (GL) diets have been shown to improve glycemic control and cardiometabolic&#xD;
      risk factors in randomized controlled trials in people with diabetes and are associated with&#xD;
      reduced incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in prospective cohort studies&#xD;
      inclusive of people with diabetes. These benefits have been recognized in the most recent&#xD;
      updates of the clinical practice guidelines for diabetes from the U.S., Canada, UK, and&#xD;
      Australia. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) also recommends&#xD;
      low-GI/GL diets but has not updated their guidance in 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary guidelines and&#xD;
      public health policy development. As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted&#xD;
      toward food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, there is a need for systematic reviews&#xD;
      and meta-analyses comparing the role of low GI/GL diets in the management of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To support the update the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators conducted a systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using the GRADE approach of the&#xD;
      effect of low GI/GL dietary patterns on glycemic control and other established&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      manual searches of references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Dietary randomized controlled trials conducted in humans with a follow-up&#xD;
      duration ≥ 3 weeks investigating the effect of low GI/GL diets on measures of glycemic&#xD;
      control, blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure, or inflammation will be included. Studies&#xD;
      that are not conducted in humans, not randomized, have an acute feeding design (&lt;3 weeks),&#xD;
      lack a suitable control (non-isocaloric) and/or do not report viable endpoint data will not&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be HbA1c. Secondary outcomes will include other markers of&#xD;
      glycemic control (fasting glucose, fasting insulin); blood lipids (LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B,&#xD;
      HDL-C, triglycerides); adiposity (body weight, BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure&#xD;
      (systolic and diastolic blood pressure), and inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Separate pooled analyses will be conducted for each area of cardiometabolic&#xD;
      control using the Generic Inverse Variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in&#xD;
      the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Exceptions&#xD;
      will be made for the use of fixed-effects models where there is &lt;5 included trials&#xD;
      irrespective of heterogeneity or small trials are being pooled with larger more precise&#xD;
      trials in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be&#xD;
      applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by the Cochran Q statistic and&#xD;
      quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are ≥10&#xD;
      studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori&#xD;
      subgroup analyses by diabetes type (type 1 or type 2), study design (parallel or crossover),&#xD;
      follow-up duration (&lt;12 weeks or ≥12 weeks), comparator diet, baseline measurements, risk of&#xD;
      bias and diabetes duration. To further explore sources of heterogeneity, investigators will&#xD;
      perform post hoc subgroup analyses by age (&lt;18y vs ≥18y), energy balance (neutral, negative&#xD;
      or positive), feeding control (metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice, ad libitum), test GI&#xD;
      (≤55 vs &gt;55 GI units), test GL (by median) and funding source. Meta-regression analyses will&#xD;
      assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. Linear dietary GI&#xD;
      and dietary GL dose-response analyses will be assessed using continuous meta-regression&#xD;
      analyses. Non-linear dose-response association will be assessed using a two-stage&#xD;
      multivariate random-effects method with restricted cubic splines with three knots. When ≥10&#xD;
      studies are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots&#xD;
      and formal testing using the Egger's and Begg's tests. If publication bias is suspected, then&#xD;
      the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing&#xD;
      study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence assessment: The certainty of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      low GI/GL diets in the management of diabetes, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines&#xD;
      and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating&#xD;
      industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
