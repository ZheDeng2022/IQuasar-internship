    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial that compares written exposure therapy with usual care among&#xD;
      patients at risk for cardiovascular event-induced PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized with acute cardiovascular events, including strokes, heart attacks, and&#xD;
      cardiac arrest are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the&#xD;
      trauma of the acute medical event. The goal of this study is to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a randomized trial involving a psychological intervention to prevent the&#xD;
      development of PTSD symptoms in patients at risk for PTSD. Patients who are admitted with&#xD;
      these acute cardiovascular events will first be screened for PTSD risk factors while&#xD;
      in-hospital after the index event. These risk factors will include elevated threat&#xD;
      perceptions at the time of presentation to the hospital or early symptoms of PTSD due to the&#xD;
      cardiovascular event. Patients at elevated risk for PTSD will then be randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group or usual care. Those assigned to the intervention will participate in 5&#xD;
      sessions of written exposure therapy in which they are asked to write about the experience of&#xD;
      their cardiovascular event with guidance from a trained study clinician. At 1 month after&#xD;
      discharge, all patients will be contacted by phone to complete a questionnaire that assesses&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms related to the cardiovascular event. Descriptive statistics will be used to&#xD;
      understand the feasibility of testing the written exposure therapy intervention as part of a&#xD;
      larger, fully powered clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing a life threatening cardiovascular event, such as a stroke, transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack (TIA), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or cardiac arrest has been found to be&#xD;
      associated with PTSD symptoms in up to 1 in 3 survivors. Patients with elevated PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      are at risk for lower medication adherence, increased readmissions, recurrent cardiovascular&#xD;
      events, and worsened quality of life. Risk for recurrent cardiovascular events is especially&#xD;
      high in the initial weeks after acute cardiovascular events, and existing epidemiological&#xD;
      data suggest that PTSD symptoms increase this risk. Thus, intervening early to prevent PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms prior to waiting the full one or more months to make a PTSD diagnosis may provide&#xD;
      new opportunities for offsetting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Despite these adverse&#xD;
      consequence of cardiovascular event-induced PTSD, these patients are not currently being&#xD;
      systematically screened or treated to prevent PTSD symptoms, in part because there is no&#xD;
      evidence assessing the effect of early interventions in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing number of studies have been evaluating early interventions after trauma to prevent&#xD;
      PTSD. While there is no gold-standard intervention, psychological interventions grounded in&#xD;
      trauma-focused, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have shown promise in some populations.&#xD;
      For example, compared to a supportive counseling control condition, CBT has been found to&#xD;
      reduce PTSD symptom severity and incidence in individuals with acute stress disorder (ASD),&#xD;
      an early manifestation of posttraumatic stress, detected within the first month of a&#xD;
      traumatic event. Preliminary research suggests that an exposure-based CBT intervention&#xD;
      delivered in the immediate aftermath of trauma for individuals meeting Criterion A of a&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) PTSD diagnosis&#xD;
      may also hold promise for PTSD prevention. Acute cardiovascular events such as stroke and ACS&#xD;
      as the source of trauma are inherently different from other forms of stressors that commonly&#xD;
      lead to PTSD. As opposed to an external and past traumatic threat (e.g., combat,&#xD;
      physical/emotional abuse), these events can represent an ongoing internal somatic threat.&#xD;
      Accordingly, treatments for preventing PTSD such as the trauma-focused CBT interventions&#xD;
      discussed above need to be formally evaluated in this distinct patient population before&#xD;
      generalizing the findings from other patient populations. In particular, the willingness to&#xD;
      engage in therapies to prevent or reduce PTSD symptoms may differ in this patient population.&#xD;
      Few of these patients are actively seeking treatment. Many may not be aware of potential&#xD;
      psychological symptoms that can begin or worsen after these events and may not perceive their&#xD;
      psychological symptoms to be problematic. Hence, the acceptability of psychological&#xD;
      interventions is particularly relevant in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written exposure therapy represents a promising intervention to prevent PTSD after&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Written exposure therapy is a brief exposure-based therapy, founded on&#xD;
      the principles of Pennebaker and Beale's written disclosure procedure. The treatment protocol&#xD;
      consists of 5 sessions, each comprising 30 minutes of writing. In each session, participants&#xD;
      are instructed to write about their memory of the traumatic event with particular attention&#xD;
      to the felt emotions and the meaning of the event. The initial session also incorporates&#xD;
      psychoeducation and review of the rationale for the intervention by a study clinician.&#xD;
      Sessions end with therapists' discussing how the writing session went. The rationale behind&#xD;
      this exposure therapy is that there is a significant habituation of emotional reactivity to&#xD;
      reminders of the traumatic event over repeated writing sessions. Consistent with this&#xD;
      rationale, research suggests that these exposure writing sessions are associated with greater&#xD;
      initial emotional and physiological reactivity and greater habituation of these responses&#xD;
      over time compared to a control writing condition. A recent study showed that this brief&#xD;
      psychotherapy approach was non-inferior to a more extensive CBT approach (cognitive&#xD;
      processing therapy) for reducing PTSD symptoms in adults with PTSD. Written exposure therapy&#xD;
      has also been shown to be effective at lowering PTSD symptoms in patients with motor vehicle&#xD;
      accident-induced PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast with more standard CBT interventions, written exposure therapy was designed to&#xD;
      create a more acceptable exposure-based treatment option for PTSD that is easily disseminated&#xD;
      and implemented. Like the promising trauma-focused CBT interventions for PTSD prevention, it&#xD;
      is also exposure-based. In light of these qualities, written exposure therapy thus may be&#xD;
      ideally suited for reducing PTSD symptoms in non-treatment seeking survivors of acute&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Key differences between written exposure therapy and other CBT&#xD;
      approaches to treating PTSD include a lower frequency of sessions (~5) and no homework&#xD;
      requirement, resulting in higher treatment completion compared to a more rigorous&#xD;
      exposure-based therapy approach. Other advantages of written exposure therapy are that it&#xD;
      requires a lower level of training from clinicians and less clinician time, which could&#xD;
      facilitate dissemination.&#xD;

    <measure>PTSD Checklist - Stressor Specific (PCL-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is to measure PTSD symptoms due to the index cardiovascular event. The PCL-S is self-report measure of the symptoms of PTSD. Respondents rate how much they were bothered by 20 symptoms, each rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), such that total scores range from 0-80. The PCL-S (specific stressor) asks respondents about symptoms in relation to an identified stressful experience. The PCL-S aims to link symptom endorsements to the index cardiovascular event</description>

        <description>This is to measure PTSD symptoms due to the index cardiovascular event. The PCL-S is self-report measure of the symptoms of PTSD. Respondents rate how much they were bothered by 20 symptoms, each rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), such that total scores range from 0-80. The PCL-S (specific stressor) asks respondents about symptoms in relation to an identified stressful experience.
