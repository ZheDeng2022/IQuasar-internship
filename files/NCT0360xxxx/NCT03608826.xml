  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ReLINQuish study is to characterize the relationship between subcutaneous&#xD;
      impedance and hemodynamic measurements in patients with heart failure. Additionally, the&#xD;
      relationship between changes in subcutaneous impedance and other physiologic parameters&#xD;
      during acute decompensated HF events will be characterized.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients meeting at least 1 of 3 criteria will be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with symptomatic systolic or diastolic heart failure who in the&#xD;
                  clinician's judgment have a high likelihood of undergoing serial right heart&#xD;
                  catheterizations to aid in clinical management of their heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with dyspnea on exertion in whom exercise hemodynamics is indicated to&#xD;
                  diagnose diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have or will be implanted with a pulmonary artery pressure monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) is willing and able to&#xD;
             provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol, including follow-up visits&#xD;
             and Carelink transmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant (all females of child-bearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 1 week of enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study,&#xD;
             without documented pre-approval from a Medtronic study manager&#xD;
