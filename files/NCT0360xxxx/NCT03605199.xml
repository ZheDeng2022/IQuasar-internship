  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, multi-center, phase 2 study of the efficacy of denosumab in subjects with&#xD;
      giant cell rich tumors of bone. The population will consist of subjects with the following&#xD;
      tumor types: aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC), giant cell granuloma (GCG) and other giant cell&#xD;
      rich lesions (primary bone, non-malignant).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase 2 single arm trial subjects with giant cell rich tumors that would require&#xD;
      morbid surgery OR with tumors that have recurred after previous surgery will be treated with&#xD;
      denosumab. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate avoidance of surgery and&#xD;
      performance of less morbid surgical procedure compared with the planned surgical procedure at&#xD;
      baseline in subjects with salvageable giant cell rich tumors during the study. For subjects&#xD;
      with unsalvageable tumors the objective is to evaluate disease control (radiological response&#xD;
      assessed by combined RECIST, PET, inverse Choi when available and/or no progression at 1 year&#xD;
      (based on disease assessment) in combination with stable pain score defined as ≤ 1 point&#xD;
      increase on 'worst pain' question in BPI-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection may occur at any time during the study based on the clinical judgement of&#xD;
      the Investigator. For subjects that undergo surgical tumor resection, denosumab treatment&#xD;
      will be discontinued after surgery. In all other cases, denosumab treatment continues for a&#xD;
      maximum of up to 3 years, or until confirmation of disease progression, the Investigator's or&#xD;
      Sponsor's recommendation of discontinuation, the subject's decision to discontinue for any&#xD;
      reason or administration of any of the prohibited therapies listed in the study protocol. For&#xD;
      subjects that continue to show clinical benefit after 3 years of treatment with denosumab,&#xD;
      ongoing treatment outside of study protocol is optional after discussion with Amgen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessment of histopathological response and for translational research purposes a tumor&#xD;
      sample will be requested either during study or at the EOT (surgical sample only for the&#xD;
      subject group that has undergone surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time the study is still open, re-treatment may be allowed for subjects who&#xD;
      demonstrated a response to denosumab and are currently not receiving denosumab treatment&#xD;
      (e.g., in the case of recurrent disease while subject is in the safety follow-up phase or&#xD;
      subjects that have completed the study and have later experienced disease progression). The&#xD;
      re-treatment decision including the use of the loading dose and discontinuation of therapy&#xD;
      will be handled on a case-by-case basis; prior authorization from the Sponsor is required.&#xD;
      Subjects must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to being considered for&#xD;
      re-treatment, with the exception of the exclusion criterium of previous denosumab treatment.&#xD;
      The same subject number will be assigned to avoid bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall in total approximately 60 subjects with giant cell rich tumors that would require&#xD;
      morbid surgery or with tumors that have recurred after previous surgery will be included. The&#xD;
      investigators expect 50% of subjects will have salvageable giant cell rich tumors and the&#xD;
      remaining 50% of subjects to have unsalvageable giant cell rich tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will consist of subjects with the following cohorts according to tumor type:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC), ~ approximately 40 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Giant Cell Granuloma (GCG) and other giant cell rich lesions (primary bone,&#xD;
           non-malignant), ~ approximately 20 subjects&#xD;
