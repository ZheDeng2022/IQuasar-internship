    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I-II, first-in-human (FIH) study for A166 as monotherapy in&#xD;
      HER2-expressing patients who progressed on or did not respond to available standard&#xD;
      therapies. Patients enrolled in this Phase III study must have documented HER2 positivity&#xD;
      defined as positive on in situ hybridization (ISH) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) or&#xD;
      HER2 expression, defined as at least 1+ by validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) test. The&#xD;
      patient must be, in the judgment of the investigator, an appropriate candidate for&#xD;
      experimental therapy after available standard therapies have ceased to provide clinical&#xD;
      benefit for their disease. Patients will receive study drug as a single IV infusion at the&#xD;
      prescribed dose level in each treatment cycle. Cycles will continue until disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. The study is divided into 2 parts (Phase I and Phase II).&#xD;
