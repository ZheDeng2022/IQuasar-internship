      This is a pilot study to compare pre- and post-SABR core biopsies of stage I NSCLC tumors to&#xD;
      identify SABR-induced immune-mediated tumor recognition based on a significant and specific&#xD;
      expansion of T-cell clones using a novel T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing assay. This will be&#xD;
      coupled with (1) novel genomic analysis of candidate tumor antigens that may be released from&#xD;
      the pre-SABR tumor and (2) functional validation assays to screen post-treatment peripheral&#xD;
      blood T-cells for reactivity to these released candidate tumor antigens. In addition,&#xD;
      cell-based analysis will be used to identify changes in key T-cell infiltrates into the&#xD;
      post-SABR tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. While stereotactic&#xD;
      ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is delivered as standard treatment in patients with medically&#xD;
      inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an alarming 30-40% of these patients&#xD;
      still develop disease recurrence just outside of the radiation field and deadly distant&#xD;
      metastases in their lifetime. Furthermore, since the abscopal response was reported in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC where a systemic cancer response was induced in areas away from the irradiated&#xD;
      site when radiation was combined with immunotherapy, multiple clinical trials are currently&#xD;
      investigating the role of combining these two modalities. Significantly, how SABR alone&#xD;
      increases immunogenicity of a tumor is unknown. There is a critical need to elucidate the&#xD;
      mechanism by which SABR alone incites the immune system to better develop future rational&#xD;
      combinations of immunotherapy with SABR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SABR induced cell death will ultimately activate downstream cytotoxic T-cells and cause&#xD;
      T-cell influx into the tumor to enhance immunogenic tumor cell kill. This is accomplished&#xD;
      with SABR-induced tumor antigen-both mutation-associated neoantigen and tumor-associated&#xD;
      antigen- release, priming of downstream cytotoxic T-cells, leading to specific T-cell clonal&#xD;
      expansion, and resultant influx of these activated cytotoxic T-cells into the tumor and blood&#xD;
      to enhance immune-mediated tumor cell kill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein the investigator proposes a pilot study to compare pre- and post-SABR core biopsies of&#xD;
      stage I NSCLC tumors to identify SABR-induced immune-mediated tumor recognition based on a&#xD;
      significant and specific expansion of T-cell clones using a novel T-cell receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      sequencing assay. This will be coupled with (1) novel genomic analysis of candidate tumor&#xD;
      antigens that may be released from the pre-SABR tumor and (2) functional validation assays to&#xD;
      screen post-treatment peripheral blood T-cells for reactivity to these released candidate&#xD;
      tumor antigens. In addition, cell-based analysis will be used to identify changes in key&#xD;
      T-cell infiltrates into the post-SABR tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study may have the potential to translate into improved systemic&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with NSCLC through future integrated trials of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade antibodies that specifically relieve the immunosuppression on the T-cell population&#xD;
      found to be activated by SABR. Clarifying SABR-induced immune changes in the tumor and blood&#xD;
      will identify pathways that may be exploited to enhance systemic immunity to kill&#xD;
      micro-metastatic disease and mitigate relapse in the next generation of clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional corollary imaging studies using dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT), a novel&#xD;
      imaging modality that improves the material decomposition ability of CTs, may identify new&#xD;
      imaging markers for post-SABR treatment response by comparing DE-CT imaging characteristics&#xD;
      with SABR fields and pathologic response.&#xD;
