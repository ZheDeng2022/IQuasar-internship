      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of bariatric embolizations and&#xD;
      confirm published reports of sustained post-procedural weight loss, and pathologically assess&#xD;
      post-procedural metabolic effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 2003, the proportion of Canadians who were obese has increased 17.5%. Obesity is ranked&#xD;
      as the fifth leading risk for mortality globally. Obesity has been strongly linked to&#xD;
      numerous comorbidities, including type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea, heart disease, stroke, asthma, cancer, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of obesity is complex and inadequately understood. Nevertheless, an&#xD;
      energy imbalance is fundamentally at fault. As recently as 1996, ghrelin, the hormonal&#xD;
      stimulus for hunger was identified. Further research has revealed that ghrelin, predominantly&#xD;
      produced in the fundus of the stomach, stimulates appetite and increases serum concentrations&#xD;
      of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, prolactin, and glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congruously, the complexity of obesity is reflected in the efficacy of modern therapy.&#xD;
      Treatment for obesity lies along a spectrum of available modalities beginning with diet&#xD;
      modification, exercise therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. Despite initial positive&#xD;
      results, diet and exercise frequently prove futile for long-term management of weight loss.&#xD;
      Likewise, it is uncommon for diabetic remission to be achieved through pharmaco-therapeutic&#xD;
      agents, most of the medications designed to stabilize and improve diabetic control. This has&#xD;
      led to the advent of interventional treatment for these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery is the current gold-standard in the treatment of morbid obesity with recent&#xD;
      evidence revealing that bariatric surgery is more effective than medical treatment for the&#xD;
      long-term control of obese patients with type 2 diabetes. It is postulated that in addition&#xD;
      to the restrictive effects associated with bariatric surgery, resection or disruption of the&#xD;
      ghrelin producing regions of the stomach may play a significant role in eventual weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary source of blood flow to the fundus of the stomach, where the majority of&#xD;
      ghrelin-producing cells are found, is the left gastric artery. This artery is commonly&#xD;
      accessed percutaneously for the management of refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding.&#xD;
      Embolizations are typically well tolerated, therefore, it has been purported that selective&#xD;
      embolization of this artery could induce adequate ischemia to the fundus resulting in a rapid&#xD;
      decrease in ghrelin-producing cells along with its neurological and metabolic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007, Arepally et al reported a minimally-invasive method of destroying ghrelin-producing&#xD;
      cells in a porcine model. With mixed success, Arepally was able to demonstrate a correlation&#xD;
      between left gastric artery embolizations, weight loss, and fluctuations in ghrelin levels.&#xD;
      Propagation of his efforts was performed by Bawudun et al, utilizing a liquid sclerosant and&#xD;
      500-700-mm polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles as embolic agents, Bawudun was able to&#xD;
      demonstrate significant decreases in ghrelin and body weight measurements in the experimental&#xD;
      arms in a canine model. Subsequently, Paxton, et al. demonstrated lowered ghrelin levels and&#xD;
      reduced weight gain utilizing 40-micron microsphere particle embolizations in a similar&#xD;
      porcine model no duodenal upregulation for ghrelin was found. These studies also revealed&#xD;
      potential complications including non-target embolization, frank gastric ulcerations, and&#xD;
      gastritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these preclinical animal studies, Gunn and Oklu performed a small retrospective&#xD;
      study of patients who underwent a left gastric artery embolization for upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeds. The results, although limited, revealed significant weight loss amongst the&#xD;
      experimental group as compared with the control (patients who underwent embolization for&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal bleeds without left gastric artery selection). Kipshidze et al&#xD;
      reported significant weight loss amongst all five patients who underwent the first-in-human&#xD;
      prospective left gastric artery embolization trial utilizing 300-500 µm microspheres. Human&#xD;
      trials have resulted in few reported complications, namely minor pyrosis and indigestion. The&#xD;
      safety profile of the procedure is well reported given that elective left gastric artery&#xD;
      embolizations are offered to stable patients with refractory non-variceal bleeds. Case&#xD;
      reports have reported on the uncommon instances of hepatic infarction, gastric infarction,&#xD;
      gastric volvulus, and arterial rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The momentum behind this procedure has led to the design and implementation of two phase I&#xD;
      clinical trials [Gastric Artery Embolization Trial for the Lessening of Appetite&#xD;
      Nonsurgically (GET LEAN) and Bariatric Embolization of Arteries for the Treatment of Obesity&#xD;
      (BEAT Obesity)] which sought to demonstrate the safety profile of left gastric artery&#xD;
      embolizations and demonstrate post-procedural weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results have been promising with weight loss and safety demonstrated in both trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor complications included post-procedural nausea, vomiting, and mild epigastric discomfort&#xD;
      which was treated with oral proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) following administration of one&#xD;
      course of intravenous (IV) PPIs. 3 asymptomatic gastric ulcers were identified on&#xD;
      post-procedural endoscopy however these resolved within 1 month (a 1-month endoscopy was&#xD;
      performed).&#xD;
