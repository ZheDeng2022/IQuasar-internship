    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an investigational DNA vaccine,&#xD;
      pTVG-HP, a plasmid DNA encoding human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab, and the efficacy of this combination in decreasing serum Prostate-Specific Antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) in patients with non-metastatic, non-castrate prostate cancer (clinical stage D0/M0).&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of subjects within acceptable toxicity boundaries</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be evaluated at each visit by a review of systems based on the most recent version of the NCI common toxicity criteria. Safety and Tolerability of this intervention is defined as following: a toxicity rate p0 of at most 15% of Grade ≥ 3 toxicity events (CTCAE v.4.0) will be considered as acceptable while a toxicity rate p1=35% or more will be considered as unacceptably high. Percentage of subjects within acceptable toxicity boundaries will be reported (95% confidence intervals constructed using the Wilson score method).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Complete Response (CR) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A PSA CR will be defined as the percentage of participants with a serum PSA &lt;0.2 ng/mL and confirmatory PSA &lt;0.2 ng/mL at least 4 weeks later, as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) recommendations. To qualify as a PSA CR, there must be no evidence of radiographic progression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metastasis-free Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 2-year metastasis-free survival will be determined by investigator review of radiographic studies (CT/MRI and bone scintigraphy) performed 2 years after study initiation in subjects who have not already met criteria for radiographic progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Radiographic Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will undergo radiographic imaging prior to treatment and at 6-month intervals (or as clinically required). The appearance of lesions consistent with metastatic disease will be used to define radiographic progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSA Doubling Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment doubling time will be calculated from: 1) All PSA values obtained from the same clinical laboratory using the same PSA assay beginning with the PSA value at day 1 (week 0) and continuing until the end-of study (or month 24) value (PSADT 0-24). 2) All PSA values obtained from the same clinical laboratory using the same PSA assay beginning with the PSA value at day 85 (month 3) to the day 253 (month 9) value (PSADT 3-9).</description>

&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide blood samples for immune studies, per study calendar, up to one&#xD;
             year after study, even if off study treatment.&#xD;

             following circumstances: Neoadjuvant/adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy&#xD;
             administered with radiation therapy or at the time of prostatectomy is acceptable,&#xD;
             provided that there was no evidence of PSA progression while on treatment. In this&#xD;
             situation, patients must not have received more than 24 months of androgen deprivation&#xD;
             treatment. Other treatment with androgen deprivation therapy is prohibited.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have evidence of bone metastases or lymph node involvement as&#xD;
             determined by bone scan or CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis within 4 weeks of study&#xD;
             registration. Note: Advanced imaging modalities (such as NaF-PET/CT, choline PET/CT,&#xD;
             fluciclovine, or PSMA PET scans) will NOT be used to determine evidence of metastases&#xD;
             for eligibility purposes or for defining disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have been treated with a prior DNA vaccine therapy for prostate&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have known psychological or sociological conditions, addictive&#xD;
             disorders or family problems, which would preclude compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
