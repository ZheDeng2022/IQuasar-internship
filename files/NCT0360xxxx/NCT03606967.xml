    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and tremelimumab with or&#xD;
      without personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine (neoantigen vaccine) works in treating&#xD;
      patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab&#xD;
      and tremelimumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body&#xD;
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, durvalumab, and tremelimumab with or without neoantigen vaccine will work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the clinical response to nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab +&#xD;
      neoantigen vaccine (Arm 1) versus (vs.) nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab&#xD;
      (Arm 2) in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab + neoantigen&#xD;
      vaccine vs. nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the immune response induced by nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) +&#xD;
      tremelimumab + neoantigen vaccine vs. nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Biomarkers of response to therapy will be assessed based on the research biopsies&#xD;
      performed at baseline, following the chemotherapy run-in (Part A) and following&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab +/- neoantigen vaccine (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and&#xD;
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 4, patients&#xD;
      with progression of disease within the first 18 weeks may switch and receive nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 for 2 cycles at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine and poly-ICLC&#xD;
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 50, and 78 in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of&#xD;
      cycles 1-4, durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4, durvalumab&#xD;
      IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;

             2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver metastases are present, in&#xD;
             which case it must be =&lt; 5 x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measured creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula or by&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for&#xD;
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have&#xD;
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following&#xD;
             age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &lt; 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women &gt;= 50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt; 1 year ago, had&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt; 1 year ago, or underwent&#xD;

                  hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and neoantigen vaccine on the developing human&#xD;
             fetus are unknown. For this reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation, and through 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow&#xD;
             up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are eligible provided they have a&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not considered to be candidates for carboplatin + gemcitabine for&#xD;

             marrow), or biologic therapy within 30 days (42 days for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)&#xD;
             prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior immunotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any previous treatment with a PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, including durvalumab (MEDI4736)&#xD;
             or tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from grade &gt;= 2 adverse events due to prior&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory&#xD;
             values defined in the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with grade &gt;= 2 neuropathy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
                  after consultation with the study physician.&#xD;

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have received an&#xD;
             investigational agent within the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 6 months prior to study entry or within&#xD;
             30 days of receiving durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving&#xD;
                  study treatment and up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to the first dose of durvalumab&#xD;
             (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent&#xD;
             is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this&#xD;
             criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids or local steroid injections (e.g.&#xD;
                  intra-articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses which are not to exceed 10 mg/day&#xD;
                  of prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS&#xD;
             metastases. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
             adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leptomeningeal disease or history of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab. Known allergy, or history of&#xD;
             serious adverse reaction to vaccines, such as anaphylaxis, hives or respiratory&#xD;
             difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;= 470 ms&#xD;
             calculated from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) (within 15 minutes at 5 minutes apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, evidence of any acute or chronic&#xD;
             viral illness or disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because durvalumab (MEDI4736) and&#xD;
             tremelimumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and&#xD;
             tremelimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
             A negative serum pregnancy test is required no more than 7 days before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active primary immunodeficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with&#xD;
             local practice), hepatitis B (known positive hepatitis B virus [HBV] surface antigen&#xD;
             [HBsAg] result), or hepatitis C. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection&#xD;
             (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg)&#xD;
             are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient with a previous history of non-breast malignancy is eligible for this&#xD;
             study only if the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer&#xD;
             survivor is eligible provided the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients have been considered disease free for at least 1 year (with the&#xD;
                  exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
                  carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a strong likelihood of non-adherence (such as difficulties in adhering&#xD;
             to follow-up schedule due to geographic distance from the treatment facility) should&#xD;
             not be knowingly registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allogeneic organ transplantation.&#xD;
