  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will pilot test a brief, scalable intervention called Maisha (Swahili for life),&#xD;
      to address HIV stigma for women presenting to antenatal care in Tanzania and male partners&#xD;
      who accompany them. The intervention will include: 1) a video and brief counseling that&#xD;
      addresses HIV stigma at the start of the ANC visit (prior to HIV testing), and 2) two&#xD;
      stigma-based counseling sessions for individuals who are HIV infected, building on the video&#xD;
      content to provide emotional support, promote acceptance, address stigma, and reinforce care&#xD;
      engagement. The primary intervention outcome is engagement in PMTCT care among women who are&#xD;
      HIV infected. The investigators will also examine HIV stigma outcomes (enacted, anticipated,&#xD;
      internalized) among all groups of participants, including individuals who are already&#xD;
      established on ART and indiviudals who are HIV uninfected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-related stigma has been identified as a significant reason for loss to follow up in&#xD;
      prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs. Antenatal care (ANC)&#xD;
      provides a unique and important entry point to address HIV stigma. Stigma-based counseling&#xD;
      during the first ANC visit can promote readiness to initiate or sustain treatment among those&#xD;
      who are HIV infected, and can address stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors among those who&#xD;
      are uninfected. We are proposing to pilot test a brief, scalable intervention called Maisha&#xD;
      (Swahili for life), to address HIV stigma for women and their partners presenting to ANC in&#xD;
      Tanzania. The intervention will include: 1) a video and brief counseling for women and their&#xD;
      partners (if present) that addresses HIV stigma at the start of the ANC visit (prior to HIV&#xD;
      testing), and 2) two stigma-based counseling sessions for women who are HIV infected,&#xD;
      building on the video content to provide emotional support, promote acceptance, address&#xD;
      stigma, and reinforce care engagement, with the opportunity for male partners to attend the&#xD;
      first follow-up counseling session after testing. The primary intervention outcome is&#xD;
      engagement in PMTCT care among women who are HIV infected. As a secondary outcome we will&#xD;
      also look at linkage to HIV care among men who are HIV infected. We will also examine HIV&#xD;
      stigma outcomes (enacted, anticipated, internalized) among all groups of people, including&#xD;
      those who are already established on ART and those who are HIV uninfected. The intervention&#xD;
      content is based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (addressing automatic negative&#xD;
      thoughts about the self, future and the world) to address and mitigate multiple forms of HIV&#xD;
      stigma (internalized, anticipated and enacted). We will conduct a pilot RCT of the&#xD;
      intervention, enrolling all women who attend a first ANC appointment at two clinics in the&#xD;
      Moshi district. If women come to the ANC visit with a male partner, the partner will be&#xD;
      invited to enroll as well. Maisha will be compared to the standard of care HIV counseling. In&#xD;
      addition to a baseline assessment, all participants who are identified as HIV-infected and&#xD;
      their partners will get a follow-up assessment three months after enrollment. A subset of&#xD;
      participants who are identified as HIV-uninfected but who report high levels of HIV&#xD;
      stigmatizing attitudes at baseline will also receive a follow-up assessment three months&#xD;
      after enrollment. Measures will include health outcomes (care engagement, adherence,&#xD;
      depression), stigma outcomes, and HIV disclosure. Quality assurance data will be collected&#xD;
      and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and RCT will be described.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will examine differences between conditions in health outcomes and&#xD;
      stigma measures, stratified by HIV status. We hypothesize that 1) among HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals, individuals receiving the Maisha intervention will report better engagement in&#xD;
      PMTCT care/linkage to HIV care and lower levels of internalized HIV stigma, as compared to&#xD;
      individuals receiving the standard of care, and 2) among HIV uninfected individuals,&#xD;
      individuals receiving the pre-test video and counseling will report lower levels of&#xD;
      stigmatizing attitudes when compared with the control group.&#xD;

            <description>Participants randomized to the intervention condition will receive the SoC counseling plus Maisha, a brief, scalable, theory-based counseling intervention that addresses HIV stigma at entry into antenatal care. Maisha involves a video delivered to all women prior to HIV testing, and, if a woman tests positive for HIV, two counseling sessions. If a male partner is present with the women, he may also be enrolled and participate in the first two counseling sessions together with the woman.&#xD;
Mashia: Maisha is a brief, scalable, theory-based counseling intervention that addresses HIV stigma at entry into antenatal care. The intervention will be developed in a formative phase and includes 1) a video and counseling session prior to HIV testing that addresses HIV stigma, and 2) two post-test HIV counseling sessions for HIV-infected individuals, building on the video content to provide emotional support, address stigma, and reinforce the value of care engagement.</description>

          <title>SoC + Stigma Counseling (Maisha)</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to the intervention condition (n=758) received the SoC counseling plus Maisha, a brief, scalable, theory-based counseling intervention that addresses HIV stigma at entry into antenatal care. Maisha involves a video delivered to all women prior to HIV testing, and, if a woman tested positive for HIV, two counseling sessions. If a male partner was present with the women, he was also enrolled and participated in the first two counseling sessions together with the woman.&#xD;
Mashia: Maisha is a brief, scalable, theory-based counseling intervention that addresses HIV stigma at entry into antenatal care. The intervention was developed in a formative phase and includes 1) a video and counseling session prior to HIV testing that addresses HIV stigma, and 2) two post-test HIV counseling sessions for HIV-infected individuals, building on the video content to provide emotional support, address stigma, and reinforce the value of care engagement.</description>
