  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Weight regain is one of the most common problems in bariatric patients. Although&#xD;
      exercise contributes to maintaining weight, there are currently few studies performed on this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To know the effects of a high-intensity exercise program applied 3 years after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery on body composition and cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 37-month follow-up was performed on 21 patients who underwent bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      in which periodic body composition was evaluated. At month 37, participants were divided into&#xD;
      an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). The EG performed a 5-months of a&#xD;
      supervised exercise program. At this point physical fitness, glycemia and cholesterolemia&#xD;
      were also evaluated in the EG. Finally, the EG repeated the evaluations 2-months after the&#xD;
      end of the program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 patients from the Vinalopó-Salud Hospital of Elche (Spain) who underwent&#xD;
      bariatric surgery between 2010-2013, were recruited. Male and female participants were&#xD;
      eligible if they complied with the following inclusion criteria: a) absence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease; b) they had not suffered any type of cancer in the 5-year period before surgery; c)&#xD;
      absence of functional limitations that prevented them from performing the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, an initial interview was conducted with the patients to verify&#xD;
      that they complied with the inclusion criteria. In this interview, all aspects of the program&#xD;
      were carefully explained. At the start of the study, all patients who had agreed to&#xD;
      participate signed an informed consent. This study was conformed to the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committees of the University. Two patients declined to&#xD;
      participate in the study after the initial interview. Finally, 38 patients started the study&#xD;
      and 18 finished it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after surgery, participant's body composition, anthropometric measures and resting&#xD;
      blood pressure were assessed. These assessments were performed periodically every six months&#xD;
      until month 19 after surgery. At an average of 37.10 ± 4.35 months of follow-up after&#xD;
      surgery, they were distributed into two groups, an experimental group (EG; n=10), and a&#xD;
      control group (CG; n=8). The EG group performed a monitored exercise program, while only the&#xD;
      evaluations were performed in the CG. At this point, measurements of cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness and biochemical parameters were added to the previous assessments (anthropometric&#xD;
      measures and blood pressure) for the EG. An assessment was performed coinciding with the&#xD;
      start of the exercise program (which lasted 20 weeks), and a final assessment was also&#xD;
      performed at the end of the program. Finally, the EG was evaluated 2 months after the end of&#xD;
      the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition, waist and hip circumference, blood pressure and biochemical parameters were&#xD;
      evaluated between 8:00 ante meridien (AM) and 9:00 AM. Cardiorespiratory fitness was&#xD;
      evaluated between 4:00 post meridien (PM) and 8:00 PM. Measurements were performed in a&#xD;
      climatically controlled laboratory, located at 80 m above sea level, in which the relative&#xD;
      air humidity was maintained between 45-60% and the temperature between 22-24º.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition, anthropometric measures and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) After at&#xD;
      least 10 hours of fasting, body composition, biochemical parameters and blood pressure were&#xD;
      measured. Alcohol consumption was restricted for at least 8 hours before the test, while PA&#xD;
      was forbidden in the 48 hours prior to the test. Participants performed the assessment with&#xD;
      an empty bladder. Bioimpedance analysis (Tanita, TBF 300A, Tokyo, Japan) was used to&#xD;
      establish body weight and body composition. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to&#xD;
      the formula: total weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters (kg·m-2). The&#xD;
      International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) protocol was used to&#xD;
      assess height and waist and hip circumference. Blood pressure was measured using a digital&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer (Microlife WatchBP Home, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), according to established&#xD;
      recommendations. Capillary blood samples were taken to analyse blood glucose and Total&#xD;
      Cholesterol (TC) using a portable multi-analyser (Accutrend GCT, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,&#xD;
      Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory fitness The peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was determined on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer (Technogym Bike Med, Technogym, Gambettola, Italy), using an Oxycon Pro gas&#xD;
      analysis system (Jaeger, Friedberg, Germany) by adapted protocol from Achten. The protocol&#xD;
      had two phases: a) a first phase in which the participants performed a 4-minute warm-up at 40&#xD;
      watts (W), followed by increases of 20 W every 3 minutes, maintaining a cadence of 60&#xD;
      rotations per minute (RPM) during the whole phase; and, b) a second phase that started when&#xD;
      the respiratory exchange ratio reached 1.0, and which was aimed to determine the VO2peak.&#xD;
      This phase consisted of increments of 20 W every minute, maintaining a cadence between 70-80&#xD;
      RPM, until volitional fatigue. The VO2peak was calculated as the average of the highest 30&#xD;
      seconds of VO2. The VO2peak was expressed in absolute values (VO2peak ABS) and normalized to&#xD;
      total body weight (VO2peak/BW) and fat-free mass (VO2peak/FFM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk (CVR) The SCORE risk charts of the European Society of Cardiology were&#xD;
      used to calculate CVR. The formula to calculate CVR estimates the 10-year coronary risk using&#xD;
      TC, systolic blood pressure, gender, age, and smoking status. In addition, CVR was also&#xD;
      calculated using waist to hip ratio, and waist to height ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life The health-related quality of life was measured by the Short&#xD;
      Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), in its version adapted to the Spanish context. This&#xD;
      questionnaire measures physical and mental health through 8 scales, the scores of which are&#xD;
      transformed to values between 0-100 points, with the highest scores meaning a better&#xD;
      function. These 8 scales are grouped into two summary components, the physical summary&#xD;
      component, and the mental summary component, which were calculated according to the reference&#xD;
      values of the Spanish population, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise program lasted 20 weeks, which were distributed in five 4-week blocks. The first&#xD;
      -block included two weekly sessions, in which the endurance training (ET) and the resistance&#xD;
      training (RT) for 5 muscle groups (hamstrings, pectorals, quadriceps, latissimus dorsi, and&#xD;
      gastrocnemius) was combined in the same session. In the second block participants trained 3&#xD;
      days a week, in two of them a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) was performed, followed&#xD;
      by RT (biceps and triceps were added to the previous 5 major muscle groups trained), while in&#xD;
      the third session only the ET was performed. Between the third and fifth block participants&#xD;
      trained 4 days a week. In two sessions, a HIIT was performed, followed by RT, focusing on&#xD;
      different muscle groups in each session: a) session 1: pectorals, quadriceps, biceps, and&#xD;
      hamstrings; b) session 2: dorsal, triceps, gastrocnemius and deltoids. In the other two&#xD;
      sessions, ET was performed. In all the blocks, 2 days a week of flexibility training were&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ET (performed on a cycle-ergometer, elliptical and treadmill) was monitored using a heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) monitor (FT40, Polar, Finland). The RT was performed using resistance machines, and&#xD;
      training intensity was determined by percentages of 1 maximum repetition which was estimated&#xD;
      using the Brzycki formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIIT consisted of a five-minute warm up, increasing the intensity from 40% of VO2peak to&#xD;
      60% VO2peak. After this, 20 minutes with bouts of 30 seconds at high intensity (60-95%&#xD;
      VO2peak) and 30 seconds of active recovery (40% VO2peak), for a total of 10 minutes of&#xD;
      training at high intensity were performed. Finally, 3 minutes of cool-down at 40% VO2peak&#xD;
      were performed.&#xD;
