  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to international guidelines, upfront therapy for transplant eligible myeloma&#xD;
      patients should include triplet induction containing proteasome inhibitor and&#xD;
      immunomodulatory agent, autologous stem cell transplant, PI+Imid based triplet consolidation&#xD;
      and lenalidomide maintenance. Despite this approach, virtually all MM patients experience&#xD;
      disease relapse, especially those with High Risk disease defined by adverse cytogenetic&#xD;
      abnormalities (i.e. del(17p), or t(14;16) or t(4;14)) detected by FISH and/or SNP arrays.&#xD;
      Indeed, HR myeloma is associated with poorer progression free survival and overall survival&#xD;
      and frontline therapy should therefore be improved for this subset of HR patients. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this prospective multicenter, open label, interventional phase 2 trial&#xD;
      is to evaluate the feasibility of an intensive program including quadruplet induction and&#xD;
      consolidation, tandem autologous stem cell transplantation and maintenance in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      multiple myeloma patients presenting with HR cytogenetic. Quadruplet induction and&#xD;
      consolidation include carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone and daratumumab. Maintenance&#xD;
      will include lenalidomide and daratumumab. Secondary objectives will include efficacy&#xD;
      parameters (i.e. response rate, minimal residual disease, safety, progression free survival,&#xD;
      overall survival).&#xD;
