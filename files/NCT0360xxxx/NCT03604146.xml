  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1 year longitudinal study to establish a related index system for chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) quality control.Clinical and economic data of COPD&#xD;
      patients will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixteen hospitals in Guangdong Province were randomly divided into control group and&#xD;
      intervention group.Doctors and nurses of intervention group were trained treat chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease according to the GOLD(Global InitiaTive of Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Lung Disease) guidelinesï¼Œwhile those in the control group will not receive any training from&#xD;
      research team. Hospital patient cohort and outpatient cohort will be setted. Subjects were&#xD;
      interviewed and received pulmonary function tests.All patients will be followed and events of&#xD;
      acute exacerbation will be recorded.Factors that influence patient prognosis and&#xD;
      economic-health benefits will be analyzed.&#xD;
