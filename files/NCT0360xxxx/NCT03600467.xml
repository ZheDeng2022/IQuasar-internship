  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's purpose is to facilitate and expedite the clinical testing of SEVI-D in a&#xD;
      population with advanced GBM that are androgen receptor (AR) positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who is it for? You may be eligible for this study if you have a GBM with&#xD;
      clinical/radiological progression on or following last anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be screened to confirm if their GBM is AR positive by the study team.&#xD;
      If eligible, participants will receive the medications of Serivteronel and Dexamethasone&#xD;
      (also known as SEVI-D) by oral tablets continuously per cycle (4 weeks). Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to have blood tests, scans, complete questionnaire and regularly meet with the study&#xD;
      doctor and team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped this research will demonstrate this treatment could be beneficial for the&#xD;
      treatment of GBM that are known to be human androgen receptor positive.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid hormone receptor that is expressed in multiple&#xD;
      reproductive tissues and has important effects on multiple organ systems. The AR is a major&#xD;
      target for the treatment of prostate cancer, and, more recently, for treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer. However, the AR is also expressed on many other tissues and plays vital roles in&#xD;
      other cancer types, such as head and neck cancers (eg, salivary gland and thyroid cancers),&#xD;
      cutaneous malignancies (eg, melanoma and basal cell carcinoma), sarcomas, and genitourinary&#xD;
      cancers (eg, renal and bladder cancers). There are very few studies investigating AR-targeted&#xD;
      therapies for indications other than prostate or breast cancer; however the few anecdotal&#xD;
      reports and small studies that have been performed suggest that AR-positive tumours may&#xD;
      respond to therapy with AR-targeted agents. In this study we are concentrating on GBM&#xD;
      Seviteronel is a dual selective P450C17,20-lyase (CYP17 lyase) and AR inhibitor currently&#xD;
      being investigated in Phase 1/2 trials for prostate and breast cancers. Seviteronel has shown&#xD;
      promising preclinical activity in some breast cancer models, and seviteronel in combination&#xD;
      with dexamethasone (SEVI-D) has shown promising preliminary activity for treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, SEVI-D could be beneficial for&#xD;
      the treatment of other cancers that are known to be AR-positive such as GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim is to facilitate and expedite the clinical testing of rational therapeutic&#xD;
      hypotheses in a population with advanced cancer and unmet need, with a particular, but not&#xD;
      exclusive, focus on rare or neglected cancers. The program will evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      activity of SEVI-D in subjects with AR-positive GBM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the clinical activity of novel targeted treatments and/or indications as measured by&#xD;
      objective tumour response or the ratio of time-to-progression on study over the preceding&#xD;
      period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall survival (OS) (death from any cause);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety and tolerability of treatment (rates of adverse events)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Health related quality of life during treatment (EORTC QLQ-C30v.3 questionnaire or brief&#xD;
           pain inventory, if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the feasibility, efficiency and utility of an overarching framework protocol&#xD;
           for multiple, parallel signal-seeking clinical substudies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate a mechanism for screening patients for actionable biomarkers to be used to&#xD;
           guide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AR-positive GBM as confirmed by immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seviteronel, will be administered orally at 450 mg (3 x 150 mg tablets) for men with 0.5 mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone (tablet) once daily plus a GnRH analogue (depot injection). Seviteronel, will&#xD;
      be administered orally at 450 mg (3 x 150 mg tablets) for post menopausal women, once daily&#xD;
      in combination with once daily 0.5 mg dexamethasone (tablet). For premenopausal women (with&#xD;
      intact ovaries), a GnRH analogue (depot injection) will also need to be admistered. See&#xD;
      Treatment Study Table below. Patients will take seviteronel and dexamethasone each day&#xD;
      continuously in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for participation in the screening platform includes the review of patient history,&#xD;
      current health status, availability of a biospecimen for AR screening and patient willingness&#xD;
      to be in a trial if eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and safety assessments are scheduled prior to registration and then every 8 weeks&#xD;
      until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging and other response assessments are required at baseline and 8-weekly from cycle 1 day&#xD;
      1 until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection for translational studies will occur at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline (collected within 21 days prior to registration) or within 28 days of C1D1&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Every 2nd cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At End of treatment&#xD;
