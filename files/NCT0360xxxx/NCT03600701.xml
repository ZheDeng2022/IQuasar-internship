  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab and cobimetinib work in treating patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), has&#xD;
      come back (recurrent), or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      atezolizumab and cobimetinib may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate durable overall response rate with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or&#xD;
      PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or&#xD;
      refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy when treated with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the consequences of treatment with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib on the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment in patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or refractory to prior PD-1 or&#xD;
      PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate genomic characteristics including tumor mutation burden to response to&#xD;
      therapy with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in patients with metastatic NSCLC resistant or&#xD;
      refractory to prior PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1, and&#xD;
      cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency&#xD;
                       topical steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%,&#xD;
                       flucinolone 0.01%, desonide 0.05%, aclometasone dipropionate 0.05%)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12 months&#xD;
                       (not requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA], methotrexate,&#xD;
                       retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors; high potency or&#xD;
                       oral steroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),&#xD;
             organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing&#xD;
             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan; history of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field&#xD;
             (fibrosis) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant active infection requiring treatment within 14 days prior to cycle 1,&#xD;
             day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to cycle 1, day 1 or anticipation of&#xD;
             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before cycle 1, day 1 or&#xD;
             anticipation that such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study&#xD;
             and up to 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately&#xD;
                  October to March); patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled pleural or pericardial effusion or ascites requiring recurrent drainage&#xD;

             infection, active tuberculosis (TB), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because both atezolizumab and cobimetinib&#xD;
             are expected to cause fetal harm if used during pregnancy; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with cobimetinib or atezolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with either therapy; these potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to swallow pills&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral&#xD;
