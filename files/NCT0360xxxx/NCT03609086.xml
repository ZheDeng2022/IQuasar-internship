  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melatonin is well known for its role in the sleep-wake cycle and is synthesised in response&#xD;
      to low light levels from the pineal gland. In our previous study it was found that serum&#xD;
      melatonin levels increased dramatically during pregnancy, such that levels were up to 100&#xD;
      fold higher in the third trimester compared to healthy non-pregnant women. The placenta&#xD;
      contains the enzymes which are involved in synthesising melatonin but it is unclear if this&#xD;
      is the source of the high levels in pregnancy. Severe pre-eclampsia has been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with low levels of melatonin. In this study its is proposed to measure serum&#xD;
      melatonin immediately before and after delivery and in cord blood and relate the levels to&#xD;
      those in the placenta itself. This will contribute to the potential role for melatonin as a&#xD;
      biomarker for obstetric disease and potentially as a therapeutic agent in future. This&#xD;
      observational pilot study aims to measure serum and placental melatonin levels (as the major&#xD;
      metabolite 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate) in pregnant women undergoing elective Caesarean&#xD;
      section.&#xD;

      Background Melatonin, a substance produced by the pineal gland, is well known for its role in&#xD;
      the sleep-wake cycle but it is less well known as an effective antioxidant. It is able to&#xD;
      access all parts of the cell, and can cross the blood-brain and placental barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin has been reported to be synthesised in the placenta and may have both receptor&#xD;
      mediated and non-receptor mediated protective functions during pregnancy. Severe&#xD;
      pre-eclampsia has been reported to be associated with low levels of melatonin in the placenta&#xD;
      although it is not known if the placental melatonin contributes to circulating levels.1,2&#xD;
      Despite this, melatonin levels have been proposed as a biomarker of pre-eclampsia. More&#xD;
      information on the role of melatonin and metabolism of melatonin in pregnancy would inform&#xD;
      planning of larger research studies to investigate the potential role for melatonin as a&#xD;
      bio-marker for obstetric disease and potentially as a therapeutic agent in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is synthesized endogenously from serotonin via two steps; the first, rate limiting&#xD;
      step is arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase mediated acetylation of serotonin to N-acetyl&#xD;
      serotonin. The second step is methylation of N-acetyl serotonin via the enzyme hydroxyindole&#xD;
      O-methyltransferase (also called N-acetylserotonin O-methyl-transferase).3,4 Interrogation of&#xD;
      our database of next generation sequencing analysis of 80 human foetal livers revealed that&#xD;
      the genes encoding these enzymes were not present although those encoding related&#xD;
      acetyltransferases were. We can conclude that the human foetal liver is not a site of&#xD;
      melatonin synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous work found melatonin levels do however increase markedly during pregnancy and&#xD;
      are up to 50-100 times higher than non-pregnant women in the third trimester (Figure). The&#xD;
      physiological role of these elevated melatonin levels remains a supposition and the&#xD;
      relationship of melatonin levels in the placenta with the maternal and foetal circulations at&#xD;
      different stages of pregnancy are unclear. Melatonin synthesizing enzymes have been found in&#xD;
      human placental tissue, however it is not clear whether placental production of melatonin is&#xD;
      directly related to the elevated circulating maternal melatonin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The production of melatonin is catalysed by specific enzymes and although these enzymes have&#xD;
      been found in placental tissue, it is not known if the high melatonin levels in pregnancy&#xD;
      come from the placenta and what the role of this melatonin is. It is proposed to measure&#xD;
      melatonin in placentas and maternal/cord blood from women undergoing planned Caesarean&#xD;
      section. The results should enable defining as to whether the placenta is a major source of&#xD;
      melatonin and how the pattern of production changes in pregnancy. The blood samples taken&#xD;
      from women having a Caesarean section and the umbilical cord will provide information about&#xD;
      the role of melatonin at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If melatonin levels in the maternal circulation falls after delivery and placental tissue&#xD;
      melatonin levels are well above limits of detection, then a firm conclusion that the placenta&#xD;
      is the source of elevated maternal melatonin would be justified. This observational pilot&#xD;
      study aims to measure 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate levels in blood from women undergoing&#xD;
      Caesarean section and umbilical cords, and from placental tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational pilot study to investigate 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate levels in&#xD;
      blood from pregnant women immediately before and after delivery, from umbilical cord blood at&#xD;
      the time of delivery and in samples of placental tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy pregnant women will be recruited at the pre-Caesarean section pre-assessment clinic.&#xD;
