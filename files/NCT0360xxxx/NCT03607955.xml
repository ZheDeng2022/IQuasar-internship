  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is a pathway that plays a crucial role in metastasis and&#xD;
      chemoresistance. Overexpression of AXL has been associated with metastasis, recurrence, and&#xD;
      chemoresistance in various cancer including ovarian cancer[16, 17]}. Targeting AXL is an&#xD;
      attractive approach because it is overexpressed among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer&#xD;
      and strongly associated with advanced stages, high grade cancer and shorter median survival&#xD;
      time. AVB-S6-500 is a potent AXL inhibitor by binding to the ligand Gas6. Pre-clinical&#xD;
      studies found that AVB-S6-500 was efficacious in ovarian cancer xenograft tumor models.&#xD;
      Interventions which would increase the proportion of patients achieving pCR in this patient&#xD;
      population could impact survival favorably and are of interest for study.&#xD;
