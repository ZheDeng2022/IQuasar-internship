  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breath and sweat samples will be collected at intervals throughout the visit, with increased&#xD;
      frequency during hypoglycemia. Collaborators with the MITRE Corporation will perform analyses&#xD;
      on these samples to identify any relationships between volatile organic compounds in breath&#xD;
      and sweat and hypoglycemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will measure volatile organic compounds in breath and sweat of participants&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes with normoglycemia and induced hypoglycemia to determine if there is a&#xD;
      relationship between VOC signature and hypoglycemia. The investigators will administer an&#xD;
      insulin injection to provoke mild hypoglycemia and thereby increase the number of breath and&#xD;
      sweat samples collected under hypoglycemic conditions.&#xD;

    <description>Exploration via chemical analysis of clinical samples taken from diabetics' breath and sweat, using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), to determine the volatile organic compounds whose varying concentrations might correlate with diabetics' blood sugar concentrations in the normoglycemic and hypoglycemic ranges.</description>

    <description>Subjects will arrive to the study visit having fasted the night before. Subjects will be given an insulin injection based on their meal to carbohydrate ratio for their breakfast meal as well as a correction bolus to correct their current plasma glucose value down to 40 mg/dL. Following the insulin injection, subjects will eat breakfast. Blood, breath, and sweat samples will be collected throughout the study visit with increased frequency of collection during hypoglycemia. After subjects reach the hypoglycemia threshold, they will be allowed to eat and drink and their blood sugar will be monitored for stability prior to discharge.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent by the subject documented prior to any study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had clinical type 1 diabetes for at least one year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to avoid deodorant, scented lotions, and scented laundry detergent on&#xD;
             your clothes on the day of the visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide informed consent (e.g. impaired cognition or judgment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to safely comply with study procedures and reporting requirements (e.g.&#xD;
             impaired memory or unable to speak and read English)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment&#xD;
             of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety&#xD;
             of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the&#xD;
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must use acceptable contraception for the two weeks prior to the study,&#xD;
                  throughout the study and for the two weeks following the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable contraception methods include:&#xD;

             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for&#xD;
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring&#xD;
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypoglycemic seizures (grand mal) or coma in the last year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of poor venous access or inadequate venous access as determined by trial nurse&#xD;
             or physician at time of screening&#xD;
