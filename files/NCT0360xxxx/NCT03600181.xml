  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intubation of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) carries a risk of potentially severe&#xD;
      complications, including cardiac arrest. Hypoxemia is common in ICU patients requiring&#xD;
      intubation, which must be performed rapidly to avoid aspiration, since the patient is usually&#xD;
      not in the fasted state. Studies have assessed interventions designed to improve intubation&#xD;
      success rates, such as routine neuromuscular blockade. Care bundles combined with training on&#xD;
      simulators have improved the safety of intubation. Nevertheless, intubation in the ICU still&#xD;
      carries higher morbidity and mortality rates compared to intubation in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoxygenation is a cornerstone of safety for intubation in the ICU. Several recent trials&#xD;
      have investigated different devices (non-rebreather mask, non-invasive ventilation, high flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula, bag valve mask) with conflicting results. A main reason for those results is&#xD;
      that efficiency of the preoxygenation period cannot be evaluated in the ICU in opposite to&#xD;
      the operating room: gas monitoring are not available in ICU and even if it was the case, high&#xD;
      flow demand from the patient, and agitation will make it inefficient. Additionally,&#xD;
      desaturation is frequent (from 10% up to 50%) during intubation in ICU and lead to morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality; so anticipation of desaturation is a major concern for ICU's physician because&#xD;
      it's impacting care (face mask ventilation, early insertion of subglottic device). The oxygen&#xD;
      reserve index (ORI) is a new parameter for monitoring oxygen reserve non-invasively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators purpose to analyze efficiency of preoxygenation and time&#xD;
      allowed by ORI for medical interventions before hypoxemia during intubation in the ICU in a&#xD;
      pilot observational study in our medical ICU in a university hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      *Severe hypoxaemia is the most common serious adverse event during endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      (ETI) in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), consistently reported around&#xD;
      25%. Preoxygenation is universally recommended as a risk-minimisation measure. While&#xD;
      effective in the operating room, preoxygenation is more complex in critically ill patients,&#xD;
      most notably those with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, as the low functional residual&#xD;
      capacity (FRC) carries a risk of denitrogenation being confined to the healthy lung&#xD;
      parenchyma, so that the FeO2 (Fraction of expired oxygen) no longer reflects the partial&#xD;
      pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2). In these patients, 8 minutes of preoxygenation&#xD;
      using a bag-valve-mask (BVM) device failed to change PaO2 levels noticeably. Increasing the&#xD;
      BVM time was unhelpful, as the increase in PaO2 achieved in some patients was offset by&#xD;
      decreases in others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has theoretical advantages for preoxygenation and has been&#xD;
      shown to provide higher PaO2 values in hypoxic patients compared to a non-rebreathing (NRB)&#xD;
      mask. However, use of NIV has several contraindications including consciousness alterations&#xD;
      and agitation, and drawbacks such as gastric distension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apnoeic oxygenation which has been updated is a method consisting in continued oxygenation&#xD;
      during laryngoscopy to extend the safe apnoea time. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy&#xD;
      ensuring high and stable FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) values by delivering oxygen flows&#xD;
      above 60 L/min is another innovation shown to improve oxygenation in hypoxaemic patients. The&#xD;
      effect of HFNO for preoxygenation, however, is less clear, as one study suggested benefits&#xD;
      vs. NRB mask in patients with moderate hypoxaemia but another found no significant difference&#xD;
      vs. BVM in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratios below 200. No large randomised trial has compared&#xD;
      preoxygenation methods. The latest recommendations of the Difficult Airway Society suggest&#xD;
      than &quot;In hypoxaemic patients, CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV) may be beneficial.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      As preoxygenation is a cornerstone of safety for intubation in the ICU, several recent trials&#xD;
      have investigated different devices (non-rebreather mask, non-invasive ventilation, high flow&#xD;
      nasal cannula, bag valve mask) with conflicting results. A main reason for those results is&#xD;
      that efficiency of the preoxygenation period cannot be evaluated in the ICU in opposite to&#xD;
      the operating room : gas monitoring are not available in ICU and even if it was the case,&#xD;
      high flow demand from the patient, and agitation will make it inefficient. Additionally,&#xD;
      desaturation is frequent (from 10% up to 50%) during intubation in ICU and lead to morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality; so anticipation of desaturation is a major concern for ICU's physician because&#xD;
      it's impacting care (face mask ventilation, early insertion of subglottic device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxygen reserve index (ORI) (Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) is a new parameter that&#xD;
      indicates real-time oxygenation reserve status in mild hyperoxemia range [partial pressure of&#xD;
      oxygen (PaO2) of about 100-200 mmHg). ORI can be measured non-invasively by applying an&#xD;
      exclusive sensor on a finger; the ORI is a nondimensional index that changes according to the&#xD;
      oxygenation reserve status of the patient. It uses a value range of 0.00-1.00.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the investigators purpose to analyze efficiency of preoxygenation and time&#xD;
      allowed by ORI for medical interventions before hypoxemia during intubation in the ICU in a&#xD;
      pilot observational study in our medical ICU in a university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Study population : Patients admitted in ICU and planned to be intubated. Recruitment will be&#xD;
      done in the Medical ICU of Nantes University Hospital. The study plans to include 50 patients&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care and requiring a tracheal intubation procedure, after the provision&#xD;
      of the informational letter and collection of non-opposition from the patient or responsible&#xD;
      party, or through the emergency inclusion process. In the latter two cases, the&#xD;
      non-opposition of the patient will be collected retrospectively after reading the&#xD;
      informational letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Design and conduct of the study : In each case, after intubation decision was made and&#xD;
      patient consent, a non-invasive sensor capable of measuring ORI (Rainbow® Sensor, R2-25,&#xD;
      Revision L, Masimo Corp.) will be applied to the third or fourth finger on the contralateral&#xD;
      side of the inflatable cuff for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring. The sensor will be&#xD;
      shield to be protected from exposure to light. SpO2 and ORI values, displayed on Root with&#xD;
      Radical7 will be recorded each 2 seconds and then will be transferred to a laptop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will end in case of secondary opposition of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient leaving the protocol will continue the usual follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Data management and patient identification : Data collection for each person participating&#xD;
      in the research is realized with paper case report form (CRF). Each person responsible for&#xD;
      the filling of the CRF (investigator, clinical research assistant ...) will have to be&#xD;
      identified in the table of delegations of responsibilities of the center (see investigator's&#xD;
      file).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entering, viewing or modifying data will only be possible via the CRF. The structure of the&#xD;
      database will be approved by the person responsible for the research, and will be implemented&#xD;
      in conformity with the protocol and the relevant regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical data for each patient can only be forwarded to the affiliated organization of the&#xD;
      person responsible for research or any person duly authorized by him in conditions ensuring&#xD;
      their confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator and all co-investigators undertake to keep the identities of the&#xD;
      persons who participate in the study confidential by assigning them a code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This code will be used for all the CRF and all the attached documents (reports of imaging&#xD;
      exams, biology, etc.). It will be the only information which will make it possible to make&#xD;
      the connection with the patient retrospectively. To this end, a correspondence table will be&#xD;
      implemented and kept in the service under the responsibility of the investigator who will be&#xD;
      the only one to have access to this document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sending a person's data for research will hence be possible only provided this code system&#xD;
      has been applied; the presentation of the research results must exclude any direct or&#xD;
      indirect identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No nominative data will be collected during this research. The coding rule is the following:&#xD;
      1st letter of first name + first letter of surname + month and year of birth, Inclusion&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The documents will be archived under the name of the study in the facilities of the&#xD;
      multipurpose ICU of CHU Nantes until the end of the period of practical utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These documents are as follows: Protocols and annexes, possible amendments ; Information&#xD;
      notices ; Individual data (authenticated copies of raw data) ; Follow-up documents ;&#xD;
      Statistical analyses ; Final report of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the period of practical use, all documents to be archived, as defined in the&#xD;
      classification process and document archiving related to CHU Nantes biomedical research, will&#xD;
      be transferred to the archive site (CHU Nantes) and will be placed under the responsibility&#xD;
      of the institution responsible for research for 15 years following the end of the study in&#xD;
      accordance with the institutional practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No displacement or destruction can occur without the consent of the institution responsible&#xD;
      for the research. After 15 years, the institution responsible for the research will be&#xD;
      consulted for destruction. All data, documents and reports may be subject to audit or&#xD;
      inspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Statistics : The protocol falls within the scope of the MR003 (reference methodology 003),&#xD;
      which conforms to Nantes University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be described in frequency and percentage. Quantitative data will be&#xD;
      described using mean, standard deviation, median, and extreme values. All tests will be&#xD;
      bilateral, and the level of significance is 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stata statistical software (Release 13; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical justification of the number of inclusions : Duration before drop of SpO2 was&#xD;
      approximately 60 seconds +/- 30 seconds (data from Lascarrou JAMA (Journal of the American&#xD;
      Medical Association) 2017 and Miguel-Montanes Critical Care Medicine 2015). Assuming that the&#xD;
      ORI drop occurs 30 seconds before SpO2 drop, the investigators would like to estimate the&#xD;
      average delay between these two drops with 95% confidence interval, with a precision to 10&#xD;
      seconds. Assuming a standard deviation equal to 30 seconds, 35 patients will be necessary.&#xD;
      According to Szmuk, only 72% patients will be analyzed so the investigators decide to include&#xD;
      50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be performed with a significance level of 5%. No imputation will&#xD;
      be realized for this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Safety : No adverse event or reaction can be associated with this study insofar as it&#xD;
      consists on a non-interventional study with no impact on care.&#xD;
