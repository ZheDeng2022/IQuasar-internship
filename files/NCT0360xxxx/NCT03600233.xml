  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CVM-1118 (TRX-818) is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapeutic by TaiRx, Inc. CVM-1118 is a potent anti-cancer agent in numerous&#xD;
      human cancer cell lines. The safety of administrating CVM-1118 on human is evaluated from the&#xD;
      phase 1 study. The objectives of the phase 2 study is to further investigate the efficacy of&#xD;
      CVM-1118 for patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of uncommon heterogeneous malignancies originating&#xD;
      from neuroendocrine cells localized throughout the body. Approximately 50% of patients with&#xD;
      NETs would have metastatic cancer, where 65% of patients with metastatic cancer would result&#xD;
      in mortality within 5 years of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatments of NETs do not follow single discipline and the effective agents are&#xD;
      largely still under clinical investigations. Apparent formation of vasculogenic mimicry (VM)&#xD;
      has been reported in at least two types of NETs. Moreover, VM has been found as part of&#xD;
      multiple microvascular alterations in mouse models of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wih the high potential of inhibiting VM formation, CVM-1118 is considered to have therapeutic&#xD;
      potentials in treating NET tumors.&#xD;

             of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically&#xD;
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The&#xD;
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator or a designated associate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or Sponsor,&#xD;
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
