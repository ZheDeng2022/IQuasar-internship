  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of&#xD;
      three dose cohorts (A: 0.033 mg/kg, B: 0.165 mg/kg, and C: 0.33 mg/kg). The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NTM-1633 in healthy adults. This is a&#xD;
      first-in-human study consisting of three cohorts of eight subjects each. Dosing for each&#xD;
      cohort is as follows: Two sentinel subjects will be administered a single 1-hour infusion&#xD;
      (one NTM-1633, one placebo). No more than two subjects per day thereafter (at least 24 hrs&#xD;
      will elapse between the dosing of each two subjects) will be dosed in the same manner until&#xD;
      all subjects are dosed. Dose escalation will not occur until safety data through Day 8 is&#xD;
      reviewed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Objective dose-escalation criteria and safety&#xD;
      evaluations will be utilized. The study duration will be for approximately 8 months. Subjects&#xD;
      in Cohort A will participate for approximately 17 weeks and Subjects in Cohorts B and C will&#xD;
      participate approximately 21 weeks. Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of escalating doses of NTM-1633 administered intravenously in healthy adults.&#xD;

      Objectives: 1) To assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of NTM-1633 following a single&#xD;
      intravenous administration; 2) To assess the immunogenicity of NTM-1633 following a single&#xD;
