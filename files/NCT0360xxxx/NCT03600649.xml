             with Medical Monitor if there are any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. The effects of&#xD;
             seclidemstat on the developing human fetus have the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;

             completion of seclidemstat administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with seclidemstat. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
