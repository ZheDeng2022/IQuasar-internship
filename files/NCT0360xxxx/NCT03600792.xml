  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is one of the most frequent cerebral malformations and&#xD;
      is now diagnosed prenatally in most cases. Prenatal counseling is then challenging because of&#xD;
      uncertain neurodevelopmental outcome, depending on the genetic cause of ACC. Our purpose is&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility of sequencing known genes responsible for ACC by whole exome&#xD;
      sequencing (WES) in trio (fetus and both parents) when ACC is diagnosed during the pregnancy,&#xD;
      in order to provide complete and loyal information on the intellectual prognosis for the&#xD;
      fetus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is one of the most frequent cerebral malformations. The&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome of patients with ACC is extremely variable, ranging from normal&#xD;
      intelligence to severe intellectual disability (ID). When ACC is discovered during the&#xD;
      prenatal period, prenatal counseling is challenging because of this uncertain&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome. Currently, only chromosomal analyses are performed in cases of&#xD;
      prenatal diagnoses, which are expected to bring the diagnosis in only few cases. No molecular&#xD;
      studies of genes implied in ACC with or without ID are performed. Then, the couples are in&#xD;
      the difficult situation of continuing or interrupting the pregnancy without complete&#xD;
      information about the aetiology of ACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a consultation with an obstetrician and consultations with a&#xD;
      paediatric neurologist and a geneticist. The geneticist will explain WES and its issues. Both&#xD;
      parents will have to provide informed consent for the study.&#xD;

    <description>WES analysis will be performed in the &quot;UF de Génomique du Développement&quot; (APHP, Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital), using DNA extracted from amniotic fluid for the foetus (also used for chromosomal studies) and DNA extracted from peripheral blood for both parents. There will be no supplemental invasive sampling for this study. The result of WES will be returned during a consultation with the geneticist and the associated prognosis will be explained in case of molecular diagnosis</description>
