      A clinical trial to compare the efficacy of azithromycin (Arm 1) vs. doxycycline (Arm 2)&#xD;
      administered per CDC's STD Treatment Guidelines for rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in men&#xD;
      who have sex with men (MSM). Subjects will be males aged = / &gt; 18 years with a&#xD;
      microbiologically confirmed diagnosis of rectal CT and at least one male sex partner in the&#xD;
      past 12 months. The trial will be conducted at two sites in the US and will enroll up to 274&#xD;
      total subjects to achieve 246 subjects who contribute to the primary analysis. The duration&#xD;
      of this study will be approximately 16 months 22 months with subject participation duration&#xD;
      29 days. The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of azithromycin vs.&#xD;
      doxycycline for treatment of rectal CT infection in MSM based on microbiologic cure (negative&#xD;

      A Phase 4, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of azithromycin (Arm 1) vs. doxycycline (Arm 2) administered per CDC's STD Treatment&#xD;
      Guidelines for rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in men who have sex with men (MSM). The&#xD;
      effect of Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) infection on microbiologic cure in MSM with rectal&#xD;
      CT will also be assessed. Arm 1 will comprise of subjects receiving 1 gram of Azithromycin (4&#xD;
      capsules of 250 mg) orally as a single dose, and Doxycycline placebo (1 capsule) orally twice&#xD;
      daily for 7 days. Arm 2 will comprise of subjects receiving 100 mg of Doxycycline (1 capsule)&#xD;
      administered orally twice daily for 7 days, and Azithromycin placebo (4 capsules)&#xD;
      administered orally as a single dose. Subjects will be males aged = / &gt;18 years with a&#xD;
      microbiologically confirmed diagnosis of rectal CT and at least one male sex partner in the&#xD;
      past 12 months. The trial will be conducted at two sites in the US and will enroll up to 274&#xD;
      total subjects to achieve 246 subjects who contribute to the primary analysis. The duration&#xD;
      of this study will be approximately 22 months with subject participation duration 29 days.&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of azithromycin vs.&#xD;
      doxycycline for treatment of rectal CT infection in MSM based on microbiologic cure (negative&#xD;
      NAAT) at Day 29. The secondary objectives are: 1) to assess the effect of LGV infection on&#xD;
      microbiologic cure in MSM with rectal CT at Days 15 and 29 and 2) to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      azithromycin vs. doxycycline for treatment of rectal CT in MSM based on microbiologic cure at&#xD;
      Day 15.&#xD;

          <title>The Proportion of Subjects With Microbiologic Cure (Negative Rectal CT NAAT Result) Within the Subgroup of LGV (Lymphogranuloma Venereum) Infected at Baseline</title>
          <description>Microbiologic cure was based on rectal CT (Chlamydia trachomatis) NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) result. The proportion of subjects with microbiologic cure in each study arm at Day 29 is reported in this outcome measure. LGV strains of CT were identified via multiplex PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) on positive CT NAAT specimens.</description>
          <population>The Complete Case population included randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria at enrollment, had a positive baseline rectal CT NAAT result, had a baseline LGV infection status result, and had a post-baseline microbiologic result available. Furthermore, participants in this subgroup analyses were LGV infected at baseline.</population>
