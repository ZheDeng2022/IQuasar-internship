  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are two types of vaccines available against pertussis (whooping cough), an&#xD;
      infectious disease of the respiratory tract that can be extremely serious in very young&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both have advantages and disadvantages: The acellular form (aP, mainly used in resource-rich&#xD;
      countries) does not appear to offer as long lasting protection, but the whole cell vaccine&#xD;
      (wP, mainly used in LMIC) appears to be generally more reactogenic. There is consensus that a&#xD;
      &quot;better pertussis vaccine&quot; ought to be designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GaPs trial is part of a series of clinical trials performed by the PERtussIS COrrelates&#xD;
      of Protection Europe (PERISCOPE) Consortium, an EU-funded group of investigators which aims&#xD;
      to generate knowledge on immune responses to pertussis. A better understanding of human&#xD;
      biomarkers of protective immune responses to B. pertussis and its waning immunity is needed&#xD;
      to accelerate the design and testing of new pertussis vaccines with a longer duration of&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal describes the design and objectives of the clinical trial to be conducted in&#xD;
      the Gambia, which is the only site in Africa involved in the consortium and involves the&#xD;
      recruitment of 600 mother/infant pairs. Pregnant women will be randomised to receive either&#xD;
      the usually recommended tetanus vaccination or a combination vaccine against whooping cough,&#xD;
      diptheria, tetanus and polio. Their infants will receive either aP or wP as part of their EPI&#xD;
      vaccines, and resulting immune responses will be characterized in detail up to the age of 9&#xD;
      months. The investigators will use immunological assays to investigate the functional humoral&#xD;
      and cellular responses to pertussis in infants born to mothers who are randomized to&#xD;
      receiving pertussis vaccine in pregnancy or not, and their infants who will receive either aP&#xD;
      or wP vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does vaccination against pertussis in pregnancy have impact on subsequent immune responses to&#xD;
      pertussis vaccine and other EPI vaccines in the infants Does vaccination of infants with wP&#xD;
      vaccine induce different levels and functionality of antibody and/or T cell responses than&#xD;
      vaccination with aP vaccine What is the difference in innate and acquired immunity- as&#xD;
      measured with novel systems vaccinology tools- between being vaccinated with wP versus aP?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomised, controlled, double-blinded, clinical vaccine&#xD;
      trial in pregnant women combined with an open-label controlled Phase IV clinical vaccine&#xD;
      trial in their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will examine the differences in immunity generated by aP compared with wP in&#xD;
      infants at 5 and 9 months of age, and examine the impact of maternal antibodies on the immune&#xD;
      response of infants receiving aP or wP vaccines at two, three and four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to address two key question: 1. If measures of immunity in infants&#xD;
      given aP or wP differ by 5 and 9 months of age; and 2: If and- if so- how maternal pertussis&#xD;
      antibodies affect the development and maintenance of immunity to Bordetella pertussis in&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pertussis (whooping cough) is an infectious disease that can be very serious- particularly in&#xD;
      young infants- but preventable through vaccination. There are two types of vaccines:&#xD;
      acellular (aP) and whole cell (wP) vaccines, both extensively used worldwide. A clearer&#xD;
      understanding of how these two different types of vaccines work is fundamental when&#xD;
      considering adjustments or rethinking vaccination strategies and such knowledge will help the&#xD;
      future development of new vaccines, given that some LMIC have already introduced aP but the&#xD;
      current WHO recommendation still continues to recommend wP vaccine for those who have not yet&#xD;
      switched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increases in the incidence of pertussis infection, including fatal cases in young infants,&#xD;
      have been recently observed in many regions in the world, more likely associated with the use&#xD;
      of aP vaccines. As a consequence, it is now recommended in several countries that women&#xD;
      should receive aP vaccination in pregnancy so that their high levels of pertussis antibody&#xD;
      which will be passed on via the placenta can protect their babies in early life, before the&#xD;
      infants have received sufficient doses of pertussis vaccine themselves. However, it is&#xD;
      currently unclear if and how maternal antibodies affect long-term immunity to pertussis in&#xD;
      infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike in the UK, where many women of childbearing age would have received aP vaccine in&#xD;
      childhood, in The Gambia, all women would have been primed with wP vaccine as part of the&#xD;
      NIP. Hence a study in this group of women is uniquely placed to assess if different priming&#xD;
      regimens could have different quantitative and qualitative effects on transplacental antibody&#xD;
      transfer for pertussis antibody, providing additional insights in comparison to parallel&#xD;
      studies in Europe under the PERISCOPE consortium (PERtussIS COrrelates of Protection Europe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of human biomarkers of protective immune responses to B. pertussis,&#xD;
      and its waning immunity is needed to accelerate the design and testing of new pertussis&#xD;
      vaccines with a longer duration of protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 600 mother/infant pairs. Following informed consent,&#xD;
      sensitisation and eligibility checks including antenatal ultrasound to date the pregnancy,&#xD;
      pregnant women will be randomised to receive either Boostrix IPV (contains antigens against&#xD;
      pertussis, tetanus, diphteria and polio)- a vaccine recommended for pregnant women in the UK&#xD;
      and other countries where recent pertussis outbreaks have been observed, or the tetanus&#xD;
      vaccine routinely recommended for women in LMIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre vaccination antibody titres will be measured in the women prior to vaccination between&#xD;
      28-34 week gestation and vaccine responses measured subsequently at the time of giving birth.&#xD;
      Cord blood will be collected to measure transfer of maternal antibody. Infants will be&#xD;
      grouped to receive either aP or wP at 2,3 and 4 months of age, in line with routine EPI&#xD;
      programs. Blood samples will be collected from infants prior to vaccination and following&#xD;
      doses of vaccines at specific intervals to measure innate and acquired immune responses and&#xD;
      followed up until 9 months of age. Infants will be allocated to subgroups for blood tests so&#xD;
      that no infant will have between 4 and max 5 episodes of blood sampling up to the age of 9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be processed for quantitative and qualitative antibody, innate and acquired&#xD;
      cellular immune responses. Where available, samples will be stored for further investigations&#xD;
      using transcriptomic and epigenetic methodologies. Samples, results and data will be shared&#xD;
      with the PERISCOPE consortium members.&#xD;
