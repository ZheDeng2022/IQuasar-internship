    <textblock>
      Anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes loaded with doxorubicin (C225-ILs-dox) are given intravenously in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of C225-ILs-dox in peripheral blood (PB), cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and&#xD;
      resected tumour tissue will be assessed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent according to International Conference on Harmonization&#xD;
             (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations before registration and prior to any&#xD;
             trial specific procedures&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients need to have at least one line of treatment with combined radio-chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. EGFR amplification. EGFR amplification will be tested by comparative genomic&#xD;
             hybridization (CGH) method. EGFR will be considered amplified if the value is 0.15&#xD;
             above the average signal of chromosome 7.&#xD;

             least 3 years from registration except for adequately treated cervical carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ and localized non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Lack to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Previous therapy with more than 240 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or more than 450 mg/m2 of&#xD;
             epirubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any serious underlying medical condition (at the judgement of the investigator) which&#xD;
             could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial (e.g. active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Breastfeeding and pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in any investigational drug trial within 4 weeks preceding treatment&#xD;
             start&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any concomitant drugs contraindicated when administering Erbitux™ or Caelyx™ according&#xD;
             to the Swissmedic-approved product information&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known hypersensitivity to trial drug(s) or to any component of the trial drug(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any other serious underlying medical, psychiatric, psychological, familial or&#xD;
             geographical condition, which in the judgment of the investigator may interfere with&#xD;
             the planned staging, treatment and follow-up, affect patient compliance or place the&#xD;
             patient at high risk from treatment-related complications.&#xD;
