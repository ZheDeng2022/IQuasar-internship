  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to calibrate the performance of the KBS-1 non-invasive glucose&#xD;
      monitoring device with diabetic people when compared to that of the standard method currently&#xD;
      used in the clinical setting for prescription point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring.&#xD;
      The secondary purpose of this study is to calibrate the performance of the RBA-1 minimally&#xD;
      invasive bodily fluid analyte analyzer device when compared to the results from a&#xD;
      prescription POC blood glucose monitoring device and/or standard hospital laboratory blood&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to collect non-invasive in vivo, and potentially in vitro,&#xD;
      spectral measurements of interstitial fluid glucose from underneath the skin of the palm of&#xD;
      the hand (Test Article #01), and potentially the blood, respectively, from diabetic adult&#xD;
      hospital staff participants, and to collect in vitro spectral measurements of venous blood&#xD;
      tested from adult hospital patients with or without diabetes (Test Article #02) and compare&#xD;
      them to POC blood glucose monitor values and analyte measurements conducted by a hospital&#xD;
      laboratory (Control Article #01 procedure), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison of the results obtained from the different analytical methods will be used to&#xD;
      calibrate and refine the glucose, and other, analyte level calculation algorithms of the Test&#xD;
      Article systems.&#xD;

    <description>Diabetic hospital staff participants subjected to the KBS-1 device (Test Article #01) will have a finger on their left hand pricked with a lancet and their blood glucose level read by a POC glucose monitor (Control Article #02). Next, they will have their interstitial fluid glucose level spectroscopically scanned from the palm of their left hand using the KBS-1 device, and blood (approximately 40µl), collected from their finger prick site, will be spectroscopically scanned using the RBA-1 device (Test Article #02). Hospital patients subjected to the RBA-1 device, who must already be prescribed a hospital lab blood test by their physician, will have approximately 40µl of their blood, collected from the venipuncture site, spectroscopically scanned using the RBA-1 device (Test Article #02).</description>
