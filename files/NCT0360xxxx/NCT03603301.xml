  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will re-investigate 150 children studied extensively in the past. 100 of&#xD;
      these children were born to mothers prescribed methadone during their pregnancy because of&#xD;
      opiate dependency, and 50 were comparison children who were not exposed to drugs. These&#xD;
      children were investigated when they were newborn babies, and again when they were six months&#xD;
      old, and a quarter of the drug-exposed babies had problems with their eyesight, whilst very&#xD;
      few of the comparison children has eyesight problems. The investigators would like to see&#xD;
      whether the eyesight problems are still present in the children now that they are older.&#xD;
      Because they are older, more detailed testing can be undertaken which will help to understand&#xD;
      how drug exposure in the womb may have affected their eyesight. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit new, comparison children to the study to match the number of comparison children with&#xD;
      the number of drug-exposed children. The findings will be relevant and important when&#xD;
      advising mothers on drug use - both prescribed and illicit - when they are pregnant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple researchers across the world over many decades have noted eyesight problems in&#xD;
      children born to mothers who use drugs during pregnancy. From our earlier work on this group&#xD;
      of children, we have detailed knowledge of which drugs each mother used, making this group of&#xD;
      children uniquely important for understanding the consequences of drug use during pregnancy.&#xD;
      Although methadone use in the UK is dropping as heroin misuse falls, there is currently an&#xD;
      international epidemic of babies being born to mothers using illicit or prescribed opioid&#xD;
      drugs (e.g. methadone, heroin, opiate-based painkillers). These babies may be at risk of the&#xD;
      same eyesight problems as this Scottish cohort. Knowing the longer-term consequences and&#xD;
      disseminating the findings to relevant international clinical groups could help to alleviate&#xD;
      the consequential damage, through better information for mothers and through better and&#xD;
      prompter management of affected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to run for 2 years. It is anticipated that a maximum of 65 drug-exposed&#xD;
      children (out of the original 100) will attend, and will therefore aim to also investigate 65&#xD;
      comparison children, as many as possible of whom will belong to the original cohort of 50&#xD;
      comparison children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will take place in the Children's Clinical Research Facility (CRF), on the campus of&#xD;
      the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow. A CRF&#xD;
      paediatric nurse will recruit, coordinate and administrate the study. They will manage the&#xD;
      child's progress through the assessment session, measure height, weight and head&#xD;
      circumference, document demographic, social and educational details from the child's carer,&#xD;
      and will apply two questionnaires to the carers. Eyesight tests will be done by a specialist&#xD;
      paediatric orthoptist, and will include acuity (the smallest letter correctly identified),&#xD;
      stereoacuity (perception of depth) and looking for squints or nystagmus (shaking or wobbling&#xD;
      of the eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly specialised eye tests (eye movement recordings and visual evoked potentials) will also&#xD;
      be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any abnormalities are noted from these tests, the child will be given eyedrops to dilate&#xD;
      their pupils. All children will be seen by a paediatric ophthalmologist who will look at the&#xD;
      back of their eyes, and check whether they need glasses, or whether their glasses are&#xD;
      correct. A medical history will be taken. If any problems are noted during the visit (e.g.&#xD;
      visual, medical, social), the child will be referred to relevant services after discussion&#xD;
      with their carer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be added to the existing database for these children, and the test results&#xD;
      correlated with the results found at birth and at six months, and with the any known drug&#xD;
      exposure of each child.&#xD;
