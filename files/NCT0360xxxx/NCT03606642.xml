    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if one month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) combined&#xD;
      with the placement of the Synergy® Stent with IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) is safe for&#xD;
      patients who are at high risk of bleeding (HBR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DAPT or Dual Antiplatelet Therapy is a combination of two medications given after a&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug eluting stent. DAPT is used to help make&#xD;
      the platelets in your blood slick so they don't clump or stick together. If the platelets&#xD;
      stick together and form a blood clot in the stent it is called a stent thrombosis and will&#xD;
      cause an immediate heart attack or MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medications used for DAPT are low dose Aspirin (81mg) and one of three (3) antiplatelet&#xD;
      medications: ticagrelor (Brilinta), clopidogrel (Plavix) or prasugrel (Effient) . The&#xD;
      standard length of time to take DAPT after a stent placement is 6 months to 1 year. Dapt is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Because you are considered to be at a high&#xD;
      risk for bleeding due to one or a combination of reasons this study is trying to determine if&#xD;
      a shorter use of DAPT in combination with the Synergy® stent and an imaging tool called IVUS&#xD;
      used during your PCI procedure is safe and effective to reduce the potential for serious&#xD;
      bleeding events and early stent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Synergy® stent was chosen because of its enhanced method of healing and reduced&#xD;
      inflammation of the artery after placement. Because of this the Synergy stent may be a better&#xD;
      choice for patients who are at high risk for bleeding and could benefit from a shortened&#xD;
      period of DAPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular ultrasound or IVUS provides a visual image of the inside of the coronary&#xD;
      artery. It is used in patients undergoing PCI or stent placement for a few reasons; prior to&#xD;
      placing the stent it is used to measure the artery's width to select the proper size diameter&#xD;
      of a stent, also the length of the blockage to select the appropriate length of the stent and&#xD;
      to visualize the amount of narrowing or blockage. After the stent is placed IVUS is used to&#xD;
      make sure the stent itself is fully expanded and sits up against the wall of the artery. This&#xD;
      is called apposition. If stents are not fully expanded and sit up against the wall of the&#xD;
      artery early reblockage may occur. In short the IVUS aids in the ideal placement of the&#xD;
      stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the combination of the Synergy® Stent with the IVUS the expectation is to safely&#xD;
      decrease the length of time you take DAPT from 6-12 months to 1 month. With the benefit of&#xD;
      decreasing the risk of bleeding events.&#xD;
