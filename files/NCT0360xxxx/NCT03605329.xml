    <textblock>
      The links between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are&#xD;
      poorly studied. This study proposes to evaluate the severity of cardiovascular autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy (CAN) related to T1D in case of associated OSAS. This issue has significant&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic implications because of the increased cardiovascular risk in case&#xD;
      of confirmed CAN in T1D patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a common complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#xD;
      and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Otherwise, some studies have found a&#xD;
      high frequence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAs) in T1D. Cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      modulations are deeply altered in OSAS. The combination of T1D and OSAS could therefore&#xD;
      increase the severity of CAN and worsen the cardiovascular prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common method used to explore CAN is the study of heart rate variability (HRV). HRV&#xD;
      is a practical, non-invasive and reproducible measure of autonomic nervous system function.&#xD;
      HRV abnormalities are a predictor of hypertension and increased mortality in T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Th investigators therefore propose to explore the severity of NAC in case of OSAS associated&#xD;
      with T1D, and the hypothesis is that cardiovascular damage is increased in the presence of&#xD;
      these two pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in this study will be patients with type 1 diabetes diagnosed for more&#xD;
      than 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After overnight polysomnography, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy will be evaluated by&#xD;
      different methods: study of HRV, cardiovascular autonomic reflex test (Ewing), measurements&#xD;
      of urinary levels of catecholamines and measurements of sweat gland dysfunction using&#xD;
      Sudoscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of CAN will be evaluated in T1D patients with moderate to severe OSAS (apnea&#xD;
      hypopnea index (IAH) ≥15 / hour) compared to T1D patients with IAH &lt;15 / hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, glycemic holter will describe the links between glycemic variability, sleep&#xD;
      architecture and CAN. Biological oxidative stress assays will improve physiopathological&#xD;
      knowledge between T1D, OSAS and CAN. Finally, a 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ancillary study is planned to evaluate the evolution of markers of the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system after three months of treatment with CPAP in 15 patients with severe OSAS (AHI ≥30 /&#xD;
      hour) having previously participated in the main study. Fifteen patients with IAH &lt;30 / hour&#xD;
      will also be reassessed at three months to assess the intra-individual variability of the&#xD;
      HRV.&#xD;
