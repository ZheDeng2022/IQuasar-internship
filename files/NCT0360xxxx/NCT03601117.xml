  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in psychiatric inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small pilot study (n=22) will be carried out to demonstrate feasibility, using the&#xD;
      FDA-approved stimulation site for depression treatment (L-DLPFC). Participants will be&#xD;
      offered stimulation at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to investigate whether modifying stimulation parameters enables typical&#xD;
      6-8 week long rTMS protocols to be compressed to only five days. The influence of this&#xD;
      accelerated protocol on the length of patient stay in the hospital will be investigated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A small pilot study (n=22) will be an open-label study in which all participants receive stimulation to the L-DLPFC to demonstrate feasibility of delivering this accelerated protocol on an inpatient unit.&#xD;
For participants who do not respond to L-DLPFC stimulation, we will offer an alternative site, the ACC.&#xD;
If patients are enrolled that have a psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD, scales measuring symptoms related to their other diagnosis/(es) will also be collected in addition to measuring change in depressive symptoms (see 'other pre-specified outcome measures' for a list of measures used to measure symptoms related to psychiatric diagnoses other than depression).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>After all stimulation sessions have been completed (approximately 48 hours after the final session)</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item clinician-administered scale, designed to be particularly sensitive to antidepressant treatment effects in patients with major depression. Severity gradations for the MADRS have been proposed: 9-17 = mild depression, 18-34 = moderate depression, and â‰¥ 35 = severe depression. Scores range from 0-60 (higher scores are more symptomatic).&#xD;
Response is defined as a 50% reduction or greater in MADRS score compared to baseline. Remission is defined as a MADRS score of &lt;10.&#xD;
Data are presented as a raw score point change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>After all stimulation sessions have been completed (approximately 48 hours after the final session)</time_frame>
    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition.&#xD;
There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.&#xD;
Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2).&#xD;
Data are presented as a raw score point change.</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. BDI-II items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3 based on severity of each item. The maximum total score is 63.&#xD;
Scores: 0-13= minimal depression, 14-19=mild depression, 20-28=moderate depression, 29-63=severe depression.&#xD;
Data are presented as a raw score point change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quick Inventory Depressive Scale-Self Reported (QIDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>After all stimulation sessions have been completed (approximately 48 hours after the final session)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of depressive symptoms. The questionnaire consists of 16 questions. Each question can score between 0 to 4 points.&#xD;
Severity of depression is determined as follows: 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Very Severe.&#xD;
Total scores range from 0-27. Total scores: 0-5= no depression, 6-10= mild depression, 11-15= moderate depression, 16-20= severe depression, 21-27= very severe depression.&#xD;
The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each of the nine symptom domains of the DSM-IV MDD criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes (Rush et al. 2003).&#xD;

Each question can be scored between 0-3. 0=not bothered at all&#xD;
slightly bothered moderately bothered severely bothered&#xD;
Total score is calculated by adding up all questions (i.e. Q1+Q2+...Q20). One missing item is allowed, pro-rate if missing one item....i.e. (sum/count)*20.&#xD;
Minimum Score = 0 (good); Maximum Score = 60 (bad).&#xD;

        <title>Change in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</title>
        <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition.&#xD;
There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. These four items are given twice the weight of the others to compensate for poor cooperation from severely ill patients.&#xD;
Typical YMRS baseline scores can vary a lot. They depend on the patients' clinical features such as mania (YMRS = 12), depression (YMRS = 3), or euthymia (YMRS = 2).&#xD;

        <title>Change in Quick Inventory Depressive Scale-Self Reported (QIDS) Score</title>
        <description>Self-report measure of depressive symptoms. The questionnaire consists of 16 questions. Each question can score between 0 to 4 points.&#xD;
Severity of depression is determined as follows: 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe, 4=Very Severe.&#xD;
Total scores range from 0-27. Total scores: 0-5= no depression, 6-10= mild depression, 11-15= moderate depression, 16-20= severe depression, 21-27= very severe depression.&#xD;
The total score is obtained by adding the scores for each of the nine symptom domains of the DSM-IV MDD criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes (Rush et al. 2003).&#xD;

Blood samples will be analyzed by our collaborators at the Open Medicine Institute. Specifically, samples will be used for DNA/RNA extraction and analyses will be done to determine potential gene targets. Presence of inflammatory markers (cytokines) will also be determined.&#xD;
All analyses of blood samples will be conducted in the Open Medicine Institute.</description>

      <time_frame>The day after treatment was completed, the participant was asked to complete a questionnaire regarding any adverse events during the week. (If any adverse events were evident to the researcher during the treatment week, a note was made and this was included in the final assessment to prevent under reporting of side-effects if the participant forgot about these events by the end of the 5 day treatment).</time_frame>

          <description>The accelerated theta burst stimulation protocol will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC)&#xD;
Accelerated theta burst stimulation: All participants will receive iTBS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) to the left DLPFC (if participants do not respond to L-DLPFC stimulation, they may be offered stimulation at the ACC). Stimulation intensity will be standardized at 80% of resting motor threshold (adjusted for cortical depth).&#xD;
Stimulation will be delivered using the Brainsway TMS system.</description>
