      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study follows people who have had, or will soon have, a transplant using stem cells from&#xD;
      another person. This is known as an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).&#xD;
      Graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) can happen after HSCT. cGVHD can cause mouth problems and&#xD;
      more serious issues. Researchers want to study changes in the mouth that might indicate&#xD;
      cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify cGVHD in the mouth and better understand the development, treatment, and progress&#xD;
      of post-transplant changes in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old who will soon undergo HSCT or have had one in the past 3 years&#xD;
      Healthy adults at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a screening visit and baseline visit. They will last 60-90&#xD;
      minutes. Over these two visits, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and dental history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about their eating habits and general health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood drawn through a needle in the arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pictures of their mouth and lips taken&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about their oral health, including about pain, sensitivity, or dryness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples taken. Participants will spit into a sterile plastic tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swabs taken of the mouth and some of the saliva, plaque, and fluid from the spaces between&#xD;
      teeth and gums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A piece of skin taken (biopsy) from the inner lining of the cheeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      A piece of skin taken (biopsy) from the lower lip&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental X-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most participants will have at least 7 study visits over 3 years. They will meet with a&#xD;
      dentist and repeat baseline tests.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a multi-organ severe alloimmune and -&#xD;
           autoimmune disorder that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
           (HSCT). It is characterized by immune dysregulation, immunodeficiency, impaired organ&#xD;
           function, and decreased survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manifestations of cGVHD in the oral cavity are observed in 45-85% of cGVHD patients and&#xD;
           include 3 components: limitation of mouth opening, oral mucosal changes (lichenoid&#xD;
           lesions, ulceration) and salivary gland changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is an urgent need for new tools to diagnose and treat oral cGVHD. To develop&#xD;
           targeted therapies and non-invasive methods for serial screening, an improved&#xD;
           understanding of the clinical course and underlying mechanisms of oral cGVHD are&#xD;
           required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advance understanding of cGVHD pathophysiology and generate hypotheses for future cGVHD&#xD;
           studies by tracking the longitudinal development of cGVHD in the oral cavity and&#xD;
           transplant-related changes in the oral microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leverage knowledge about the impact of transplant on the oral cavity to develop better&#xD;
           protocols for supportive dental care, to refine clinical definitions and classifications&#xD;
           of oral cGVHD, and to test and improve criteria and tools for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Include healthy volunteer cohorts both as a direct control group for HSCT patients, and&#xD;
           to characterize measures of interest that were not previously defined in the normal oral&#xD;
           cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are scheduled to undergo allogeneic HSCT at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health (NIH) or who have already undergone allogeneic HSCT at the NIH or elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals who have not undergone transplant and are willing to undergo oral&#xD;
           exam and sample collection will be included in a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All study subjects, including patients and healthy individuals, must be able to provide&#xD;
           written informed consent and be willing to return to the NIH Dental Clinic for scheduled&#xD;
           evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single site, observational study with four cohorts. There are 2 transplant&#xD;
           cohorts: the New Transplant Cohort (&quot;Cohort NT&quot;; approximate n=300) consists of patients&#xD;
           who are scheduled to undergo allogeneic HSCT (under another protocol at the NIH) and the&#xD;
           Prior Transplant Cohort (&quot;Cohort PT&quot;; approximate n=100) consists of patients who have&#xD;
           already undergone allogeneic HSCT. These Cohorts will have up to 7 regularly scheduled&#xD;
           visits across 3 years, along with a variable number of acute-episode visits. Subjects&#xD;
           enrolled as NT or PT, who require a subsequent transplant are eligible to be either&#xD;
           enrolled or re-enrolled into the PT cohort to be followed for the 7 visits in 3 years.&#xD;
           Additionally, subjects will have the opportunity to participate in and optional annual&#xD;
           follow-up visits in years 4-10 post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The other 2 Cohorts include healthy volunteers: the Healthy-controls Longitudinal (HL)&#xD;
           Cohort (&quot;Cohort HL&quot;; approximate n=20) includes subjects who will participate in up to 4&#xD;
           study visits across 1 year, and the Healthy-controls Short-term (HS) Cohort (&quot;Cohort&#xD;
           HS&quot;; approximate n=80) will participate in a single baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each visit will include collection of biologic samples, patient-reported data and&#xD;
           clinical assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial statistical analysis will begin with unsupervised clustering methods and simple&#xD;
           logistic regression to identify biomarkers important in oral cGVHD. Based upon the&#xD;
           results of these initial analyses, more complex multivariate statistical models will be&#xD;
           developed to both classify and predict onset of oral cGVHD. Given the&#xD;
           hypothesisgenerating nature of this study, additional prospective statistical analysis&#xD;
           plans will be developed in consultation with a statistician as the study progresses to&#xD;
           address specific scientific questions.&#xD;
