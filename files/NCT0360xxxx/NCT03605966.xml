  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate prescribing is the fundamental upstream driver of the opioid epidemic.&#xD;
      Objective measures to determine the appropriateness of an opioid intervention, provide&#xD;
      monitoring of the therapy for adequacy of dose and detection of tolerance or hyperalgesia&#xD;
      would eliminate the subjective nature of opioid mediated pain management and obviate&#xD;
      iatrogenic facilitation of opioid abuse. The present study is designed to objectively&#xD;
      determine whether our device can pain type and determine analgesic efficacy thereby&#xD;
      optimizing treatment selection and opioid management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is generally recognized that pain assessment and management in newborns and children is an&#xD;
      unmet need. The Center for Disease Control found that in 2012, healthcare providers wrote 259&#xD;
      million prescriptions for opioid painkillers contributing to an epidemic of over&#xD;
      prescription. At the same time, medical professionals still see large amounts of pain left&#xD;
      untreated, particularly in pediatric populations. Children are often given minimal or no&#xD;
      analgesia for procedures that are treated much more aggressively in adults. This issue stems&#xD;
      from the lack of an effective method of assessing and monitoring patient analgesia. Recently&#xD;
      attempts have been made to objectively quantify pain but as of now, no effective standard&#xD;
      exists. This pilot study utilizes pupillary reflexes to characterize opioid analgesia in&#xD;
      pediatrics with the purpose of synthesizing the data into algorithms that detect specific&#xD;
      conditions and provide decision support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupillometry is a useful, non-invasive clinical and research tool that can provide valuable&#xD;
      insights into the autonomic nervous system. Pupillary tests provide a convenient and simple&#xD;
      method for evaluation of autonomic function4. In normal pupillary responsiveness, pupils&#xD;
      should be equal in size, approximately 3-4mm in size under average light conditions, and&#xD;
      reactive to light at &gt;1mm of movement. The sympathetic nervous system is activated during&#xD;
      periods of pain and stress and creates relaxation of the ciliary muscles resulting in&#xD;
      pupillary dilation, or mydriasis. In accommodation, the parasympathetic axons that innervate&#xD;
      the iris muscle produce constriction, or miosis. This reflex is known as the pupillary reflex&#xD;
      dilation (PRD) and has been shown in previous studies to occur in both awake and anesthetized&#xD;
      participants following a noxious stimulus5. This protocol will utilize these known reactions&#xD;
      to track the response to specific neurostimulation in participants receiving opioids to&#xD;
      determine the effect and effectiveness of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All mu opioid agonists cause miosis (constriction of the pupil) thus reducing the&#xD;
      constriction amplitude and constriction velocity of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). This is&#xD;
      the one opioid side effect to which tolerance does not occur. However, the pharmacologic&#xD;
      impact is not consistent and will vary with different drugs in the class and duration of&#xD;
      exposure. For example, morphine and Dilaudid (hydromorphone) each produce a neuro-excitatory&#xD;
      metabolite that causes mydriasis or dilation of the pupil and also antagonizes the parent&#xD;
      drug, producing the clinical appearance of tolerance, requiring more drug to achieve the same&#xD;
      effect. With other drugs of this class such as fentanyl, which is commonly administered in&#xD;
      ICUs, mydriasis may occur due to a phenomenon called opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH) where&#xD;
      there is an increased sensitivity to pain, often leading to an increased dose of drug.&#xD;
      Increasing the dosing in this situation can potentially exacerbate the issue, having a method&#xD;
      to monitor for OIH would provide decision support to physicians and allow them to recognize&#xD;
      and properly reconcile this issue. Evaluation of PRD in response to a 5 Hz neuro-stimulus can&#xD;
      differentiate between these drug-related issues and disease progression. This works because&#xD;
      opioid receptors populate the C fibers, which are stimulated with a 5 Hz frequency6,7,&#xD;
      allowing the investigators to determine dose response relationships as well as the optimized&#xD;
      analgesic dose and precisely determine dosing with opioid rotation. This occurs empirically&#xD;
      during standard of care based on a trial and error approach that risks under or overdosing&#xD;
      patients and having tolerance, dependence and OIH occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is part of an ongoing effort to develop a method to objectively assess pain&#xD;
      and its response to specific interventions. It specifically aims to develop profiles of the&#xD;
      impact of a variety of opioids under a variety of conditions in a diverse patient population.&#xD;
      It will allow researchers to understand better the specific impact of drugs in this class on&#xD;
      the PLR and PRD. Data collected herein will help will evaluate the feasibility of using this&#xD;
      approach to detect and monitor opioid analgesia and open new avenues for future research in&#xD;
      this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain assessment and baseline testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Standardized care where patient receives opioid dose per clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Testing pupillary reflexes at regular intervals and repeated pain assessments&#xD;
