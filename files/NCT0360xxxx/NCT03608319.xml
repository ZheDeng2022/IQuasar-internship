  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      A4250 when administered after a high-fat meal and when sprinkled on applesauce in healthy&#xD;
      adult subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover, food-effect and sprinkle study. On Day 1&#xD;
      of each period, subjects will receive a single oral dose of A4250 under 1 of 3 conditions:&#xD;
      fasting, following a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, or sprinkled on applesauce. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive A4250 under each condition on one occasion. Blood samples for PK analysis will&#xD;
      be collected for 18 hours following each study drug administration. There will be a washout&#xD;
      period of at least 7 days between doses. Study participants will be contacted approximately&#xD;
      14 days after the last study drug administration to determine if any adverse event (AE) has&#xD;
      occurred since the last study visit.&#xD;
