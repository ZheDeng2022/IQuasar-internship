      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab and ipilimumab after&#xD;
      donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with high risk acute myeloid leukemia or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome that does not respond to treatment or has come back. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      nivolumab and ipilimumab alone and in combination in patients with high risk or&#xD;
      refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) following&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the toxicity of nivolumab and ipilimumab alone and in combination with regard&#xD;
      to the rate and severity of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab, ipilimumab and the combination&#xD;
      in patients with high risk or refractory/ relapsed AML and MDS following allo-SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) of patients with high risk or refractory/ relapsed AML and MDS treated with this&#xD;
      combination following allo-SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify neo-antigens, the immune cell phenotype, expression of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      molecules and the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire following treatment with nivolumab,&#xD;
      ipilimumab and the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study immunological and molecular changes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow in&#xD;
      response to nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the TCR repertoire and immune phenotype in patients who experience aGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Beginning at least 6 weeks post-stem cell transplant, patients receive nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Beginning at least 6 weeks post-stem cell transplant, patients receive ipilimumab IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Beginning at least 6 weeks post-stem cell transplant, patients receive nivolumab IV&#xD;
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 14, and 28, and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and periodically&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
