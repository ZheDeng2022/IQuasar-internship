    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HBI is defined as total HBI score of 4 points or less. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (8 items, score 1 per item) lower scores indicating better well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Remission for CD as Measured by HBI</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants achieving remission for CD will be measured using the HBI Score less than or equal to (&lt;= 4). HBI remission is defined as total HBI score of 4 points or less. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (8 items, score 1 per item) lower scores indicating better well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo scoring system is used for assessment of ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physician's global assessment, and endoscopy findings) each ranging from 0 to 3. Partial Mayo score is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment) and ranges from 0 to 9 points. Higher score indicates severe disease. Change from baseline in the Partial Mayo Score of at least 3 points and at least 30 percent, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or an absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1 will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Remission for UC as Measured by Partial Mayo Score (Score of &lt;=2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants achieving remission for UC will be measured using the Partial Mayo score Score less than or equal to &lt;=2). Partial Mayo score is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician's global assessment) and ranges from 0 to 9 points. Higher score indicates severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Presence of Extra Intestinal Manifestations (EIMS) or Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (IMIDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the presence of Extra Intestinal Manifestations (EIMs)/ Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases (IMIDs) for its severity/activity will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI is a validated, self-administered questionnaire that assesses work and activity impairment during the past 7 days due to IBD. The WPAI score ranges from 0 to10. Score 0 means IBD had no effect on work and score 10 indicates because of IBD, could not work at all.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire Score (Short IBDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Short IBDQ is a health-related quality of life tool (HRQoL) to assess quality of life in adult participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) having only 10 items with 4 domains: digestive symptoms (3 items), systemic symptoms (2 items), emotional disturbance (3 items), and social function (2 items). Participants are asked to recall symptoms and quality of life from the last 2 weeks and rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale (1=all of the time; 2=most of the time; 3=a good bit of the time; 4=some of the time; 5=a little bit of the time; 6=hardly any of the time; 7=none of the time). Total score is calculated by adding the scores from each domain; the total score ranges from 10 to 70, where minimum score =10 (poor HRQoL) and maximum score =70 (good HRQoL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Scale (FACIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F scale is a 13 item fatigue scale with a 7 day recall period. It measures the level of fatigue during the usual daily activities. The level of fatigue is measured on a 4 point Likert scale (0=very much fatigued to 4=not at all fatigued). Total FACIT score is the sum of 13 items, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 52 (very much). Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Disability Index (IBD-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The IBD-DI consists of 28 items that evaluate the 5 domains of overall health, body function, body structures, activity participation and environmental factors. Each item response is graded from 0 to 4 for each area evaluated (0 = very good; 1 = Good; 2 = medium; 3 = Bad; 4 = Very bad). The final composite score representative of the overall degree of disability ranging from -80 (maximum degree of disability) to 22 (no disability).</description>
