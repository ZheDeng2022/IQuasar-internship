  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inability to urinate a common complication that happens to many patients after a surgery,&#xD;
      especially in men over 60 years of age who undergo surgery on their chest. Urinary retention&#xD;
      is uncomfortable, increases anxiety, increases hospital length of stay, and leads to more&#xD;
      procedures such as putting in a bladder catheter (Foley). This is uncomfortable, and can lead&#xD;
      to bleeding, infection, damage to the urethra and/or bladder and bladder spasm. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to attempt to prevent inability to urinate by giving patients a medication&#xD;
      called Flomax (Tamusolin) every day beginning a week before surgery. That medication relaxes&#xD;
      the prostate. It's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to improve urinary flow&#xD;
      in those with enlarged prostates. It is also commonly used in patients with bladder problems&#xD;
      due to inability to urinate who have required a Foley.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-operative urinary retention (POUR) in older men who undergo a thoracic surgical&#xD;
      procedure occurs in a significant proportion of patients (25% at Hackensack University&#xD;
      Medical Center in men &gt;60) and is a significant management problem. Typically, this&#xD;
      complication needs to be treated with placement of a bladder catheter (foley). In addition to&#xD;
      the discomfort of placing a foley in an awake patient, these patients are at a significantly&#xD;
      increased risk of a catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), potential&#xD;
      genito-urinary injury during the placement, and bladder muscle damage due to distention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether the use of Tamusolin could lower the high&#xD;
      incidence of POUR in older men undergoing a thoracic surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pre-operative administration of Tamusolin (Flomax,&#xD;
      0.4mg/day x 1 week), with ongoing use post-operatively until normal voiding resumes, will&#xD;
      result in a significant decrease in the incidence of POUR after a thoracic surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
