  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators designed a double-blind randomized trial to prove a more&#xD;
      reliable evidence to show how the treatment by using high-definition transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (HD-tDCS) can relieve negative symptoms in patients with predominant&#xD;
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia, especially on improving participants' anhedonia condition&#xD;
      and social cognition, through stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into active and sham HD-tDCS groups equally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders that almost 1% worldwide&#xD;
      population suffer from this devastating illness. The clinical expression of this illness has&#xD;
      been categorized into different dimensions, though most of the patients are well treated with&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication, the negative symptom is still one of the very refractory symptoms.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence shows that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising&#xD;
      treatment for schizophrenia negative symptoms, however, findings are still controversial.&#xD;
      HD-tDCS can provide a more stable and accurate direct current comparing with traditional&#xD;
      tDCS, which gives a hope to treat negative symptoms in a more reliable way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An association between negative symptoms and grey matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      is found, moreover, even during rest, hypoactivity of the prefrontal cortex, particularly of&#xD;
      the left dorsolateral, and of the anterior cingulate regions, has been linked to negative&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been observed that tDCS could relatively alleviate negative&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with schizophrenia by stimulating the left DLPFC through an anodal&#xD;
      electrode, which has been proved can also modulate brain functional connectivity and have&#xD;
      clinical improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the participants with a clinical presentation of predominant negative symptoms will&#xD;
      be stimulated by active HD-tDCS and the rest will have a sham stimulation. HD-tDCS is going&#xD;
      to be delivered at 1.5 mA intensity for 20 minutes once a day; sessions will be performed on&#xD;
      10 days 5 consecutive weekdays with sustained effects at 1 (T2) and 3 (T3) months. A Soterix&#xD;
      Medical 4x1 HD-tDCS will be used with the anode placed over the left DLPFC (F3), surrounded&#xD;
      by four cathodal electrodes at F5, F1, FC3 and AF3, based on the 10/20 international EEG&#xD;
      system. All the outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0, before HD-tDCS sessions), one day&#xD;
      after the 10th HD-tDCS sessions (T1), and also at T2 and T3. Both participants and&#xD;
      investigators will be blind to this treatment.&#xD;
