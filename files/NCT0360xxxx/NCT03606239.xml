  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiation is considered to be the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
      However, due to the patient's physical condition, comorbidities and other reasons, only about&#xD;
      1/3 of patients can receive concurrent chemoradiation. Radiotherapy alone or sequential&#xD;
      chemoradiation has become the treatment protocol for most patients. Hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy can be used in NSCLC because it can shorten the over treatment time and may&#xD;
      potentially reduce the effect of accelerated repopulation and obtain higher biological&#xD;
      effective dose（BED）. So far, the vast majority of radiotherapy prescriptions have given a&#xD;
      uniform dose of 60 Gy. This unified prescription dosage approach is completely inconsistent&#xD;
      with the concept of precision treatment. The Netherlands MAASTRO put forward the concept of&#xD;
      in silico radiotherapy prescription, that is: the normal tissue limits are uniform, such as:&#xD;
      V20% ≤ 30%, spinal cord V0&gt; 45Gy, etc., and each patient receives a different dose of&#xD;
      radiation therapy. This radiation prescription could reach the limits of the normal tissue of&#xD;
      every patient; if no one tissue limits were reached, the highest dose was set up to 79.2 Gy&#xD;
      (1.8 Gy, BID). MAASTRO applied this &quot;iso-toxic&quot; radiotherapy prescription and used&#xD;
      accelerated hyperfractionation technology so that each patient received the maximum&#xD;
      individualized radiation dose as possible. We will integrate this concept with&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiotherapy in order to further improve efficacy.&#xD;

      Radiotherapy plays an important role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and concurrent&#xD;

      However, due to the patient's physical condition, comorbidities and other reasons, only about&#xD;

      chemoradiation has become the treatment protocol for most patients. Hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy can be used in NSCLC because it can shorten the total treatment time and may&#xD;
      potentially reduce the effect of accelerated repopulation and obtain higher BED. So far, the&#xD;
      vast majority of radiotherapy prescriptions have given a uniform dose of radiotherapy to all&#xD;
      patients, regardless of individual factors such as tumor size, location, and adjacent vital&#xD;
      organs, which may cause two consequences: First, small-volume tumors may, not receive enough&#xD;
      radiation dose, resulting in a decrease in local control rate. Second, for large volumes of&#xD;
      tumors or tumors adjacent to vital organs, even the &quot;so-called&quot; standard dose (60 Gy) may&#xD;
      cause serious damage to normal tissues. This unified prescription dosage approach is&#xD;
      completely inconsistent with the concept of precision treatment. The Netherlands MAASTRO put&#xD;
      forward the concept of in silico radiotherapy prescription, that is: the normal tissue limits&#xD;
      are uniform, such as: V20% ≤ 30%, spinal cord V0&gt; 45Gy, etc., and each patient receives a&#xD;
      different dose of radiation therapy.This radiation prescription could reach the limits of the&#xD;

      and used accelerated hyperfractionation technology so that each patient received the maximum&#xD;
      individualized radiation dose as possible.From the model study to the long-term survival&#xD;
      results, a series of encouraging results were achieved. The use of an individualized&#xD;
      radiotherapy prescription based on iso-toxicity for the treatment of NSCLC in large-segment&#xD;
      radiotherapy is expected to achieve: 1. For patients with small tumor volumes and no adjacent&#xD;
      to vital organs, a higher radiation dose is given under safe conditions. 2. For patients with&#xD;
      larger volumes of tumors or adjacent to vital organs, give safer doses.&#xD;
