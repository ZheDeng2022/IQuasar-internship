  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to characterize the safety and efficacy of a new extravascular&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system in humans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit male and female adult subjects that meet all of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and none of the exclusion criteria. All subjects will be indicated to receive an ICD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EV ICD system will be implanted and the subjects will be followed for at least 3 months&#xD;
      following implantation of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be exited after follow-up is completed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At Implant</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will demonstrate a successful defibrillation outcome if either 2 successive induced ventricular fibrillation episodes are terminated by the subject's device delivering a shock at the required energy level, or if one such episode is successfully terminated by the subject's device delivering a shock at a lower energy level. Up to 5 such episodes may be induced to test device efficacy.</description>
