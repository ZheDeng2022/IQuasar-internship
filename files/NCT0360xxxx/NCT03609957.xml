  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Hispanic Blacks tend to report higher levels of pain, experience pain more frequently,&#xD;
      and be under-treated for pain compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Acute (single session)&#xD;
      exercise is known to be effective at reducing pain but it is unknown what effect chronic&#xD;
      exercise training has on pain responses. The broad goal of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      regular exercise training is more effective at reducing pain responses in non-Hispanic Blacks&#xD;
      compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The investigators are interested in comparing regular&#xD;
      aerobic exercise training versus high-intensity interval training.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Racial discrepancy in the experience of pain is well documented within the literature.&#xD;
      Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) report greater amounts and severity of clinical pain compared to&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) in a variety of clinical conditions. NHB also experience greater&#xD;
      pain-related symptoms and disability, regardless of descriptive factors such as age, gender,&#xD;
      and socioeconomic status or clinical factors such as comorbidities and duration of disease.&#xD;
      Further, NHB tend to be medically undertreated for pain, regardless of nearly identical&#xD;
      reporting of pain level and severity compared with NHW. Not only is adequate pain treatment&#xD;
      infrequent, but many pain treatments are less effective in NHB than in NHW, commonly&#xD;
      resulting in less reduction of pain severity in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison to NHW, NHB report greater sensitivity to several types of pain, including heat&#xD;
      pain, cold pressor pain, ischemic pain, and electrical stimulation. NHB show increased&#xD;
      temporal summation, implying central nervous system hypersensitivity and hyperexcitability to&#xD;
      noxious (painful) stimuli. Specifically, regarding experimental heat pain, NHB differ&#xD;
      minimally in pain threshold or ratings of pain intensity compared to NHW, but perceive&#xD;
      greater unpleasantness of pain and show a lower pain tolerance. The physiological mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying this racial discrepancy remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental pain assessment is valuable in understanding the experience of pain between&#xD;
      individuals. Pain is an individual experience and differs from one to another. However,&#xD;
      differences in experimental pain perceived may estimate the clinical pain one would&#xD;
      experience. Studies show that greater experimental pain sensitivity is associated with&#xD;
      greater experience of day-to-day pain in healthy adults and can predict higher levels of&#xD;
      clinical pain in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While affective (subjective) pain perception has been the focus of the majority of pain&#xD;
      assessment studies, in 2008 Campbell et al. investigated the nociceptive flexion reflex&#xD;
      (NFR), an involuntary and objective component of the pain response. The NFR is a&#xD;
      spinal-mediated reflex that follows activation of nociceptive A-delta afferents by noxious&#xD;
      stimuli. This study shows the NFR threshold in NHB is decreased compared to NHW, implying a&#xD;
      physiological difference between these racial groups that may contribute to the discrepancy&#xD;
      in pain perception. Skin blood flow via vasodilation, another physiological measure, has been&#xD;
      shown to increase in response to noxious thermal stimuli in order to distribute heat away&#xD;
      from a singular point in the cutaneous environment and prevent damage. Assessing changes in&#xD;
      skin blood flow in response to noxious thermal stimuli may further elucidate physiological&#xD;
      differences between races that affect pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to investigate more effective prevention or treatment methods for pain in&#xD;
      NHB. Exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is characterized by decreased pain sensation&#xD;
      following physical exercise. Specifically, EIH leads to decreased sensitivity to noxious&#xD;
      (painful) stimuli, increased pain thresholds, increased pain tolerance, and decreased pain&#xD;
      ratings. EIH has been shown to occur following several types of exercise, such as acute bouts&#xD;
      of submaximal, continuous aerobic exercise and acute bouts of isometric hand-grip exercise.&#xD;
      Lending to the knowledge of racial discrepancy in pain perception, a study by Umeda et al. in&#xD;
      2016 showed NHB had a smaller magnitude of EIH compared to NHW following isometric hand-grip&#xD;
      exercise, but racial differences in EIH remain incompletely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is suggested that hypoalgesia following exercise may be due to an overlapping of pain&#xD;
      perception and cardiovascular mechanisms. For example, pain regulation and blood pressure&#xD;
      control are associated with the same brain stem nuclei. Further, hypertensive individuals&#xD;
      have shown reduced sensitivity to noxious (painful) stimuli compared to normotensives, and&#xD;
      acute pharmacological elevations in blood pressure have been shown to alter pain perception.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to investigate alterations in pain perception following both acute&#xD;
      (which should elicit elevations in blood pressure) and chronic (which should elicit overall&#xD;
      declines in blood pressure) exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated the effects of submaximal exercise on various types of pain&#xD;
      and it is typical to see moderate-intensity continuous (MIC) exercise incorporated into pain&#xD;
      management programs (generally 30 minutes of 70% VO2max exercise). However, two studies in&#xD;
      particular display data indicating that as workload increases, pain thresholds increase in a&#xD;
      stepwise manner. Other studies show EIH occurs more consistently following exercise at higher&#xD;
      intensities (&gt; 70% VO2max), indicating that high intensity interval training (HIIT) may&#xD;
      produce more beneficial results in affective and/or objective responses to pain than MIC&#xD;
      exercise. Several studies have looked at affective pain perception following acute submaximal&#xD;
      bouts of aerobic and isometric exercise. Those that have investigated acute HIIT have only&#xD;
      examined affective responses. The investigators do not know of any studies that have looked&#xD;
      at the acute and chronic effect of MIC exercise and HIIT on affective and objective pain&#xD;
      perception in NHB and NH There are three main purposes of this study, and they are as&#xD;
      follows: 1) to assess objective and subjective responses to pain in NHB and NHW, 2) to assess&#xD;
      the use of acute versus chronic exercise in pain management for NHW and NHB, and 3) to assess&#xD;
      the use of MIC exercise versus HITT in pain management for NHW and NHB. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that 1) NHB will show decreased skin blood flow response to noxious stimuli&#xD;
      compared to NHW prior to exercise training, 2) NHB will report greater pain ratings than NHW&#xD;
      prior to exercise training, and 3) chronic HIIT will mitigate the differences in skin blood&#xD;
      flow and pain ratings between NHB and NHW.&#xD;
