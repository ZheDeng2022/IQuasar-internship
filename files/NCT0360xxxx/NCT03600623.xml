  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement a new treatment regimen for patients with advanced and inoperable&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer using chemotherapy combinations of Folfirinox or gemcitabine-nab paclitaxel&#xD;
      (abraxane) followed by a short course of high dose radiation called Stereotactic Body&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT). While the chemotherapy is standard of care, the strategy of adding&#xD;
      SBRT has not been investigated. An increase in the percentage of patients who can proceed to&#xD;
      have surgery to remove their disease is anticipated with this approach.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed&#xD;
      by SBRT. Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and borderline pancreatic&#xD;
      inoperable cancer will be assigned to one of two treatment arms based upon performance status&#xD;
      and physician's discretion. The two treatment arms are: Folfirinox or gemcitabine-nab&#xD;
      paclitaxel (abraxane). There are no study drugs as all treatments are based on standard&#xD;
      clinical pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two cycles of treatment patients will be restaged with CT scans or imaging. If the&#xD;
      tumor remains resectable, borderline, or unresectable without progression of disease, then&#xD;
      the patient will proceed to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will continue every three months for up to one year or until progression of&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
