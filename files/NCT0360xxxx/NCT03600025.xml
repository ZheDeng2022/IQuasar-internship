  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi causes over 21 million cases of&#xD;
      febrile illness and 200,000 deaths are attributed to enteric fever each year. Typhoid fever&#xD;
      is an enteric infection that results in febrile illness. Typhoid fever causes significant&#xD;
      morbidity in the developing world especially young children.S. Typhi specific antibody&#xD;
      responses are elicited in typhoid fever and following typhoid vaccination. Cross-reactive&#xD;
      multifunctional CD+4 T cell mediated IL-17 responses have been shown in typhoid fever. As S.&#xD;
      Typhi as an intracellular pathogen, cellular immune responses might be central to protection.&#xD;
      S. Typhi peptide subunit vaccine elicits CD+4 T cell responses that correlate with protection&#xD;
      in mice. The role of mucosal associated invariant T cell (MAIT) and natural killer (NK) cell&#xD;
      responses in typhoid fever or following vaccination remain poorly understood. Transcriptome&#xD;
      profiling of human immune responses to S. Typhi infection is not clearly understood.&#xD;
      Establishing successful infection by S. Typhi evasion of T cell and neutrophil responses need&#xD;
      to be investigated to better understand the correlates of protection.&#xD;

      Description of the Research Project: It has been previously shown that IFN-gamma and IL-17&#xD;
      are increased in typhoid fever patients. It was shown that S. Typhi infection induces&#xD;
      antibody responses against a number of key typhoid antigens (LPS) HlyE, Flagellar protein&#xD;
      FliC and chaperon protein EcpD). In the enteric diarrheal disease cholera, MAIT cells are&#xD;
      activated and associated LPS specific antibody responses are generated. In a human challenge&#xD;
      model study, it has been shown that CD8+ T cell memory cells are key correlates of protection&#xD;
      against typhoid fever. The live attenuated typhoid vaccine (TY21a) also induces MAIT cells&#xD;
      after immunization. It has been shown that IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 induce memory-like NK cells in&#xD;
      a mouse model and IL-21 induces memory-like NK cells protective against Mycobacterium&#xD;
      tuberculosis infection. The role of activated MAIT cells, and cytokine induced memory-like NK&#xD;
      cells in typhoid fever currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the multiple killing mechanism employed by neutrophil is the release of neutrophil&#xD;
      extracellular traps (NETs) that contain myeloperoxidase (MPO), elastase, lysozyme and&#xD;
      defensins. Infection induces releases of NETs to trap microbial pathogens. Neutrophils&#xD;
      isolated from typhoid fever patients release NETs in and that neutrophil NET release is&#xD;
      primed by vaccination with a subunit-conjugate vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: Typbar-TCV is a Typhoid Vi capsular polysaccharide tetanus toxoid&#xD;
      conjugate vaccine. Typbar-TCV is the world's 1st clinically proven conjugate typhoid vaccine.&#xD;
      This vaccine is WHO pre-qualified and approved for children and infants less that 2 years of&#xD;
      age. During the Phase III clinical study, a single dose of Typbar-TCV elicited 4-fold&#xD;
      seroconversion rates of 98.05%, 99.17% and 92.13% in subjects between greater than 6 months&#xD;
      to 2 years, &gt;2 to 15 years and &gt;15 to 45 years respectively. Each volunteer in the&#xD;
      vaccination arm of the study will receive 25 ug of Typbar-TCV vaccine administered as 0.5 ml&#xD;
      single intracellular dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage condition: The vaccine will be stored at +2-8C and cold chain will be maintained at&#xD;
      all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants and sample collection: The investigators will collect 8-10 ml of blood&#xD;
      from adults and 3-5 ml of blood from children who will be suspected typhoid fever patients&#xD;
      (age 1-59 years) at enrollment (day1) and if patient is S. Typhi/Paratyphi culture confirmed&#xD;
      then two more blood samples (2-5 days and 27-33 days later) will be collected. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect 8-10 ml of blood from adults and 3-5 ml of blood from children&#xD;
      before vaccination (day 0) and two more blood samples after one dose of vaccination at day 7&#xD;
      (6-8 days later) [13] and at day 30 (27-33 days later). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs) and neutrophils will be isolated from blood samples and will be used for different&#xD;
      assays (Polymorphprep kit). Plasma samples will be separated to measure antibody response to&#xD;
      infection and vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management Depending on discretion of clinician, treatment of the patient with&#xD;
      antibiotic and other necessary drug will be provided. After culture confirmation of typhoid&#xD;
      fever antibiotic treatment will be adjusted depending on antibiotic sensitivity pattern. If&#xD;
      patient does not respond to oral antibiotic then we will provide injectable antibiotic. If&#xD;
      the patient remains unresponded to injectable antibiotic and/or other complication arise,&#xD;
      then the patient will be hospitalized. The investigators are conducting another typhoid study&#xD;
      where the patients are enrolled in different health care facilities in Mirpur and also&#xD;
      icddr,b Dhaka hospital. The patient management will be supported by other ongoing typhoid&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assay Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIT and NK cell assay: Isolated PBMCs will be stained with fluorochrome labelled antibodies&#xD;
      and flow cytometric phenotyping performed (acquisition of ≥50000 live cells on a FACS-Aria).&#xD;
      MAIT cells will be defined as live (DAPI-) CD3+CD4-CD161hiVα7.2+ cells, expressed as a&#xD;
      percentage of total CD3+ lymphocytes, and CD38 used as a marker of cell activation. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess the frequency of circulating live CD3+CD8+CD4-CD161loVα7.2+&#xD;
      cells, which have been suggested to be MAIT-derived cells associated with absent or reduced&#xD;
      cytokine secretion in vitro. CD4+ (live CD3+ CD8-CD4+) T cell responses in study subjects&#xD;
      will be evaluated in different T memory (TM) subsets defined by their expression of CD45RA&#xD;
      and CD62L i.e., T central memory (TCM; CD45RA-CD62L+), T effector memory (TEM; CD45RA-CD62L-)&#xD;
      and T effector memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA; CD45RA+CD62L-), T follicular (CD3+CXCR5+) and Naïve T&#xD;
      cells (TN: CD45RA+CD62L+). Activated NK cell as live CD3-, CD45+, CD56+, CD69+, CD40L+, CD16+&#xD;
      cells and memory like NK cell as live CD3-CD56+CD16+NKp46+CD27+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokine analysis: Isolated lymphocytes will be stimulated with S. Typhi antigens (Whole&#xD;
      cell, MP and LPS) for 48 hours as well as for 5 days and culture supernatant will be&#xD;
      collected and stored until analyzed at -70°C. Cytokines in culture supernatant will be&#xD;
      analyzed by using multiplex bead array (Luminex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of NETs: Neutrophils will be isolated from peripheral blood based on previously&#xD;
      described method. The release of NETs will be measured by neutrophil NET assay kit (NET assay&#xD;
      kit, Creative Biomart, NY, USA). NETosis will be quantified by measuring levels of elastase&#xD;
      that are released from neutrophils and NETs mediated killing will be quantified by measuring&#xD;
      viability of bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NETs mediated killing assay: To determine the efficiency of NETs in killing S. Typhi, a CFU&#xD;
      assay will be performed. Overnight culture S. Typhi will be co-incubated with freshly&#xD;
      isolated human neutrophils in 96-well culture plate and incubated at 37ºC. After 3 hours of&#xD;
      incubation, wells will be aspirated and washed with PBS. Dilutions of 1:10 and 1:100 will be&#xD;
      made and 100 µl of each dilution will be plated onto Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar. Culture&#xD;
      plates will be incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2. The number of CFU will be counted after 24&#xD;
      hours incubation and after 3 days of culturing until no further increase in colony numbers&#xD;
      are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophil intracellular metabolite assay: Neutrophils will be isolated from blood and&#xD;
      incubated at 37ºC for 1 hour for recovery. Incubation media will be aspirated and 1 ml of dry&#xD;
      ice (-80ºC) cold 80% methanol will be added. Cells will be vortexed for 1 min, and then&#xD;
      centrifuged at 15 K rpm for 1 min. Supernatant will be collected in tubes and stored at -80ºC&#xD;
      until use. Before analysis samples will be removed from -80ºC and allow to equilibrate to&#xD;
      room temperature. Supernatant (75 µl) will be transferred to a liquid chromatography-tandem&#xD;
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS) vial capped. Ten microliters of sample will be autoloaded into&#xD;
      LC-MS system for metabolite separation and mass spectrometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in plasma. Plasma antibody responses to S.&#xD;
      Typhi LPS in patients and vaccinees will be measured using ELISA methods. Briefly, 96-well&#xD;
      microtiter plates will be coated with LPS and incubated with plasma (1:10 dilution) with&#xD;
      serial 3-fold dilutions thereafter. Plates will be washed, and horseradish&#xD;
      peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies will be added. Plates will be&#xD;
      developed using 0.1% ortho-phenylene diamine (OPD) and 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and OD&#xD;
      will be measured at 492 nm. A 2-fold or higher antibody response will be considered a&#xD;
      significant response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcriptomics analysis: From a subset of adult patients and vaccinees 3 ml blood will be&#xD;
      collected in Tempus RNA tubes (applied biosystem) and RNA will be extracted from blood,&#xD;
      trancriptomic sequencing will be done at Shanghi, China (BGI) which is a service providing&#xD;
      lab and data will be analyzed using next-gen RNA-seq sequencing to see the gene expression&#xD;
      profile. Differential gene expression will be analysed using the DESeq package&#xD;
      (Bioconductor). The obtained sequence reads will be normalized between patients/vaccinees&#xD;
      versus healthy controls. A ratio larger than 2 and lower that 0.5 will be considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
