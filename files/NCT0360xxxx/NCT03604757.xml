      Patients with primary prostate cancer (low, intermediate or high metastatic risk) for whom&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy is indicated, will be invited to participate to the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography coupled with scanner (PET-CT) using a radiotracer : 68Ga-RM2 and&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography coupled with scanner (PET-CT) using another radiotracer :&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15% of men with prostate cancer have high-risk disease at diagnosis. For these&#xD;
      patients the accuracy of initial staging is of critical importance for treatment&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended imaging modalities for initial staging include computerized tomography (CT) scan,&#xD;
      bone scan, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In addition to initial work-up, 18F-Choline&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography coupled with scanner (PET-CT) may be proposed in some high-risk&#xD;
      patients but its sensitivity for lymph node detection remains limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, new radiotracers are becoming available for prostate cancer imaging. Among them,&#xD;
      PET-CT imaging with radiolabeled ligands of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) could&#xD;
      be more sensitive and more specific for the detection of lymph node metastasis in high-risk&#xD;
      cancers, as it is the case with radiolabeled PSMA-617 which has demonstrated very promising&#xD;
      results in men with metastatic prostate cancer in recent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, PET imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-617 may participate to optimize work-up in the staging&#xD;
      of high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another family of radiopharmaceuticals aimed to target the Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor&#xD;
      (GRP-R) which is overexpressed in low-grade prostatic carcinomas. GRP-R expression is&#xD;
      correlated with androgen receptor expression and with better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various radiolabeled GRP analogues have been developed and one of them, 68Ga-RM2, has shown&#xD;
      very promising preclinical results. A study in 14 patients with prostate cancer showed&#xD;
      encouraging results as related to the detection of primary prostate cancer and metastatic&#xD;
      lymph nodes as well as in detection of local recurrence in the prostate bed and nodal&#xD;
      relapse. However, 68Ga-RM2 failed to show some bone metastases in hormone-refractory&#xD;
      patients. 68Ga-RM2 has also been recently used and compared to 68Ga-PSMA-11 for targeting&#xD;
      biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. These radiotracers may offer complementary&#xD;
      performances in lymph nodes detection due to their distinct pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA-617 target different cell populations, combining these two&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals in patients could be of additional value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to compare 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT to 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT in 24&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer of various progression risks to better understand how they&#xD;
      could performed a metastatic risk mapping and how they could be used (or combined) in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
