      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for 15-20% of all strokes in Western Europe, and&#xD;
      contributes profoundly to mortality and disability. Thirty day case fatality is 40% and of&#xD;
      those surviving, only few gain independence. Except for stroke unit care and early blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering there is currently no treatment of proven benefit. Important predictors of&#xD;
      poor outcome are increasing age, decreasing Glasgow Coma Scale score, increasing ICH volume,&#xD;
      presence of intraventricular hemorrhage and deep or infratentorial location. In addition,&#xD;
      secondary injury due to development of edema and inflammatory response, contribute to&#xD;
      disability and death. Surgical treatment, mostly comprising craniotomy, has so far not been&#xD;
      proven effective. In the largest trials STICH and STICH II, the median time to treatment was&#xD;
      more than 24 hours, which may be an important explanation for the lack of treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that early, minimally-invasive, endoscopy-guided surgery&#xD;
      improves outcome in patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to study safety, feasibility and technical effectiveness of minimally-invasive&#xD;
      endoscopy guided surgery for treatment of spontaneous supratentorial ICH and to estimate the&#xD;
      potential effect on outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: a multicenter, prospective intervention study (phase II) with a telephonic&#xD;
      follow up interview at 90 and 180 days.The pilot study serves as a prelude to a randomized&#xD;
      phase III trial in which the investigators aim to assess whether this intervention improves&#xD;
      functional outcome at 90 and 180 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: patients with spontaneous supratentorial ICH of 18 years and older. Forty&#xD;
      patients in three participating centers (Radboudumc, Erasmus MC and AMC) will undergo&#xD;
      minimally-invasive endoscopy-guided surgery. Three-hundred-and-sixty patients undergoing&#xD;
      standard medical treatment in one of 7 other participating centers, will be included as a&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: minimally-invasive endoscopy-guided surgery within 8 hours of symptom onset, in&#xD;
      addition to standard medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcomes: safety (death within 24 hours, 7-day procedure related complications,&#xD;
      7-day mortality, 30-day mortality) and technical effectiveness (proportional volume&#xD;
      reduction, proportion of participants with volume reduction &gt; 60 and &gt;80%, and proportion&#xD;
      with remaining clot volume &lt;15mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: modified Rankin Scale score at 90 and 180 days after ICH (functional&#xD;
      outcome).&#xD;
