      Autism is a behaviorally defined complex neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by&#xD;
      impairments in social communication, by the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors,&#xD;
      interests and activities, and by abnormalities in sensory reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism is a severe, life-long developmental disorder that compromises functioning across&#xD;
      multiple domains including social behavior, language, sensory function, and&#xD;
      ritualistic/repetitive behaviors and interests. While the etiology of autism is complex and&#xD;
      not fully understood, strong evidence from twin and family studies suggests a large genetic&#xD;
      contribution .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environment factors. Risk factors include&#xD;
      certain infections during pregnancy such as rubella as well as valproic acid, alcohol or&#xD;
      cocaine use during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of children known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980's.The&#xD;
      reviews of epidemiology in estimating the global prevalence is that one to two cases of&#xD;
      autism exist per 2,000 people, and about six per 1,000 people have Autistic Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorders (ASD) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a guide&#xD;
      created by the American Psychiatric Association used to diagnose mental disorders, people&#xD;
      with Autism have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms that hurt the person's ability to function properly in school, work, and other&#xD;
           areas of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common and persevering nutritional disorder and continues to&#xD;
      be an important public health problem worldwide. Specifically in children in the first years&#xD;
      of life, hemoglobin (HGB) levels below 11 g/dL have been related to negative cognitive,&#xD;
      social, and emotional effects that may lead to irreversible behavioral squeals, even after&#xD;
      appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reduction of iron levels in the brain may be accompanied by changes in serotonergic and&#xD;
      dopaminergic systems, cortical networks, and myelination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency (ID) cause negative outcomes on psychomotor and behavioral development of&#xD;
      infants and young children. Children with autism are under risk for ID and this condition may&#xD;
      increase the severity of psychomotor and behavioral problems,The association between iron&#xD;
      deficiency and developmental problems such as global developmental delay is thought to be&#xD;
      bidirectional. Iron deficiency impairs the processes of neurotransmitter metabolism and&#xD;
      myelin formation, as well as altering energy metabolism in the brain - effects that have been&#xD;
      theorised to cause behavioural and cognitive developmental delays in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it can be considered that ID/IDA (iron deficiency anemia) may increase the severity of&#xD;
      autistic symptoms in children with ASD.&#xD;
