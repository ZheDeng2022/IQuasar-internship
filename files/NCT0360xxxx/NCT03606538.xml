  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single dose study evaluating the effect of moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment in the pharmacokinetics of MDMA and its active metabolite,&#xD;
      3,4-methylene-dioxyamphetamine (MDA) in order to decide whether an adjustment to the dosage&#xD;
      would be need for individuals with moderate hepatic function in comparison to individuals&#xD;
      with normal liver function. Eight participants with moderate hepatic impairment and eight&#xD;
      matched participants with normal hepatic function will take part in this study. All patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated to see if they meet criteria for study participation, with screening&#xD;
      including a physical examination including a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and questions&#xD;
      about mental and physical health. Participants who meet study criteria will stay at the study&#xD;
      site for three days. On Day 1, they will receive a single dose of 80 mg MDMA. For the next&#xD;
      seven to eight hours, participants will have blood collected and will rate their mood and&#xD;
      other experiences. They will stay at the study sight for two more days. Blood will be drawn&#xD;
      twice on the second day and once on the third day, and they will have their heart function&#xD;
      measured with ECG. Blood will be collected periodically during a 12-hour interval on the day&#xD;
      of drug administration. Blood will also be drawn 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours after MDMA&#xD;
      administration. Participant mood and feelings or experiences on-drug (subjective effects)&#xD;
      will be measured a half-hour, one, two, four, six, and seven hours after receiving MDMA. ECG&#xD;
      will be performed every day at the same time upon enrollment (Day -4 or -3) and from the Day&#xD;
      1 (day of drug administration) to Day 5. Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature on&#xD;
      Day 1 through 5. Blood samples will be used to compute the peak or maximum amount of MDMA and&#xD;
      MDA in blood (Cmax), the time until reaching peak MDMA or MDA (Tmax) and the area under curve&#xD;
      (AUC), or actual degree of exposure to drug. The primary outcome measure will be AUC for&#xD;
      MDMA. Finding out if there are differences in drug metabolism between people with normally&#xD;
      functioning livers and people whose livers do not function normally will help researchers&#xD;
      performing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life.&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a ring-substituted phenylisopropylamine&#xD;
      derivative that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. MDMA has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, enhance communication, and increase empathy,&#xD;
      creating productive psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process for the&#xD;
      treatment of PTSD and other anxiety disorders. This is supported by data from an&#xD;
      international series of Phase 2 pilot studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy conducted by the&#xD;
      sponsor that provide preliminary evidence that chronic PTSD, independent of cause, is&#xD;
      treatable with two to three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and associated non-drug&#xD;
      preparatory and integrative psychotherapy. The results from multiple independent studies in&#xD;
      Phase 2 efficacy analyses demonstrate superiority of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy over&#xD;
      psychotherapy with placebo and low dose MDMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is for a Phase 1, open-label study with a primary purpose of evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of moderate hepatic impairment in the pharmacokinetics of MDMA and its active&#xD;
      metabolite, 3,4-methylene-dioxyamphetamine (MDA), and determining whether an adjustment to&#xD;
      the dosage would be indicated in this group of patients in comparison to patients with normal&#xD;
      liver function. Because people with moderate hepatic impairment may experience greater&#xD;
      exposure to drug than people without it, the secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the safety and tolerability of oral MDMA, with&#xD;
      special attention to ECG data. The study will enroll eight participants, ages 18 to 65 years&#xD;
      old, with moderate hepatic impairment, and eight healthy controls with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function who are matched with participants with moderate impaired hepatic function on the&#xD;
      basis of age, weight and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who give their written informed consent will be screened for study participation&#xD;
      that will include a physical examination, assessing current and prior medical and physical&#xD;
      health, and a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) reading. If applicable, they may begin&#xD;
      tapering off any contraindicated psychiatric medication. Participants who meet study criteria&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of 80 mg MDMA on the first day of a three-day stay at the study&#xD;
      site. Blood will be collected periodically in order to calculate pharmacokinetics of MDMA and&#xD;
      its active metabolite methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). Blood will be collected ten times on&#xD;
      Day 1 (-5 min, 0 hours (drug administration), 0.5 h, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 12 hours),&#xD;
      starting five minutes before drug administration. Subjective effects of MDMA will be assessed&#xD;
      through 15 visual analog scales at similar time points to blood collection, at 0.5, 1, 2, 4,&#xD;
      6 and 7 hours post-drug. There will be six 12-lead ECG measurements on Day 1. Participants&#xD;
      will remain at the study site for two more days. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature after MDMA administrations, collecting&#xD;
      adverse events throughout the study and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the&#xD;
      Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Blood will be collected 24 and 36 hours&#xD;
      after drug administration, and ECG will be performed on Day 2, and a single ECG and blood&#xD;
      draw will occur on Day 3, 4 and 5. Participants will return for eight and 15 days after drug&#xD;
      administration. They will have a single blood draw on each day. The study ends 15 days after&#xD;
      drug administration, approximately one month after screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be area under the curve from dosing to last dose (AUC) of&#xD;
      MDMA and MDA. AUC will be computed from plasma collected multiple times after a single dose&#xD;
      of MDMA, twice on the day following the day of drug administration, and once daily for three&#xD;
      more days. Other pharmacokinetic measures will be maximal values of MDMA and MDA (Cmax), and&#xD;
      time to reach maximum MDMA and MDA levels (Tmax). Safety measures will also include a&#xD;
      comparison of subjective effects across groups, ECG readings, number of adverse events, and&#xD;
      suicidal ideation or behavior as measured via C-SSRS during the study.&#xD;
