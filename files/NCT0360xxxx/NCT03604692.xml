    <description>SNDX-6352 is a high affinity antibody targeting the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). CSF-1R signaling has been demonstrated in nonclinical studies to be the key regulatory pathway involved in the expansion and infiltration of donor derived macrophages that mediate the disease processes involved in cGVHD.</description>
