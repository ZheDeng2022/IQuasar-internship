  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to include mother-infant couplets admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit(NICU) at Brookdale Hospital for clinical reasons during one year period 1/2018-1/2019.&#xD;
      Participants whose infants have health conditions that will not allow breastfeeding, not able&#xD;
      to read or understand English and/or participants refusing to provide phone numbers, an email&#xD;
      address or mail address for future communication will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an informed consent, participants will be allocated to one of the four study&#xD;
      groups by randomization and participants will receive either no education or one of the&#xD;
      verbal/written/video education at two different time points: within 4 days and at 2 weeks&#xD;
      from the time of birth of the infant. Participants whose infants are in NICU and are feeding&#xD;
      expressed breastmilk will be instructed to bring all the expressed breastmilk to NICU and to&#xD;
      keep records of the date, time and the amount of expressed breastmilk in the log book&#xD;
      maintained at the bedside of the infant. Participants who are directly feeding the infant on&#xD;
      breast will be contacted by third personnel who is blind to which study group the participant&#xD;
      belongs to qualitatively evaluate breast feeding in terms of frequency, duration, exclusive&#xD;
      breast feeding at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks from the time of birth. Participants will be&#xD;
      requested not to reveal the study team about the mode of teaching method she has received&#xD;
      when she is contacted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks for the evaluation of the breast&#xD;
      feeding. Investigators will also go through the medical records of participants and their&#xD;
      infants to collect some demographic data and clinical characteristics pertinent for the study&#xD;
      such as age, parity, weight of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigators plan to compare the breast-feeding outcome quantitatively among&#xD;
      participants who are feeding expressed breast milk and qualitatively as duration/exclusive&#xD;
      breast-feeding among participants who are feeding directly on breast following three&#xD;
      different teaching interventions: written or verbal or video and find out the most effective&#xD;
      method of teaching intervention&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the breast-feeding outcome following three different&#xD;
      teaching interventions: written or verbal/direct or visual/videos among participants whose&#xD;
      infants are admitted in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Brookdale Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breast-feeding outcome among participants who are feeding expressed breast milk will be&#xD;
           measured quantitatively as amount of milk production per day on an average during NICU&#xD;
           stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Breast-feeding outcome among participants who are directly feeding the infants at breast&#xD;
           will be measured qualitatively in terms of frequency, duration, exclusive breast feeding&#xD;
           at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks of infant's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Investigators are including participants whose infants are admitted to&#xD;
      the Brookdale NICU This also include very preterm [&lt;32 weeks] infants, the period when&#xD;
      breastfeeding incidence has been lesser compared to participants who give birth at later&#xD;
      gestation and those who don't require admission to NICU. By including participants who give&#xD;
      birth &lt;32 weeks and newborns admitted to NICU, investigators will be able to document the&#xD;
      quantity of breast milk production by logging the milk brought to our NICU storage freezer by&#xD;
      participants and effectively measure the outcome objectively of the three different&#xD;
      interventions [written, verbal and visual methods].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have found that breast feeding is lower among African American population.&#xD;
      Since most of population at Brookdale hospital is African American, this study will also give&#xD;
      an opportunity to find the result of education intervention among this population&#xD;
      Investigators propose that this study will be useful to find the most effective mode to&#xD;
      educate participants whose neonates admitted to NICU about breast-feeding and may enhance the&#xD;
      culture of breastmilk feeding in this population and therefore increase breast feeding among&#xD;
      newborns admitted to the NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY This is a prospective randomized study on breast-feeding teaching intervention on&#xD;
      participants who give birth to newborns that are admitted to NICU at Brookdale Hospital&#xD;
      during one-year period 1/2018-1/2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who deliver at Brookdale hospital receive regular breast-feeding education&#xD;
      on benefit of exclusive breastfeeding, latching, pumping provided by the nurses or physicians&#xD;
      during postpartum period while they are admitted in the hospital. The participants also&#xD;
      receive education on breastfeeding through public health assistant/volunteer through New York&#xD;
      City (NYC) Family and Child Health Bureau of Maternal Infant and Reproductive Health either&#xD;
      at the hospital and or during home visit following discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any education provided as a part of research is the additional education participant will&#xD;
      receive on top of the regular education all participants receive irrespective of their&#xD;
      participation and the group they belong to in the study. Participant decision to participate&#xD;
      or not in the study will not affect the regular health care and education participant or&#xD;
      participant's infant will receive in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to obtain at-least 25 participants per group for a total sample size&#xD;
      of 100 participants and 100 participants' infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once investigators identify the participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria, one of the&#xD;
      two trained investigators will take an informed consent that include permission to contact&#xD;
      participants over the phone or by email/mail at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks for providing&#xD;
      the appropriate method of teaching intervention and/ or measurement of breast feeding&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by picking up one of the random numbers representing each group&#xD;
      such as 1 for Group 1, 2 for Group 2, 3 for Group 3 and 4 for Group 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Participants in this group will not receive additional teaching interventions&#xD;
      included in the research. Participants will be contacted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum to evaluate amount, duration, exclusive breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Participants in this group will receive the written breast-feeding education in the&#xD;
      form of booklet (included with this protocol). Booklet will be distributed 2 times: 1st time&#xD;
      in the hospital within 4 days of birth of the infant before the participant is discharged and&#xD;
      at 2 weeks from the time of birth of the infant utilizing the time when participant visits to&#xD;
      the NICU. If the participant is not able to visit NICU or the infant is discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital before 2 weeks from the time of birth, booklet will be provided to the participant&#xD;
      by post or as an attachment in an email. Participants will be contacted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 6 weeks postpartum to evaluate amount, duration, exclusive breast feeding Group 3:&#xD;
      Participants in this group will receive breast-feeding education verbally (please find the&#xD;
      content of verbal education in following page). Verbal education will be provided 2 times:&#xD;
      1st time in the hospital within 4 days of birth of the infant before the participant is&#xD;
      discharged. Subsequent breast-feeding trouble shooting verbal education will be provided at 2&#xD;
      weeks from the time of birth of the infant utilizing the time when participant visits to the&#xD;
      NICU. If the participant is not able to visit NICU or the infant is discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital before 2 weeks from the time of birth, verbal education will be provided to the&#xD;
      participant over the phone. Participants will be contacted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum to evaluate amount, duration, exclusive breast feeding Group 4: Participants in&#xD;
      this group will receive breast-feeding education through the video format. (links for the&#xD;
      video is provided in the following page). Video education will be provided 2 times: 1st time&#xD;
      in the hospital within 4 days of birth of the infant before the participant is discharged.&#xD;
      Subsequent breast-feeding video education will be provided at 2 weeks from the time of birth&#xD;
      of the infant by sending a link for the video in participant's email. Participants will be&#xD;
      contacted at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum to evaluate amount, duration, exclusive&#xD;
      breast feeding All three forms of education will include similar information that include&#xD;
      advantages of breast-feeding, optimization of pumping using hand pump or electric pump,&#xD;
      storage of milk and such other troubleshooting during breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written education method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written education will be provided in the form of booklet. Investigators have received 100&#xD;
      booklets 'your guide to breastfeeding' from The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#xD;
      Office on Women's Health (OWH) for free. Investigators will provide the booklet to the&#xD;
      participants that belong to group 2 as written education within 4 days of the birth of the&#xD;
      infant and at 2 weeks from the time of birth of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This standard booklet can be found free at the government website below:&#xD;
      https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/documents/your-guide-to-breastfeeding.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal education method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal education will be provided by one of the two investigators who will use the checklist&#xD;
      to provide the information. Both investigators have successfully completed online &quot;Supporting&#xD;
      and Promoting Breastfeeding in Health Care Settings modules' from School of Public Health,&#xD;
      University of Albany, State University of New York. Both investigators will be trained by a&#xD;
      neonatologist so that the verbal education method provided by two different investigators is&#xD;
      similar. The checklist in verbal education is derived from the above standard booklet so that&#xD;
      the information provided is same as the booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video education method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is standard you-tube video link for free at the following government website:&#xD;
&#xD;
      https://www.womenshealth.gov/printables-and-shareables/resource/videos Participants will be&#xD;
      provided you-tube video links included in the following table within 4 days and at 2 weeks&#xD;
      from the time of birth of the infant.&#xD;
