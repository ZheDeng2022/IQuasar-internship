      Overall Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre open label, non-randomized, non-placebo phase 1 clinical trial to&#xD;
      establish the safety and tolerability compound 451238 in combination with radiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STS). STS patients receiving radiotherapy to a tumour&#xD;
      deposit above the diaphragm in the thorax, trunk or extremity, will receive radiotherapy.&#xD;
      This study will recruit 12 patients and run as a fixed dose trial. Patients will continue on&#xD;
      the treatment regimen unless they progress, suffer unacceptable toxicities, or withdraw from&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 12 patients will be recruited. The safety and tolerabilty will be assessed in&#xD;
      the first 3+3 patients with expansion to 12 patients as tolerated. A minimum gap of 2 weeks&#xD;
      will be left between treatment of the first and second patient (with the combination of RT)&#xD;
      to mitigate against multiple patients suffering acute toxicity. Patients will be followed for&#xD;
      a minimum of 11 weeks from the initiation of radiotherapy with combined compound 451238 for&#xD;
      the purposes of acute toxicity monitoring. Late toxicity monitoring will commence from 11&#xD;
      weeks + one day from initiation of radiotherapy with combined compound 451238 and continue&#xD;
      until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up - 30 Days&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be required to attend a safety follow-up visit 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of compound 451238 or before the initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment, whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended Safety Follow-up - 90 Days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential risk for delayed toxicities, an extended safety follow-up visit must be&#xD;
      performed up to 90 days after the last dose of compound 451238 administration. The extended&#xD;
      safety follow-up will be performed either via a site visit or via a telephone call with&#xD;
      subsequent site visit requested in case any concerns noted during the telephone call. All AEs&#xD;
      and SAEs that occur prior to the safety follow-up visit should be reported as described in&#xD;
      the trial protocol. After the safety follow-up any unresolved AEs at the patient's last visit&#xD;
      should be followed up for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in&#xD;
      the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue trial treatment for any reason other than disease progression will&#xD;
      move into the follow-up phase and will be assessed every 12 weeks by MRI or radiologic&#xD;
      imaging to monitor disease status. Every effort will be made to collect information regarding&#xD;
      disease status until the start of new anti-cancer therapy, disease progression, death,&#xD;
      withdrawal or end of the study. Information regarding post-study anticancer treatment will be&#xD;
      collected if new treatment is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient experiences confirmed PD or starts a new anti-cancer therapy, the patient&#xD;
      moves into the survival follow-up phase and will be followed up every 12 weeks to determine&#xD;
      their disease status. This will be done by reviewing their medical notes and/or contacting&#xD;
      the patient and/or General Practitioner directly. Patients will remain on this follow-up&#xD;
      until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
