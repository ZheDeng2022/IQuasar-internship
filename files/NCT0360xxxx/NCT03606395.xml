    <textblock>
      Randomized, two-part, placebo-controlled study of single ascending doses of NV-5138 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, and a single dose of NV-5138 in subjects with Treatment-Resistant&#xD;
      Depression (TRD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending&#xD;
      dosage levels of NV-5138 in healthy volunteers and a single dose of NV-5138 in subjects with&#xD;
      TRD. The study includes an up to 28-day screening period, an in-house period during which&#xD;
      NV-5138 or placebo will be administered, and a 3- to 7-day follow-up period after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A of the study (single-ascending-dose [SAD] portion in healthy volunteers), up to&#xD;
      approximately 48 healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment.&#xD;
      Eight (8) subjects will be randomized in each of six dosage-level cohorts (150, 300, 600,&#xD;
      1000, 1600, or 2400 mg NV-5138, or placebo, administered as an oral solution). Within each&#xD;
      cohort, six subjects will be randomized to receive NV-5138 and two subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive placebo. Each subject will receive only one dose of either NV-5138 or&#xD;
      placebo on Day 1. Within each cohort, initially one subject will receive NV-5138 and one&#xD;
      subject will receive placebo. Provided no clinically significant safety issues are noted in&#xD;
      the 24 hours after dosing the initial two subjects in the cohort, the six subjects remaining&#xD;
      in the cohort may be dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B of the study (single-dose portion in subjects with TRD), up to approximately 40&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment in one cohort. The dosage level&#xD;
      for this cohort will be determined based on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data from Part A of the study. However, in no case will the dose in Part B of the study&#xD;
      exceed the highest dose administered in Part A of the study. Within this cohort, after&#xD;
      potential eligibility has been confirmed by a site-independent review process, twenty (20)&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive NV-5138 and twenty (20) subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive placebo.&#xD;

    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts and suicidal thoughts.</description>
