      Open label, single arm, dose-escalation phase I study in ambulatory patients receiving first&#xD;
      line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. The treatment comprises of the standard 6&#xD;
      cycles of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m² IV at D1, D8 and D15 of a 28 day cycle) and two EOC202&#xD;
      doses (6 and 30 mg SC at D2 and D16 of a 28 day cycle) for 6 cycles. After completion of the&#xD;
      combined therapy, the patients can continue to receive up to 6 cycles of EOC202 maintenance&#xD;
      monotherapy (once every cycle on day 1 of each cycle).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, single arm, dose-escalation phase I study, performed in&#xD;
      ambulatory setting with patients receiving first line chemotherapy for metastatic breast&#xD;
      carcinoma. The standard 6 cycles of paclitaxel (80 mg/m² at D1, D8 and D15 of every 4-week&#xD;
      cycle) will be given to subjects. Twenty mg i.v. dexamethasone will be given in the first&#xD;
      cycle before each paclitaxel infusion. Corticosteroids will not be administered after the&#xD;
      first chemotherapy cycle if the first 3 i.v. infusions of paclitaxel have been well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two EOC202 dose levels, 6 mg and 30 mg will be given to subjects during the cycle and be&#xD;
      evaluated in successive cohorts of patients. For each dose level, 3 patients will be&#xD;
      administered one subcutaneous dose every 2 weeks for a total of 24 weeks (12 injections in&#xD;
      total), separated by 13-day administration-free intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30 mg dose will be dosed to 3 new patients if the 6 mg dose has been deemed safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A - 3 patients at the 6 mg dose - will receive EOC202 administration in seriatim&#xD;
      separated by four-week intervals for DLT observation. If safety/tolerability are acceptable&#xD;
      at the end of the DLT observation periods, the study will proceed to the next dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B - 3 patients at the 30 mg dose - will receive EOC202 administration in seriatim&#xD;
      separated by four-week intervals for DLT observation. If safety/tolerability are acceptable&#xD;
      at the end of the 4-week observation periods, the study will proceed to the next phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C will comprise of additional 6 patients as the PK dose expansion group based on the&#xD;
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE). The study procedure is the same with the corresponding&#xD;
      dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will participate in a pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study which&#xD;
      involves additional blood samples.&#xD;
