      Methodolgy&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preoperative visit, the techniques will be explained to patients including&#xD;
      benefits and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Pre-operative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Medical history:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical disorders as hypertension, diabetes, heart, chest, liver or kidney diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Past history of operations, hospitalization or blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Past anesthetic history with impact on previous airway problems during previous&#xD;
           surgeries, hypersensitivity to anesthetic medications, any previous post-operative&#xD;
           complications that could be attributed to anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Family history for specific anesthetic problems like malignant hyperthermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General examination, &amp; vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and&#xD;
           temperature) in bed the night before operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart, chest and abdominal examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Anesthetic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examination of the limbs for prediction of difficult cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Airway assessment including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Thyromental distance&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Mallampatti score&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Neck and tempro-mandibular joint mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Assessing the absence of deformities in the mandible, face, tongue, palate, teeth&#xD;
                and neck that may interfere with airway management&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Laboratory investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prothrombin time and partial tissue thromboplastic time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kidney function test (s, creatinine &amp; urea), Liver function test (ALT, AST, albumin and&#xD;
           bilirubin) &amp; Random blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum Cortisol and IL6 level before starting drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2) Demographic data: The patient's age, sex, ASA status, and duration of surgery will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3) Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients will be fasting for 6 - 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All patients will receive oral midazolam (7.5 mg), and oral ranitidine (150mg)&#xD;
                administered 90 min before arrival in the operating room with a sip of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All patients will receive a pre-induction normal saline 10 ml/kg body weight over&#xD;
                10-15 minutes. Subsequently, intravenous fluid administration will be done&#xD;
                according to the need of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. All operations will start between 08.30 am and 09.30 am, to minimize variations in&#xD;
                cortisol level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. All patients will receive the drug of study 10 min before induction of anesthesia&#xD;
                till the start of wound closure in the form of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Group (D) Dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg over 10 min followed by 0.4 mcg/kg/hr. till the&#xD;
                end of wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Group (L) Lidocaine prepared in a syringe with the same volume of Dexmedetomidine&#xD;
                to assure blinding given as 1mg/kg over 10 min followed by 1mg/kg/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Doses will be calculated, diluted in 50 ml of normal saline and given intravenously&#xD;
                by a syringe pump over 10 minutes initially and then over 1hr till the start of&#xD;
                wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. All drugs of the study will be prepared by an independent anesthesiologist who will&#xD;
                not share in the study and then selected and given by another one blinded for the&#xD;
                content of each syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Airway devices, anesthesia machine, ventilator, flowmeters and monitors will be&#xD;
                checked promptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Another wide-bore I.V cannula will be inserted in case of blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
            10. Monitoring equipment's (Datex-Ohmeda™) will be attached to the patient including&#xD;
                3-leads ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetery and capnograph&#xD;
                after tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
            11. The depth of anesthesia will be monitored with Entropy device. The Entropy&#xD;
                electrodes will be placed on the forehead and on the lateral angle of orbit and&#xD;
                connected to (Datex-Ohmeda™) by a special. The target Entropy range will be 40-60&#xD;
                for surgical anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
            12. Induction of anesthesia will be performed by Propofol 2 mg/kg followed by&#xD;
                cis-atracurium 0.15 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mcg/kg given intravenously after&#xD;
                pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen for at least 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
            13. Patients will be manually ventilated with 100% oxygen till intubation after 2 min&#xD;
                and with Entropy value of 60 to 40 by Macintosh laryngoscope and appropriate size&#xD;
                endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
            14. Maintenance of anesthesia will be carried out by isoflurane varying its end tidal&#xD;
                concentration to keep Entropy in the range of 55 to 40 with Air:Oxygen mixture 0.3&#xD;
                fraction of oxygen and flow rate of 2 liter in completely closed circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
            15. Cis-atracurium 0.03 mg/kg guided by neuromuscular monitor Train of Four (TOF) will&#xD;
                be used for muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
            16. Hemodynamics (mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate) will be maintained&#xD;
                within 25 % of baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
            17. Any increase of MAP or HR more than 25% of baseline measures on two consecutive&#xD;
                readings within 2-3 min will be managed by I.V bolus of fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg and any&#xD;
                decrease of MAP or HR less than 25 % on two consecutive readings within 2-3 min&#xD;
                will be managed by I.V bolus of ephedrine 5 mg or atropine 0.5 mg respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
            18. The infusion of study medication will be discontinued if the hypotension persisted&#xD;
                &gt; 5 min after these interventions upon return of the MAP or HR to within 25% of the&#xD;
                baseline value, the study medication infusion will be resumed at 50% of the initial&#xD;
                infusion rate and then gradually increased to the initial infusion rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
            19. The infusion of study medication will be discontinued at the start of wound&#xD;
                closure. Upon completion of wound closure, isoflurane will be discontinued and the&#xD;
                inspired oxygen flow rate will be increased to 5 L/min and residual neuromuscular&#xD;
                block will be reversed with neostigmine, 0.05 mg/kg IV, and atropine 0.25 mg/kg,&#xD;
                IV. The trachea will be extubated when the patient is fully awake. Transfer to the&#xD;
                recovery room will be done when the patient scored 7 and above using the modified&#xD;
                Aldrete scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
            20. On emergence from anesthesia and immediately in post anesthesia care unit,&#xD;
                analgesic regimen, consisting of intravenous patient-controlled morphine analgesia&#xD;
                (bolus 1mg, 10-min lockout, maximum dose 5 mg / h), will be used in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
            21. The whole technique and anesthetic procedures will be performed by the same&#xD;
                anesthesiologist to avoid as much as possible the inter-individual skill&#xD;
                variations.&#xD;
