  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brain networks controlling movement are complex, involving multiple areas of the brain.&#xD;
      Some neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease, cause abnormalities in the brain&#xD;
      networks. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment that is used to treat these types of&#xD;
      neurological diseases. Through this research, the investigators will take advantage of the&#xD;
      unique opportunity provided by awake deep brain stimulation surgery to learn more about how&#xD;
      the brain functions in a diseased state and how deep brain stimulation changes these&#xD;
      networks. This study aims to enroll up to 75 subjects over a period of 2.5 years. Those who&#xD;
      participate in the study will spend up to 40 minutes during their deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      surgery during which researchers will record signals from deep structures within the brain as&#xD;
      well as the surface of the brain using electrodes that are temporarily placed for research&#xD;
      purposes. During the study, researchers will record signals while subjects perform three&#xD;
      different tasks, in some cases while the brain is stimulated. Study participation is limited&#xD;
      to the intraoperative environment with no additional study visits required.&#xD;
