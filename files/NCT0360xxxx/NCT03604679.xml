  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study of SyB C-0501 by continuous daily&#xD;
      oral administration in patients with advanced solid tumors, who have previously received&#xD;
      anticancer therapy and consists of two parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation study to evaluate&#xD;
      tolerability of SyB C-0501 in the patients, and to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      recommended dose (RD) and optimum dosing schedule. Part 2 is being done to evaluate safety&#xD;
      and anti-tumor activity of SyB C-0501 preliminarily at RD, and to assess its target cancer&#xD;
      exploratory.&#xD;

    <description>Based on the number of patients with DLT and administration dose in each cohort, recommended dosage will be defined for the following clinical phase. A DLT is defined as an adverse event that occurred during the Cycle 1, for which a causality with the investigational products (IP) cannot be ruled out and meets the DLT criteria of this study.</description>
