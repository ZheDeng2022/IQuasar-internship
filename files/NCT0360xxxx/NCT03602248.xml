  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soccer is an intermittent sport in which the aerobic and anaerobic capacity of the players&#xD;
      are both very important. Elite football players perform an average of 150-250 short and&#xD;
      intense movements during a match, demonstrating the significant contribution of the anaerobic&#xD;
      energy system. Speed endurance training consists a tool to enhance the performance of aerobic&#xD;
      and anaerobic system. This training includes actions such as sprinting, changes of direction,&#xD;
      accelerations, decelerations, jumps and shooting, characterized by a strong eccentric&#xD;
      component. Eccentric actions are associated with exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, to date, EIMD responses following a session of speed endurance training have&#xD;
      not yet been investigated. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine the EIMD&#xD;
      responses and changes on performance and neuromuscular fatigue indices after two different&#xD;
      speed endurance training protocols.&#xD;

      Football is a team sport in which mean and maximum heart rate ranges from 85 to 98% of the&#xD;
      maximum heart rate during a competitive match. Elite football players perform an average of&#xD;
      150-250 short and intense movements during a match while blood lactate values range from 2 to&#xD;
      14 mmol/L demonstrating that the anaerobic energy system contributes significantly during the&#xD;
      game. Acceleration and deceleration ability as well as ability to perform repeated sprints&#xD;
      and changes of direction greatly determine performance in soccer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soccer players' ability to perform repetitive high intensity sprints over a long period of&#xD;
      time can be improved by speed endurance training. Speed endurance training consists of&#xD;
      repetitive intense exercise bouts at a higher intensity than maximum aerobic speed (MAS)&#xD;
      lasting from 10 to 40 seconds and has been proven to be an important tool for improving&#xD;
      performance in trained soccer players. Improved performance is attributed to the muscle's&#xD;
      increased regulatory capacity regarding intense exercise, enhanced recovery of the energy&#xD;
      stores, increased activity and number of muscle enzymes and accelerated by-products removal,&#xD;
      thereby contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis and delay of fatigue occurrence during&#xD;
      intense exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speed endurance training includes repeated high intensity actions such as sprinting, changes&#xD;
      of direction, accelerations, decelerations, jumps and shooting. However, these movements have&#xD;
      a strong eccentric component which has been associated with exercise induced muscle damage&#xD;
      (EIMD) and inflammation. EIMD increases plasma creatine kinase (CK) levels and the delayed&#xD;
      onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) and reduces power production capacity. CK increases after a&#xD;
      soccer match, peaks at 48 hours and returns to rest values 5-7 days after the match. DOMS&#xD;
      increases immediately after a soccer match, peaks at 24-72 hours and is normalized ~5 days&#xD;
      post match. The reduction in power production capacity is observed immediately after the&#xD;
      match and remains reduced for ~72 hours with the largest decrease observed at 48 hours&#xD;
      post-match. Nevertheless, to date, EIMD responses following a session of speed endurance&#xD;
      training have not yet been investigated. Therefore, the aim of the proposed study is to&#xD;
      examine the EIMD responses and changes on performance and neuromuscular fatigue indices after&#xD;
      two speed endurance training protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preliminary power analysis (effect size &gt;0.55, probability error of 0.05, power of 0.90)&#xD;
      revealed that a total sample of 8-10 soccer players required to detect statistically&#xD;
      meaningful differences after a speed endurance training protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, three-trial (speed endurance protocol A vs. speed endurance protocol B vs.&#xD;
      control), cross-over, repeated measures design will be implemented. The study will be&#xD;
      performed one week after the end of the in-season to minimize the detraining effect. Prior to&#xD;
      the first trial participants will have their body mass, height, body composition and&#xD;
      performance measured and will be familiarized with all the testing procedures. Each&#xD;
      experimental trial (speed endurance training protocol A and B) will include a speed endurance&#xD;
      training session on Monday. The second trial (between training trials) will serve as control,&#xD;
      where only performance measurements and blood sampling will be performed. Performance&#xD;
      assessment and blood sampling will be performed immediately after each speed endurance&#xD;
      training session and daily for three days post training session. Each training session will&#xD;
      be performed on natural grass surface under the same environmental conditions (i.e.&#xD;
      temperature and humidity). A 5-day recovery period will be used between trials. During the&#xD;
      training sessions, participants will consume only water ad libitum. Field activity during&#xD;
      training sessions will be recorded using high time-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS)&#xD;
      instrumentation and heart rate monitoring. Before each training session, a standard breakfast&#xD;
      and meal will be consumed by all players as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Speed endurance training protocols Speed endurance training protocol A will consist of 1 set&#xD;
      of 8 repetitions interspersed by 2,5 minutes of recovery with a work to rest ratio of 1:5&#xD;
      (25-30 seconds all out work) whereas speed endurance training protocol B will consist of 1&#xD;
      set of 8 repetitions interspersed by 4 minutes of recovery with a work to rest ratio of 1:8&#xD;
      (25-30 seconds all out work). Both training protocols will include the same exercise (drill),&#xD;
      consisting of multiple linear sprints, changes of direction, ball contacts, passes, and&#xD;
      shooting. Prior to the training sessions, a 15-min standard warm-up (free running, active&#xD;
      stretching, ball contacts and sprints) will be performed.&#xD;
