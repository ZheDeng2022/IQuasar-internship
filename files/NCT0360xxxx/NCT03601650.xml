  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the effect of focussing on the sensory properties of food whilst&#xD;
      eating. It will look at effects on calorie intake and diet over a 3-day period among women of&#xD;
      a healthy weight. Participants asked to focus on the sensory properties of their food will be&#xD;
      compared with a second group of participants who will be asked to eat their food without&#xD;
      distractions and a third group who will not be provided with any strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted as a between subject design over a period of three days&#xD;
      (Tuesday-Thursday). Upon arrival at the laboratory (on a Monday), participants will be&#xD;
      provided with more information about the study and will complete a demographics&#xD;
      questionnaire. A smartphone app will be downloaded onto the participant's phone and the&#xD;
      participant will be provided with login details to access the food diary Intake24.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete the food diary every night over a period of three&#xD;
      days. The diary will ask participants to record what they consumed for breakfast, lunch,&#xD;
      dinner, as well as snack on a daily basis. All participants will receive a reminder&#xD;
      notification on their phone each evening during the 3-day period to complete the Intake 24&#xD;
      food diary. They will also be asked to rate how well they think they remembered the food they&#xD;
      had eaten that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3-day period, some participants will also be asked to open reminders in sealed&#xD;
      envelopes at particular times of the day. The app will additionally include a recording that&#xD;
      participants will be able to listen to at their own convenience, as many times as they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of the reminders and recording will differ between participants depending on the&#xD;
      condition they are allocated to. There will be three conditions: intervention, no distraction&#xD;
      control, and no strategy control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention condition, participants will open reminders related to focusing on the&#xD;
      sensory properties of their food while eating their meals. These participants will also have&#xD;
      access to a recording that will encourage them to focus on the sensory properties of the food&#xD;
      (e.g. its smell, look, texture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the no distraction control condition will open reminders related to eating&#xD;
      their meals with no distractions. The recording provided to participants in this condition&#xD;
      will encourage them to consume their meals with no surrounding distractions (e.g. to avoid&#xD;
      watching television or listening to the radio). During the study, the number of times the&#xD;
      recording is played as well as the date and time it is played will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention and no distraction control group, at the end of each of the three days&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to rate the extent to which they adhered to the strategy they&#xD;
      were provided with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the no strategy control condition, participants will not receive any reminders to open or&#xD;
      have access to a recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the three days (i.e. on a Friday), participants will return to the laboratory. They&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the usability of the mobile app and the&#xD;
      online food diary. Via this questionnaire, they will also be asked about whether they thought&#xD;
      taking part in the study influenced their eating behaviour and the amount of pleasure they&#xD;
      got from their food during the three-day period. Additionally they will complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire measuring sensitivity to reward. At this session participants will be asked if&#xD;
      they are happy to have their weight and height measured. If they are, the researcher will&#xD;
      measure their weight and height.&#xD;
