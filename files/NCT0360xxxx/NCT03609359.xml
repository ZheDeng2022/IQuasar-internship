      The efficacy and safety of the use of pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, if combination therapy with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      gastric cancer is judged to be effective, a prospective treatment regimen can be expected for&#xD;
      a larger number of participating subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated disadvantages include any adverse events associated with lenvatinib and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. To minimize the risk and disadvantages of adverse events, the data center&#xD;
      together with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will monitor any adverse events in the&#xD;
      present trial to determine whether or not they are within the expected range. These bodies&#xD;
      will also conduct a thorough examination in the event that serious or unexpected adverse&#xD;
      events occur, and adopt an appropriate system to take any necessary actions.&#xD;
