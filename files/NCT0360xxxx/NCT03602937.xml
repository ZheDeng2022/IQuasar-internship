  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of Renastep is a 28-day long, prospective nutritional study that will recruit 15&#xD;
      patients aged between 3 and 18 years of age with Chronic Kidney Disease. Participants will&#xD;
      incorporate Renastep into their renal specific diet, during which time they will record&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, adherence to recommended intakes and thoughts on its palatability.&#xD;
      A Baseline CRF completed by the Investigator at the start of the trial will record&#xD;
      demographic information, GI history and the most recent renal bio-marker results. Bio-marker&#xD;
      results recorded as part of routine care over the course of the study will be captured in the&#xD;
      End of Study CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to generate acceptability data that will be used to support an&#xD;
      application to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances for Renastep to be&#xD;
      reimbursable on prescription within the NHS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renastep is designed for use in the dietary management of kidney disease between 3 and 18&#xD;
      years of age. It is a high-energy liquid feed containing protein, carbohydrate, fat,&#xD;
      vitamins, minerals, trace elements and DHA. It contains low levels of potassium, phosphorus,&#xD;
      calcium, chloride and vitamin A compared with a standard paediatric enteral feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitaflo (International) Ltd has developed Renastep following a request from the Paediatric&#xD;
      Renal Interest Nutrition Group (PRING). They requested a low potassium and phosphate, high&#xD;
      energy liquid feed for the dietary management of children with kidney disease that can be&#xD;
      used as a sip feed or as a part of a modular tube feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no product designed specifically for use in this age group. Current&#xD;
      dietetic practice involves either prescribing a powdered infant formula, in variable&#xD;
      concentrations, or manipulating an adult renal sip feed to construct a modular feed, meeting&#xD;
      the particular individual requirements of a paediatric patient with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
      This can be time consuming, complicated, can frequently involve preparation error leading to&#xD;
      over or underconcentration of key nutrients, and increases the risk of microbial&#xD;
      contamination. As Renastep is a ready to use product designed specifically for children with&#xD;
      kidney disease, it can be expected that it will be more easily incorporated into the dietary&#xD;
      management of the patient than the current options available. This has also been requested by&#xD;
      the children and their families. Renastep could replace unsafe current practices that are the&#xD;
      only option available to clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for Renastep to be prescribed within the NHS, it must first be subject to an&#xD;
      application to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS). The ACBS require data&#xD;
      on the product's acceptability, in terms of gastrointestinal tolerance, palatability and&#xD;
      participants' adherence to recommended intakes. The ACBS require such acceptability studies&#xD;
      to be conducted in at least 15 patients for whom the product is designed. This stipulation is&#xD;
      the reason for conducting the trial within patients aged 3 - 18 years of age with Chronic&#xD;
      Kidney Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for 28 days. Participants will self-report study data in Daily Diary&#xD;
      forms that include 7 days of gastrointestinal data, daily records of how much of the product&#xD;
      has been taken compared to the amount prescribed and a final evaluation of the product's&#xD;
      palatability. The investigator will complete a Baseline CRF at the first visit to record&#xD;
      demographic information, GI history and the most recent urea, phosphorus and potassium&#xD;
      results. This will be supplemented by an End of Study CRF which will record urea, phosphorus&#xD;
      and potassium results recorded during the trial period as part of usual clinical care.&#xD;
      Information relating to gastrointestinal tolerance of Renastep over the 28-day study period&#xD;
      will also be recorded by the Investigator in the End of Study CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be anonymised and reviewed by the local investigator prior to it being&#xD;
      forwarded to the sponsor, Vitaflo (International) Ltd.&#xD;
