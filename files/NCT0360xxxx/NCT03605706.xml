  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 plus FOLFOX4 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced HCC who have never received prior systemic treatment compared to&#xD;
      placebo plus FOLFOX4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hyposis is that Camrelizumab combined with FOLFOX4 treatment can improve&#xD;
      Overall Survival when compared with placebo in combination with FOLFOX4 Regimen.&#xD;
