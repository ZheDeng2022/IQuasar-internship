  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to develop Magnetic Resonance Elastography by&#xD;
      Intrinsic Activation (MRE-IA) imaging methods at two imaging centers (CRCHUS and CRCHUM) for&#xD;
      use in ongoing studies in liver disease and neurovascular imaging. MRE is a developing MR&#xD;
      imaging modality that provides detailed maps of tissue's mechanical properties, based on&#xD;
      displacement measurements made during the propagation of low amplitude vibrations through the&#xD;
      region of interest. MRE-IA uses the pressure pulses of the cardiac cycle to induce the&#xD;
      vibrations needed for MRE image reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRE-IA has already been demonstrated based on the use of existing, clinically approved MR&#xD;
      imaging sequences, and once this capability has been established at the two centers, initial&#xD;
      trials will be done to demonstrate the method's potential in liver and neurovascular imaging.&#xD;
      In the case of the liver, this pilot project funding will be used to perform MRE-IA imaging&#xD;
      in patients with chronic liver disease and focal liver lesions. Results will be analyzed to&#xD;
      establish the relationship between the mechanical properties mentioned above and disease&#xD;
      stage. In the neurovascular case, imaging will be conducted under basic visual and motor&#xD;
      stimulus conditions in healthy subjects, and results compared non-stimulus control images to&#xD;
      determine changes in the above properties based on brain function. In addition, MRE-IA images&#xD;
      will be compared with BOLD imaging to investigate the role of fluid conductivity in fMRI&#xD;
      results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unlike current MRE methods which require the application of cyclical mechanical excitations&#xD;
      with an external driver, MRE-IA is a recently developed MRE modality that uses the naturally&#xD;
      occurring cardiac pressure cycle to generate the displacements used for elastic property&#xD;
      reconstruction. With no external activation, MRE-IA provides a simple pathway towards in-vivo&#xD;
      elastography results that avoids the discomfort, poor coupling, and high attenuation often&#xD;
      observed in MRE extrinsic vibration drivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: The principal goal of this project is to establish Magnetic Resonance Elastography by&#xD;
      Intrinsic Activation (MRE-IA) imaging methods at the imaging centers of the Centre de&#xD;
      recherche du centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke (CRCHUS) and the Centre de&#xD;
      recherche du centre hospitalier universitaire de Montréal (CRCHUM). Each imaging center will&#xD;
      then focus on separate sub-goals: improving liver disease assessment with MRE-IA (CRCHUM) and&#xD;
      evaluating the role of fluid conductivity and changes in elastic properties with mental tasks&#xD;
      (CRCHUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There are two main hypotheses underlying this project: (1) that internal&#xD;
      activation provides an effective, robust displacement source for MRE image reconstruction&#xD;
      that eliminates the problems of discomfort, high attenuation, artefact sensitivity, and low&#xD;
      signal to noise associated with traditional extrinsic MRE methods; and (2) that the advanced&#xD;
      material property maps provided by MRE-IA, such as viscoelastic damping, poroelastic effects&#xD;
      and anisotropy, will lead to better classification and understanding of both diseased and&#xD;
      healthy tissue states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The image acquisition methodology for this project will be identical at both imaging&#xD;
      centers. Intrinsic activation MRE displacement data will be obtained through the use the&#xD;
      Q-Flow angiographic sequence available on the Philips 3T systems at both the CRCHUS and&#xD;
      CRCHUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRE-IA for diffuse and focal liver disease (CRCHUM): The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility of MRE-IA imaging in the assessment of liver disease. MRE-IA will&#xD;
      be performed in three populations (10 healthy volunteers, 25 patients with diffuse liver&#xD;
      disease and 10 patients with focal liver lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrinsic MRE: MRE-IA images are reconstructed from phase-contrast sequences that are&#xD;
      currently available on MRI scanners at CHUM and CHUS. Post-processing of the images with&#xD;
      finite element analysis (FEA) mechanical simulations allows calculation of&#xD;
      poroviscoelasticity parameters (i.e. porosity, bulk modulus, storage modulus [G'], and loss&#xD;
      modulus [G'']). These poroviscoelasticity parameters will be correlated with&#xD;
      histopathological markers of disease severity (fibrosis, inflammation, fat) in patients with&#xD;
      chronic liver disease and with the final diagnosis (type of liver lesion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral function imaging via MRE-IA (CRCHUS): The objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the changes in mechanical properties during the performance of mental tasks and the role of&#xD;
      inherent fluid conductivity in the BOLD imaging used in fMRI methods. Multiple imaging&#xD;
      sessions will be performed to investigate changes to MRE-IA property maps to visual (V1)&#xD;
      stimulation. Imaging sessions will be include either V1 (n=6) or non-stimulus (n=3) cases.&#xD;
      Each case will include both MRE-IA and fMRI acquisitions.&#xD;
