  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices are the most common used method of contraception in the world, mostly in&#xD;
      developing countries, because they offer long-term, reversible and relatively safe&#xD;
      contraception. At present, 50% of intrauterine devices users are women of reproductive age&#xD;
      and most of them are requesting Intrauterine device removal to regain their fertility. In&#xD;
      general, an intrauterine device should be removed during menses or preferably immediate after&#xD;
      menses because intrauterine device removal is usually easy because the cervix is still soft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intrauterine device is usually removed by firmly grasping the threads at the external os;&#xD;
      traction should be applied away from the cervix. If resistance is present, the removal should&#xD;
      be stopped until it is determined why the intrauterine device is not moving. Some deeply&#xD;
      embedded intrauterine device may need to be removed by hysteroscope [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, many women, however, have an intolerable pain during intrauterine device removal&#xD;
      and some of them requesting painkiller or even anesthesia to allow the physician to remove&#xD;
      it. Cervical hardening and adhesions are the major factors making IUD removal difficult&#xD;
      especially in post-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion and removal of IUD in nulliparous women is possible but it may carry more pain,&#xD;
      more difficulty than in parous women. We think that this problem is also present in women has&#xD;
      no vagina delivery before. So, the intrauterine device removal actually has some difficulty&#xD;
      or pain in the nulliparous women, women delivered by elective caesarian section or&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many medical agents for cervical ripening prior to the removal have been emerged like&#xD;
      misoprostol. Misoprostol is commonly used for cervical ripening in the first and second&#xD;
      trimester miscarriage and prior intrauterine devices insertion. The use of vaginal&#xD;
      misoprostol before intrauterine device insertion in women who had never delivered vaginally&#xD;
      before may increase the ease and success of insertion with pain felt during the procedure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However and up to our knowledge; no studies had been reported the effect of misoprostol on&#xD;
      removal pain in women delivered only by elective cesarean section.&#xD;
