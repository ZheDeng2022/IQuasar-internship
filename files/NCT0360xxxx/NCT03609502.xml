    <textblock>
      This study tests a memory-based account of atypical speech perception in adults with&#xD;
      language-based learning disability (also known as developmental language impairment [LI]).&#xD;
      One perspective regarding the its etiology considers impoverished speech sound&#xD;
      representations to be central to the linguistic symptoms observed in LI. This project&#xD;
      examines a potential abnormality in the process of building speech sound representations in&#xD;
      LI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work by the PI has found that sleep is important for learning speech sounds.&#xD;
      Furthermore, different measures of speech perception (identification and discrimination),&#xD;
      reveal distinct patterns of learning that are consistent with that of declarative and&#xD;
      procedural memory consolidation. A division of labor by declarative and procedural memory&#xD;
      systems in the building of speech representations may imply that problems with phonology may&#xD;
      stem from selective weaknesses in declarative or procedural memory in predictive ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first project Aim is to identify the memory substrates of novel phonetic category&#xD;
      formation. In Experiment 1, the investigators will obtain behavioral measures of declarative,&#xD;
      procedural, and speech sound learning before and after post-training sleep in 40 typical&#xD;
      adults and 20 adults with LI. Among typical adults, a double dissociation is predicted in&#xD;
      which speech identification will be predicted by individual differences in declarative&#xD;
      memory, and speech discrimination will be predicted by individual differences in procedural&#xD;
      memory. Moreover, adults with LI are predicted to demonstrate consolidation deficits across&#xD;
      memory types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second project Aim is to identify the neural substrates of phonetic category formation.&#xD;
      In Experiment 2, the investigators will obtain functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)&#xD;
      recordings of 20 TD and 20 LI adults performing post-training identification and&#xD;
      discrimination tasks on a trained speech contrast before and after sleep. In typical adults,&#xD;
      a Time by Speech-task interaction is predicted. Speech identification will recruit episodic&#xD;
      (hippocampal) information on Day 1 relative to classic regions for phonological processing on&#xD;
      Day 2. Speech discrimination will result in a change in magnitude of activation from Days 1&#xD;
      and 2 in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), reflecting an overnight decrease in effort.&#xD;
      LI (n=20) is predicted to demonstrate reduced overnight change in neural activation relative&#xD;
      to TD in both tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 60 adults with typical language (TD) and 40 LI participants&#xD;
      through a variety of community and university related contacts. 40 TD adults and 20 LI&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in Experiment 1. 20 TD adults and 20 LI participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in Experiment 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both experiments will take place over 3 Sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Session 1, the investigators will administer various measures in order to validate&#xD;
      study eligibility, classify participants into groups, and other measures in order to further&#xD;
      characterize our samples. To that end, participants will be administered a pure tone&#xD;
      audiometric screening, and complete an interview questionnaire asking for background&#xD;
      information such as handedness, language background, language and reading development, and&#xD;
      development of motor skills. Trained research personnel will then administer an approximately&#xD;
      2-hour testing battery that includes measures of nonverbal cognition, language ability,&#xD;
      reading ability, attention, executive function, and phonological processing. Participants&#xD;
      will also complete questionnaires to assess their habitual sleep quality, sleepiness, and&#xD;
      individual chronotpyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All testing will be completed by a student clinician, and will be supervised by a certified&#xD;
      speech-language pathologist. 100% of administrations will be re-scored by a trained student&#xD;
      for accuracy. To account for attrition and non-qualifiers, we anticipate enrolling/screening&#xD;
      up to 200 individuals in Session 1 in order to arrive at the enrollment targets for&#xD;
      Experiments 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both experiments, Sessions 2 and 3 takes place on two consecutive days. Session 2 will&#xD;
      take place in the late evening, and Session 3 will take place in the morning. We have&#xD;
      intentionally chosen not to employ a wake-state (AM-PM) control. This is done in order to&#xD;
      limit the potential variability in the amount of English exposure between sessions.&#xD;
      Between-session sleep duration will be monitored with an Actigraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer&#xD;
      (Actigraph, corp) worn on the non-dominant wrist. Actigraphs will be set to collect data in&#xD;
      60-second epochs via a validated algorithm (Cain &amp; Geremia,2011). This method of recording&#xD;
      sleep/wake activity has been independently validated to agree with lab polysomnography at 85%&#xD;
      accuracy (Slater et al.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1: behavioral measures During Session 2, participants will complete the three&#xD;
      learning tasks, declarative learning, procedural learning, nonnative speech learning (in that&#xD;
      order), and immediate post-learning assessments. During Session 3, participants will be&#xD;
      re-assessed in nonnative speech learning, declarative learning, and procedural learning (in&#xD;
      that order).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Declarative memory will be assessed using an object recognition task following&#xD;
           incidental encoding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A version of the Serial Reaction Time task will be used to measure procedural learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceptual learning of speech will be measured through performance on identification and&#xD;
           discrimination tasks on the dental and retroflex contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2: neuroimaging measures During Session 2, participants will complete the&#xD;
      nonnative contrast training in the late evening. Then they will enter a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imagine (MRI) scanner, where their blood oxygen-level dependent signals will be recorded&#xD;
      while they complete the post-training identification and discrimination assessments. The&#xD;
      participants will complete the same in-scanner assessments of the perception of the nonnative&#xD;
      contrast during Session 3.&#xD;
