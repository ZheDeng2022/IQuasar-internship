      To determine whether silicone gel is effective at preventing or minimizing scar formation&#xD;
      after eyelid surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper eyelid blepharoplasty or ptosis repair is performed when the upper eyelid becomes&#xD;
      droopy, which often occurs as a natural part of the aging process. The droopiness of the&#xD;
      upper eyelids decreases the ability to see objects in their peripheral vision, causing&#xD;
      functional deficits. Additionally, the droopiness can be a cosmetic concern for many. The&#xD;
      most effective treatment option is blepharoplasty or ptosis repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine pre-operative counseling, many patients note a fear of prominent facial&#xD;
      scarring. Different techniques have been described in the literature to minimize scarring,&#xD;
      from steroid creams to injections to laser therapy; however, there is currently no consensus&#xD;
      for long-term management of post-surgical eyelid scars. Specifically, there is no study&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of topical silicone gel on eyelid scars, although a few studies have&#xD;
      examined its efficacy on other facial scars. Silicone is proposed to aid in healing by&#xD;
      regulating fibroblast production, reducing collagen production, and modifying expression of&#xD;
      growth factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's study is designed to determine whether topical silicone may prevent&#xD;
      significant post-operative eyelid scar formation. It may help clarify whether there is a safe&#xD;
      and effective topical treatment for patients undergoing eyelid surgery for whom scarring or&#xD;
      cosmesis is a concern. It is the first study of silicone gel on the eyelid and is also&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, and double blinded.&#xD;

    The principal investigator suspended the study temporarily because of the COVID pandemic. We do&#xD;
    not want patients to attend their follow-up visits at this time unless absolutely necessary.&#xD;

    <description>Patients who have consented to the study will receive two tubes labeled only &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, corresponding to the side of the face to which the tube contents will be applied. One tube will contain silicone gel and the other tube will contain aquaphor. Neither the patient nor the surgeon will know what side will receive which treatment. These tubes will be given to patients at post-operative week 1 visit. Patients will be instructed to rub the solution into their eyelid incisions gently with their fingers for 2-3 minutes twice a day</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be included if they have met the criteria for undergoing upper eyelid&#xD;
             ptosis repair or blepharoplasty. This means they have droopiness of the upper eyelids&#xD;
             that is visually significant and limiting the patient's visual field.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they require additional upper eyelid surgery.&#xD;
