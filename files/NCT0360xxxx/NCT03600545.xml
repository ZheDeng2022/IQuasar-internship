  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memory and cognitive declines are associated with normal brain aging but are also precursors&#xD;
      to dementia, in particular the so called the pandemic of the century, Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
      While currently there is no cure or &quot;vaccine&quot; against dementia, there are hopes to delay the&#xD;
      onset of the disease by living a brain-healthy life style. The proposed research offers a&#xD;
      novel approach to prevent dementia and age-related cognitive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to create a brain fitness APP for the aging population. The proposed APP is&#xD;
      based on the premise of brain plasticity, and targets the brain functions that are declining&#xD;
      with normal aging and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed APP will be tested on a large population with statistical rigor (60 healthy&#xD;
      individuals of age 65+ years and up to 30 individuals with cognitive impairment); the&#xD;
      participants will be divided into an intervention group and a control group. We will analyze&#xD;
      the logged performance of the participants, and assess their cognitive state with an&#xD;
      independent test compared to a matched control group before and after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the frequent use of the proposed APP will help to maintain a healthy&#xD;
      brain as well as detecting the onset of a cognitive decline in aging population. In addition,&#xD;
      its frequent use will slow and even reverse the progression of the cognition decline in&#xD;
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The APP will have many different&#xD;
      levels of difficulty so that it can be applied to a wide age range and conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research is on the frequent use of our designed APP (for iPADs) that contains a series of&#xD;
      our recently developed brain exercises that contains a series of our recently developed brain&#xD;
      exercises, including orientation, associative memory, word-image association, recall memory,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control Arm. Participants of&#xD;
      Intervention Arm must have access to an iPAD at least for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for Intervention Arm The participants in Intervention Arm will have a training&#xD;
      session (after obtaining their consent form) for the Brain Exercises. The Brain Fitness App&#xD;
      will be downloaded into their iPAD and they will be instructed on how to use it. As mentioned&#xD;
      in their consent form, they will commit themselves to play the games on a daily basis for (at&#xD;
      least 5 days/week), twice/day, each session of minimum 15 minutes for a period of 4&#xD;
      consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for Control Arm Participants of this arm will do nothing but will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, 4 week and 8 weeks later. Their data will be used as the control data for&#xD;
      comparison with the Intervention Arm data. All participants of this group, if interested,&#xD;
      will be offered to practice the Brain Fitness App if they wish after their completion of this&#xD;
      study (2 months period).&#xD;

    <measure>The change in Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS IV) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention within a week after the end of 4-week trial and a month after the second assessment</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment has a total of 11 tests, out of which we will use its six primary tests that assess our target brain functions, comprised of 12 subtests (subsections): Logical Memory 1, Verbal Paired Associates 1, Faces 1, Family Pictures 1, Logical Memory 2, Verbal Paired Associates 2, Faces 2, Family Pictures 2, Verbal Paired Associates 2 Recognition, Logical Memory 2 Recognition, Letter-Number Sequencing and Spatial Span. They are classified into 3 major memory indexes: Immediate Memory, General Memory and Working Memory. The WMS test is being purchased online from the following link; they do not provide a softcopy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Egocentric Spatial Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention within a week after the end of 4-week trial and a month after the second assessment</time_frame>
    <description>This test is one of the PI's designs that has been in use since a few years ago. It is used for detecting the onset of Alzheimer's. In this test participants sit in a customized wheelchair and by waking the wheelchair they move within a virtual cubic building to reach a particular target room. They can do this test either using the laptop screen or in its immersive version wearing a goggle (Oculus Rift 2).</description>

    <measure>Change in MONTGOMERY ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post-intervention within a week after the end of 4-week trial and a month after the second assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten item rating scale for rating levels of depression. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 to 6, where 0 indicates absence of the symptom and 6 indicates extreme presence of the symptom. The time frame for the scale is the previous four weeks.</description>
