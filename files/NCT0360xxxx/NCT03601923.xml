  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an investigational therapy as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Niraparib&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved niraparib for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niraparib belongs to a class of anti-cancer agents known as PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase)&#xD;
      inhibitors. PARP is a protein in the body that repairs damage to DNA (one of the building&#xD;
      blocks of a cell). In cells that are rapidly growing, such as cancer cells, blocking repair&#xD;
      of DNA may be of benefit, since it will cause the cell to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to test the effectiveness of niraparib&#xD;
      in patients with pancreatic cancer. The trial is focused on pancreatic cancer patients that&#xD;
      have marker, a mutation in a DNA repair gene, suggesting that their cancer might be&#xD;
      susceptible to niraparib.&#xD;

             treatment through 180 days after the last dose of study treatment. Note: Abstinence is&#xD;
             acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must agree to not donate blood during the study or for 90 days after the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant receiving corticosteroids may continue as long as their dose is stable for&#xD;
             least 4 weeks prior to initiating protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             biologic therapy, or other investigational therapy within 2 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered to ≤ CTCAE (version 5.0) Grade 1 or baseline&#xD;
             from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier (with the&#xD;
             exceptions of alopecia and peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have received investigational therapy administered ≤ 4 weeks, or&#xD;
             within a time interval less than at least 5 half-lives of the investigational agent,&#xD;
             whichever is longer, prior initiating protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received oral targeted therapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
             (TKI) therapy within 5 half-lives or 2 weeks of study entry, whichever is shorter.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with known untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. Participants with a history of brain metastases that have&#xD;
             been treated, are no longer taking corticosteroids, and have been stable on imaging&#xD;

             abnormality (including active or uncontrolled myelosuppression [ie, anemia,&#xD;
             leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia]) that might confound the results of the&#xD;
             study or interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the&#xD;
             study treatment or that makes it not in the best interest of the participant to&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression,&#xD;

             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the treating investigator could impact the absorption of the study drug,&#xD;

             or bowels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of a clinically relevant second primary malignancy within&#xD;
             the past 2 years. Exceptions include: resected basal and squamous cell carcinomas of&#xD;
             the skin and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not be on anticoagulant therapy unless the treating investigator has&#xD;
             deemed it safe to temporarily hold to facilitate the collection of the pre-treatment&#xD;
             tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must not have received colony stimulating factors (eg, granulocyte&#xD;
             colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, or&#xD;
             recombinant erythropoietin) within 4 weeks prior initiating protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had any known Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia due&#xD;
             to prior chemotherapy that persisted &gt; 4 weeks and was related to the most recent&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
