    <textblock>
      Patient-controlled admissions are short self-referred inpatient admissions in mental health&#xD;
      services without approval by clinicians. The intention is to reduce a high use of inpatient&#xD;
      care. Patients are signing a contract for a specified period with stays limited to a maximum&#xD;
      number of days and with a minimum number of weeks between stays. The few studies so far show&#xD;
      tendencies to a possible effect, but additional studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to describe the use and experiences of patient-controlled&#xD;
      admissions, compare the use of inpatient admissions and inpatient days during the 24 months&#xD;
      before and after baseline, and to identify subgroups who may benefit from the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pre-post prospective intervention study where the use of inpatient admissions&#xD;
      in the contract period is compared to a similar period before baseline so that the patients&#xD;
      are their own controls. The study is done in inpatient wards in four community mental health&#xD;
      centers of Akershus University Hospital, Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 120 patients. The eligible patients have a severe mental illness,&#xD;
      high use of inpatient mental health care the last two years and are expected to benefit from&#xD;
      patient-controlled admissions. The patients will be followed for 24 months from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data at baseline includes socio-demographics, diagnoses, type and severity of psychiatric&#xD;
      problems, and use of alcohol and drugs. Data on admissions and experience of these are&#xD;
      collected during the contract period, Data on patients' and relatives' experience of the&#xD;
      model are collected at the end of the period. Data on total inpatient admissions/stays during&#xD;
      the 24 months before and after baseline are extracted from the hospital patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses will include descriptive statistics on the sample and the use of inpatient&#xD;
      care, testing of differences of inpatient care between 24 months before and after baseline,&#xD;
      multiple regression of associations between baseline characteristics and the use of inpatient&#xD;
      care, and analyses to identify subgroups who benefit from the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol in Norwegian was approved by the Regional Committee on Medical and Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics in Norway South East 29 April 2011 (reg.no. 2011/790).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period was 2011-2012. Data collection were done 2011-2014. Data extraction from&#xD;
      the patient records was done 2015-2016. Quality control and organization of data was done&#xD;
      2017-2018. Data analysis will start in August 2018.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-controlled admissions are short self-referred inpatient admissions in mental health&#xD;
      services without approval by clinicians (Heskestad &amp; Tytlandsvik 2008). The intention is to&#xD;
      reduce a high use of inpatient care. Patients are signing a contract for a specified period&#xD;
      with such stays limited to a maximum number of days per stay and with a minimum number of&#xD;
      weeks between stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review on patient-controlled hospital admissions identified six small studies&#xD;
      which had all been done in Norway and including patients with schizophrenia, affective&#xD;
      disorders, anxiety disorder, personality disorder and substance abuse (Strand et al 2015).&#xD;
      The review showed a tendency towards a reduction in involuntary inpatient care and use of&#xD;
      inpatient days, but it could not conclude on effect due to small sample sizes and&#xD;
      methodological limitations. A later and larger study in Denmark showed a reduction in&#xD;
      involuntary admissions and inpatient days compared to historical controls, but not compared&#xD;
      to another matched group with treatment as usual (Thomsen et al 2018). The model is line with&#xD;
      research on the positive influence of shared decision-making, where the patient has a major&#xD;
      influence on decisions on choice of treatment (Wills &amp; Holmes-Rovner 2006) and research on&#xD;
      the use of low-threshold crisis units as an alternative to stay at psychiatric hospital&#xD;
      departments (Lloyd-Evans et al 2009). But more studies are needed to explore the usefulness&#xD;
      of patient-controlled admissions for different patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTEXT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is being done in inpatient wards in four community mental health centers of&#xD;
      Akershus University Hospital, Norway, after a smaller pilot study that indicated potential&#xD;
      effect for patients with affective illness, but less for patients with psychosis (Støvind et&#xD;
      al 2012). Based on the pilot project and earlier studies, it was estimated that two&#xD;
      patient-controlled beds in each center would be enough to meet the needs for&#xD;
      patient-controlled hospital admissions for approximately 120 patients within the target&#xD;
      group. Each of the 19 health trust in Norway has 2-5 community mental health centers, and 40&#xD;
      % of the beds in mental health services in Norway are in community mental health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to describe the use and experiences of patient-controlled&#xD;
      admissions, compare the use of inpatient admissions and inpatient days during the 24 months&#xD;
      before and after baseline, and to identify subgroups who may benefit from the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol in Norwegian was approved by the Regional Committee on Medical and Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics in Norway South East 29 April 2011 (reg.no. 2011/790).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      (RQ1) Has the model and use of patient-controlled admissions been implemented according to&#xD;
      the plan? (RQ2) Are the number of admissions, involuntary admissions or days of stay reduced&#xD;
      for the 24 months contract period compared with the previous 24 months? (RQ3) Are there any&#xD;
      differences among subgroups in changes in admissions or total inpatient days? (RQ4) How has&#xD;
      the patients' contact with staff, participation in activities and experiences of the stay&#xD;
      been for patient-controlled stays? (RQ5) How has the patients' and relatives' experience been&#xD;
      with the model of patient-controlled admissions for 24 months? (RQ6) Do the results indicate&#xD;
      which patients seem to benefit from patient-controlled admissions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pre-post prospective intervention study where the use of inpatient admissions&#xD;
      in the contract period is compared to a similar period before baseline so that the patients&#xD;
      are their own controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has aimed to recruit 120 patients. The eligible patients have a severe mental&#xD;
      illness, high use of inpatient mental health care the last two years and are expected to&#xD;
      benefit from patient-controlled admissions. Only patients giving written consent are&#xD;
      included. The inclusion period was planned for 12 months (April 2011 to March 2012) but was&#xD;
      extended with 9 months (to December 2012) due to slower recruitment than expected. The&#xD;
      patients are followed for 24 months from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUMENTS AND VARIABLES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on patients at baseline (start of period with contract about patient-controlled&#xD;
      admissions, and inclusion in the study) includes socio-demographics, current use of health&#xD;
      services, ICD-10 diagnoses, ratings on type and severity of current psychiatric problems&#xD;
      using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) (Wing et al 1998) and use of alcohol or&#xD;
      illegal drugs using Alcohol and Drug Use Scales (Mueser et al 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on each patient-controlled admission and the patient's experience of this includes date&#xD;
      and hour for self-referral, date and hour for admission, date and hour for discharge, reasons&#xD;
      for self-referral, contacts with staff and participation in activities during the stay, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with the stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on patients' experience with the model with patient-controlled admissions includes&#xD;
      questions about feasibility of using patient-controlled admissions, satisfaction with the&#xD;
      contract and the patient-controlled stays, how they think the model may have changed their&#xD;
      use on inpatient care, and how the model may be improved. Data on relatives' experiences with&#xD;
      the model includes the same question as to the patient but adapted to the relatives'&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on all inpatient admissions/stays in the mental health services for each participant at&#xD;
      Akershus University Hospital for the 24 months contract period and for the 24 months period&#xD;
      before baseline is extracted from the electronic patient records. For each stay data is&#xD;
      extracted on department/section, admission date, discharge date, whether admission was&#xD;
      voluntary/involuntary, and date for changing involuntary stay to voluntary stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the patient's situation and mental health at baseline is collected by mental health&#xD;
      nurses trained in completing the assessment form in collaboration with the clinician of the&#xD;
      patient. Data on each patient-controlled admission is collected by the ward staff during the&#xD;
      stay and in an interview with the patient at the end of the stay. Data on the patient's and a&#xD;
      relative's experience with the model is collected by the ward staff in a brief interview or&#xD;
      telephone interview at the end of the 24 months contract period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on all inpatient admissions/stays in the mental health services for each participant is&#xD;
      extracted later from the electronic patient journal system at Akershus University Hospital&#xD;
      for the 24 months contract period and for the 24 months period before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will be done to describe the patient sample and their situation at&#xD;
      baseline, the use and characteristics of the patient-controlled admission/stays, and the&#xD;
      patients' and relatives' experiences with the patient-controlled admission model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing of significant differences in use of admissions and inpatient days between the 24&#xD;
      months contract period and the previous 24 months period with treatment as usual will be done&#xD;
      with t-test and chi-square. Multiple regression analyses will be used to study association&#xD;
      between baseline characteristics and the use of patient-controlled admissions. If subgroups&#xD;
      with different patterns of use of patient-controlled admission/stays are identified, analyses&#xD;
      may be done to identify characteristics of these groups, depending on the size of sample and&#xD;
      subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period was 2011-2012. Data collection was done 2011-2014. Data extraction from&#xD;
      the patient records was done 2015-2016. Quality control and organization of data was done&#xD;
      2017-2018. Data analysis will start in August 2018.&#xD;
