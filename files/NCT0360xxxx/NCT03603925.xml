    <textblock>
      Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs), normalized activity concentration, measured using PET/MR&#xD;
      have inaccuracies â‰¥ 20% which exceeds National Cancer Institute / American College of&#xD;
      Radiology Imaging Network (NCI/ACRIN), Radiological Society of North America / Quantitative&#xD;
      Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (RSNA/QIBA) specifications and disqualifies PET/MR from&#xD;
      multicenter or cooperative group clinical trials. High inaccuracy is primarily due to poor&#xD;
      attenuation correction (AC) owing to lack of computed tomography (CT) data. This study will&#xD;
      develop acquisition and analyses methods to synthesize CT images from MR data that can be&#xD;
      used to achieve SUVs that are within 5% of those obtained using PET/CT (reference standard),&#xD;
      thus meeting accuracy requirements needed to qualify for multicenter trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this research project is to validate clinically practical methods for&#xD;
      producing MR-based attenuation correction information which is needed to produce&#xD;
      quantitatively accurate PET images from a PET/MR scanner. Existing commercial PET/MR systems&#xD;
      use methods that are inaccurate.&#xD;

      Objective The primary objective is to demonstrate that, using the new acquisition and&#xD;
      analysis methods for MR-AC, PET SUVs in lesions and normal tissues can be measured using&#xD;
      PET/MR and be within 5% agreement of those measured using PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to demonstrate visual and quantitative agreement between&#xD;
      synthesized CT images generated from MR data and the reference, measured CT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This study would like to enroll patients receiving a clinically indicated PET/CT&#xD;
      scan. The patients will be asked to agree to a receive research PET/MR scan within the study&#xD;
      which requires additional time and potential MR risks for the patient. It does not entail&#xD;
      extra injections or radiation exposure. Research acquisition and processing will be performed&#xD;
      on the PET/MR data to create PET images that are expected to have quantitatively accurate&#xD;
      SUVs. These will be compared to SUVs from the clinical PET/CT which will serve as the&#xD;
      reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome By bringing together cutting-edge advances in both MR acquisition and image analyses,&#xD;
      the successful completion of these aims will achieve SUVs that are within 5% of those&#xD;
      obtained with PET/CT (reference standard) with clinically appropriate acquisition time, image&#xD;
      quality, and diagnostic accuracy, so that PET/MR systems meet SUV accuracy requirements&#xD;
      needed to qualify for cooperative group clinical trials.&#xD;

    <description>The Philips Ingenuity PET/MR is used for research scanning. Patients receiving a clinically indicated PET/CT, will be approached to be included in this study. There is no special preparation other than that needed for the prerequisite PET/CT scanning. At the completion of the PET/CT scanning, the subject will be taken to the PET/MR scanner, which is in close in proximity, for research scanning. The research scanning would take up to one hour or as tolerated.</description>
