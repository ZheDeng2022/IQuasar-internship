  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies the side effects of pomalidomide and how well it works&#xD;
      in treating patients with Kaposi sarcoma and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop tumor cells from growing and it may also block the growth of new blood vessels&#xD;
      necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if pomalidomide monotherapy induces a minimal level of antitumor efficacy to&#xD;
      justify its further development for HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      and is safe and tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effects of pomalidomide monotherapy on standard measures of HIV control,&#xD;
      i.e., CD4 counts and HIV viral loads, in this participant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effect of pomalidomide treatment on serum cytokine levels. II. To evaluate&#xD;
      if changes in serum cytokine levels correlate with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 48 weeks.&#xD;

             requirements for central pathology review&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not show evidence for ongoing improvement in KS lesions in the 4&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay&#xD;
             confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot confirmation or&#xD;

             initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either&#xD;
             another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen&#xD;
             preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a&#xD;
             Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
