    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating leukoplakia.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Clinical response rate at 6 months? percent of patients with complete response and partial&#xD;
      response at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Histologic response rate at 6 months. II. Change in clinical impression based on&#xD;
      photographs of the lesion. III. Clinical response rate at 9 months and 12 months. IV.&#xD;
      Toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. PD-L1 expression in leukoplakia lesions and biomarker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 3 weeks for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>If there is a signal of efficacy based on this analysis, further exploratory analyses using Cox-proportional hazards regression, will be performed to identify variables which correlate to improved 6-month clinical response rate will be performed. Variables will include demographics, age, gender, pack-years smoking history, size of the lesions, prior history of leukoplakia or erythroleukoplakia, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. While the study is not powered to detect a statistically difference between these groups, such an analysis may help identify a population more likely to benefit from treatment.</description>
