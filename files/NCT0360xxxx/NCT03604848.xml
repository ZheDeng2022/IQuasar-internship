    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide from a single&#xD;
      infectious agent, ranking above HIV/AIDS. Management and eradication of this disease is being&#xD;
      hindered by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant&#xD;
      TB (XDR-TB). Globally, there were estimated 10.4 million cases of TB and 490,000 cases of&#xD;
      MDR-TB in 2016. China accounts for around 8.6% (0.895/10.4 million) of the global TB burden,&#xD;
      ranking third in the top 3 countries (India, Indonesia, China) with the highest number of TB&#xD;
      cases and ranking first with the largest number of MDR/ Rifampin-Resistant (RR)-TB cases. The&#xD;
      treatment success rate for MDR-TB using the 18-24-month conventional World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) regimen was estimated to be about 54% worldwide and 41% for China in 2016,&#xD;
      which remains unacceptably low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The poor MDR-TB treatment success rates suggest that current drug regimens are suboptimal. In&#xD;
      addition, they are costly with a high pill burden, as many drugs, with significant potential&#xD;
      for adverse events, are given for a long duration. These factors also inhibit good treatment&#xD;
      compliance with further negative impact on treatment outcomes. According to previous studies,&#xD;
      treatment outcomes of MDR-TB could be affected by drug resistance of pivotal drugs in MDR-TB&#xD;
      regimen, such as fluoroquinolones, second-line injectable agents and pyrazinamide. The&#xD;
      available drug-resistance information could help physicians decide the proper regimens for&#xD;
      MDR-TB patients, which may prevent the useless prescription and evitable adverse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the individualized regimen based on the resistance profile of the bacteria and&#xD;
      patients' drug tolerance should be aimed for high-quality treatment for MDR-TB in the future.&#xD;
      A precision individualized treatment approach based on the rapid molecular drug&#xD;
      susceptibility tests of second line drugs may assist clinicians in making more suitable&#xD;
      regimen and improve the treatment outcome of MDR-TB. Also, precision regimen offers the&#xD;
      opportunity to improve treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis through reduced toxicity&#xD;
      while reducing the risk of resistance amplification and further transmission at a population&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility and effects of individualized&#xD;
      regimen that is guided by rapid molecular drug susceptibility tests of key second-line drugs&#xD;
      through next generation sequencing. Meanwhile, the study will evaluate a short course&#xD;
      regimens of drugs among &quot;simple MDR-TB&quot; patients who are proven to be sensitive to&#xD;
      fluoroquinolones ,injectable second-line drugs and pyrazinamide.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The GRACE-TB study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, controlled trial in patients&#xD;
      with MDR-TB. This study will assess the feasibility and effects of individualized regimen for&#xD;
      MDR-TB based on rapid molecular drug susceptibility tests（DSTs） of key second-line drugs&#xD;
      through next generation sequencing (NGS) and try to improve the treatment outcome of MDR-TB.&#xD;
      And the study will evaluate a shorter course regimen among patients who are proven to be&#xD;
      sensitive to fluoroquinolones (FQs) or second-line injectable drugs(SLIDs) or pyrazinamide&#xD;
      (PZA) through NGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 488 participants with MDR-TB will be recruited and followed up until 18 months&#xD;
      after the end of treatment. During randomization, eligible patients will be assigned in a 1:3&#xD;
      ratio to one of the following groups: a control group, which is treated with WHO-approved&#xD;
      MDR-TB regimen, composed of 6 months of PZA, amikacin (Am) ,moxifloxacin (MFX), prothionamide&#xD;
      (PTO), and Cycloserine (Cs), followed by 18 months of PZA, MFX, PTO and Cs; a NGS-guided&#xD;
      group, which is treated with one individualized regimen that is guided by the drug&#xD;
      susceptability test results of FQs/PZA/ SLIDs through NGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 366 patients will be enrolled in the NGS-guided group. Based on the molecular DST&#xD;
      results of FQs/PZA/ SLIDs , patients proven to be sensitive to PZA, FQs and SLIDs will be&#xD;
      divided into to the &quot;simple MDR-TB group&quot; and those with resistant to at least one of&#xD;
      FQs/PZA/ SLIDs will be divided into to &quot;complicated MDR-TB group&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the &quot;simple MDR-TB group&quot; will be assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to one of the&#xD;
      following daily regimen: a 9-month regimen(Regimen A) which consists of 4-month intensive&#xD;
      therapy of PZA, Am, MFX,PTO, Cs, followed by 5-month consolidation therapy of PZA, MFX, PTO&#xD;
      and Cs; a 12-month regimen(Regimen B) which consists of 6-month intensive therapy of PZA, Am,&#xD;
      MFX,PTO, Cs, followed by 6-month consolidation therapy of PZA, MFX, PTO and Cs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the &quot;complicated MDR-TB group&quot; will be treated a regimen (Regimen C) in which the&#xD;
      resistant drug(s) will be replaced by the other WHO recommended drugs for MDR-TB such as&#xD;
      linezolid, clofazimine or ethambutol based on the DST results. The duration of treatment in&#xD;
      the &quot;complicated MDR-TB group&quot; is consistent with control group, with 6 months of intensive&#xD;
      phase and 18 months of consolidation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the proportion of patients with a favorable efficacy&#xD;
      between the NGS-guided group and the control group. The second objective is to assess whether&#xD;
      the proportion of simple MDR-TB patients with a favorable efficacy outcome of Regimen A is&#xD;
      not inferior to Regimen B. The participants will be followed up to 18 months after the end of&#xD;
      the treatment. The data accrued to 18 months after the end of treatment will be used in&#xD;
      primary and secondary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations performed are the routine lab tests, blood glucose, hearing, vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiograph (ECG), reporting of adverse events, physical examinations and chest CT.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be monitored and promptly managed during the whole treatment course.&#xD;
