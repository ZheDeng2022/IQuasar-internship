      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood plasma cells. It usually becomes resistant to&#xD;
      standard treatments. Researchers have developed a procedure called gene therapy. It uses a&#xD;
      person s own T cells, which are part of the immune system. The cells are changed in a lab and&#xD;
      then returned to the person. Researchers hope the changed T cells will be better at&#xD;
      recognizing and killing tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of giving changed T cells to people with multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-73 who have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma that has not been controlled&#xD;
      with standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow sample taken by needle in a hip bone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have a brain scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have apheresis. Blood will be removed through an arm vein. The blood will&#xD;
      be separated and T cells removed. The rest of the blood will be returned through a vein in&#xD;
      the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a central line placed in a large vein in the arm or chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get 2 chemotherapy drugs by the central line over 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two days later, participants will get the changed T cells by the central line. They will stay&#xD;
      in the hospital at least 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must stay near the hospital for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8 follow-up visits over the next year for blood and urine tests. They&#xD;
      may have scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants blood will be collected regularly over the next several years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MM is nearly always incurable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that&#xD;
           specifically target malignancy-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous T cells genetically modified to express CARs targeting the B-cell antigen&#xD;
           CD19 have caused complete remissions in a small number of patients with leukemia or&#xD;
           lymphoma. These results demonstrate that CAR-expressing T cells have anti-malignancy&#xD;
           activity in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein expressed by normal plasma cells and the&#xD;
           malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BCMA is not expressed by normal cells except for plasma cells and some mature B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a novel anti-BCMA CAR that can specifically recognize BCMA-&#xD;
           expressing target cells in vitro and eradicate BCMA-expressing tumors in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This CAR has an antigen-recognition domain made up of a single fully-human heavy chain&#xD;
           variable region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells will specifically eliminate BCMA-&#xD;
           expressing MM cells in patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as fever, hypotension,&#xD;
           and neurological toxicities. Elimination of normal plasma cells and unknown toxicities&#xD;
           are also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the safety and feasibility of administering T cells expressing an anti-BCMA CAR&#xD;
      to patients with MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 73.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable MM defined as a serum M-protein greater than or equal to&#xD;
           1.0 g/dL or a urine M- protein greater than or equal to 200 mg/24 hours or an involved&#xD;
           serum free light chain (FLC) level greater than or equal to 10 mg/dL (provided FLC ratio&#xD;
           is abnormal) or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma of 2.0 cm or more in largest dimension, or&#xD;
           greater than or equal to 30% bone marrow plasma cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have previously received at least 3 different treatment regimens for MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have prior exposure to an IMiD such as lenalidomide, and a proteasome&#xD;
           inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a creatinine level of less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a cardiac ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECOG performance status of 0-2 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients on any anticoagulant medications except aspirin are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No active infections are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/microliters, platelet count&#xD;
           greater than or equal to 55,000/ microliters, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ALT and AST less than or equal to 2.5-fold higher than the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including&#xD;
           corticosteroids) and the required leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including&#xD;
           corticosteroids) and initiation of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient s MM will need to be assessed for BCMA expression by flow cytometry or&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry performed at the NIH. The myeloma must express BCMA. If unstained,&#xD;
           paraffin-embedded bone marrow or plasmacytoma sections are available from prior&#xD;
           biopsies, these can be used to determine BCMA expression by immunohistochemistry;&#xD;
           otherwise patients will need to come to the NIH for a bone marrow biopsy or other biopsy&#xD;
           of a plasmacytoma to determine BCMA expression. The sample for BCMA expression can come&#xD;
           from a biopsy obtained at any time before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cells obtained by leukapheresis will be genetically modified to express an anti-BCMA&#xD;
           CAR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with the&#xD;
           intent of enhancing the activity of the infused anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chemotherapy conditioning regimen is cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days&#xD;
           and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 daily for 3 days. Fludarabine will be given on the same days as&#xD;
           the cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the chemotherapy ends, the patients will have two days with no treatments then&#xD;
           receive an infusion of anti-BCMA- CAR-expressing T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose level will be 0.75x10^6 CAR+ T cells/kg of recipient bodyweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell dose administered will be escalated until a maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the T-cell infusion, there will be a mandatory 9-day minimum inpatient&#xD;
           hospitalization to monitor for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient follow-up is planned for 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after&#xD;
           the CAR T-cell infusion. Afterwards, follow-up will be every six months up to at least 5&#xD;
           years.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Multiple Myeloma criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCMA expression must be detected on malignant plasma cells from either bone marrow or&#xD;
             a plasmacytoma by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. If patient has&#xD;
             plasmacytomas, one plasmacytoma must be biopsied to demonstrate BCMA expression. A&#xD;
             specific quantitative level of BCMA expression for eligibility is not specified, but&#xD;
             patients with multiple myeloma cells that are negative for BCMA by flow cytometry and&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry on either bone marrow biopsy or plasmacytoma biopsy will not be&#xD;
             enrolled. These assays must be performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;
             It is not required that the specimen used for BCMA determination comes from a sample&#xD;
             that was obtained after the patient s most recent treatment. If paraffin embedded&#xD;
             unstained samples of bone marrow involved with MM or a plasmacytoma are available,&#xD;
             these can be shipped to the NIH for BCMA staining, otherwise new biopsies will need to&#xD;
             be performed for determination of BCMA expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCMA expression will need to be documented on the majority of malignant plasma cells&#xD;
             by flow cytometry at the NIH at some time after the original anti-BCMA CAR T-cell&#xD;
             infusion in all patients undergoing a second anti-BCMA CAR T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow plasma cells must make up less than 50% of total bone marrow cells based&#xD;
             on a bone marrow biopsy performed within 24 days of the start of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received at least 3 different prior treatment regimens for multiple&#xD;
             myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have prior exposure to an &quot;IMiD&quot; such as lenolidamide and a proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable MM as defined by at least one of the criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One or more of these abnormalities defines measurable multiple myeloma:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum M-protein greater or equal to 1.0 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine M-protein greater or equal to 200 mg/24 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level greater or equal to 10&#xD;
                  mg/dL (100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A biopsy-proven plasmacytoma at least 2.0 cm in largest dimension&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow core biopsy with 30% or more plasma cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 73.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of&#xD;
             enrollment on this study and for four months after last day of receiving protocol&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with a negative blood PCR test for hepatitis B DNA test can be enrolled. If&#xD;
             hepatitis B DNA (PCR) testing is not available, patients with a negative hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen and negative hepatitis B core antibody can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be tested for the presence of Hepatitis C antigen by PCR and be HCV RNA&#xD;
             negative in order to be eligible. Only if Hepatitis C PCR testing is not available in&#xD;
             a timely manner, patients who are Hepatitis C antibody-negative can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3) without the support of&#xD;
             filgrastim or other growth factors within the previous 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 55,000/mm(3) without transfusion support&#xD;
             within the past 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 5% plasma cells in the peripheral blood leukocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum ALT and AST less or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of the institutional&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL, except in patients with Gilbert s&#xD;
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the&#xD;
             patient starts the cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning regimen, and&#xD;
             patients' toxicities must have recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities&#xD;
             such as alopecia or vitiligo).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because this protocol requires collection of autologous blood cells by leukapheresis&#xD;
             in order to prepare anti-BCMA-CAR T cells, systemic anti-myeloma therapy including&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             required leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal cardiac ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 50% by echocardiography)&#xD;
             and no evidence of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion as determined by&#xD;
             an echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with past participation in gene-therapy, cryopreserved PBMC that have not&#xD;
             been genetically-engineered must be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on any anticoagulants except aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that require urgent therapy due to tumor mass effects or spinal cord&#xD;
             compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have active hemolytic anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with second malignancies in addition to multiple myeloma are not eligible if&#xD;
             the second malignancy has required treatment within the past 3 years or is not in&#xD;
             complete remission. There are two exceptions to this criterion: successfully treated&#xD;
             non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
             Women of child bearing potential cannot have a positive pregnancy test. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential are defined as all women except women who are post- menopausal&#xD;
             or who have had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as women over the age&#xD;
             of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infections (defined as infections causing fevers or requiring anti-&#xD;
             microbial treatment), active coagulation disorders or other major uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             genitourinary, neurologic, or immune system, history of myocardial infarction, active&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias including active atrial fibrillation history of any arrhythmias&#xD;
             other than sinus tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation, currently taking any&#xD;
             anti-arrythmic or congestive heart failure medications, active obstructive or&#xD;
             restrictive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid (prednisone, dexamethasone, etc) is not&#xD;
             allowed within 2 weeks prior to either the required leukapheresis or within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to CAR T-cell infusion (and at any time after the CAR T cell infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient unwilling to undergo intensive care unit treatment including mechanical&#xD;
