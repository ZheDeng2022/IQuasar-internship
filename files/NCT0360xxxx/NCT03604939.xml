  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the model of&#xD;
      delivering CHW-driven home-based comprehensive NCD control services aimed to prevent&#xD;
      premature deaths from cardio-vascular diseases, stroke and breast, cervix and oral cancers in&#xD;
      the hard-to-reach women.&#xD;

      Specific objectives of this study are the evaluation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The social, cultural and behavioral factors that impact the uptake of the NCD control&#xD;
           services among rural women using the Rapid Assessment, Response and Evaluation (RARE)&#xD;
           approach;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The feasibility and acceptability of the strategy to deliver the following NCD control&#xD;
           services to the rural women at their homes by the trained CHWs:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Counselling of the tobacco habitu√©s to give up the practice&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Early detection of hypertension and diabetes to ensure prompt and regular treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Creating breast awareness and ensuring access to prompt diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
                the women with symptoms suggestive of breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening for cervical cancer by self-collected HPV test and ensuring prompt&#xD;
                treatment of screen detected precancers and cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening of the habitual tobacco/alcohol users for oral cancer by OVE and ensuring&#xD;
                prompt treatment of screen detected precancers and cancers&#xD;
