  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease often diagnosed in a person's 20s&#xD;
      or 30s, at a time when most people are starting careers and families. In relapsing remitting&#xD;
      (RR) MS new neurological symptoms suddenly develop over hours to days during relapses, and&#xD;
      they do not start to resolve for days to weeks. Relapse symptoms may not completely&#xD;
      disappear, such that disability accumulates over time. Further, most persons with RRMS will&#xD;
      enter a progressive phase years after diagnosis. It is unpredictable when the transition to&#xD;
      the progressive phase will occur and how quickly this progression will happen. Thus,&#xD;
      receiving an MS diagnosis is a highly stressful event. Persons with MS (PwMS) often suffer&#xD;
      from mood symptoms, which can further impair quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PwMS need support and the skills to effectively cope with the distress that comes with the&#xD;
      uncertainty of a new MS diagnosis, as well as to minimize or prevent the onset of negative&#xD;
      mood symptoms. One promising approach is mindfulness - a mental state of paying attention&#xD;
      with intention, and accepting the present moment as it is without judgment. Scientific&#xD;
      evidence supports the use of mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) in other chronic diseases&#xD;
      to reduce stress, anxiety and depression, leading to improved physical function and QOL. MBIs&#xD;
      decreased stress-related symptoms and the levels of stress hormones in the blood. As such,&#xD;
      MBIs have the potential to lessen the negative consequences of stress in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      PwMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess if an MBI can reduce the negative impact of an MS diagnosis&#xD;
      by improving coping skills. The investigator predicts that it will reduce perceived stress as&#xD;
      well as stress markers in the blood, thus increasing overall QOL for newly diagnosed PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigator will randomly assign newly diagnosed PwMS to either MBI or&#xD;
      standard treatment. The investigator administers the MBI under the format of the Mindfulness&#xD;
      Ambassador Council (MAC), which was developed by the non-profit organization, Mindfulness&#xD;
      Without Borders (MWB, www.mindfulnesswithoutborders.org). This intervention will consist of&#xD;
      group meetings led by a mindfulness coach once a week for an hour over 10 weeks. We will&#xD;
      include in the study PwMS that have been diagnosed with RRMS within the last year. We will&#xD;
      assess measures of coping, mood symptoms and QOL before the intervention, after 10 weeks (or&#xD;
      equivalent time for the standard treatment group) and then again 6 months later, to ensure&#xD;
      any benefit continues over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First and foremost, PwMS will benefit from this type of research. This project could lead to&#xD;
      a non-pharmacological, cost-effective intervention to help cope with the uncertainty that&#xD;
      comes with an MS diagnosis as well as improves mood symptoms, psychosocial functioning and&#xD;
      QOL, currently and over the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sharing the results of this study will be a priority for us. We will present our results at&#xD;
      national and international meetings as well as submit for journal publication. We will share&#xD;
      our findings with other health care practitioners and with the lay public through community&#xD;
      presentations and possible media releases.&#xD;

    <description>Brief COPE measure - was developed to assess a broad range of coping responses.28 questions with a 1-4 point scale for a total range of 28-116 with a lower score indicating better coping skills.&#xD;
This will be assessed at three time points and then aggregated to arrive at one reported value that represents &quot;change in coping skills&quot;. This is indicated as an integer. Ex. Pre-MBI = 70 and Post-MBI = 50 and 6mo Post-MBI = 50 then the aggregated score would be -20.</description>

    <description>While every MBI session is different, in general they will help you develop skills in focused attention, and emotional and behavioural regulation in a group environment made up of other people with MS who may share common experiences with you. MBI sessions are group-based which means you will be attending the sessions with other people who are also in this study and facilitated by trained personnel .</description>
