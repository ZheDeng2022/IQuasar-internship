      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of mesenchymal stromal&#xD;
      cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA (iExosomes) in treating participants with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer with KrasG12D mutation that has spread to other places in the body.&#xD;
      iExosomes may work better at treating pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived&#xD;
      exosomes loaded with small interference RNA (siRNA) against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with KrasG12D mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived&#xD;
      exosomes loaded with siRNA against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic PDAC patients with&#xD;
      KrasG12D mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of iExosomes. II. Assess the overall response rate of&#xD;
      iExosomes in the chosen patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine median progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment. V. Determine the&#xD;
      median overall survival (OS) with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate optional tissue collection and serum-derived exosomes and circulating-free&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) for detection of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) showing&#xD;
      KrasG12D sequence; evaluate DNA and RNA showing KrasG12D sequence in optional tissue&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the siRNA content in blood and optional tissue collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 15-20 minutes on days 1, 4, and 10. Treatment repeats every 14 days&#xD;
      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Participants who respond may continue 3 additional courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
