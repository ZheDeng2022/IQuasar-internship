      This work will test a set of strategies for helping community health centers(CHCs) routinely&#xD;
      identify and take action on the SDH-related needs of patients with / at risk for DM. The work&#xD;
      will specifically study: (a) EHR-based SDH data collection / action in CHCs, and (b) the&#xD;
      impact of a set of scalable implementation strategies known to support clinical practice&#xD;
      changes (the 'SDH Action Plan'), on CHCs' adoption of SDH data collection and action.&#xD;
      Focusing on DM risk management and obesity prevention outcomes in adult patients, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a mixed methods formative evaluation of SDH data collection uptake&#xD;
      among CHCs that had SDH data tools activated in their EHR in June 2016. (Quantitative data&#xD;
      will come from all 440 CHCs' shared EHR, qualitative data from 10-12 CHCs purposively&#xD;
      recruited from this pool). Identify patterns of SDH data collection in these diverse CHCs,&#xD;
      and clinic-level factors associated with variation in SDH data collection rates. Use results&#xD;
      to fine-tune the SDH Action Plan intervention's strategies for helping CHCs systematically:&#xD;
      (i) collect SDH data in standard workflows, and (ii) integrate SDH data into care plans&#xD;
      (e.g., making referrals to social services; adapting treatment plans) for adults with / at&#xD;
      risk for DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial in 30 CHCs, the CHCs will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of five 6-month wedges, with staggered timing. CHCs in each wedge will&#xD;
      receive intensive implementation support (the SDH Action Plan). This scalable intervention&#xD;
      includes both comprehensive technical assistance and training materials designed to help CHCs&#xD;
      plan for and implement SDH data collection / action, and six months of remote access to an&#xD;
      'SDH Implementation Team' that will tailor implementation support to each CHC's needs, with&#xD;
      an emphasis on the Building Blocks of Primary Care.45 To test this approach, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a realist evaluation of whether and how the SDH Action Plan&#xD;
      intervention improves: (i) SDH data collection in CHC workflows; (ii) integration of SDH data&#xD;
      into DM risk management care; and (iii) clinical measures associated with effective DM risk&#xD;
      management (controlled blood pressure, HbA1c, BMI, lipids, etc.; up-to-date preventive care).&#xD;
      H3a: Intervention CHCs will have significantly greater increases in (i) SDH data collection,&#xD;
      and (ii) actions taken to address SDH needs, compared to control CHCs. H3b: Patients at&#xD;
      intervention CHCs for whom SDH data are collected will have significant improvements in DM /&#xD;
      obesity risk management / receipt of related preventive care, compared to those at control&#xD;
      CHCs.&#xD;

          -  Any persons who are at risk for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May include some subjects with mental health conditions of various types; however, it&#xD;
             is important to systematically address high DM /obesity risk in this population,&#xD;
             because such patients may be at risk for elevated high DM /obesity risk and have often&#xD;
             been excluded or underrepresented in previous research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decisionally/cognitively impaired&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Economically/educationally disadvantaged&#xD;

        Note: The investigators are not enrolling patients for this clinic-randomized study, but&#xD;
        rather studying the uptake and impact of a set of EHR-based clinical decision support tools&#xD;
        into regular care at the participating clinics. In this clinic-randomized trial, the&#xD;
        intervention / randomization are clinic level. The intervention targets clinic processes&#xD;
        that are part of the regular care patients receive, and will not require special visits.&#xD;
