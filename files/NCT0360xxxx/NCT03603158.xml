    <textblock>
      Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is one of the modalities to prevent HIV transmission&#xD;
      among injected drug users, particularly in opioid-dependent users. However,&#xD;
      methadone-associated cardiotoxicity is one of the fatal adverse events that limit the&#xD;
      widespread usage in certain groups of opioid-dependent patients. This is a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study aimed to investigate the association between 4 KCNH2 SNPs (1539C&gt;T, in exon 6 of KCNH2&#xD;
      gene; 1956T&gt;C, in exon 8 of KCNH2 gene), 2350C&gt;T (in exon 9 of KCNH2 gene), 2690A&gt;C (Exon 11&#xD;
      of KCNH2 gene)) and prolongation of QTc interval in opioid-dependent Kelantanese Malays who&#xD;
      are the recipients of Methadone Maintenance Therapy. The investigators hypothesized that&#xD;
      subjects with minor alleles of those 4 SNPs will have longer QTc intervals than those with&#xD;
      major alleles, adjusting for the effects of other confounding factors such as age and gender&#xD;
      of the subjects, plasma methadone trough levels, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and&#xD;
      hypomagnesemia. The investigators also aimed to provide a model that will reliably predict&#xD;
      the magnitude QTc based on the SNPs data and other covariates mentioned above. This will&#xD;
      greatly assist in identifying methadone recipients who are at risk of developing prolonged&#xD;
      QTc or the more fatal torsade de pointes.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is one of the modalities to prevent HIV transmission&#xD;
      among injected drug users, particularly in opioid-dependent users. However,&#xD;
      methadone-associated cardiotoxicity is one of the fatal adverse events that limit the&#xD;
      widespread usage in certain groups of opioid-dependent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses / aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that subjects with minor alleles of those 4 SNPs would have&#xD;
      longer QTc intervals than those with major alleles, adjusting for the effects of other&#xD;
      confounding factors such as age and gender of the subjects, plasma methadone trough levels,&#xD;
      hypokalemia, hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. The investigators also aimed to provide a model&#xD;
      that will reliably predict the magnitude QTc based on the SNPs data and other covariates&#xD;
      mentioned above. This will greatly assist in identifying methadone recipients who are at risk&#xD;
      of developing prolonged QTc or the more fatal torsade de pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Sample Size Calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association between 4 KCNH2 SNPs&#xD;
      (1539C&gt;T, in exon 6 of KCNH2 gene; 1956T&gt;C, in exon 8 of KCNH2 gene), 2350C&gt;T (in exon 9 of&#xD;
      KCNH2 gene), 2690A&gt;C (Exon 11 of KCNH2 gene)) and prolongation of QTc interval in&#xD;
      opioid-dependent Kelantanese Malays who are the recipients of Methadone Maintenance Therapy .&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using single-proportion formula and the information required&#xD;
      was based on a similar prior study conducted among Singaporean Malay. It was concluded that&#xD;
      the sample size required is 105 patients. Since eligible patients were lacking, the&#xD;
      convenience (non-probability) sampling method was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial visit, relevant clinico-demographic details such as age, gender, history&#xD;
      of drug addiction and psychiatric illnesses, drug dependency patterns, other drug usage and&#xD;
      treatment-related issues for each patient were gathered. Subsequently a validated Malay&#xD;
      version of Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) questionnaire was administered to assess&#xD;
      any opioid withdrawal symptoms experienced by study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five (5) mls of blood was then withdrawn for each subject for the ascertainment of relevant&#xD;
      biochemical profile (serum potassium, magnesium, calcium), plasma methadone trough levels,&#xD;
      and KCNH2 SNPs genotyping. Drug screening for substances such as MDMA, benzodiazepines&#xD;
      methamphetamine, cannabis, marijuana were also carried out using urine dipstick test at urine&#xD;
      collection point. The colour and temperature of the urine were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QT measurement was obtained using calibrated Welch Allyn CP 50™ ECG (Electrocardiograph)&#xD;
      (Welch Allyn Australia Pty Ltd., New South Wales, Australia) machine, printed at a paper&#xD;
      speed of 25mm/s and voltage of 10mm/mV. QTc measurement was then manually calculated using&#xD;
      Fredericia's formula to correct for heart rate (R-R interval). All trained personnel who were&#xD;
      responsible for obtaining QTc measurement from each patient were blinded to other information&#xD;
      on serum biochemical profiles and methadone trough levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KCNH2 Genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA was extracted according to procedures modified from Bethesda Research Laboratories&#xD;
      based on the revisions made to the Brinboam and Doly method. The quantity and quality of the&#xD;
      extracted DNA were determined using NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop&#xD;
      Technologies, Inc. Wilmington, USA) with measurements done at 260 and 280 nm. The integrity&#xD;
      of the extracted DNA was determined using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis performed at 70&#xD;
      Volts for 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA in all samples were amplified for all 4KCNH2 SNPs were performed using 2-step nested&#xD;
      allele-specific multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers (both forward and&#xD;
      reverse) were designed according to the published sequence for KCNH2 (NC_000007.13). To&#xD;
      improve primer specificity, mismatch at its 3´ ends that were specific to either the variant&#xD;
      sequence or wild-type DNA sequence at the specified locus was made to the primers. Besides,&#xD;
      the primers were also designed and manipulated to differentiate between the different single&#xD;
      nucleotide changes/alleles during PCR amplification. To verify primers specificity, the BLAST&#xD;
      program at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ blast) was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first multiplex PCR, exon 6,8,9 and 11 were amplified under the following condition:&#xD;
      pre-denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 25-cycle of denaturation at 95°C for 15&#xD;
      seconds, annealing for 65°C for 15 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 10 seconds. Upon full&#xD;
      25-cycle completion, final extension phase lasted for 72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR products&#xD;
      (amplicons) were then resolved using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis at 130 Volts for 90&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCR products of the first multiplex PCR were then used as templates for second PCR which&#xD;
      targeted the 4 respective SNPs region for amplification. This was performed under the&#xD;
      following condition:pre-denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 25-cycle of&#xD;
      denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds, annealing for 69°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C&#xD;
      for 4 seconds. Upon full 25-cycle completion, final extension phase lasted for 72°C for 7&#xD;
      minutes. The PCR products (amplicons) were then resolved using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis&#xD;
      at 130 Volts for 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first products of the amplified regions in the Exons 6, 8, 9, and Exon11 were&#xD;
      subsequently submitted for direct DNA sequencing. QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, USA)&#xD;
      was used for purification of the PCR products. DNA sequencing was carried out by applying&#xD;
      3130XL genetic analyzer DNA sequencer (ABI, USA). The results were compared with the&#xD;
      published sequences for KCNH2 in the NCBI, accession number (NC_000007.13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The select equally likely or more extreme samples (SELOME) version of the Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      was employed to examine whether the distribution of the SNP alleles and genotype follow the&#xD;
      Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) assumption. Those SNPs that significantly deviated from the&#xD;
      HWE assumption were dropped from further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the associations between the 4SNPs and QTc interval (measured as continuous&#xD;
      variable) and build a statistical model that can reliably predict QTc intervals, simple and&#xD;
      multiple linear regression methods were used. Age and gender of the patients, plasma&#xD;
      methadone trough levels, serum potassium, calcium and magnesium were treated as confounding&#xD;
      factors whose effects on QTc were adjusted for.&#xD;
