  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it seems obvious that the high level of preoperative anxiety may affect&#xD;
      intraoperative anaesthetic requirements and recovery adversely, there are several&#xD;
      contradictory studies about this subject. Furthermore, the effects of anxiolytic&#xD;
      premedication are actually disputed: sedative premedication is widely administered but little&#xD;
      clinical evidence supports its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to evaluate the effects of pre-procedure anxiety for propofol needs in patients&#xD;
      receiving general anaesthetic procedure. We also want to know if premedication is useful&#xD;
      according to the preoperative anxiety level, in order to determine if a sub-group of patients&#xD;
      benefit from it.&#xD;

      This study will be carried out in solely at the institute of CHU de Reims, France (Reims&#xD;
      Teaching Hospital) from March 2017 to May 2017. Selected patients will be over the age of 18,&#xD;
      among those receiving general anaesthesia for surgery. Demographic data and medical history&#xD;
      will be collected after written consent. Before the anaesthetic procedure, an APAIS&#xD;
      questionnaire (Anxiety evaluation form) will be filled out by each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical, anaesthetic and surgical care will not be changed. In the operating room, we&#xD;
      will proceed with anaesthetic induction following a medical protocol according to the&#xD;
      practice of our hospital (TCI Target Controlled Infusion or manual induction): the propofol&#xD;
      infusion or injection is started with an initial effect-site concentration or dose and&#xD;
      increased step by step until patients present the clinical en points defined as LOC (loss of&#xD;
      consciousness, i.e. no response to a verbal command).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect-site concentration of propofol, induction time required for a loss of&#xD;
      consciousness (LOC), and preoperative incidents will be recorded by an anaesthetist student&#xD;
      nurse and will be recorded in a data book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, we will record any secondary effect attributable to premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after surgery, patients will be assessed with the EVAN-G questionnaire. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be done in sub-groups with variance analysis. We will also do multivariate&#xD;
      regression analysis according to the type of premedication, demographic data, preoperative&#xD;
      variable and preoperative anxiety level. If the number of included patients allows it, we&#xD;
      will do propensity score matching for premedication.&#xD;
