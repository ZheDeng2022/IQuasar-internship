      Research hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pregnant women undergoing induction of labor, intramuscular injection of dexamethasone may&#xD;
      accelerate induction delivery interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pregnant women undergoing induction of labor, does intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      dexamethasone accelerate induction delivery interval ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effect of intramuscular administration of dexamethasone on the&#xD;
      induction delivery interval in full term patients undergoing induction of labor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of corticosteroids is one of the methods put forward for the strengthening and&#xD;
      speeding up the process of labor. After identification of glucocorticoid receptors in human&#xD;
      amnion, the role of corticosteroids in starting the process of labor has been studied in&#xD;
      numerous studies. Some of them discussed the relation between dexamethasone injection and&#xD;
      labor induction but still there is insufficient data. So by the end of this study it may be&#xD;
      possible to assess the effect of intramuscular dexamethasone injection on shortening the&#xD;
      induction delivery interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of Study: Randomized Clinical Double Blind Trial .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting: The study will be conducted at Ain Shams Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population: Full term patients who attend to the labor ward in El Demerdash&#xD;
           Maternity Hospital and scheduled for induction of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample Size: Sample size was calculated using PASS® version 15.0, setting the power (β)&#xD;
           at 0.02 and the significance level (α) at 0.05. Data from previous reports (Kashanian et&#xD;
           al., 2008) indicated that mean Induction-Active phase Interval in women receiving 8mg of&#xD;
           dexamethasone before induction of labor and controls was 3.09±1.5 and 4.21±1.8 hours&#xD;
           respectively. Calculation according to these values produced a minimal sample size of 70&#xD;
           patients to be randomized equally to both groups. Assuming a drop-out rate of 15%, a&#xD;
           minimum drop-out inflated enrollment sample size of approximately 80 women will be&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethical Considerations: The study will be approved from the Ethical Committee of the&#xD;
           Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
           Informed written consent will be taken from all women before recruitment in the study,&#xD;
           and after extensive explanation and clear discussion of risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Procedures: A total of 80 women undergoing induction of labor will be included in&#xD;
           this study after taking their consent for this clinical trial after full explanation of&#xD;
           the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Forty patients undergoing induction of labor will receive 8 mg (2ml) of the product dexamethasone sodium phosphate intramuscular one hour before the initiation of labor induction in the form of epidrone ampoules which is a dexamethasone product from Epico-Egypt, and labor induction will be performed according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists protocol, i.e, starting by 25 mcg of PGE1 vaginally, in the form of Vagiprost, every 3-6 hours according to patient response, Dexamethasone will be given one hour before the first dose of Vagiprost, when bishop score reaches 6 to 8, oxytocin will be added by 5 drops/minute of 500 cc saline + 5 units of oxytocin with the dose increasing by 5-10 drops / minute every 30 minute till optimal contractions are reached which are three uterine contractions in 10 minutes and each lasting for 40-50 seconds</description>
