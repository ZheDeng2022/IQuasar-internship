        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, aged ≥ 65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to provide written and informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability of the participant (in the Principal Investigator's opinion) to comprehend the&#xD;
             full nature and purpose of the study including possible risks and side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Agreement to comply with the protocol and study restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Available for all study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. In good general health, self-reported and as judged by the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator/Clinical advisor based on medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Fluent in written and spoken English&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participant is willing to maintain habitual diet (including caffeine and alcohol) and&#xD;
             physical activity patterns throughout the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a bank account (required for payment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have any pre-existing significant acute or chronic co-existing medical condition /&#xD;
             illness which contraindicates, in the Principal Investigator's judgement, entry to the&#xD;
             study NOTE: the explicit exceptions to this are controlled (medicated) hypertension,&#xD;
             arthritis, asthma, hay fever, high cholesterol and reflux-related conditions. There&#xD;
             may be other, unforeseen, exceptions and these will be considered on a case-by-case&#xD;
             basis; i.e. participants may be allowed to progess to screening if they have a&#xD;
             condition/illness which would not interact with the active treatments or impede&#xD;
             performance&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of dementia, stroke and other neurological conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Traumatic loss of consciousness in the last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of epilepsy or Parkinson's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Anxiety, depression or any psychiatric disorder that the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             believes would interfere with the objectives of the study and requiring treatment in&#xD;
             the last 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Currently taking (from day of screening onwards) or have previously taken (last 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to screening) prescription medications that the Principal Investigator&#xD;
             believes would interfere with the objectives of the study, pose a safety risk or&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the study results such as psychoactive medication&#xD;
             (anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants,&#xD;
             anti-convulsants, centrally acting corticosteroids, opioid pain relievers) NOTE: the&#xD;
             explicit exceptions to this are hormone replacement treatments for female participants&#xD;
             where symptoms are stable, those medications used in the treatment of arthritis, high&#xD;
             blood pressure, high cholesterol and reflux-related conditions; and those taken 'as&#xD;
             needed' in the treatment of asthma and hay fever. As above, there may be other&#xD;
             instances of medication use which, where no interaction with the active treatments is&#xD;
             likely, participants may be able to progress to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently taking (from day of screening onwards) medication or dietary supplements&#xD;
             that the Principal Investigator believes would interfere with the objectives of the&#xD;
             study, pose a safety risk or confound the interpretation of the study results such as:&#xD;
             melatonin, vitamin E, multivitamins, B vitamin complex, ginkgo biloba, fish oil, St.&#xD;
             John's Wort or other cognitive enhancing dietary or herbal supplements over the study&#xD;
             period&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recent (within last 4 weeks prior to screening) or ongoing antibiotic therapy during&#xD;
             the intervention period&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Daily consumption of concentrated sources of probiotics and / or prebiotics within 2&#xD;
             weeks of screening and throughout the intervention period other than the provided&#xD;
             study products (e.g., probiotic / prebiotic tablets, capsules, drops or powders),&#xD;
             including yoghurt or yoghurt drinks&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have high blood pressure (systolic over 159 mm Hg or diastolic over 99 mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) outside of the range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have learning difficulties, dyslexia&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Have a visual impairment that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses&#xD;
             (including colour-blindness)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Current smoker (use of nicotine replacement products, vaping, gum, patches etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current misuse of alcohol, drug or prescription medications&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Excessive caffeine intake (&gt;500 mg per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Excessive alcohol consumption (drinking on 5 or more days a week or consuming &gt; 6&#xD;
             units of alcohol in a single session on 5 or more days a week) for 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             screening and during the intervention period&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Contraindication to any substance in the investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Principal Investigator believes that the participant may be uncooperative and / or&#xD;
             noncompliant and should therefore not participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Participant under legal or administrative supervision&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Have food intolerances / sensitivities&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Have any health condition that would prevent fulfilment of the study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Are unable or unwilling to complete all the study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
