  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal withdrawal syndrome is a series of signs and symptoms in infants exposed to opioids&#xD;
      in utero. Buprenorphine has demonstrated a 40% reduction in length of pharmacologic treatment&#xD;
      compared to oral morphine. These results were with an empirically derived dose. This study&#xD;
      will use pharmacokinetic modeling-informed dosing to clarify the dose/response relationship&#xD;
      and use a rational approach to define an optimal dose regimen. The clinical trial will be&#xD;
      open label, single arm design with a goal of initial testing of a new dosing regimen.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall rationale for this study is to explore new dose regimens in a small number of&#xD;
      patients. There is evidence from pharmacometric models with dose simulation that suggest&#xD;
      there is room for improvement in buprenorphine dosing. This study will explore these doses.&#xD;
      While the endpoint will be primarily pharmacokinetic, it is likely that the revised dose&#xD;
      regimen will be more effective and thus holds the potential for benefit for those infants&#xD;
      participating. This information will be used to feed back to the model and generate&#xD;
      rationally derived, optimal doses to be tested in subsequent efficacy trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a set of signs of withdrawal in an infant with in&#xD;
      utero exposure to opioids. Cardinal manifestations include increased muscle tone, autonomic&#xD;
      instability, irritability, poor sucking reflex, gastrointestinal symptoms, and impaired&#xD;
      weight gain. All infants are treated with non-pharmacologic methods such as swaddling,&#xD;
      rooming in with mother and minimization of stimuli. Despite these measures, ~50% of infants&#xD;
      require pharmacologic treatment to ensure proper growth and development. While the optimal&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment for NAS has not been identified, expert review identifies an opioid&#xD;
      as the primary therapy. In the US 80% of infants are treated with morphine and 20% with&#xD;
      methadone. Sublingual buprenorphine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in an open&#xD;
      label phase 1 clinical trial conducted by the Thomas Jefferson University Team [NCT00521248].&#xD;
      These data were used to plan the BBORN (Blinded Buprenorphine OR Neonatal morphine solution)&#xD;
      clinical trial [NCT01452789] comparing buprenorphine to morphine for NAS. BBORN demonstrated&#xD;
      a 40% reduction in length of treatment compared to morphine in a double blind fashion (New&#xD;
      England Journal of Medicine, June 2017). The external validity of this finding has been&#xD;
      supported by retrospective examination of buprenorphine used in a treatment paradigm at the&#xD;
      University of Cincinnati Medical Center, with a reduction in length of treatment of ~30% in&#xD;
      &gt;200 infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose selection for both the phase 1 trial and the efficacy trial (BBORN) were empirically&#xD;
      derived. A population pharmacokinetic model for buprenorphine in NAS has been published by&#xD;
      our group. In addition a pre-specified endpoint for the BBORN trial was a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      analysis of buprenorphine. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model from the BBORN study has&#xD;
      been published (Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, March 2018). The time to control of&#xD;
      symptoms was directly tied to buprenorphine exposure, which itself appeared to be driven&#xD;
      primarily by clearance. Among the strengths of pharmacometric models is the ability to&#xD;
      simulate in silico many potential dose regimens. In this manner, a dose regimen can be chosen&#xD;
      that is more likely to be in the desired range of concentrations. This approach also allows&#xD;
      for incorporation of covariates of drug exposure or response to treatment. This is much safer&#xD;
      and efficient than the traditional approach of choosing an empiric dose that would need to be&#xD;
      tested in clinical trial. An ideal dose would quickly reach this exposure while maintaining a&#xD;
      good safety margin. There was no evidence of decline in respiratory rate in infants treated&#xD;
      with higher doses of buprenorphine compared to lower doses, or those treated with&#xD;
      buprenorphine compared to those treated with morphine. This may allow a higher initial dose&#xD;
      to more quickly reach therapeutic buprenorphine concentrations. This ultimately could lead to&#xD;
      shorter lengths of treatment and stay, though achieving this goal is outside of the scope of&#xD;
      the current proposed project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, buprenorphine at the dose and schedule used in prior clinical trials has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be safe and effective. The goal of the proposed study is to simulate a dose&#xD;
      of sublingual buprenorphine for NAS using pharmacometric modelling techniques. This dose will&#xD;
      be tested in infants requiring treatment for NAS. Pharmacokinetic samples would be collected&#xD;
      and used to confirm and refine the pharmacokinetic model. The proposed study would allow&#xD;
      broad examination and refinement of the exposure/response relationship. This optimized dose&#xD;
      could later be used in an efficacy trial.&#xD;
