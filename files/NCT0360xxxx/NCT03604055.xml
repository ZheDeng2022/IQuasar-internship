      Background. Recently, treatment of endobronchial hamartomas with interventional bronchoscopic&#xD;
      methods has become possible. Although there are several reports of therapeutic benefits, the&#xD;
      protocol of administration varies between centers and high recurrence rates continue to be a&#xD;
      problem. In this study, the investigators aimed to show that cryotherapy applied to the root&#xD;
      of the bronchial wall after removal of the intraluminal portion of endobronchial hamartoma&#xD;
      with interventional bronchoscopic methods can prevent recurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Between 2012 and 2016, the treatment outcomes and long-term follow-up data of 21&#xD;
      consecutive patients with symptomatic endobronchial hamartomas treated by interventional&#xD;
      bronchoscopic methods were prospectively recorded. After debulking, cryotherapy was applied&#xD;
      to the root of the bronchial wall of all lesions. The data were analyzed retrospectively.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hamartomas are the most common benign pulmonary tumors. The incidence varies between 0.025%&#xD;
      and 0.032%. Endobronchial hamartomas constitute 10-20% of all pulmonary hamartomas. Pulmonary&#xD;
      hamartomas are usually asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally. In endobronchial&#xD;
      hamartomas, at least one of the symptoms of airway obstruction such as cough, hemoptysis and&#xD;
      dyspnea are most commonly seen (80%). The results of bronchoscopic removal of symptomatic&#xD;
      endobronchial hamartomas and recurrence rates have been the subject of several studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy is an endobronchial therapy based on the cytotoxic effects of extreme cold on&#xD;
      tumor tissues. Excessive cold causes intracellular and extracellular ice crystals to form in&#xD;
      the affected tissue. These crystals damage intracellular organelles, especially mitochondria.&#xD;
      The most lethal effect is the formation of intracellular ice crystals. This effect results&#xD;
      from fast freezing and slow thawing cycles. In clinical practice, cryotherapy is used as an&#xD;
      endobronchial treatment method capable of destroying tumor cells at a depth of 10 mm with a&#xD;
      rigid probe and at a depth of 3 mm with a flexible probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators investigated the treatment and long-term follow-up results of patients who&#xD;
      underwent cryotherapy to the site of origin on the airway wall after the luminal part of the&#xD;
      symptomatic endobronchial hamartomas was removed by interventional bronchoscopic methods. We&#xD;
      aimed to determine the benefit of cryotherapy to conventional endobronchial debulking at the&#xD;
      sites of origin of hamartomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia was administered by an intravenous anesthesia technique. Patients were&#xD;
      intubated with a rigid bronchoscope (Effer-Dumon, 11 mm diameter, 43 cm length, Efer&#xD;
      Endoscopy, Marseille, France). Debulking procedures were performed by mechanical tumor&#xD;
      resection (MTR) using the tip of the rigid bronchoscope, rigid pliers or argon plasma&#xD;
      coagulation assisted MTR (ERBE ICC 200/APC 300 electrosurgical unit, rigid APC probe, 50 cm&#xD;
      length, 2.3 mm diameter; ERBE, Medizintechnik, GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) or cryorecanalization&#xD;
      (ERBOKRYO® CA unit, ERBE flexible cryoprobe 2.4 mm diameter, 90 cm length or ERBE rigid&#xD;
      cryoprobe 3 mm diameter, 53 cm length; ERBE, Medizintechnik, GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) or&#xD;
      electrocautery - snare probe (Erbotom ICC 200 electrosurgical unit ERBE, Medizintechnik GmbH,&#xD;
      Tübingen, Germany and Electrosurgical snare probe SD-7C-1, loop diameter 23 mm, length 1050&#xD;
      mm, Olympus EndoTherapy, Tokyo, Japan). An innovation of study was that cryotherapy (Using&#xD;
      the same equipment as cryorecanalization) was performed in the regions where the lesions&#xD;
      originated after debulking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation for intermittent and&#xD;
      continuous numerical variables, and categorical variables were expressed as number of cases&#xD;
      and &quot;(%)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been approved by the local ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      from all patients.&#xD;
