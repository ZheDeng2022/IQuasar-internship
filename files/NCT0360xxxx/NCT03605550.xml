  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators want to learn more about the safety of the study&#xD;
      drug, PTC596 has when taken during radiation. The investigators also want to learn about the&#xD;
      effects, if any, these drugs have on children and young adults with brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are asking people to be in this research study who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      a high grade glioma (HGG) including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) to be in the&#xD;
      research, because they have scheduled to have radiation to treat their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two parts. The goal of the first part is to find the dose of PTC596&#xD;
      that can be given with radiation without causing serious side effects. The purpose of this&#xD;
      surgical study is to test the amount of a study drug that may be found in the tumor and blood&#xD;
      when given prior to and during a planned surgery for removal of the recurrent tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the first part:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the highest safe dose of PTC596 that can be given together with radiation therapy&#xD;
           without causing severe side effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn what kind of side effects can be caused by PTC596 with radiation therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the pharmacology of PTC596;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the biological effects of PTC596 on the cells in their body including&#xD;
           any changes to the tumor DNA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether PTC596 with radiation therapy is a beneficial treatment for their&#xD;
           tumor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if there are any changes to participants quality of life when taking PTC596.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the surgical part are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn if PTC596 is able to reach the tumor in the brain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn what kind of side effects can be caused by PTC596 with radiation therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the pharmacology of PTC596;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the biological effects of PTC596 on the cells in their body including&#xD;
           any changes to the tumor DNA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether PTC596 with radiation therapy is a beneficial treatment for their&#xD;
           tumor;&#xD;

      This study consists of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The phase I, dose-finding component of the trial, to estimate the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PTC596 in combination with radiation&#xD;
           therapy followed by maintenance therapy with PTC596, in children with newly-diagnosed&#xD;
           DIPG and HGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Once the RP2D has been determined, the investigators will enroll a surgical cohort of&#xD;
           patients with either a. newly-diagnosed DIPG who are amenable to undergo biopsy per&#xD;
           recommendation of their treating physician OR b. Newly-diagnosed HGG for whom a second&#xD;
           surgical resection is warranted for further debulking or to achieve a near-total or&#xD;
           gross total resection after initial diagnosis has been made, but prior to start of&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the Phase I study will be to determine the MTD or RP2D of PTC596 in&#xD;
      combination with radiation therapy and to assess pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      studies. Dose-modifying toxicities for maintenance therapy will also be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK studies will be collected on days 1 and 4 (doses 1 and 2) of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycle 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTC596 will be given twice weekly on Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday, for 6-7&#xD;
      weeks, during daily radiation therapy. Once radiation therapy with concomitant PTC596 is&#xD;
      completed, all patients will continue with maintenance therapy which will begin immediately&#xD;
      after completion of RT for up to 25 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the Surgical Cohort Stratum are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the ability of PTC596 to inhibit BMI-1 activity in tumor and peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) of children with newly-diagnosed DIPG or HGG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of PTC596 in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and&#xD;
           tumor tissue of children with newly-diagnosed DIPG or HGG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D has been established, up to 12 patients will be enrolled on the surgical study.&#xD;
      Patients eligible for the Surgical Stratum include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. newly-diagnosed DIPG patients who are amenable to undergo biopsy per the recommendation&#xD;
           of their treating physician OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. newly-diagnosed HGG patients for whom a second surgical resection is warranted for&#xD;
           further debulking or to achieve a near-total or gross total resection after initial&#xD;
           diagnosis has been made, but prior to start of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on the surgical cohort study will commence treatment with the surgical cycle. During&#xD;
      the surgical cycle, patients will be treated with two doses of PTC596, on days 1 and 4 of the&#xD;
      surgical cycle prior to biopsy or re-resection; the second dose of PTC596 should ideally be&#xD;
      administered 3-6 hours before surgery (but may be up to 12 hours prior to surgery). The&#xD;
      concentration of PTC596 will then be measured in the tumor and accompanying blood sample by&#xD;
      mass spectrometry. BMI-1 expression and the effects of BMI-1 inhibition in DIPG and HGG on&#xD;
      gene regulation through gene expression profiling and epigenetic studies will be assessed in&#xD;
      tissue and plasma. The PK and PD studies on the surgical cohort study are mandatory. The&#xD;
      surgical cycle will end when patients begin RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must begin RT at least two weeks after the date of surgery and may restart PTC596 on&#xD;
      Mondays and Thursdays or Tuesdays and Fridays (twice weekly) after starting RT. Following&#xD;
      completion of radiotherapy, patients will immediately start maintenance therapy on a Monday&#xD;
      and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday schedule. Patients can continue to receive therapy with&#xD;
      PTC596 for up to 25 cycles.&#xD;
