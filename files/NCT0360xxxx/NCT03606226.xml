  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The health benefits of regular physical activity and a healthy diet are well established in&#xD;
      literature. Regular physical activity and a healthy diet may reduce the risk of certain&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, and contribute&#xD;
      to mental health and emotional benefits, as well as social wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the health benefits of regular physical activity and healthy diet, most of the Hong&#xD;
      Kong people live a sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle and do not meet the WHO's recommendation&#xD;
      on physical activity for health and on fruit and vegetables intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to examine the physical activity and dietary attitudes and behavioural patterns&#xD;
      of the Hong Kong community and provide a clear direction for future health education and&#xD;
      awareness projects and campaigns aimed towards improving the general health of the Hong Kong&#xD;
      community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health benefits of regular physical activity and a healthy diet are well established in&#xD;
      health literature. Regular physical activity is positively associated with psychological&#xD;
      well-being (Bize, Johnson, &amp; Plotnikoff, 2007), and inversely correlated with various&#xD;
      illnesses (Pedersen &amp; Saltin, 2006). Similarly, a healthy diet may reduce the risk of certain&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer (World Health&#xD;
      Organization, 2015a; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2015), , and can also&#xD;
      contribute to mental health and emotional benefits, as well as social well-being (Schooling,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of physical inactivity and an unhealthy diet are also well established in&#xD;
      the literature, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting that physical inactivity&#xD;
      and unhealthy diets are two of the four main modifiable behavioural risk factors that&#xD;
      contribute to non-communicable diseases such as heart diseases, diabetes, and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the health benefits of regular physical activity and the detrimental effects of&#xD;
      physical inactivity, the WHO recommends that children and young people aged 5 - 17 years&#xD;
      should perform at least 60 minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity per&#xD;
      day, and adults aged 18 years or above should perform at least 150 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week. In&#xD;
      terms of diet, the WHO recommends that for adults that a daily healthy diet should contain at&#xD;
      least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables, no more than 50 g of free sugars, and no more than&#xD;
      5 g of salt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the health benefits of regular physical activity, most Hong Kong people live a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle. Many do not meet the World Health Organization targets for physical&#xD;
      activity. The Department of Health (2015) reports that only 15.3% of local children aged 5 -&#xD;
      14 years meet the WHO recommendations on physical activity for health, and the 2014&#xD;
      Behavioural Risk Factor Survey indicates that only 37.4% of local adults aged 18 - 64 years&#xD;
      meet the WHO recommendations on physical activity for health. Similarly, most Hong Kong&#xD;
      people do not adopt a healthy diet, with about four-fifths (79.0%) of adults aged 18 - 64&#xD;
      years failing to meet the WHO's recommendation on fruits and vegetable intake. Only 18.7% of&#xD;
      local adults aged 18 - 64 years consume 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day&#xD;
      (WHO, 2015b; WHO, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the aforementioned figures indicate, members of the Hong Kong community do not meet the&#xD;
      WHO recommended physical activity and healthy diet standards. Since these standards of&#xD;
      regular physical activity and a healthy diet benefit health and wellbeing and can protect&#xD;
      against non-communicable diseases, it is important, in order to improve general health, to&#xD;
      improve physical activity and healthy diet practices and patterns in the Hong Kong community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to examine the Hong Kong people's attitudes and behavioural patterns in&#xD;
      relation to physical activity and a healthy diet. Attitude-behaviour gaps may be identified,&#xD;
      providing a clear starting point and direction for future health education and awareness&#xD;
      projects and campaigns aimed towards improving the general health of the Hong Kong community.&#xD;
