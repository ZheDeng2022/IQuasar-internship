    <textblock>
      Will injection(s) of autologous culture-expanded AMSCs be safe and efficacious for treatment&#xD;
      of painful Hip OA, and if so, which dosing regimen is most effective?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will enroll 24 subjects with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the hip.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either a single dose of 30 million autologous culture-expanded&#xD;
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs), or two doses of AMSCs (with one month&#xD;
      interval between doses) via ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 24 months past their last injection to determine the local and systemic safety&#xD;
      of single and two-dose injections of AMSCs in the treatment of symptomatic hip OA.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for inclusion into this study, the subjects must fulfill all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female ages 18-65 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             â€¢ Persons of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             receiving the study drug and will agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year&#xD;
             following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing potential&#xD;
             are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for&#xD;
             fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to the&#xD;
             administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the result will be&#xD;
             confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a&#xD;
             central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by&#xD;
             qualified personnel using kit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Persons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the&#xD;
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring&#xD;
             will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with pregnancy will&#xD;
             be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Chronic (&gt; 3 months), unilaterally symptomatic, primary hip OA. Patients with episodes&#xD;
             of contralateral hip pain that is asymptomatic at the time of enrollment will be&#xD;
             eligible for inclusion. However, as outlined in the primary study endpoints, patients&#xD;
             with previous episodes of contralateral hip pain who experience a repeat episode of&#xD;
             contralateral pain similar to their established pattern of pain during the course of&#xD;
             the trial will not be considered as having experienced an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Radiographic hip OA of TÃ¶nnis Grade 1 - 2, accompanied by at least mild sclerosis and&#xD;
             joint space narrowing, as agreed upon by two study co-investigators without underlying&#xD;
             structural hip abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous 6 week or longer trial of one of the following conservative treatments:&#xD;
             activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications or&#xD;
             injection therapy (e.g. cortisone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to routinely walk without assistance (e.g. cane, walker)&#xD;

          7. Clinically stable target hip&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No surgery planned in the target hip for at least 12 months following the last&#xD;
             injection&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Completed general physical and well-being evaluation with primary care provider within&#xD;
             12 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Fully understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with&#xD;
             the treatment plan, including fat harvesting, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging,&#xD;
             and follow-up visits and assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Can provide written informed consent and complete HIPAA documentation after the nature&#xD;
             of the study is fully explained and prior to any study-related procedure&#xD;
