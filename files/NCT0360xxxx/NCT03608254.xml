      This study aimed to examine the effects of a one-time dose of 100% watermelon juice on&#xD;
      circulating lycopene levels and measures of vascular health among a cohort of postmenopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      Purpose and Objectives Arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction are early independent&#xD;
      predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death for women ages 60 and&#xD;
      older in the United States. It is well-known that age-related decreases in vascular function&#xD;
      are partially due to increases in oxidative stress and inflammation. In attempts to combat&#xD;
      CVD, previous studies have investigated provision of isolated food compounds in supplement&#xD;
      form. For example, purified lycopene has been shown to decrease oxidative stress, and our&#xD;
      previous work supports the supplemental use of glutamine and arginine powders for improving&#xD;
      vascular endothelial function of older adults. Watermelon is among the greatest plant sources&#xD;
      of arginine and glutamine, and it is one of the richest sources of lycopene. However,&#xD;
      clinical studies evaluating the whole food have not been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Healthy Eating Index, only 27% of women ages 60 and older meet the daily&#xD;
      dietary recommendations for 2.5 fruit servings. Likewise, although no Recommended Dietary&#xD;
      Allowance for lycopene exists, this age group consumes less lycopene daily than is provided&#xD;
      in one serving of watermelon. While reasons for poor fruit intake among older adults are&#xD;
      multifactorial, difficulty chewing and inability to prepare fresh foods in the home&#xD;
      environment have been noted as significant barriers to fresh fruit and vegetable intake. Of&#xD;
      note, a previous systematic review suggests that 100% fruit and vegetable juices may be&#xD;
      practical vehicles for improving intake of antioxidant nutrients among older adults. The&#xD;
      provision of 100% watermelon juice to older adult women represents a practical, innovative&#xD;
      approach to increase consumption of a food containing multiple components that may act in&#xD;
      synergy to improve vascular function. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the effects of a one-time serving of 100% watermelon juice on blood vessel function and serum&#xD;
      lycopene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether consumption of a 12-ounce serving of 100% watermelon juice by&#xD;
           non-obese women ages 60-75 will result in increased levels of serum lycopene.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotheses: Acute supplementation with 100% watermelon juice will result in increased&#xD;
           serum lycopene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether consumption of a 12-ounce serving of 100% watermelon juice by&#xD;
           non-obese women ages 60-75 will result in improved vascular endothelial function as&#xD;
           assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and decreased arterial stiffness as assessed by&#xD;
           pulse wave analysis (PWA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Acute supplementation with 100% watermelon juice will result in improved vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function and decreased arterial stiffness.&#xD;
