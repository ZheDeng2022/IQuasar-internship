      Scientific background(Statement of the problem):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental caries is a disease that occurs through complex interaction of four major factors: the&#xD;
      host, acidogenic bacteria, fermentable carbohydrates and time. There are many factors which&#xD;
      contribute to dental caries incidence but do not seen in clinical examination. Those things&#xD;
      are considered as dental caries risk factors, such as socioeconomic, attitudes, knowledge and&#xD;
      behavior toward oral health. These risk factors play an important role in incidence of the&#xD;
      disease, significantly associated with disease progression . The traditional &quot;drill and fill&#xD;
      &quot;concept has served to restore function and esthetics but it has failed to prevent&#xD;
      development of new carious lesions. In recent years; better understanding of nature of&#xD;
      carious process has changed this operative treatment concept to non destructive risk -based&#xD;
      caries management. Caries risk assessment is a procedure used to predict dental caries&#xD;
      development before clinical onset of disease, through assessing risk factors contributing to&#xD;
      progress of dental caries and let oral health care professionals to be more active in&#xD;
      identifying and referring high risk patients for proper treatment and required prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for carrying out this study : Many studies have measured dentists' knowledge toward&#xD;
      caries risk assessment all over the world, but no studies have examined Egyptian Dentists'&#xD;
      subjective ratings of the importance of specific caries risk factors or tested whether they&#xD;
      use this information in treatment planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the aim of this study to assess knowledge, attitude and practice toward caries risk&#xD;
      assessment and management among group of dental interns in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the Dental interns:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Challenge the knowledge of the intern dentists regarding caries risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Encourage the concept of minimally invasive dentistry to be applied in clinical&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accurate caries risk assessment in patients can guide clinician to give attention of&#xD;
           their resources to high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will benefit from proper knowledge, attitude and practice of dentists, thus proper&#xD;
           treatment will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral modification of patients toward oral hygiene practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing patient risk of developing advanced disease and may even arrest disease&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to the Community:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Imparting knowledge of Caries risk assessment to dentists will benefit their patients&#xD;
      especially high-caries risk patients by giving proper preventive interventions that help to&#xD;
      reduce the expected elevated incidence and severity of caries in the future, therefore the&#xD;
      whole community will benefit.&#xD;
