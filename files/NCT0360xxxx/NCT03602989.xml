  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection and intervention of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is critical in preventing&#xD;
      DR-related vision loss among type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) patients,&#xD;
      currently estimated at over 100 million in China alone. Yet the healthcare resources,&#xD;
      particularly retinal specialists, are in short supply and unevenly distributed. In order to&#xD;
      help address this enormous mismatch and implement population-based screening, an artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) enabled, cloud based software is developed by training a custom-built&#xD;
      convolutional neural network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of such device in detecting&#xD;
      referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate non-proliferative DR or worse).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center clinical study is designed to validate the performance of an&#xD;
      AI enabled software - Shenzhen SiBright AIDRScreening - in detecting referable diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy (RDR, defined as more than mild NPDR) among study subjects primarily by&#xD;
      evaluating its sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects enrolled in this trial are patients with T1DM and T2DM. For those who qualify,&#xD;
      color fundus images of each eyes are taken and then independently graded for RDR by both the&#xD;
      device under test and a centralized reading center, which, for the purpose of this trial, is&#xD;
      the Image Reading Center at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University (ZIRC). The&#xD;
      grading from ZIRC serves as the gold standard to compare the device performance against.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial plans to enroll 1000 subjects. With a 95% confidence interval, the sensitivity is&#xD;
      expected to be at least 85% whereas the specificity at 90% or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus image quality assessment is performed according to the National DR Screening Imaging&#xD;
      and Grading Guideline jointly published by Chinese Ophthalmological Society and Chinese&#xD;
      Medical Doctor Association in 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of RDR is based on the National DR Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline&#xD;
      published by Chinese Ophthalmological Society in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief overview of the clinical protocol is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Candidate screening phase: recruiting qualified trial subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical phase: imaging and grading by AI and ZIRC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis phase: comparing two outputs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Closing phase: final report and archiving&#xD;

          1. As it is difficult to obtain fundus images of satisfactory quality with small pupils,&#xD;
             mydriasis is advisable under certain circumstances except if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. the subject is allergic to mydriatic drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. the subject's intraocular pressure (IOP) â‰¥ 22 mmHg;&#xD;

             examination and imaging;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has severe vitreous hemorrhage;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has received fundus laser treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;

             transposition, etc., BUT cataract surgery or external eye surgery are exempt from&#xD;
             exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
