  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by complex molecular and genetic&#xD;
      changes. The high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor,&#xD;
      programmed death receptor ligands 1 (PD-L1) expression, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      damage in ovarian tumors provide several targets for treatment and maintenance of disease&#xD;
      response. Given the unmet medical need of participants with advanced or metastatic ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, this study design will enable investigators to provide participants with current SOC&#xD;
      for ovarian cancer for the duration of the study. This is a global, multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled Phase 3 study that will primarily compare progressive survival rate&#xD;
      of PD-L1 positive patients and also to compare progression-free survival (PFS) of all&#xD;
      participants with Stage III or IV high-grade nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer treated&#xD;
      with platinum-based combination therapy, dostarlimab, and niraparib to SOC platinum-based&#xD;
      combination therapy. The currently recommended SOC therapy for the first line treatment of&#xD;
      Stage III or IV ovarian cancer is the combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin, with or&#xD;
      without concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab. Participants will receive SOC during the&#xD;
      chemotherapy Run-In period (cycle 1) before randomization to study treatment (cycle 2).&#xD;
      Concurrent bevacizumab use must be determined prior to randomization at cycle 2.&#xD;
      Approximately 1228 participants will be enrolled into the study and the duration of the study&#xD;
      will be approximately 78 months.&#xD;
