      A double-blind, randomized, intra-subject placebo-controlled, multicenter, multiple dose&#xD;
      study, evaluating safety, proof of mechanism, preliminary efficacy and systemic exposure in&#xD;
      subjects with confirmed DDEB or RDEB diagnosis with one or more pathogenic mutations in exon&#xD;
      73 in the COL7A1 gene.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and tolerability, proof of mechanism, systemic&#xD;
      exposure and preliminary efficacy following topical application of QR-313 to subjects with&#xD;
      confirmed DDEB or RDEB with one or more pathogenic mutations in exon 73 in the COL7A1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to two Target Wound Areas (TWAs) per subject will be selected and randomized. Each TWA&#xD;
      will be treated with IMP for 8 weeks, either QR-313 or matching placebo. All subjects will&#xD;
      continue to be followed up for 8 weeks post last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored through home visits and site visits. An imaging system will be&#xD;
      used to assess the target wound at all home and study site visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QR-313 is a 21-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotide (AON) designed to hybridize to a specific&#xD;
      sequence in the COL7A1 pre-messengerRNA (pre-mRNA).&#xD;
