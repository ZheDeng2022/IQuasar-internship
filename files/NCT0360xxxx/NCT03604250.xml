      Human beings react differently to changes in diet, exercise, and sleep patterns. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to (1) learn how individuals react to lifestyle choices and suggestions by&#xD;
      examining a small group of people with similar health and lifestyle profiles; and (2) to&#xD;
      develop algorithmic policies (male/female) that will help people optimize their health&#xD;
      through lifestyle interventions and supplementation with prebiotics.&#xD;

      Human beings react differently to changes in diet, exercise, and sleep patterns. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is two-fold and consists of two phases involving the same subjects. In the first&#xD;
      phase, the study aims to learn how individuals react to lifestyle choices and suggestions by&#xD;
      examining a small group of people with similar health and lifestyle profiles. Specifically,&#xD;
      how their food choices, physical activity pattern, sleep pattern, and stress levels affect&#xD;
      glucose metabolism, stress response, inflammation, and microbiome composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, the investigator's goal is to use the data collected to&#xD;
      develop algorithmic policies that will help people optimize their health through lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions and supplementation with prebiotics. The ultimate goal is to achieve&#xD;
      optimization of glucose and stress regulation, inflammation state, and microbiome composition&#xD;
      by observing real-time variations of these regulatory systems through the use of wearable&#xD;
      health-monitoring devices and providing lifestyle suggestions via a mobile application.&#xD;
