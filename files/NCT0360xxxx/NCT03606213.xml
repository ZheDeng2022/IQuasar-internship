  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central premise of our program is that durable control of HIV in the absence of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (&quot;remission&quot;) will require the generation of de novo potent and&#xD;
      sustained HIV-specific CD8+ cell responses that target evolutionarily conserved epitopes. Our&#xD;
      program is inspired by the recent success of VGX-3100 (Inovio), a DNA therapeutic vaccine for&#xD;
      HPV that leads to histopathologic regression of pre-malignant lesions in people and is&#xD;
      associated with a potent, sustained boost to HPV-specific CD8+ T cell populations. A closely&#xD;
      related multi-clade gag/pol/env DNA vaccine administered with an IL-12 DNA plasmid (PENNVAX,&#xD;
      Inovio) has been studied for HIV prevention and is known to be both safe and highly&#xD;
      immunogenic. In a randomized placebo-controlled study we will compare the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      anti-reservoir activities of gag/pol DNA versus gag/pol/env DNA (both administered with&#xD;
      IL-12). We will determine for the first time in established HIV disease whether presence of&#xD;
      env in a DNA vaccine blunts T cell responses to more conserved Gag-specific and Pol-specific&#xD;
      epitopes. We will also determine if Env-specific responses (which will presumably be mediated&#xD;
      by antibodies and ADCC) have a measurable effect on reservoir.&#xD;

    <description>Electroporation (EP) is a technology in which an electrical field is applied to increase the permeability of cell membranes and thereby enhance the uptake of drugs, vaccines, or other agents into target cells. This technology has been used in the last decade in both therapeutics and vaccinations. EP is currently being used to deliver cancer vaccines and therapeutics as well as in gene therapy. The expression levels are increased by as much as 3 orders of magnitude over plasmid injection alone.</description>
