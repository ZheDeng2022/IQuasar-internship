  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TACE against HCC is the standard of care for BCLC stage B patients. In this exploratory&#xD;
      study, the investigators assess the efficacy of TACE with or without adagloxad&#xD;
      simolenin/OBI-821 treatment in GALNT14 &quot;non-TT&quot; HCC population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common solid cancers worldwide and the third&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related death. Early stage HCC can be cured by surgical removal or&#xD;
      non-surgical ablation procedures, albeit a high recurrence rate up to 75% in 5 years remains&#xD;
      an unsolved problem. On the other hand, in patients with unresectable HCC, the &quot;standard&#xD;
      therapy&quot; is still under intensive clinical investigations. In patients without portal vein&#xD;
      occlusion/thrombosis or extrahepatic metastasis, namely Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer&#xD;
      (BCLC) Stage B, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is believed to be an&#xD;
      effective palliative treatment. The beneficial effect of TACE on overall survival has been&#xD;
      mild to moderate as reviewed in a previous study. Thus, TACE is generally considered a&#xD;
      &quot;palliative&quot; therapy. TACE induces tumor necrosis but at the same time, it also induces&#xD;
      angiogenesis owing to the increases of hypoxia-inducible factors and endothelial growth&#xD;
      factors to trigger regrowth of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been known that GALNT14 genotype is associated with treatment responses. Patients with&#xD;
      GALNT14 &quot;TT&quot; genotype response well to both TACE and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new immunotherapy is directed against Globo H, a carbohydrate antigen that is expressed at&#xD;
      high levels on the surface of a variety of tumor cells. These Globo H-specific antibodies can&#xD;
      effectively induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as well as antibody-dependent&#xD;
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by IgM and IgG, respectively, together with other cellular&#xD;
      immune responses to kill tumors. In the clinical setting, Globo H has been evaluated as the&#xD;
      target of active immunotherapy in a few clinical trials including an ongoing Phase II/III&#xD;
      trial of adagloxad simolenin/OBI-821 sponsored by OBI Pharma, Inc., as a potential treatment&#xD;
      for stage IV metastatic breast cancers and possibly other cancer types expressing Globo&#xD;
      series TACAs. Although vaccination with adagloxad simolenin/OBI-821 did not improve&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer,&#xD;
      in a post-hoc analysis, patients who developed a humoral immune response to Globo H had a&#xD;
      longer PFS than those who did not, indicating that adagloxad simolenin/OBI-821 treatment&#xD;
      could be of benefit when an antibody response can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, overexpression of tumor-specific antigen Globo H can contribute to enhanced&#xD;
      tumor angiogenesis and tumor-associated immune suppression, and in turn, positively correlate&#xD;
      with tumor aggressiveness and poor survival in patients. In the present study, only &quot;non-TT&quot;&#xD;
      (less favorable) groups will be enrolled and the patients will be randomized to examine the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the TACE + adagloxad simolenin/OBI-821 treatment is beneficial in the BCLC&#xD;
      class B, advanced HCC patients.&#xD;

    <description>Adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822) is a glyco-conjugated protein comprised of a carbohydrate tumor antigen. Globo H allyl glycoside is covalently linked to a carrier protein KLH, presented in a dominant trimer form with molecular weight between 1200-1395 kDa., to form Adagloxad simolenin (OBI-822) (Globo H-KLH) OBI-821 is a saponin based adjuvant structurally similar to descriptions found in the literature for another adjuvant, QS-21.&#xD;
Adagloxad simolenin will be mixed with OBI-821 before administration.</description>
