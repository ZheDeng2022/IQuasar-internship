    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of a web-based app compared to the treatment as&#xD;
      usual without an app for the telemonitoring of patients with chronic pain. Two conditions&#xD;
      will be set:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. usual treatment (waiting list)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. usual treatment + app&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is defined as one that lasts for at least three to six months, provided that&#xD;
      this time is greater than the normal healing period of an injury. This pathology has become&#xD;
      an important public health problem due to its high prevalence. In particular, it is estimated&#xD;
      that it affects 20-30% of the adult population around the world. Medical interventions are&#xD;
      the first-line treatment in recent clinical practice guidelines. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of medical interventions is only modest. Treatments significantly reduce pain&#xD;
      on average, but the effect tends to be small . In addition, the drugs are not effective for a&#xD;
      large percentage of patients. What these and other research suggest is that focusing only on&#xD;
      large sample studies and the use of average change scores calls into question the usefulness&#xD;
      of current patient-centered treatments. As noted by Dr. Turk, when data are averaged, various&#xD;
      pain syndromes, drugs, surgical procedures, and studies in different countries are often&#xD;
      included, which may mask the efficacy results of different treatments with Different samples.&#xD;
      Single case methodology could be one of the ways to overcome these limitations. The single&#xD;
      case investigation is a type of experimental study that offers experimental control within a&#xD;
      single case. Some studies have already demonstrated the usefulness of these designs in&#xD;
      chronic pain. In fact, the benefits of using this methodology as opposed to large sample&#xD;
      studies were discussed recently during the 10th Congress of the European Pain Federation.&#xD;
      These benefits include the need for a reduced number of participants, the ability to follow&#xD;
      clinical evolution in real time and continuously, the amount of data provided, and&#xD;
      applicability when using a control group is impractical or unethical. The investigators&#xD;
      conducting the present investigation recently conducted a study at the Pain Unit of the&#xD;
      Hospital General de Castellón to explore the effectiveness of current medical treatments.&#xD;
      According to previous investigations, the treatment effect was only small (d = 0.32) and only&#xD;
      a percentage of the patients (18.1%) had a clinically significant reduction of pain (ie a&#xD;
      reduction greater than 30% ). From these results and the literature reviewed, a single case&#xD;
      design could be an alternative method for research in the Pain Unit. However, the&#xD;
      implementation of this type of methodology can be very costly due to the continuous&#xD;
      evaluation of the evolution of the patient. In this sense, several studies have already shown&#xD;
      that mobile applications (app) can effectively control the evolution of a wide range of&#xD;
      pathologies in health settings . In fact, a recent controlled clinical study found that&#xD;
      ecological records performed with mobile app had greater reliability than paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      records. Rosser and Eccleston conducted a comprehensive review of existing apps for pain and&#xD;
      the conclusion was that there was little evidence to support the use of current apps.&#xD;
      Specifically, these authors showed that most apps did not specify whether their content was&#xD;
      validated, did not include psychological components and none had been applied in a clinical&#xD;
      study. In light of these results, Dr. Carlos Suso Ribera and Dr. Ribera Canudas contacted the&#xD;
      research team Labpsitec of Jaume I University, who were developing an application for pain&#xD;
      called &quot;Pain Monitor&quot;. Dr. Carlos Suso Ribera and Dr. Ribera Canudas of the Pain Unit&#xD;
      collaborated with Dr. Azucena García Palacios and Dr. Diana Castilla López of the Universitat&#xD;
      Jaume I in the final development of the application of pain, Following the guidelines of&#xD;
      Rosser and Eccleston. App content validity and usability was tested in a previous study at&#xD;
      the pain unit of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Suso-Ribera et al., in preparation). Thus, the&#xD;
      study objective is to test if the introduction of this tool in the day-to-day work of the&#xD;
      pain unit improves pain management of chronic pain patients. To do this, it is necessary to&#xD;
      compare the evolution of patients who follow the usual treatment at the pain unit (without&#xD;
      app) with a group of patients who do use the Pain Monitor app.&#xD;
