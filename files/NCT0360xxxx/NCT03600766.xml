      To study the impact of mirabegron, a B3-adrenoceptor agonist, in the treatment of ED in&#xD;
      patients with LUTS secondary to BPH and concomitant ED.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major world-wide problem. In United Stated of America, ED&#xD;
      affects 26/1000 man yearly (Gonzalgo et al., 2003). The prevalence of ED increases with age&#xD;
      from 2-9% in men between 40-49 year, to 20-40% between 60-69 and between 50-100% over 70&#xD;
      years (Gur et al., 2006; Hojanned et al., 2000; Gades et al., 2009; Braun et al., 2000). Many&#xD;
      factors may contribute in the occurrence of ED including neuronal, vascular, myogenic and&#xD;
      psychological causes (Gur et al., 2016; Johannes et al., 2000, Lewis et al., 2000; Wu et al.,&#xD;
      2010; Mallis et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchs during the past decade have ﬁrmly established that ED and ejaculatory dysfunction&#xD;
      (EJD) are highly prevalent in aging men, particularly those with LUTS of BPH. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that LUTS of BPH is an independent risk factor for male sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction (Hansen BL. et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the underlying mechanisms responsible for the relationship between LUTS and male&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction are not fully elucidated, possible common links are present including&#xD;
      activation of a-adrenergic receptors, endothelial dysfunction, and alterations in sex hormone&#xD;
      concentrations and receptor subtypes. Thus, it is now recommended that men presenting with&#xD;
      LUTS should be evaluated for sexual dysfunction and those presenting with sexual dysfunction&#xD;
      should be evaluated for LUTS (Price DT., et al., 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also , it is now recognized that certain oral therapies for LUTS/BPH can adversely affect&#xD;
      sexual function in patients who are already at increased risk for sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
      Moreover, the correction of LUTS was associated with improvement of ED. (De Rose AF., et al.,&#xD;
      2002) Healthcare providers should discuss sexual function with BPH patients both before and&#xD;
      during treatment. (Raymond C. Rosen et al., 2005) So, use of ED-treating drugs&#xD;
      (phosphodiestrase -5 inhibitors) is now a guideline recommendation in the lines of treatment&#xD;
      of BPH/LUTS alone or in combination with α blockers. (EUA guidelines, 2015, Gratzke C et.,&#xD;
      al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are effective in treatment of ED. They treat ED&#xD;
      through enhancement of the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibition of cyclic guanosin&#xD;
      monophosphate (cGMP) breakdown, therefore, increase blood flow through penile arteries. PDE5i&#xD;
      are the first-line treatment of ED. Nevertheless, many patients may discontinue the treatment&#xD;
      because of side effects, poor response or cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that B3-adrenoreceptors are mainly localized in the smooth muscle cells of&#xD;
      human corpora cavernosa (HCC) (Cirino et al., 2003). The activation of B3-adrenoceptors cause&#xD;
      relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle of HCC. Investigators showed that a B3-&#xD;
      adrenoreceptors agoinst named &quot;BRL37344&quot; induces relaxation of the HCC. This relaxation has&#xD;
      been shown to be linked to inhibition of the RhoA-Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)&#xD;
      pathway (Cirino et al., 2003). The effect of BRL37344 is mediated by cGMP-dependent but&#xD;
      NO-independent mechanisms, altering CC smooth muscle tone and promoting erectile function&#xD;
      (Cirino et al., 2003). Thus, b3-adrenoceptor agonists may also serve as potentially useful&#xD;
      drugs for the treatment of ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirabegron is a selective B3-adrenoreceptor agonist and is currently approved in many parts&#xD;
      of the world for treatment of overactive bladder (Chapple et al., 2013; Khullar et al., 2013;&#xD;
      Chapple et al., 2013; Nitti et al., 2013). Mirabegron displayed 20-200 times higher relative&#xD;
      efficacy for human B3-adrenoceptor than that BRL37344 (Takasu et al., 2007). Mirabegron&#xD;
      increases intracellular cAMP levels and activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A resulting&#xD;
      in relaxation of the human urinary bladder through a cascade of mechanisms including decrease&#xD;
      in intracellular cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Imran et al., 2013; Matanake et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently , Gur et al studied the effect of mirabegron on HCC in vitro study and also examined&#xD;
      the impact of the drug in vivo, after intracavernosal injection of rats. Authors showed that&#xD;
      mirabegron caused marked relaxation of HCC by activating B3-adrenoceptors independently of No&#xD;
      pathway. So it appears that mirabegron may be apotential safe and effective therapeutic agent&#xD;
      for ED. (Gur et al., 2016) Herein, we designed this protocol to evaluate the role of&#xD;
      mirabegron in treating ED in men with BPH/LUTS with concomitant ED.&#xD;
