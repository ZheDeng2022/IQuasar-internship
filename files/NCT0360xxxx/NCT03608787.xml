  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Responsible Retailing Forum (&quot;RRF&quot;) seeks to develop a new intervention, Stop Service to&#xD;
      Obviously- Impaired Patrons (&quot;S-STOP&quot;), to reduce the incidence and harm associated with&#xD;
      overservice of alcohol. Modeled after RRF's effective program to reduce alcohol sales to&#xD;
      minors using Mystery Shopper feedback on staff ID-checking conduct, SSTOP would (1) conduct&#xD;
      &quot;Pseudo-Intoxicated&quot; Mystery Shop&quot; (&quot;P-I/MS&quot;) inspections of serving establishments,&#xD;
      employing actors who seek to purchase an alcohol beverage while showing obvious signs of&#xD;
      intoxication, (2) provide licensees with confidential feedback on actual staff conduct and a&#xD;
      video link to view the behavior of the P-I/MS that visited their establishments, (3) provide&#xD;
      staff with brief online training in the recognition and skillful refusal of service to&#xD;
      intoxicated patrons, and (4) provide communities with a measure of the prevalence of&#xD;
      overservice. The proposed study will: (1) determine the effectiveness of S-STOP in improving&#xD;
      recognition and refusal to serve an obviously- impaired customer. To do this, we will&#xD;
      implement S-STOP in 10 pairs of demographically matched college and university communities,&#xD;
      employing a cross-over design. After a 3-month baseline, we will implement S- STOP in one&#xD;
      community in each pair (Cohort 1), while the second community serves as a control (Cohort 2).&#xD;
      After 6 months, we will end S-STOP in Cohort 1 communities but continue inspections to&#xD;
      measure the effects of decay; and we will begin S-STOP in Cohort 2. (2) examine how licensees&#xD;
      utilize the S-STOP program and the extent to which utilization moderates the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the program. To do this, we will measure the number and percentage of managers who visit the&#xD;
      S-STOP website and register their staff for training, measure the number of staff that&#xD;
      complete the training, and conduct analyses to investigate the dose-response relationship&#xD;
      between utilization of the S-STOP program and likelihood of overservice. (3) investigate why&#xD;
      some owner/managers did not participate in S-STOP. To achieve this, we will interview 20&#xD;
      owner-managers who did not access the S-STOP website.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Responsible Retailing Forum (RRF) has developed a community-based program - S-STOP (Stop&#xD;
      Service To Obviously-Impaired Patrons) - that assists communities and their on-premises&#xD;
      alcohol establishments to address the problems of over-service of alcoholic beverages. S-STOP&#xD;
      is a six-month program, administered by RRF, which:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conducts Pseudo-Intoxicated Mystery Shop (P-I/MS) visits at on-premises establishments&#xD;
           employing actors who seek to be served an alcoholic beverage while showing obvious signs&#xD;
           of intoxication;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provides on-premises owner-operators and managers with confidential feedback on staff&#xD;
           conduct and an Internet link to a video that shows how the P-I/MS that visited their&#xD;
           establishments typically would have behaved;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provides resources to licensees to assist them in complying with over-service laws;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provides on-premises staff with a brief online training module on how to recognize and&#xD;
           skillfully refuse service to potentially intoxicated patrons;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provides community stakeholders with aggregated data on the prevalence of alcohol&#xD;
           over-service in their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we will conduct and evaluate S-STOP in selected college and university&#xD;
      communities in California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of S-STOP in reducing&#xD;
      over-service. To achieve this, RRF will conduct a randomized control trial using a cross-over&#xD;
      design. We will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify ten pairs of demographically matched college/university communities for a total&#xD;
           of 20 communities and, in each community, recruit a minimum of 12 on-premises serving&#xD;
           establishments for participation in the project;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct 3 P-I/MS baseline inspections in all 20 communities to observe pre-intervention&#xD;
           over-service conduct;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomly assign one community from each pair to receive S-STOP immediately (Cohort 1)&#xD;
           and the other (Cohort 2) to serve as a control group and then to receive S-STOP later;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implement S-STOP in Cohort 1 communities for 3 months and conduct P-I MS in Cohort 2&#xD;
           control communities with no feedback to the licensees or community. At the end of the 3&#xD;
           months, we will end S-STOP in Cohort 1 communities, but continue unreported P-I/MS and&#xD;
           begin S-STOP in Cohort 2 communities for 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 is to examine how licensees utilize the S-STOP program within their&#xD;
      establishments and the extent to which utilization moderates the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      program. To achieve this aim, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the number and percentage of owner-operators and managers who visit the S-STOP&#xD;
           website to view the typical behavior of P-I/MS inspectors and register their staff for&#xD;
           training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the number of staff who complete the S-STOP online training;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the dose-response relationship between utilization of the S-STOP program&#xD;
           (number of owner-manager visits to S-STOP website; percentage of staff completing S-STOP&#xD;
           training) and likelihood of over-service as assessed by the P-I/MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 is to investigate why some owner/managers did not participate in S-STOP in&#xD;
      order to improve the program. We will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Interview 20 owner-managers who did not access the S-STOP website to find out why and&#xD;
      determine how the program might be modified to encourage their use of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The S-STOP program has three key components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pseudo-Intoxicated Mystery Shops (P-I/MS). S-STOP conducts P-I/MS inspections by actors&#xD;
           who seek to be served an alcoholic beverage while showing obvious signs of impairment.&#xD;
           In order to appear realistic, the P-I/MSs act out levels of intoxication that staff of&#xD;
           bars, clubs, and restaurants are likely to encounter in the course of their jobs.&#xD;
           Owner-operators and managers are notified by mail that the S-STOP inspections recently&#xD;
           occurred and are provided with the results (refused service/did not refuse service) of&#xD;
           inspections in their own establishment. In addition, the mailings include materials&#xD;
           describing best practices for on-premises serving establishments, providing guidance on&#xD;
           what steps staff should take if a customer is obviously impaired and describing the&#xD;
           potential legal consequences for licensees and staff who serve alcohol to an&#xD;
           obviously-impaired customer. The mailings also provide a link to an internet site with a&#xD;
           video showing the typical behavior of actors during the P-I/MS visits and for&#xD;
           registration of staff for online training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online refresher training in over-service recognition and refusal. S-STOP provides a&#xD;
           brief online training module for staff on how to recognize and skillfully refuse service&#xD;
           to potentially intoxicated patrons. The online training presents staff with scenarios&#xD;
           involving customers who have been drinking and models several ways in which staff can&#xD;
           firmly, but respectfully decline to serve. The video also reinforces the importance of&#xD;
           management supervision and reinforcement of responsible beverage service practices. The&#xD;
           online training lasts under 4 minutes and can be accessed using a mobile device, tablet,&#xD;
           or computer. Owners/managers will be notified when their staff members complete the&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Community engagement. S-STOP also reports aggregated community-level P-I/MS results to&#xD;
           licensees, their industry partners, and public health, safety, and licensing agencies to&#xD;
           provide these community stakeholders with a measure of over-service prevalence and&#xD;
           changes in refusal rates in their communities over time.&#xD;
