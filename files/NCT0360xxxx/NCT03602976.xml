      This study aims to (1) evaluate efficacy of UDCA in improving liver function and quality of&#xD;
      life; (2) monitor safety, tolerability of UDCA, as well as progression of hepatic sarcoidosis&#xD;
      and liver disease, in patients diagnosed with hepatic sarcoidosis. A minimum of 10 subjects&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 months. For all subjects, initial 6 months will be observational; in&#xD;
      subsequent 6 months, UDCA will be administered. Visits will occur every 3 months and involve&#xD;
      routine blood collection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a relatively rare, poorly defined autoimmune disease characterized by the&#xD;
      formation of sterile granulomas in affected organs, including the liver. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      hepatic sarcoid is often presumed based upon an elevated liver-specific isoenzyme of alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase or imaging findings suggestive of portal hypertension, hepatomegaly, or liver&#xD;
      lesions in a patient with known pulmonary sarcoidosis; a minority of hepatic sarcoid cases&#xD;
      are diagnosed through liver biopsy. The mainstay of treatment of systemic sarcoidosis in&#xD;
      those with symptoms is immunosuppression with corticosteroids, which are gradually tapered&#xD;
      over months. The disease course for sarcoidosis can vary; patients who are asymptomatic can&#xD;
      be monitored without therapy, while some require intermittent corticosteroids for flares. The&#xD;
      expert guidelines for treatment of hepatic sarcoid suggest waiting until a patient is&#xD;
      symptomatic or experiencing evidence of liver dysfunction to treat. This approach is in&#xD;
      opposition to the treatment of primary liver diseases in which treatment is often initiated&#xD;
      based upon abnormal lab values even without symptoms, as symptoms of liver disease (ascites,&#xD;
      variceal bleeding, pruritus, jaundice, and encephalopathy) often occur late in the disease.&#xD;
      The approach to the treatment of hepatic sarcoid should be similar to two other autoimmune&#xD;
      liver diseases: autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Liver&#xD;
      decompensation can be prevented in both AIH and PBC if the disease is diagnosed and treated&#xD;
      in the early stages. The first-line treatment for AIH is immunosuppression with&#xD;
      corticosteroids and azathioprine; for PBC, it is Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). In a similar&#xD;
      vein, patients with hepatic sarcoid may benefit from earlier initiation of therapy. Given its&#xD;
      excellent safety profile and minimal side effects, UDCA may be the consensus first-line&#xD;
      treatment for hepatic sarcoid, a disease that, like PBC, usually causes a cholestatic liver&#xD;
      injury. There have been case reports and retrospective studies documenting the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of UDCA on hepatic sarcoid. However, thus far, there have been no clinical trials to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of UDCA in hepatic sarcoid. This pilot study will examine the effects&#xD;
      of UDCA in a small sample of patients at the University of Pennsylvania. Patients with a&#xD;
      prior diagnosis of sarcoidosis and lab/imaging findings suggestive of hepatic sarcoid would&#xD;
      be approached. The primary endpoint is a reduction in alkaline phosphatase from baseline.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability of UDCA, new or worsening symptoms of&#xD;
      hepatic sarcoidosis and liver disease, changes in bilirubin and transaminases, and liver&#xD;
      stiffness as measured by Fibroscan. A minimum of ten patients will be enrolled for a&#xD;
      twelve-month study with the total study time of two years. It is hypothesized that UDCA will&#xD;
      lead to modest decreases in alkaline phosphatase levels in patients with hepatic sarcoid with&#xD;
      minimal side effects. Overtime a long-term decline in alkaline phosphatase could decrease the&#xD;
      risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with hepatic sarcoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an exploratory objective and optional sub-study, the investigators will include the&#xD;
      methacetin breath test (MBT), a noninvasive tool to assess microsomal capacity to metabolize&#xD;
      the nonradioactive compound 13-Carbon-labeled Methacetin. The MBT will be used in parallel&#xD;
      with clinical and laboratory parameters (Fibroscan, liver enzymes) to assess subjects liver&#xD;
      function prior to and following intervention with UDCA. Changes in the methacetin breath&#xD;
      tests in all subjects prior to and following intervention with UDCA will be examined as a&#xD;
      secondary exploratory endpoint.&#xD;
