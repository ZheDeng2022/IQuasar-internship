  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inherited heart conditions (IHCs) can cause young sudden deaths due to a genetic trait that&#xD;
      leads to a thickened heart muscle or abnormal heart rhythms. Relatives of an affected person&#xD;
      have a 50% chance of inheriting IHCs and this is determined either through a blood test&#xD;
      (predictive genetic test) and/or physical tests such as a heart tracing (electrocardiogram),&#xD;
      scan (echocardiogram) and exercise test. When patients find out they are affected or are&#xD;
      carriers for an IHC, they have numerous questions about medical management, prognosis,&#xD;
      lifestyle; as well as experiencing stress and anxiety because of the impact on their health&#xD;
      and risk to their family. Based on published studies and interviews, a psychoeducational&#xD;
      intervention underpinned by Self-determination Theory was developed to support these patients&#xD;
      An uncontrolled study to determine the feasibility of the intervention and outcome measures&#xD;
      will be undertaken. Patients with a new IHC diagnosis or a carrier result aged 16 years and&#xD;
      older will be recruited from outpatient clinics in London and will be receive the&#xD;
      intervention consisting of a disease-specific information leaflet, a personalised lifestyle&#xD;
      consideration guide and participation in a 1-hour group session facilitated by a cardiac&#xD;
      genetic nurse. Outcome measures to look at degree of self-determination, autonomy support and&#xD;
      competence; and heart-related anxiety will be collected at baseline and at 3 months post&#xD;
      intervention. Clinical and socio-demographic data will be obtained from medical notes. The&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be measured by assessment of the study&#xD;
      procedures such as recruitment, retention and any adverse events. It is expected that there&#xD;
      will be up to 4 consecutive group sessions and feedback from each session will be used to&#xD;
      co-design and refine the intervention model for a definitive clinical trial.&#xD;
