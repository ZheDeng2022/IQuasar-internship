  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a strong association between insomnia and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Insomnia&#xD;
      also frequently co-occurs with other common conditions associated with suicide such as&#xD;
      depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. This project focuses on improving sleep as a&#xD;
      novel suicide prevention strategy that can be delivered to a broad range of Veterans. The&#xD;
      study will examine how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, an efficacious treatment&#xD;
      for insomnia, may reduce suicidal thoughts in Veterans who also suffer from co-occurring&#xD;
      conditions when delivered by integrated primary care clinicians.&#xD;

      Anticipated Benefit to VA Healthcare The proposed study will establish the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of treating insomnia in the primary care environment as a suicide prevention&#xD;
      strategy. By treating insomnia, a common problem that is both a risk factor for suicide and&#xD;
      highly prevalent in common conditions associated with suicide such as depression and&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the investigators expect to reduce the severity of&#xD;
      suicidal ideation (SI) among Veterans experiencing SI, insomnia and a co-occurring condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Background Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S., is a major&#xD;
      concern of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and occurs at elevated rates among&#xD;
      Veterans. Veterans with common chronic conditions such as PTSD and depression are at&#xD;
      increased risk for suicide. Although evidence-based treatments exist for these conditions, a&#xD;
      significant number of Veterans do not engage in or complete such treatments leaving them at&#xD;
      higher risk for suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application builds upon VA HSR&amp;D funded pilot work that demonstrated the feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering a brief version of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) within&#xD;
      primary care to Veterans experiencing SI. The pilot data suggest that the investigators'&#xD;
      brief, primary-care based insomnia treatment was delivered with high fidelity, acceptable to&#xD;
      Veterans and associated with significant reductions in insomnia and depression symptoms, and&#xD;
      reduced SI intensity. The next stage of this program of research is to establish the&#xD;
      feasibility of delivering the brief, primary care based, insomnia intervention utilizing&#xD;
      primary care-mental health integration (PC-MHI) clinicians (as opposed to research staff) and&#xD;
      to establish the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing the severity of factors that&#xD;
      contribute to suicide risk and to improve other clinical markers in a definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Objectives The ultimate goal of the broader program of research is to reduce suicide&#xD;
      among Veterans by intervening upon sleep disturbance as a modifiable risk factor for suicide.&#xD;
      In this application the investigators focus on insomnia, which is the most common sleep&#xD;
      disorder among Veterans and is robustly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this proposed clinical trial is to test whether (and how) using&#xD;
      brief behavioral insomnia treatment can not only improve sleep, but reduce other risk factors&#xD;
      for suicide including the severity of depression, PTSD and suicidal ideation among Veterans&#xD;
      at risk for suicide. Secondary objectives are to: (1) gather initial data on barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to implementation to aid future implementation efforts in VA primary care and&#xD;
      (2) determine if the intervention improves attitudes towards psychotherapy treatments that&#xD;
      address the co-morbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Methods In order to achieve these objectives the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      real-world, randomized clinical trial among 240 Veterans experiencing either co-occurring&#xD;
      depression or PTSD recruited from primary clinics at three VA sites. These Veterans, who will&#xD;
      also endorse SI and insomnia, will be randomized to receive either a brief course of CBT-I or&#xD;
      a sleep hygiene intervention of similar length. Assessments of suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviors, insomnia, depression, and PTSD will be conducted at baseline, post-treatment, and&#xD;
      every 6 weeks thereafter until 6 months post-treatment. Mixed effects modeling and structured&#xD;
      equation modeling will be applied to determine how improvements in sleep and other symptoms&#xD;
      (e.g. depression, PTSD) contribute to reductions in SI severity. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect, code and analyze participant and provider feedback to assess&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators of implementation in real-world clinical practice.&#xD;
