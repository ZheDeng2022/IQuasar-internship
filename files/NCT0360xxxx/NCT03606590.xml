  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, phase II trial single arm, historical control aimed to test the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TTFields, using the NovoTTF-100L(P) System, in combination with&#xD;
      sorafenib in patient with advanced HCC. The device is an experimental, portable, battery&#xD;
      operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or&#xD;
      TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.&#xD;

      PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in&#xD;
      vitro hepatocellular carcinoma pre-clinical models. In addition, TTFields have shown to&#xD;
      inhibit metastatic spread of malignant melanoma in in vivo experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pilot study, 40 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      received chemotherapy with TTFields (150 kHz) applied to the abdomen. The combination was&#xD;
      well tolerated and the only device-related adverse event was contact dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active&#xD;
      chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active&#xD;
      chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life,&#xD;
      and activity within the brain (14% response rate) (Stupp R., et al., EJC 2012). Finally, a&#xD;
      phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance&#xD;
      temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma&#xD;
      without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life (Stupp R.,&#xD;
      et al., JAMA 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this trial are patients with locally advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled, baseline tests will be performed and the patients will be&#xD;
      treated continuously with the device concomitant with sorafenib until disease progression in&#xD;
      the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTFields treatment will consist of wearing four electrically insulated electrode arrays on&#xD;
      the abdomen. Electrode array placement will require shaving of the abdomen/back as necessary&#xD;
      before and during the treatment. After an initial short visit to the clinic for training and&#xD;
      monitoring, patients will be released to continue treatment at home where they can maintain&#xD;
      their regular daily routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial the patient will need to return once every 4 weeks to the clinic where an&#xD;
      examination by a physician and a routine laboratory examinations will be done. These routine&#xD;
      visits will continue for as long as the patient's disease is not progressing in the liver. A&#xD;
      routine CT or MRI scan of the abdomen will be performed at baseline and every 12 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter, until disease progression in the liver. After this follow up plan, patients will&#xD;
      be contacted once per month by telephone to answer basic questions about their health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on&#xD;
      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of&#xD;
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic&#xD;
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.&#xD;
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their&#xD;
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150&#xD;
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects&#xD;
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the&#xD;
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very&#xD;
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are&#xD;
      multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to change&#xD;
      their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately&#xD;
      leading to cell death. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which&#xD;
      act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields&#xD;
      interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular&#xD;
      components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two effects,&#xD;
      tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous&#xD;
      exposure to TTFields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells&#xD;
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to&#xD;
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the&#xD;
      frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally&#xD;
      dividing cells in healthy tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new treatment for&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma with very few side effects.&#xD;
