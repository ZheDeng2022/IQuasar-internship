      The purpose of this study is to learn if a new whole-person lifestyle program improves the&#xD;
      health of low-income mothers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to test a newly developed&#xD;
      obesity reduction program, Koa Family, among overweight or obese mothers. An exploratory,&#xD;
      uncontrolled study will assess its acceptance among normal-weight mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Koa Family consists of a 6-month whole-person lifestyle program (WPLP) combined with text&#xD;
      messaging and social media support and the opportunity to take part in a neighborhood tree&#xD;
      planting campaign. This multi-pronged program is intended to reduce weight in the short-term&#xD;
      while building self-empowerment and connections to community resources so that participants&#xD;
      can sustain long-term weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Koa Family will be implemented in select communities in Yolo and Sacramento counties,&#xD;
      California. Overweight or obese study participants will be randomized to either an&#xD;
      intervention or control group; all normal-weight participants will be assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention. All participants will complete a survey and have their height and weight&#xD;
      measured at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up. Intervention participants will&#xD;
      also take part in a focus group at the 3-month midpoint of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Koa Family is a 6-month program consisting of a whole-person lifestyle program (WPLP) combined with text messaging and social media support and a neighborhood tree planting campaign. The WPLP will bring groups of 8 to 10 mothers living in the same community together for 22 weekly 90-minute support sessions. Each session will cover a topic on whole-person living, including healthy eating, physical activity, stress reduction, coping, and well-being. Participants will receive brief text messages on their cell phones to encourage healthy lifestyle choices. Participants also will be invited to join a &quot;secret&quot; Facebook group where they can support one another in healthy lifestyle change. Finally, participants will have an opportunity to take part in a neighborhood tree planting campaign.</description>
