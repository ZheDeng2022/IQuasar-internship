  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare ways to engage sick patients and their family members&#xD;
      in Advance Care Planning (ACP) discussions. Two pathways will be tested, discussions using a&#xD;
      Nurse Navigator led pathway versus usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial for determining better&#xD;
      ways to engage multimorbid patients and their family members in Advance Care Planning through&#xD;
      a Nurse Navigator led pathway versus usual care. Investigators propose to utilize Zelen's&#xD;
      design (a more recent label/generalization for this type of design is the cohort multiple&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (cmRCT), a pragmatic clinical trial design whereby all&#xD;
      participants are randomized prior to informed consent, and then only patients randomized to&#xD;
      the interventional arm are approached for consent and subsequently enrolled in the&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There are two groups. All participants are randomized prior to informed consent, and then only patients randomized to the interventional arm are approached for consent and subsequently enrolled in the intervention group. Note that patients that do not consent to the intervention are still counted as part of control group under an intent-to-treat paradigm, which necessitates passive ascertainment mechanisms for outcomes (i.e. administrative claims or the EHR).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In the Nurse Navigator Pathway, nurse navigators are being used as leverage to: approach qualified patients to initiate advance care planning discussions, schedule advance care planning visit with patients' primary care provider to further discuss advance care planning and to mail advance care planning resources to patients after their initial advance care planning discussion.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Usual Care</intervention_name>
    <description>In the Usual Care arm, there is no approach by nurse navigators to initiate advance care planning discussions and it does not have a structure advance care planning visit. Therefore, no further action is required for the patients who were randomly assigned to the usual care arm.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>This protocol has Zelen's Design. Subjects were randomized to either the usual care arm or the nurse navigator arm prior to signing consent. And only those who were randomized to nurse navigator arm were consented. 379 subjects randomized to the nurse navigator arm, and of those, only 146 agreed to participate and signed consent. Subjects randomized to the usual care arm had a waiver of consent. The study team only did chart analysis for usual care subjects.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants in this Nurse Navigator led ACP pathway group will participate in ACP discussions, surveys, and participant visit(s) for duration of the study (12 months)&#xD;
Nurse Navigator Pathway: In the Nurse Navigator Pathway, nurse navigators are being used as leverage to: approach qualified patients to initiate advance care planning discussions, schedule advance care planning visit with patients' primary care provider to further discuss advance care planning and to mail advance care planning resources to patients after their initial advance care planning discussion.</description>

Usual Care: In the Usual Care arm, there is no approach by nurse navigators to initiate advance care planning discussions and it does not have a structure advance care planning visit.

Usual Care: In the Usual Care arm, there is no approach by nurse navigators to initiate advance care planning discussions and it does not have a structure advance care planning visit.
