    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well radiation therapy and durvalumab&#xD;
      with or without tremelimumab work in treating participants with bladder cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery, has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes, or that has spread to other&#xD;
      parts of the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink&#xD;
      tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving radiation&#xD;
      therapy and durvalumab with or without tremelimumab will work better in treating participants&#xD;
      with bladder cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN A: Participants receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Participants also undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for 5&#xD;
      fractions beginning on day 8 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 for up to 2 courses and&#xD;
      durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression of unacceptable toxicity. Participants also receive&#xD;
      undergo EBRT for 5 fractions beginning on day 8 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 8 weeks and then every&#xD;
      12 and 16 weeks.&#xD;
