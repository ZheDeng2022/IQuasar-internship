  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I single-arm open-label clinical study primarily assessing the safety and&#xD;
      secondarily, the relative efficacy of low dose melphalan + high dose ascorbate acid (HDAA) in&#xD;
      relapsed refractory patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study for patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Patients will&#xD;
      receive a 15-gram test dose, and a maximum of 3 cycles, each composed of 4 doses of high-dose&#xD;
      ascorbic acid (HDAA) and 2 doses of melphalan. This study will enroll 9 patients with&#xD;
      relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. The starting dose of ascorbic acid will be 50 grams.&#xD;
      Using a 3+3 dose escalation, the dose will potentially increase to 75 grams then 100 grams.&#xD;
