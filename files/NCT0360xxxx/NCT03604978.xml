  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given together&#xD;
      with multi-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery and to see how well they work with or without&#xD;
      ipilimumab in treating patients with grade II-III meningioma that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a&#xD;
      single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. It is not yet known whether giving nivolumab and multi-fraction stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery with or without ipilimumab may work better in treating patients with grade&#xD;
      II-III meningioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the maximum tolerated combination and safety profile of multi-fraction&#xD;
      radiosurgery with concurrent nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab for recurrent&#xD;
      radiation-relapsed high-grade meningioma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the objective response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) of multi-fraction radiosurgery with concurrent nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab&#xD;
      for recurrent radiation-relapsed high-grade meningioma. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate duration of overall response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) of recurrent radiation-relapsed high-grade meningioma patients treated with the&#xD;
      combination of multi-fraction radiosurgery and nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To analyze the immunophenotype changes of peripheral T-cells during the treatment with&#xD;
      multi-fraction radiosurgery in combination with nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To perform molecular profiling assays on pretreatment/baseline archival tumor, including,&#xD;
      but not limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
      sequencing (RNAseq), in order to IIa. Identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers&#xD;
      (such as neoantigen signature or mutation burden) beyond any genomic alteration by which&#xD;
      treatment may be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. Identify resistance mechanisms using genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based&#xD;
      assessment platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA&#xD;
      analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nivolumab followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients also undergo multi-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery on days 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 12 doses (6 months)&#xD;
      and then every 4 weeks for additional 6 months. Patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 6 weeks for 4 doses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo multi-fraction stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery on days 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days.&#xD;

    <description>Each T-cell subset will be quantified as a percentage of the overall T-cell population by normalizing to CD3+ cells. Linear mixed model for repeated measurement data will be used to assess the change over time as well as the differences between subgroups (e.g., responders vs. non-responders) for immunogenicity and other biomarkers (i.e., frequency of CD8+Ki67+PD1+ T-cells, etc.). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will also be used to assess the overall predictive ability and to explore the optimal cut-off points for baseline biomarkers to differentiate responders versus non-responders.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) grade&#xD;
             II-III meningioma which has relapsed after prior radiation therapy with radiologically&#xD;
             progressive or recurrent disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension as &gt;= 1 cm on brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
             imaging (MRI) but with the maximum dimension =&lt; 5 cm OR gross tumor volume &lt; 20 cm^3.&#xD;
             All the relapsed disease would need to be eligible to be treated with reirradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have at least one prior surgery with available archival formalin-fixed&#xD;
             paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks of the initial or recurrent meningioma. If there&#xD;
             are multiple tumor blocks from multiple surgeries, the most recent tumor block (and&#xD;
             ideally of the relapsed tumor after initial radiation therapy) should be submitted. If&#xD;
             a tumor block is not available, an alternative of 20-30 unstained slides may be&#xD;
             submitted instead. Annotation regarding whether the tumor block is before or after&#xD;
             initial radiation therapy should be provided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior initial radiation therapy may include external beam radiation or radiosurgery,&#xD;
             or combination of both. However, the total dose of prior radiation exposure to the&#xD;
             site of recurrent tumor (for consideration of re-irradiation) cannot be more than 70&#xD;
             Gy. The duration since the previous radiation exposure to the site of reirradiation&#xD;
             need to be at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN OR glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 30&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above 1.5 x institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because radiation therapy is known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid&#xD;
             pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of investigational drug. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum&#xD;
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]) within&#xD;
             24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are&#xD;
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of&#xD;
             less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e.,&#xD;
             who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not&#xD;
             require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has&#xD;
                  experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization&#xD;
                  (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause&#xD;
                  is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the&#xD;
                  absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the&#xD;
                  age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
                  less than 40 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a&#xD;
                  period of 5 months after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving&#xD;
                  nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
                  contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
                  product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the&#xD;
                  half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that&#xD;
                  WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually&#xD;
                  active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 100 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
                  immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             or, if decision-making capacity is impaired, consent of a legally authorized&#xD;
             representative (e.g., spouse, adult child, live-in caretaker).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had radiation therapy (to the site of reirradiation) within 6 months&#xD;
             prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1); however, alopecia, sensory neuropathy =&lt;&#xD;
             grade 2, or other =&lt; grade 2 not constituting a safety risk based on the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previous treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or&#xD;
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell&#xD;
             co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to nivolumab and/or ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of immunosuppressive medication (EXCEPT for the following: Intranasal,&#xD;
             inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection [e.g. intra-articular&#xD;
             injection]; systemic corticosteroids at doses =&lt; 4 mg/day of dexamethasone or&#xD;
             equivalent; steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions [e.g. computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan premedication])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. However, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on&#xD;
             stable therapy with minimal viral loads and patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C&#xD;
             who have received treatment with minimal viral loads will be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation therapy is teratogenic&#xD;
             and that the effects of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab and/or&#xD;
             ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not&#xD;
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia&#xD;
             gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),&#xD;
             connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's,&#xD;
             ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal&#xD;
             necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be&#xD;
             excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with&#xD;
             vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis managed with replacement&#xD;
             hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with&#xD;
             topical medication and patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies&#xD;
             (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ&#xD;
             involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
                  residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
                  replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not&#xD;
                  expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogeneic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior, or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of nivolumab and while on trial is&#xD;
             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines&#xD;
