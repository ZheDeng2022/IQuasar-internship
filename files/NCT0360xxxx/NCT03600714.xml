  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection with hepatitis D virus leads to a chronic liver disease with no effective&#xD;
      treatment. Lonafarnib has improved hepatitis D virus levels in blood, but the medication&#xD;
      still needs more research. Ritonavir makes other drugs more effective and is used with&#xD;
      lonafarnib to make it more effective. Lambda interferon stimulates the body s response to&#xD;
      viruses. Researchers want to see if combining these drugs fights hepatitis D and helps the&#xD;
      liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if combining lonafarnib, ritonavir, and lambda interferon is safe and effective to&#xD;
      treat chronic hepatitis D infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with chronic hepatitis D infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, all participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow rules for medicine, food, and contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take hepatitis B medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have weight checked&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have routine blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give stool samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female participants will have pregnancy tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 visits before treatment. They will repeat screening tests and have a&#xD;
      heart test and liver scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 5-day inpatient stay. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have eye tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer health questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a liver sample taken and liver blood pressure measured. Participants will be&#xD;
           sedated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have reproductive tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start the study drugs and have blood draws&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 24 weeks of treatment, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Take 2 study drugs by mouth every day and 1 as a weekly injection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic delta hepatitis is a serious form of chronic liver disease caused by infection with&#xD;
      the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major&#xD;
      structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. Based on previous and ongoing clinical&#xD;
      trials demonstrating effectiveness against HDV, we propose to treat 26 adult patients with&#xD;
      chronic delta hepatitis using the combination of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI)&#xD;
      lonafarnib (LNF), the protease inhibitor ritonavir (RTV) and peginterferon lambda-1a(lambda).&#xD;
      In this phase 2a open label study, the safety and antiviral effects of triple therapy with&#xD;
      LNF, RTV and lambda for a period of 6 months. After dosing, all patients will be monitored&#xD;
      for 24 weeks off therapy. Nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy will be instituted/continued during&#xD;
      this study to prevent the possibility of HBV reactivation/flare for the duration of&#xD;
      participation in this clinical trial. Patients with quantifiable HDV RNA in serum will be&#xD;
      enrolled. At each clinic visit, patients will be questioned about side effects, symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life, undergo focused physical examination, and have blood drawn for complete&#xD;
      blood counts, HDV RNA, and routine liver tests (including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
      direct and total bilirubin, and albumin). At the end of the treatment, patients will be&#xD;
      admitted to the clinical center and will undergo repeat liver biopsy and HVPG measurements,&#xD;
      repeat physical examination, assessment of symptoms (using a symptom scale questionnaire),&#xD;
      complete blood counts, routine liver tests, and hepatitis B and D viral markers. The primary&#xD;
      therapeutic endpoint will be a decline of HDV RNA viral titer of 2 logs at the end of&#xD;
      therapy. The primary safety endpoint will be the ability to tolerate the drugs at the&#xD;
      prescribed dose for the full course of therapy. This clinical trial is designed as a phase 2a&#xD;
      study assessing the antiviral activity, safety and tolerance of fixed doses of lonafarnib,&#xD;
      ritonavir and peginterferon lambda.&#xD;

             RNA assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstration of chronicity as evidenced by the presence of HDV RNA in serum for &gt;/= 6&#xD;

             prothrombin time &gt;2 sec prolonged, or history of bleeding esophageal varices, ascites&#xD;
             or hepatic encephalopathy. Laboratory abnormalities that are not thought to be due to&#xD;
             liver disease may not necessarily require exclusion. Patients with ALT levels greater&#xD;
             than 1000 U/L (&gt;25 times ULN) will not be enrolled but may be followed until three&#xD;
             determinations are below this level. Patients with an absolute neutrophil count&#xD;

             in women, or use of two contraceptive methods such as condoms and spermicide&#xD;
             combination with an intrauterine device or Depo-Provera, or Norplant.&#xD;

             risk by the NIH psychiatric consultation service), or active coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic immunosuppressive therapy within the previous 2 months before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of another form of liver disease in addition to viral hepatitis (for example&#xD;
             autoimmune liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis,&#xD;
             Wilson disease, alcoholic liver disease, ongoing drug induced liver disease,&#xD;
             nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (but not steatosis), hemochromatosis, or&#xD;

             with ultrasound/ CT scan or MRI performed a maximum of 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
             Elevated AFP levels will be evaluated clinically and further imaging may be performed&#xD;
             if felt necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of concurrent hepatitis C infection with positive serum HCV RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any experimental therapy or pegylated interferon therapy within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, serious autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis, Crohn s disease or rheumatoid arthritis, that is in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators might be exacerbated by therapy with lambda interferon. This will be&#xD;
             evaluated at baseline and during follow-up laboratory testing (including blood and&#xD;
             urine studies) in addition to described symptoms at each outpatient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of malignancy in the five years prior to the enrollment with exception&#xD;
             granted to superficial dermatologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of HIV co-infection; HIV 1/2 antibody positivity on serum testing.&#xD;

             sildenafil, sedative and hypnotics, ergot and St. John s Wort due to possible effect&#xD;
             of ritonavir on hepatic metabolism of these drugs resulting in potentially&#xD;
             life-threatening side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant baseline EKG abnormalities such as QTc interval &gt;450 ms and/or&#xD;
             prolonged PR interval.&#xD;

             other than statins will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of pancreatitis from causes other than gallstone pancreatitis. Subjects with a&#xD;
             baseline amylase and/or lipase level &gt;3 ULN will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
