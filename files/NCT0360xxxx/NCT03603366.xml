  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research shows that low-dose Aspirin prevents diseases of heart and blood vessels as well as&#xD;
      cancer of the colon and rectum and it is also associated with risk of bleeding. In this&#xD;
      study, they want to learn how patients regard the benefits and risks of low-dose Aspirin for&#xD;
      the prevention of these diseases. The researchers also want to learn how patients balance&#xD;
      these risks and benefits.&#xD;
