      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with conditions that are unknown or hard to diagnose may be helped by a genetic&#xD;
      technique. It is called exome sequencing. It helps diagnose disease by unlocking all the data&#xD;
      in a person s genetic code. But the results from it are often unclear. Uncertain results can&#xD;
      pose problems for doctors and patients. Researchers want to learn more about how people&#xD;
      respond when they get uncertain results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the psychological and behavioral effects of getting uncertain results from exome&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Had a diagnostic odyssey for at least 6 months. An example is having clinical symptoms but no&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And had exome sequencing to try to reach a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will choose a date and time for their interview. They will sign a form to give&#xD;
      consent and authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out 2 forms. One is the Intolerance of Uncertainty Short Form Scale.&#xD;
      The other is the Perceptions of Uncertainties in Genome Sequencing Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both scales ask about what it is like to get clinically uncertain results from exome&#xD;
      sequencing. They focus on coping and other behavioral responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a phone interview. It will last for 45-60 minutes. It will be recorded&#xD;
      and transcribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the call, the researcher will review the consent form with the participant.&#xD;
      Participants will give data such as race, education, income, and how long they have been&#xD;
      looking for a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will read their responses to the 2 scales during the interview.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients pursuing exome sequencing in their quest for diagnosis will most often receive a&#xD;
      clinically uncertain result. A clinically uncertain result is a result that has some level of&#xD;
      objective uncertainty frequently viewed by clinicians in regard to a patient s diagnosis. A&#xD;
      clinically uncertain result can be a result that is negative, with no reportable variants, or&#xD;
      that includes one or more variants deemed uncertain with regard to the cause of a patient s&#xD;
      illness. Clinically uncertain results present challenges to both providers and patients in&#xD;
      the forms of disclosing and processing uncertain health information. This exploratory study&#xD;
      aims to seek insight into the psychological and behavioral impact of receiving clinically&#xD;
      uncertain results from exome sequencing. Semi-structured phone interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with approximately 30-40 adult patients with undiagnosed conditions who have received&#xD;
      clinically uncertain result from exome sequencing. The interviews will focus on the&#xD;
      experience of receiving the clinically uncertain result, with emphasis on appraisal of&#xD;
      uncertainty, coping, and other affective and behavioral responses. Interviews will be&#xD;
      transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Understanding how patients with undiagnosed&#xD;
      conditions respond to clinically uncertain results from exome sequencing may inform providers&#xD;
      practices around informed consent for exome sequencing and the disclosure of clinically&#xD;
      uncertain results through a greater consideration of patient concerns and challenges with&#xD;
      adaptation. This study may also identify implications for interventions to reduce negative&#xD;
      effects of receiving uncertain genomic information.&#xD;

        Data will be received from up to 250 potential participants, in order to do interviews with&#xD;
        a sample of approximately 30-40 participants. Participants are adult patients with&#xD;
        undiagnosed conditions who have received one of the most common types of clinically&#xD;
        uncertain results (negative result or one or more variants of uncertain significance (VUSs)&#xD;
        without a known pathogenic result) from exome sequencing. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
        Johns Hopkins Hospital Genetics Clinics and Kennedy Krieger Institute.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had endured a diagnostic odyssey of at least 6 months before receiving exome&#xD;
             sequencing. A diagnostic odyssey may be defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having a set of clinical symptoms but no diagnosis OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having a clinical diagnosis of a broad category of disease (i.e. ataxia, muscular&#xD;
                  dystrophy) but no specific diagnosis OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having a clinical diagnosis composed of psychosomatic and/or descriptive&#xD;
                  diagnoses that individually define single symptoms or groups of symptoms (i.e.&#xD;
                  migraines, IBS, joint pain), but that do not explain the entire phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and Had exome sequencing in an attempt to attain diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and Received post-test counseling for exome sequencing by a genetic counselor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and Received a clinically uncertain result from exome sequencing. For the purposes of&#xD;
             this study, a clinically uncertain result is defined as one of the following options:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One or more VUSs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A negative test result (no reported variants)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  and Result disclosure for exome sequencing occurred anywhere from 1 week to 7 years&#xD;
             prior to being interviewed&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exome sequencing results provided a genetic diagnosis for the patient that does not&#xD;
             fall into one of the above inclusion categories&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient was under age 18 at time of clinically uncertain result disclosure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a cognitive disability that prevents him/her from comprehensibly answering&#xD;
             interview questions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient cannot speak or understand English&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have since received a genetic diagnosis (from some other mechanism besides&#xD;
        their exome sequencing test) may still participate in the study if they are able to recount&#xD;
        their experiences around receiving this sort of exome sequencing result during the time&#xD;
        they were undiagnosed.&#xD;
