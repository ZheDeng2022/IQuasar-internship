  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the past three decades, researchers have paid particular attention to the study of&#xD;
      olfactory disorders in depression. Recent studies have shown that depression is characterized&#xD;
      by a change in olfactory and emotional perception resulting in a decrease of the perception&#xD;
      of positive stimuli (odors and facial expressions) and an increase in perception of negative&#xD;
      stimuli (odors). Moreover, it has also been shown in healthy subjects that the presence of&#xD;
      minor depressive symptoms leads to a decreasing of olfactory sensitivity. However, odor&#xD;
      discrimination was not impaired in these subjects. This observation suggest the presence of a&#xD;
      change in &quot;targeted&quot; olfactory perception in people with depressive symptoms without&#xD;
      reporting major depression. In addition, studies in subjects with olfactory disorders&#xD;
      (following respiratory tract infections or following Parkinson's disease) have shown an&#xD;
      improvement in olfactory function after daily training with odors during 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From all these observations, the hypothesis is that an olfactory training could improve the&#xD;
      overall olfactory functioning and the emotional perception of the subjects presenting minor&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and of the depressed patients.&#xD;

      Recent studies have shown that depression is characterized by a change in olfactory and&#xD;
      emotional perception resulting in a decrease of the perception of positive stimuli (odors and&#xD;
      facial expressions) and an increase in perception of negative stimuli (odors). Moreover, it&#xD;
      has also been shown in healthy subjects that the presence of minor depressive symptoms leads&#xD;
      to a decreasing of olfactory sensitivity. However, odor discrimination was not impaired in&#xD;
      these subjects. This observation suggest the presence of a change in &quot;targeted&quot; olfactory&#xD;
      perception in people with depressive symptoms without reporting major depression. In&#xD;
      addition, studies in subjects with olfactory disorders (following respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections or following Parkinson's disease) have shown an improvement in olfactory function&#xD;
      after daily training with odors during 12 weeks. Therefore, the hypothesis is that an&#xD;
      olfactory training could improve the overall olfactory functioning and the emotional&#xD;
      perception of the subjects presenting minor depressive symptoms and of the depressed&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the effect of daily olfactory training on the emotional state&#xD;
      and emotional perception of the subject. The effect of the training will be evaluated using&#xD;
      three types of evaluations: (1) a clinical evaluation and the psychometric scales, (2) the&#xD;
      investigation of the olfactory function and (3) the study of the emotional perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The identification of olfactory parameters and emotional valences associated with minor&#xD;
           depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study of the link between the subjective and objective emotional response on the one&#xD;
           hand, and the link between olfactory function, emotional perception and emotional state&#xD;
           on the other hand in depressed patients and in individuals with minor depressive&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
