  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>

      dose centanafadine sustained-release tablets in subjects, over the course of approximately 52&#xD;
      weeks. This study will accept rollover subjects from both the 405-201-00013 and 405-201-00014&#xD;
      trials. For individuals that did not participate in one of the studies mentioned above, they&#xD;
      will be able to enroll if they meet the inclusion criteria as outlined below.&#xD;

        De Novo Subjects [De Novo Enrollment has ended 20Sep2019].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  De novo subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&#xD;
             Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for ADHD (including predominantly inattentive&#xD;
             presentation, hyperactive presentation, or combined presentation) as confirmed by the&#xD;
             Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) Version 1.2. To confirm that ADHD is the&#xD;
             primary diagnosis, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be&#xD;
             used to identify and exclude other psychiatric conditions which would preclude&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects have BMI of 18 to 40, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are willing to discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications starting&#xD;
             from the time of signing the informed consent and up to the 10-day safety follow-up&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a DSM-5 diagnosis of Other Specified or Unspecified&#xD;
             Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder as confirmed by ACDS Version 1.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a current comorbid psychiatric disorder that is either controlled with&#xD;
             medications prohibited in this trial or is uncontrolled and associated with&#xD;
             significant symptoms, including but not limited to: a current major depressive episode&#xD;
             (per DSM-5 criteria), current symptoms (past 90 days) meeting the DSM-5 criteria for a&#xD;
             diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic&#xD;
             disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, as established by the MINI. NOTE: Subjects&#xD;
             with mild mood or anxiety symptoms that do not meet criteria for diagnosis, who do not&#xD;
             require treatment based on the Investigator's assessment, and do not confound efficacy&#xD;
             or safety assessments in the opinion of the examining Investigator, may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that have a positive alcohol test (via breathalyzer or blood), a positive&#xD;
             drug screen for cocaine, or other illicit drugs (excluding marijuana). Subjects with a&#xD;
             positive drug screen for confirmed prescription medications at baseline will not be&#xD;
             permitted to continue participation in Trial 405-201-00015. NOTE: Subjects that tested&#xD;
             positive for marijuana may be permitted to be enrolled if they have no evidence of a&#xD;
             substance use disorder, and if they agree to refrain from use for the duration of the&#xD;
             trial. Allowance for subjects testing positive for marijuana at screening require&#xD;
             explicit approval from the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rollover Subjects: Rollover Enrollment has ended 28Aug2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who completed the double-blind treatment period and 7-day follow-up after&#xD;
             last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) in double-blind trials and who,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, could potentially benefit from centanafadine for&#xD;
             ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, during the double-blind phase 3 trial experienced, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, poor tolerability to trial medication or whose safety assessments&#xD;
             resulted in new concerns that would suggest the subject may not be appropriate for a&#xD;
             52-week treatment with trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have re-initiated any therapy for adult ADHD during the 7-day follow-up&#xD;
             period after the final treatment visit of the double-blind phase 3 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects that have a positive alcohol test (via breathalyzer or blood), a positive&#xD;
             drug screen for cocaine, or other illicit drugs (excluding marijuana). Subjects with a&#xD;
             positive drug screen for confirmed prescription medications at baseline will not be&#xD;
             permitted to continue participation in Trial 405-201-00015. NOTE: Subjects that test&#xD;
             positive for marijuana may not be permitted to rollover into the open label study, and&#xD;
             must agree to refrain from use for the duration of the open label trial. Allowance for&#xD;
             subjects testing positive for marijuana at time of rollover requires explicit approval&#xD;
             from the medical monitor.&#xD;
