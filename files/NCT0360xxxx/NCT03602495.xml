  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to compare&#xD;
      the progression free survival, overall response rate (ORR) and safety of participants treated&#xD;
      with Donafenib 0.3g Bid by continuous oral dosing versus placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blinded Phase: Participants will receive blinded study drug (Donafenib/placebo) in 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      until documentation of disease progression (confirmed by independent imaging review&#xD;
      committee), development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. After having&#xD;
      completed the primary analysis, subjects treated with Donafenib who have not experienced&#xD;
      disease progression may request to continue open label Donafenib at the same dose, according&#xD;
      to the clinical judgment of the investigator. Participants who discontinue treatment for any&#xD;
      reason other than disease progression will be followed in the Blinded Phase until disease&#xD;
      progression or start of another anticancer treatment; these participants then enter the Open&#xD;
      label Phase for survival follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label Phase: Participants in the placebo arm who have disease progression confirmed by&#xD;
      IRC could request to enter the Optional Open Label Donafenib Treatment Period and receive&#xD;
      Donafenib treatment. Participants will receive Donafenib treatment until disease progression,&#xD;
      development of intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Participants who had disease&#xD;
      progression during the blinded Phase and did not enter the Optional Open Label Donafenib&#xD;
      Treatment Period and all participants who discontinued Donafenib treatment in the Optional&#xD;
      Open Label Donafenib Treatment Period will enter the follow-up period. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed for survival, and all anticancer treatments will be recorded until the time of&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
