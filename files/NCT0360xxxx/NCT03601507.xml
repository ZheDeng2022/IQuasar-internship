  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well alpelisib works in treating participants with human&#xD;
      papillomavirus(HPV)-associated stage I-IVA head and neck cancer that can be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Alpelisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the preliminary efficacy of neoadjuvant Alpelisib (BYL719) in patients with&#xD;
      transorally-resectable, HPV+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), as measured by&#xD;
      quantitative change in tumor size (change in T) following 14-21 days of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the relationship between genomic PIK3CA activation to change in T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the tolerability of brief neoadjuvant exposure to BYL719. II. To assess the&#xD;
      effect of BYL719 on the tumoral Ki-67 proliferation index. III. To evaluate viral and&#xD;
      molecular mediators of response and resistance to BYL719, including viral messenger&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA), E6 and E7 oncoproteins, and phosphorylated (p)HER3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive Alpelisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 14-21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression of unacceptable toxicity and then undergo surgery. Participants may&#xD;
      receive Alpelisib for up to 28 days if surgery is delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 12 weeks.&#xD;

                  this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm; a&#xD;
                  condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
                  delivery of the drug via seminal fluid; moreover, sexually active males should&#xD;

                  clinical practice, women should not become pregnant for 12 months after&#xD;
                  completion of radiation; highly effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                       lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking&#xD;
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study&#xD;
                       subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                       patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Use a combination of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                            suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and&#xD;
                            implanted) are not allowed as BYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of&#xD;
                            hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  NOTE: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing&#xD;

                       with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of&#xD;
                       vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
                       without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions such as infection requiring systemic&#xD;
