  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 690517&#xD;
      in healthy Japanese male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses over&#xD;
      14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is the exploration of the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) and pharmacodynamic(s)&#xD;
      (PD) of BI 690517 in healthy Japanese male subjects after multiple dosing.&#xD;
