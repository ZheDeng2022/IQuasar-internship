  <brief_summary>

      Background/Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel transvaginal mesh (TVM) surgery for women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) had been&#xD;
      reported. However, factors affecting the efficacy of this novel TVM surgery are unknown; and&#xD;
      the above information should be important for preoperative consultation, especially for POP&#xD;
      women with concomitant urodynamic stress incontinence (USI). Thus, the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the factors responsible for anti-incontinence effect of this novel anterior&#xD;
      TVM surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women with POP and concomitant overt or occult USI, who underwent the novel anterior TVM&#xD;
      surgeries, were enrolled in this study. Medical records, including urodynamic studies,&#xD;
      questionnaires and 3-day bladder diaries, were retrospectively reviewed. Linear regress&#xD;
      analysis was used to identify factors that were responsible for the changes in pad weights&#xD;
      from baseline [i.e., 100 * (postoperative pad weight - baseline pad weight)/baseline pad&#xD;
      weight].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will get the factors responsible for anti-incontinence effect of this novel&#xD;
      anterior TVM surgery. Key Words: pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, pad&#xD;
      test, urodynamic stress incontinence&#xD;

&#xD;
      All women with POP and concomitant overt or occult USI, who underwent the novel anterior TVM&#xD;
      surgeries between November 2011 and December 2015 at the Department of Obstetrics &amp;&#xD;
      Gynecology, were enrolled in this study. Medical records, including urodynamic studies,&#xD;
