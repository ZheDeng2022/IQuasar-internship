  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-period, controlled, randomized and open clinical trial. The sample was composed of adult&#xD;
      women with moderate to severe hypo secretory dry eye associated with Sjögren's syndrome, who&#xD;
      attended the ocular surface office, derived from the general ophthalmology clinic, from the&#xD;
      Rheumatology or Immunology department. The three interventions were randomized: autologous&#xD;
      serum (GSA), Rebamipida 2% (GR) and a combined treatment (GSAR). The following were used as&#xD;
      outcome measures: OSDI self-administered questionnaire (Ocular Surface Disease Index),&#xD;
      tear-rupture time (BUT), fluorescein staining, Bengal Rose staining and Schirmer's test&#xD;
      without anesthesia to assess the answer to each treatment&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After having borrowed to participate in the study, we proceeded to the random assignment of&#xD;
      each intervention as follow: the last 2 numbers of the clinical history, typical of the&#xD;
      ocular surface office, were taken and they were placed in a list in order of lower to higher.&#xD;
      Then, each of them was assigned to a number from a table of random numbers. The list was&#xD;
      rearranged from lowest to highest using the assigned random number. Finally, the treatment&#xD;
      was assigned by simple randomization without replacement. In this way, the subject with the&#xD;
      lowest random number, the correspondence in the first treatment drawn. It was continued in&#xD;
      the same way, respecting the order assigned by random numbers until completing the 21&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of 7 subjects each were formed in this way: treatment group or group Rebamipida&#xD;
      (GR); standard treatment group or autologous serum group (GSA) and mixed group or serum and&#xD;
      Rebamipide group (GSAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning with the assigned treatment, all the participants was started a period of&#xD;
      wash-out of any medicine they were ussing, that least for two weeks. The participants were&#xD;
      asked to suspend all the drops that they been used until then (antibiotics, corticosteroids,&#xD;
      cyclosporine, artificial tears, autologous serum, etc.), and to place them using only&#xD;
      artificial tears (sodium carboxymethyl cellulose). 1%, AUCIC 1%) four times a day in all&#xD;
      cases. The purpose was to minimize the effect of the medication that could interfere with the&#xD;
      results obtained from the treatments tested. The two week period also allowed the hemotherapy&#xD;
      service to prepare the autologous serum for the subjects assigned to this group and initiate&#xD;
      the treatment without delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the washout period, the subjects began to receive the last treatments for&#xD;
      90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first intervention cycle and with the objective of influencing the treatment cycle&#xD;
      of the first treatment cycle, a second washing period of two weeks duration was carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the intention of increasing the sample size, the GR and GSA groups were crossed, in this&#xD;
      way the patients received the opposite treatment to the start. The second treatment period&#xD;
      lasted 90 days, equal to the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixed group (GSAR) did not cross, ending their participation at the end of the 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission and control of all patients on days 0, 30 and 90 of both cycles were performed by&#xD;
      the same ophthalmologist.&#xD;
