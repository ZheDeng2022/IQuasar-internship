  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects of Metformin and Topiramate prescribed at 4 weeks&#xD;
      post-surgery on overall weight loss at 6 months post-surgery. The investigators will study&#xD;
      patients who, based on current diagnoses and medication regimens, could be expected to&#xD;
      benefit the most by taking a medication to facilitate additional post-surgery weight loss.&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at Hartford Hospital's&#xD;
      Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Program will be screened, consented and enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. Prior to surgery patients will be randomized to either pharmacotherapy or no&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy following LSG. For those randomized to receive pharmacotherapy, medications&#xD;
      will be initiated at 4 weeks, as this is the estimated time post-LSG at which patients&#xD;
      advance from a liquid diet to soft foods allowing medications to be better tolerated. Once&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the medication group, patients will receive Metformin or Topiramate&#xD;
      based upon physician judgment and medical history. Dosages will not be adjusted during the&#xD;
      course of the study. The primary outcome will be % total body weight loss (%TWL) at 6 months&#xD;
      following surgery, as the majority of the weight loss after LSG occurs during the first 6&#xD;
      months. Data collected through up to 12 months will be analyzed. The %TWL for both arms of&#xD;
      the study will also be assessed at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 9 months and one-year post-LSG.&#xD;
      Resolution of comorbidities will be noted.&#xD;
