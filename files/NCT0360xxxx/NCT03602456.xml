    <textblock>
      Kentucky HEALTH was an 1115 Medicaid waiver that was approved by the Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services (CMS) in January 2018. In what was initially planned to be a 5-year&#xD;
      demonstration, KY HEALTH aimed to modify the traditional Medicaid program to improve health&#xD;
      behaviors, health outcomes, and socioeconomic outcomes in the waiver-eligible population&#xD;
      through several innovations. In brief, these included introducing Community Engagement&#xD;
      requirements (i.e. work requirements), monthly premiums, MyRewards accounts for dental and&#xD;
      vision services, and annual recertification. If beneficiaries failed to complete these&#xD;
      requirements, some penalties included suspension and 6-month lockouts from the Medicaid&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Commonwealth of Kentucky had chosen to implement this program in a randomized fashion,&#xD;
      where 10% of the target population was randomly assigned to continue receiving traditional&#xD;
      Medicaid while 90% would receive Kentucky HEALTH benefits and be subject to the requirements&#xD;
      discussed above. Randomization was conducted by the state, through their separate contract&#xD;
      with a non-profit research firm (National Opinion Research Center, NORC). The NORC also&#xD;
      engaged in primary data collection to support the analysis of the project. The University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania team served as the non-partisan, independent evaluators of this randomized&#xD;
      intervention conducted by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The analysis would measure the impact&#xD;
      of KY HEALTH compared to traditional Medicaid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to ongoing legal challenges and a change in administrations, the implementation of&#xD;
      Kentucky HEALTH was delayed and eventually cancelled. On March 27, 2019, the DC District&#xD;
      Court Judge concluded that the approvals did not address how the requests would align with&#xD;
      Medicaid's core objectives. At that point, data collection was ongoing although Kentucky&#xD;
      HEALTH was delayed until further notice. Kentucky's 2019 gubernatorial election took place on&#xD;
      November 5th and resulted in the election of a new governor. On December 16, 2019, a&#xD;
      termination request was sent to CMS as a notification of the new administration's intention&#xD;
      to cancel Kentucky HEALTH. On December 18, 2019, a clarification letter was sent to CMS to&#xD;
      notify them that the termination did not apply to the SUD program and NEMT portion (among&#xD;
      others) of the waiver. While the Penn team will continue conducting a separate evaluation of&#xD;
      the ongoing SUD program, the randomized controlled trial and data collection described in&#xD;
      this study will end with the terminated components of the waiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the legal challenges, the implementation of Kentucky HEALTH was delayed before&#xD;
      being cancelled altogether. The study start and end dates above reflect the beginning of data&#xD;
      collection and the termination letter that was sent to CMS, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 9,396 surveys (KHES), 127 beneficiary semi-structured interviews, and 40 provider&#xD;
      interviews were conducted.&#xD;

      General Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the approval of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on January 12,&#xD;
      2018, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is implementing a 5-year ยง 1115 demonstration project&#xD;
      entitled Kentucky HEALTH (for &quot;Helping to Engage and Achieve Long-Term Health&quot;). The project&#xD;
      will modify the Medicaid program for eligible beneficiaries, which include the majority of&#xD;
      able-bodied adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Commonwealth's Medicaid demonstration waiver seeks to improve health behaviors, health&#xD;
      outcomes, and socioeconomic outcomes in the waiver-eligible population through several&#xD;
      innovations as described in the ยง 1115 CMS Medicaid waiver approval letter from January,&#xD;
      2018:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Kentucky HEALTH benefit plan for the expansion population will provide a&#xD;
           comprehensive commercial insurance benefit package. Dental services, vision services,&#xD;
           and over the counter medications will now be provided via the beneficiary's My Rewards&#xD;
           Account.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kentucky HEALTH beneficiaries, with the exception of medically frail individuals,&#xD;
           pregnant women, former foster youth, and children, will be required to make sliding&#xD;
           scale flat rate monthly premium payments based on family income. As described in the&#xD;
           application the plan is:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Under 25% FPL - $1.00 per month&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  25-50% FPL - $4.00 per month&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  51-100% FPL - $8.00 per month&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  101-138% FPL - $15.00 per month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beneficiaries will be provided a 60-day grace period to make their required monthly&#xD;
           premium payments - individuals who do not elect to pay a required premium payment within&#xD;
           sixty calendar days from the due date will face a six-month non-payment penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The non-payment penalty varies based on whether the member has income above or below&#xD;
           federal poverty:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Above 100% FPL - member will be disenrolled from Kentucky HEALTH; re-enrollment&#xD;
                waiting period of six months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At or below 100% FPL - no impact on eligibility; State Plan copayments required for&#xD;
                all services; $25 is deducted from the My Rewards Account; My Rewards Account is&#xD;
                suspended - not able to use funds in account, not able to accrue funds in account&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medically Frail - no impact to eligibility; No copayments required; My Rewards&#xD;
                Account is suspended - not able to use funds in account, not able to accrue funds&#xD;
                in account&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beneficiaries will have the opportunity to end their non-payment penalty period sooner&#xD;
           than six months by paying past debt, paying the premium for the reinstatement month, and&#xD;
           participating in a financial or health literacy course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kentucky HEALTH will require that all able-bodied working age adult beneficiaries&#xD;
           without dependents participate in the community engagement and employment initiative to&#xD;
           maintain enrollment. For the first 3 months of enrollment, beneficiaries will not be&#xD;
           required to report community engagement hours. Starting at 4 months of enrollment,&#xD;
           non-exempt individuals will be required to participate in 80 hours of community&#xD;
           engagement per calendar month.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Qualifying activities include employed work, job skills training, job search&#xD;
                activities, education, community service, participation in substance use disorder&#xD;
                treatment, caregiving services for non-dependents with a chronic health condition,&#xD;
                and/or volunteering.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After one month of non-completion, beneficiaries will have a one-month opportunity&#xD;
                to remedy their deficit or face a Community Engagement Suspension, or a suspension&#xD;
                of all benefits. In order to avoid suspension, beneficiaries must be current on all&#xD;
                hours required for the new month, and either (1) make up all deficit hours from the&#xD;
                previous month before the end of the current month, or (2) complete an approved&#xD;
                re-enrollment course. The re-enrollment course may be used once per 12-month&#xD;
                period. Beneficiaries who do not cure the deficiency will be locked out from the&#xD;
                Medicaid program. They may re-enroll at any time after completing 80 hours of&#xD;
                community engagement within a 30-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Beneficiaries who complete more than 80 hours in a given month may apply their&#xD;
                excess hours to receive MyRewards Account credits and to remedy a deficit from the&#xD;
                previous month, but they may not apply the excess hours forward to a future month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of penalties for failure to provide timely documentation for&#xD;
           recertification of Medicaid eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Recertification is a yearly process for Medicaid recipients to recertify their&#xD;
                household information and eligibility for benefits based on the certification&#xD;
                period. Certification periods are 12 months from the first month of approved&#xD;
                eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eligible beneficiaries who do not provide documentation for recertification will&#xD;
                face disenrollment from Medicaid, but are given a 90-day extension to recertify&#xD;
                their eligibility for benefits. Beneficiaries who fail to do so within the 90-day&#xD;
                period will become ineligible of receiving Medicaid benefits for a 6-month&#xD;
                non-eligibility period. The same process applies to beneficiaries who fail to&#xD;
                report changes in circumstance in the required reporting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of the MyRewards account program for all adult beneficiaries who are&#xD;
           currently making monthly premium payments and not subject to lockouts, as well as&#xD;
           pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Beneficiaries can earn MyRewards account credits through engagement in eligible&#xD;
                wellness behaviors; they can have MyRewards credits deducted to penalize premium&#xD;
                nonpayment and non-emergency use of the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Beneficiaries may spend MyRewards account credits on vision care, dental services,&#xD;
                and other eligible services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elimination of retroactive eligibility for all Medicaid beneficiaries, with the&#xD;
           exception of pregnant women and former foster care youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elimination of non-emergency ground transportation for beneficiaries subject to the&#xD;
           alternative benefit plan, with the exception of 19- and 20-year old beneficiaries&#xD;
           receiving EPSDT services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Offering premium assistance for beneficiaries seeking to enroll in employer-sponsored&#xD;
           insurance (ESI). Enrolling in ESI with premium assistance will be optional for the first&#xD;
           year that a beneficiary is in Kentucky HEALTH and concurrently eligible for ESI. In&#xD;
           subsequent years of eligibility for ESI that meets state requirements, the beneficiary&#xD;
           will be required to enroll in the ESI program in order to continue participating in&#xD;
           Medicaid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementation of funded (up to $1,000) deductible accounts at the beginning of each&#xD;
           benefit year. Deductible account dollars will be deducted as beneficiaries use health&#xD;
           care throughout the year. At the conclusion of each program year, up to 50% of the&#xD;
           remaining deductible account balance will be transferred to the member's MyRewards&#xD;
           account, prorated to reflect the number of months with active enrollment (i.e., not&#xD;
           suspended or locked out).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, these program modifications aim to incentivize healthy behaviors, appropriate&#xD;
      health care utilization, and greater community and labor force participation, in order to&#xD;
      lead to better health and socioeconomic outcomes. Figure 1 displays a driver diagram which&#xD;
      clarifies these program objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, the demonstration waiver will also include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery system modifications to enhance access to mental health and substance use&#xD;
           disorder treatments. Federal financial participation (FFP) will apply to substance use&#xD;
           disorder treatment - including early intervention, in and outpatient therapy,&#xD;
           residential treatment, managed withdrawal, medication assisted therapy, peer&#xD;
           interventions, and crisis care support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infrastructure changes to encourage prevention of chronic diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      These elements are specifically designed to improve access to care and care options for&#xD;
      individuals with substance use disorder and individuals with other chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions, for which the Commonwealth suffers from a significant burden of disease&#xD;
      (Dwyer-Lindgren 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed evaluation plan will leverage rich administrative and survey data sources along&#xD;
      with robust quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the effects of the demonstration&#xD;
      waiver on insurance coverage, health care utilization, health behaviors, socioeconomic&#xD;
      outcomes, and a broad range of health outcomes (including substance use disorder). We will&#xD;
      examine the consequences of the waiver both among individuals who will be moved from&#xD;
      traditional Medicaid to the waiver at the start of the demonstration, as well as among&#xD;
      low-income, able-bodied individuals as a whole (who may participate in the Medicaid program&#xD;
      in the future). Importantly, we will track individuals from their start in this program for&#xD;
      up to 5 years to examine how trajectories in terms of labor market and health outcomes evolve&#xD;
      over time for waiver program participants compared to similar individuals on traditional&#xD;
      Medicaid. It is crucial to emphasize the research team's role as neutral evaluators in this&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to assessing the impacts of the demonstration waiver as a whole, the evaluation&#xD;
      will also seek to estimate the individual impacts of key waiver components, specifically&#xD;
      community engagement requirements, premiums and lockouts, redetermination lockouts, and the&#xD;
      My Rewards incentive program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will achieve these objectives through conducting the following, the first of&#xD;
      which is the subject of this clinicatrials.gov record:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary analysis of data collected as part of a randomized intervention initiated by&#xD;
           the Commonwealth of Kentucky to evaluate effects of the waiver on coverage, utilization,&#xD;
           health, and socioeconomic status among Medicaid beneficiaries eligible for the waiver at&#xD;
           the time of implementation (April 1 2019). Randomization will be statewide and will&#xD;
           apply to all beneficiaries in the waiver-eligible population at the time of&#xD;
           implementation. Data sources for the RCT include administrative data maintained by the&#xD;
           state; the Kentucky Health Experiment Survey (KHES), a prospective survey conducted for&#xD;
           Kentucky HEALTH by the NORC; and biometric assessments among a subgroup of KHES&#xD;
           respondents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Natural experiment and observational methods to estimate effects of program&#xD;
           components-specifically premiums and lockouts, community engagement, redetermination&#xD;
           lockouts, and increased coverage for substance use disorder services-on program&#xD;
           participation and insurance coverage among those randomized to the waiver arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semi-structured qualitative interviews of key population groups (including current and&#xD;
           former Medicaid beneficiaries, Medicaid administration staff, and providers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Natural experiment and observational methods to evaluate, for all low-income able-bodied&#xD;
           adults in the Commonwealth, the consequences of the demonstration waiver (and specific&#xD;
           waiver components) on (1) probability of Medicaid participation in the future and (2)&#xD;
           insurance coverage, utilization, health, and socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three elements will focus on the population of current adult Medicaid beneficiaries&#xD;
      who will be exposed to the demonstration waiver at the time of initial implementation. The&#xD;
      last element will focus on all low-income able-bodied individuals, who may both be current&#xD;
      and future beneficiaries of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed evaluation will yield actionable information for policymakers both within the&#xD;
      state and in other states where similar demonstration waivers are being proposed. The&#xD;
      evaluation plan is innovative in its use of an RCT, which is the gold standard approach to&#xD;
      achieving causal inference (Manning, Newhouse et al. 1987, Finkelstein, Taubman et al. 2012,&#xD;
      Baicker, Taubman et al. 2013, Newhouse and Normand 2017). In addition, our mixed-methods will&#xD;
      use natural experiments, which can also have high internal validity, alongside qualitative&#xD;
      methods, which provide granular data on process and outcome measures that cannot be collected&#xD;
      through surveys or administrative sources. Combining insights from quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data will provide information on multiple dimensions of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple data sources will be used throughout the evaluation. The state of Kentucky will&#xD;
      provide administrative data that will include Medicaid claims including prescriptions; vital&#xD;
      statistics; wages &amp; hours worked; education; state benefits enrollment data; records from&#xD;
      Kentucky HEALTH related to premium payment, redetermination, etc. Additional administrative&#xD;
      data will be made available from nationally curated databases including the State Inpatient&#xD;
      Databases, the State Emergency Department Databases, the American Community Survey, and the&#xD;
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. The research team will add to these these&#xD;
      administrative sources with the Kentucky Health Experiment Survey, qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with key populations, and biometric data from Medicaid beneficiaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Built into the evaluation plan is the opportunity to identify, (pre-)specify, and conduct&#xD;
      additional analyses in future years. For example, new analyses of interest may emerge from&#xD;
      our Year 1 quantitative plan and qualitative interviews, or from changes in the demonstration&#xD;
      waiver or its implementation. When new questions emerge, we will explicitly pre-specify any&#xD;
      new prospective analyses we wish to conduct, and identify any retrospective analyses that&#xD;
      were not pre-specified. In this context, the goal of the current document is to balance&#xD;
      pre-specification (which minimizes prospects of data mining) and the opportunity to&#xD;
      continually learn from the data in a policy relevant manner.&#xD;

      NORC collected bio measures such as height, weight, hip-waist ratio, and blood pressure among&#xD;
      participants. NORC also collected 1,434 blood spots to measure blood sugar (HbA1c), total&#xD;
      cholesterol (CHO), and HDL cholesterol. The blood spots were analyzed by and kept at the&#xD;
      Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of Washington (UW). Due to degradation,&#xD;
      CHO and HDL were contaminated and no longer of use to the evaluation. These samples will be&#xD;
      destroyed no later than at the end of the contract (June 2025).&#xD;
