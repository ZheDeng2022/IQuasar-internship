  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib/II , Open-label , Investigator-initiated Trail of SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1&#xD;
      Inhibitor) in Combination With SHR6390 (a CDK4/6 Inhibitor) in Patients With Advanced&#xD;
      Colorectal Cancer, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed in two stages, the first stage was the tolerance observation stage,&#xD;
      and the second stage was the curative effect expansion stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study is the Dose-finding Phase designed to establish the safety of&#xD;
      SHR-1210 Combination With SHR6390 at different dose Levels(150mg QD or 100mg QD ). The second&#xD;
      part of the study is the Expansion Phase designed to generate additional clinical data at&#xD;
      specified doses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 combination with SHR6390 in&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced CRC,NSCLC and HCC.&#xD;
