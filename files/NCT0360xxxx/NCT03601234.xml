  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a kind of mesenchymal tumor with malignant&#xD;
      differentiation potential. It originated from mesenchymal stem cells of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract.The most common is that gastric stromal tumors(GST) make up 60-70% of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      stromal tumors.The first choice for the treatment of non-metastatic gastric stromal tumors is&#xD;
      to ensure the integrity of the tumor and obtain the negative surgical margin.At present, the&#xD;
      common surgical methods of resection of gastric stromal tumors include laparotomy and&#xD;
      laparoscopy, most of them are partial gastrectomy, wedge-shaped resection, proximal subtotal&#xD;
      gastrectomy, distal subtotal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy, etc.There was no significant&#xD;
      difference between open surgery and laparoscopic surgery.With the rapid development of&#xD;
      endoscopic technology in recent years, endoscopes have been continuously explored in&#xD;
      practice.Laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery(LECS) is different from the past&#xD;
      technology. It is a new radical resection of GIST presented by Japanese scholars. LECS&#xD;
      resects the tumor completely by laparoscopy with the help of the precise positioning and&#xD;
      guidance of endoscopy .This method conforms to the idea of the modern minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery, and avoids many problems，such as incomplete resection and disorders of digestion&#xD;
      caused by excessive tissue resection. Investigators will observe the diffenrence of LECS and&#xD;
      traditional laparoscopic surgeries.Firstly,the investigators will collect 80 cases of GST&#xD;
      patients, randomly assigned for the laparoscopic group, the LECS surgical treatment.&#xD;
      Secondly, to analyzing the basic treatment and follow-up data, including the operation time,&#xD;
      blood loss, the number of transfer laparotomy or laparoscopy, the number of cut edge&#xD;
      positive, the distances of cut edge away from the tumor edge, the cases of anastomotic&#xD;
      fistula bleeding, stenosis, average such confinement, the meal time, cost of treatment, tumor&#xD;
      recurrence rate, the presence of residual stomach, upset stomach and frequency, reflux&#xD;
      esophagitis, bile reflux gastritis and other indicators.The purpose of this subject is to&#xD;
      observe the effectivity and safety of LECS , invent serval LECS equipment patents and provide&#xD;
      some references for LECS applying to the minimally invasive surgery of the digestive tract&#xD;
      tumor and multidisciplinary treatment mode.It also provides reference for gastrointestinal&#xD;
      stromal tumors, leiomyomas, ectopic pancreas, carcinoid, early carcinomas, giant adenomas and&#xD;
      polyps.&#xD;
