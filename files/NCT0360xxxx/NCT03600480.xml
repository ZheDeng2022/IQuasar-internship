  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find out how NNC0174-0833 taken with semaglutide works in people&#xD;
      who are overweight or obese. Both study medicines have been investigated on their own. The&#xD;
      study also looks at how the study medicines behave in participant's body and how they are&#xD;
      removed from the participant's body. Participants will get 1 of the following 2 treatments -&#xD;
      which treatment any participant gets is decided by chance: Semaglutide (a new medicine) and&#xD;
      NNC0174-0833 (a potential new medicine), or semaglutide and placebo (a &quot;dummy medicine&#xD;
      similar to the study medicine but without active ingredients). Participants will get 2&#xD;
      injections per week for 20 weeks. A study nurse at the clinic will inject the medicine with a&#xD;
      needle in a skin fold in the participant's stomach area. The study will last for about 16&#xD;
      months, but duration of participation for any participant will last up to about 7.5 months.&#xD;
      Participants will have 28 clinic visits with the study staff and some will be overnight&#xD;
      visits. Participants will be asked about their health, medical history and habits including&#xD;
      mental health questionnaires.&#xD;
