  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, open label clinical trial in approximately 300 children&#xD;
      aged 5-11 years with a physician diagnosis of persistent asthma. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intranasal dose of licensed quadrivalent LAIV&#xD;
      (LAIV4) or an intramuscular injection of quadrivalent IIV4 (IIV4).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at three sites: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Lead site),&#xD;
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (contributing site), and Duke University&#xD;
      Medical Center (contributing site) during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to receive either a single intranasal dose of licensed quadrivalent LAIV&#xD;
      (LAIV4) or an intramuscular injection of quadrivalent IIV4 (IIV4), stratifying by asthma&#xD;
      severity (mild vs. moderate-to-severe). Vanderbilt will enroll about 100 participants,&#xD;
      Cincinnati will enroll about 110 participants, and Duke will enroll about 90 participants.&#xD;
      After enrollment, participants will be followed for 43 days via 5 additional phone, email, or&#xD;
      text visits to monitor systemic reactogenicity, asthma symptoms and exacerbations, and&#xD;
      serious adverse events. The primary objective is to compare proportions of participants with&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations during the 42 days after LAIV4 versus IIV4. Because of the potential for&#xD;
      increased risk of wheezing after LAIV, the use of LAIV in persons with asthma has been an&#xD;
      area of vaccine safety research for many years; the safety issue remains unresolved. A&#xD;
      clinical study to assess the safety of LAIV4 in children with asthma could expand the&#xD;
      evidence base and inform clinical decision-making and public health policy.&#xD;
