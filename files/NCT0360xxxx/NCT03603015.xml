  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of men will experience bothersome urinary symptoms, which become more common as they&#xD;
      age. A number of conditions can cause these symptoms, and general practitioners may refer men&#xD;
      to their local hospital for further assessment and treatment. Symptoms can include poor flow&#xD;
      of urine, the need to pass urine more frequently, or the sensation that the bladder is not&#xD;
      completely emptying. This can be due to an enlargement of the prostate gland. These symptoms&#xD;
      can also be caused when the bladder muscle is not able to contract (squeeze) as well as it&#xD;
      previously has to empty the bladder. This is known as underactive bladder (UAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to distinguish between the two conditions as a cause for these symptoms, to&#xD;
      prevent side effects from unnecessary medications or operations. Currently, men would need to&#xD;
      undergo a bladder pressure test (urodynamics). This involves inserting a catheter via the&#xD;
      penis into the bladder, through which the bladder is filled with fluid and pressure is&#xD;
      measured. A separate second small tube is inserted into the rectum to measure the pressure in&#xD;
      the abdomen. The pressure changes are observed as the bladder is filled, and then urine is&#xD;
      passed around the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second technique for measuring bladder pressure is the use of a small inflatable cuff which&#xD;
      is placed around the penis (penile cuff test). The bladder pressure can then be determined by&#xD;
      inflating the cuff and interrupting the flow of urine. The bladder can be filled naturally&#xD;
      before the test, which means a bladder catheter tube is not required. This study is designed&#xD;
      to find out ways that the penile cuff test can be made more accurate. It will compare the&#xD;
      cuff results to those obtained from a bladder pressure test, and will take x-ray pictures of&#xD;
      the urinary tract during the test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to refine the procedural steps of the cuff test to improve the&#xD;
      measurement and reduce variability with pves.isv, therefore giving a more reproducible test.&#xD;
      By improving the penile cuff test, the investigators can then go on to assess how our&#xD;
      non-invasive measurements correlate with urodynamically derived indices of contractility, and&#xD;
      use data from this pilot to help construct methodology of future cuff research. The current&#xD;
      hypotheses are that; 1) accuracy of the cuff interruption pressure (pcuff.int) can be&#xD;
      improved by modification of penile cuff test factors, 2) the number of valid inflations&#xD;
      obtained per patient will increase with the modifications, and 3) that this non-invasive&#xD;
      measure of contractility will correlate with pre-existing invasive indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research protocol also gives the opportunity to explore correlation between commonly used&#xD;
      symptom scores, and accuracy in the assessment of ultrasound residual urine volume&#xD;
      measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are therefore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To modify procedural steps of the penile cuff test that may reduce the previously&#xD;
           observed variability and perform a pilot study to assess a reduction in variance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify behaviour of the urethra during penile cuff inflation, by performing x-ray&#xD;
           screening during the penile cuff test, and assess whether this is another source of&#xD;
           inaccuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the basic assumption of the penile cuff test that the bladder neck remains open&#xD;
           during flow interruption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare non-invasive measurements from the penile cuff test against invasive indices&#xD;
           of contractility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare 2 different symptom scores for men with voiding lower urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
           (LUTS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess accuracy and inter-observer variability of ultrasound residual measurement&#xD;
           against a known volume.&#xD;
