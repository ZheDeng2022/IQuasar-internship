      This investigator-initiated study will serve as a sub-study for the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology-sponsored VERVE protocol currently funded by the NIH. This double-blinded&#xD;
      multicenter randomized pragmatic trial is designed to determine whether Zostavax or Shingrix&#xD;
      are safe and effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) currently using anti-tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF) therapies. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for this sub-study mirror that&#xD;
      of the parent VERVE trial with the exception of abatacept therapy being allowed. Preliminary&#xD;
      data from the VERVE parent protocol enrolling patients using anti-TNF therapy is encouraging&#xD;
      in that few patients experienced adverse events (56 adverse events in 50 participants, out of&#xD;
      140 participants in total) and that 96.2% of these adverse events were considered either mild&#xD;
      or moderate. Importantly, there have been no instances of vaccine dissemination or zoster&#xD;
      events to date.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a live-attenuated vaccine (Zostavax速, Merck) to prevent herpes zoster (HZ) has been&#xD;
      developed and approved for use among individuals age 50 years or older, regardless of&#xD;
      previous HZ or varicella history. In a pivotal study of 38,456 older adults led by Dr.&#xD;
      Michael Oxman (a co-investigator in the parent VERVE trial and this immunogenicity pilot&#xD;
      sub-study), the vaccine reduced the incidence of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) by &gt;&#xD;
      50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines from the American Council on Immunization Practices (ACIP), based largely on&#xD;
      expert opinion (given the absence of data), recommend that patients who use methotrexate or&#xD;
      low to moderate doses of corticosteroids (up to 20mg/day prednisone) can receive this&#xD;
      vaccination safely. However, theoretical concerns regarding the safety of live vaccine use in&#xD;
      patients using biologic therapies have resulted in an ACIP recommendation that the vaccine is&#xD;
      contraindicated in patients receiving such medications. Similarly, given a lack of data, the&#xD;
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) endorsed this contraindication in the updated ACR 2012&#xD;
      recommendations for biologic and non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)&#xD;
      use in RA patients (led by members of the project team for this present application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently it is unknown if RA patients using biologics can safely receive these vaccines.&#xD;
      Despite the demonstrated efficacy and safety of the zoster vaccine observed in non-RA&#xD;
      patients, there are no prospective data critically examining the efficacy or safety of HZ&#xD;
      vaccination in RA patients. The zoster vaccine was not given to immunosuppressed patients in&#xD;
      the large Shingles Prevention Study (SPS); RA patients and others receiving biologics and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents including glucocorticoids and DMARDs were excluded. However, this&#xD;
      trial did show safety of the vaccine even for very elderly individuals including those older&#xD;
      than 70 years of age and with little evidence of remaining VZV-specific cell mediated&#xD;
      immunity (CMI). Moreover, live varicella vaccine has been safely given to children with HIV&#xD;
      infection. Recently, the investigators used the administrative databases of a national U.S.&#xD;
      Healthcare organization (Aetna) to conduct an observational study to examining Zostavax use&#xD;
      in patients with RA and other rheumatic diseases (e.g. spondyloarthropathies). Among a total&#xD;
      of 19,326 RA patients older than age 50, only 206 (1%) received zoster vaccine, suggesting&#xD;
      that clinicians may be uncomfortable using the vaccine in RA patients. Additionally,&#xD;
      approximately 60 vaccinated patients were using anti-TNF therapies within one month of&#xD;
      vaccination, and no cases of HZ were reported during this time frame. Some studies suggest an&#xD;
      elevated risk of HZ in RA patients using anti-TNF therapies, although HZ cases reported&#xD;
      within these cohorts of anti-TNF users do not show increased dissemination or complications,&#xD;
      suggesting that anti-TNF therapy might not necessarily increase the likelihood of VZV&#xD;
      dissemination in such patients. Theoretically, however, with downregulation of&#xD;
      interferon-gamma pathways associated with TNF blockade, an increase risk of HZ might be&#xD;
      expected in such patients. Lastly, limited head-to-head data collected to date suggests&#xD;
      abatacept might carry less risk of HZ and other opportunistic infections than does anti-TNF&#xD;
      therapy. Given the widespread use of anti-TNF and other biologic therapies like abatacept,&#xD;
      many RA patients and rheumatologists are unwilling to stop biologic therapy in order to&#xD;
      receive Zostavax. This represents a missed opportunity with regard to HZ prevention. Clearly,&#xD;
      given the high risk of HZ in the RA population, it would be highly beneficial to&#xD;
      prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in patients using biologic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional non-live vaccine, the adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein E (gE) herpes zoster&#xD;
      (HZ) vaccine (recombinant zoster vaccine; RZV; Shingrix速), has recently been approved for&#xD;
      healthy immunocompetent adults &gt;50 years old by the Advisory Committee on Immunization&#xD;
      Practices (ACIP). In pivotal trials among healthy individuals, the vaccine was more than 90%&#xD;
      effective in all age groups studied (&gt;50 years) with a low incidence of serious adverse&#xD;
      events. However, the vaccine displayed a high degree of reactogenicity with 15.6% of&#xD;
      individuals suffering grade 3 or higher systemic reactions. While these reactions were&#xD;
      self-limited and typically resolved within several days, patients with active immune-mediated&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases (e.g. RA) were not included in these trials. There is concern that&#xD;
      given the potency of the AS01B adjuvant in RZV and its subsequent reactogenicity, that&#xD;
      vaccination with RZV could result in flares of underlying inflammatory diseases. Further, it&#xD;
      is unclear how biologic therapy affects the immunogenicity or reactogenicity of this vaccine,&#xD;
      and it is possible the efficacy of this vaccine will not be as high in immunosuppressed&#xD;
      populations. Given RZV is a non-live vaccine, it theoretically has advantage over the&#xD;
      currently used live shingles vaccine in which it is contraindicated to give to patients using&#xD;
      biologic therapy. However, before such use is recommended, the vaccine should be evaluated in&#xD;
      such populations.&#xD;
