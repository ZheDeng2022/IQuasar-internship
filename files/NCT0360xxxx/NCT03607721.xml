  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body motion evaluation (BME) by markerless systems is increasingly being considered as an&#xD;
      alternative to traditional marker-based technology because they are faster, simpler, and less&#xD;
      expensive. They are increasingly used in clinical settings in patients with movement&#xD;
      disorders, however, the wide variety of systems available make results conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to determine if a markerless 3D motion capture system is a&#xD;
      useful instrument to objectively differentiate between Parkinons's Disease (PD) patients with&#xD;
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in On and Off state and controls; and its correlation with the&#xD;
      evaluation by means of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six PD patients who underwent DBS bilaterally in the subthalamic nucleus were evaluated using&#xD;
      BME and UPDRS-III with DBS turned On and Off. BME of 16 different movements in six controls&#xD;
      paired by age and sex was compared with PD patients with DBS in On and Off states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematic data obtained with this markerless system could contribute to the discrimination&#xD;
      between PD patients and healthy controls. This emerging technology may help to clinically&#xD;
      evaluate PD patients more objectively.&#xD;

      Methodology. Patients. Six patients with PD, diagnosed in accordance with the United Kingdom&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria by a certified&#xD;
      neurologist and movement disorder specialist, were included. This is a pilot study, and&#xD;
      sample size was chosen by convenience, accessibility and proximity to the researchers. The&#xD;
      study was approved by the investigator's institutional research board, and the patients and&#xD;
      controls provided written consent. In the months preceding the test, the PD patients were&#xD;
      clinically evaluated by the same physician according to the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating&#xD;
      Scale section III or motor section (UPDRS-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrument. Actually, there are many markerless motion capture systems in the market, with a&#xD;
      broad range of prices, as well as a broad range of reliability. However, DARI system has been&#xD;
      proven to be one of the best for numerous reasons. This system requires a quick calibration&#xD;
      at the beginning of each day that the technician can complete in less than 10 minutes. It&#xD;
      does not have to be repeated until the following day, no matter how many patients are&#xD;
      evaluated. The system depends on a computer-based software that acquires the patient's&#xD;
      skeleton or avatar using eighteen high-speed cameras (120 Hz) placed around the room to&#xD;
      collect whole body data and delivers kinematic analysis almost instantly using sophisticated&#xD;
      biomechanical algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, traditional motion labs use cumbersome floor-mounted pressure plates to measure the&#xD;
      forces generated by the body. These require frequent calibration and restrict the subject's&#xD;
      movement to a limited area. DARI's kinetic capture system does not require force plates and&#xD;
      can measure joint torques, ground reaction forces, and other measurements without restricting&#xD;
      the subject's natural movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markerless 3D motion capture evaluation of kinematics in the PD patients and controls was&#xD;
      performed on a rectangle room that measures 6 x 6 meters and 3 meters in height. The room has&#xD;
      a green screen on the floor, and eighteen cameras are strategically placed on the walls,&#xD;
      twelve are placed 2.6 meters high and 6 are on a lower level at 30 centimeters from the&#xD;
      ground. The room has ample space, which allows for broader movements to be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations. PD patients were asked to arrive in the morning wearing dark close-fitting&#xD;
      clothing, to skip their last PD medication, and with DBS in Off state for least 180 minutes.&#xD;
      On PD patients, UPDRS-III evaluation was done first. Then, to begin the markerless body&#xD;
      motion evaluation (BME), patients and controls' weight and height were entered into the&#xD;
      system to help establish the locations of joint centers. Once inside the green room, subjects&#xD;
      first stood with feet apart and arms outstretched to the side, while the system created a 3D&#xD;
      silhouette of each participant's form and a biometric skeleton was acquired; this took no&#xD;
      more than three seconds. For the BME, all subjects performed 16 different movements. This set&#xD;
      of movements was especially designed to evaluate PD patients and contains items that are&#xD;
      related to three major motor symptoms in this disease: rigidity, bradykinesia and postural&#xD;
      instability; tremor is not possible to assess. Once the BME was done, PD patients were asked&#xD;
      to turn their DBS to On state and wait 30 minutes before repeating both UPDRS-III and BME.&#xD;
      Controls only performed the BME, which took no more than 20 minutes. PD patients were&#xD;
      evaluated twice (DBS state On and Off) with a 1-hour wait in between; their evaluation&#xD;
      altogether took approximately 1.5 hours. The data files were uploaded to DARI Motion Platform&#xD;
      where the biomechanical analysis produced full-body kinematic results and, finally, these&#xD;
      data were exported to Excel for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis. A paired t-test was used to compare mean changes in UPDRS-III between the On and&#xD;
      Off state. Mean differences between groups were evaluated with ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests&#xD;
      depending of the distribution of the data of each independent variable. Post hoc analyses&#xD;
      were made for pairwise comparison in statistically significant results. Bivariate&#xD;
      correlations among evaluation modalities were examined. These correlations were examined in&#xD;
      the On and Off state between UPDRS-III and BME items. To compare them as accurately as&#xD;
      possible, the items on UPDRS-III and BME that were similar were correlated (e.g. rigidity in&#xD;
      upper limbs from UPDRS-III was correlated with shoulder flexion, extension, rotation from&#xD;
      BME). One of the correlations was hip displacement taken from BME, which analyzes balance by&#xD;
      measuring the movement of hips when patients stand during 10 seconds with arms outstretched&#xD;
      to the sides and eyes closed; this was correlated with posture stability item from UPDRS-III,&#xD;
      which is a quick pull, reactionary intervention test where patient's response is measured.&#xD;
      Because not all UPDRS-III items were measurable by DARI, seven out of 18 were correlated;&#xD;
      however, all BME items were correlated with UPDRS-III global score. IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0&#xD;
      software was used for data analysis. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to indicate&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
