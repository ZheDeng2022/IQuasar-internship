  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TP-1287 is an oral phosphate prodrug of the CDK9 inhibitor, alvocidib. This is a Phase 1,&#xD;
      open-label, dose-escalation, dose-expansion, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      study, with a purpose of determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-1287 in patients with advanced metastatic or progressive solid&#xD;
      tumors who are refractory to, or intolerant of, established therapy known to provide clinical&#xD;
      benefit for their condition.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Escalation: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting&#xD;
           toxicities (DLTs) of oral TP-1287 in patients with advanced metastatic or progressive&#xD;
           solid tumors who are refractory to, or intolerant of, established therapy known to&#xD;
           provide clinical benefit for their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Escalation: To establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for future&#xD;
           studies with TP-1287&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Expansion: To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of TP-1287 in&#xD;
           terms of objective response rate (ORR) when administered at the RP2D in patients with&#xD;
           sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Escalation: To establish the pharmacokinetics of orally administered TP-1287&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Escalation: To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of&#xD;
           TP-1287 by objective radiographic assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Escalation: To study the pharmacodynamics of TP-1287 therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Expansion: To determine the median progression-free survival (PFS) rate in&#xD;
           patients with sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Dose Expansion: To evaluate the safety of TP-1287 when administered at the RP2D&#xD;
           in patients with sarcoma&#xD;
