  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to develop an academic EF intervention, Teaching Academic Skills to&#xD;
      Kids (TASK), for high functioning (i.e., IQ score ≥80) middle-school youth with ASD and EF&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Use focus group methodology and advice from expert consultants to develop the TASK&#xD;
      intervention targeting academic EF skills for middle school youth with ASD that is tailored&#xD;
      to the unique needs of these individuals (e.g., content specific to ASD EF deficits,&#xD;
      incorporate evidence-based teaching principles and methods for ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of TASK in 3 open trials to assess initial&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy.&#xD;

      The goal of the study is to develop an academic EF intervention, Teaching Academic Skills to&#xD;
      Kids (TASK), for high functioning (i.e., IQ score ≥80) middle-school youth with ASD and EF&#xD;
      deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop the TASK intervention targeting academic EF skills for middle school youth&#xD;
      with ASD that is tailored to the unique needs of these individuals (e.g., content specific to&#xD;
      ASD EF deficits, incorporate evidence-based teaching principles and methods for ASD). A&#xD;
      methodologically rigorous, well-integrated iterative and collaborative design process with&#xD;
      input from multiple stakeholders, including school mental health professionals, teachers,&#xD;
      parents, and youth with ASD, will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of TASK in 3 open trials including the&#xD;
      feasibility of: 1) implementing the measurement protocol, 2) operationalizing intervention&#xD;
      delivery, 3) assessing both trained and untrained areas of functioning, 4) assessing whether&#xD;
      improvements in academic EF skills (proposed mechanism of treatment) are related to&#xD;
      functional educational outcomes (e.g., homework behaviors, grades), and 5) exploring the data&#xD;
      for potential treatment moderators (e.g., gender, severity). It is hypothesized that TASK&#xD;
      will be feasible, acceptable (attendance, satisfaction), and will result in improved academic&#xD;
      EF skills associated with reduced academic impairment and homework problems.&#xD;

    <measure>Children's Organizational Skills Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Organizational Skills Scale is a rating scale of organization and executive functioning. A T-score is reported. A T-score of 50 indicates the population mean with a standard deviation of 10. Range of possible T-scores is 40 to 90. Higher T-scores indicate poorer organization/executive functioning. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) T-scores as rated by the parent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Second Edition</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Second Edition is a parent rating scale of executive functioning. A T-score is reported. A T-score of 50 indicates the population mean with a standard deviation of 10. Range of possible T-scores is 40 to 90. Higher T-scores indicate poorer executive functioning. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) T-scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Homework Problem Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Homework Problem Checklist is a rating scale of homework behavior completed by the parent. There are two subscales generated: Homework Completion Behaviors &amp; Homework Management Behaviors. Scale is rated on a 0 = never to 3 = very often scale and a sum of scores is computed for each subscale. Range of scores for Homework Completion Behaviors is 0 to 36. Range of scores for Homework Management Behaviors is 0 to 21. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) scores for each subscale. Higher scores indicate worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement - Third Edition Basic Writing Subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Woodcock Johnson is an academic performance measure administered to the child. A standard score of 100 indicates the population mean with a standard deviation of 15 (range of 40 to 170). Lower standard scores are worse. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) for the Basic Writing subtest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Classroom Performance Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Classroom Performance Survey is a teacher rating scale of classroom behavior. The scale is rated 1 = always to 5 = never. An academic competence mean score is computed (range 1 to 5) with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) total mean score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Academic Performance Rating System</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Academic Performance Rating System is a teacher rating scale of academic performance. Items are rated 1 = Never to 5 = Very often and the items are summed to generate a Total Score (range 19 to 95) with higher scores worse indicating a worse outcome. We present the Total score at baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Relationship Questionnaire - Communication Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Relationship Questionnaire is completed by parents to describe their parenting relationship with the teen. A T-score is reported for the Communication subscale. A T-score of 50 indicates the population mean with a standard deviation of 10. Range of possible T-scores is 40 to 90. Lower T-scores indicate poorer communication. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) T-scores.</description>

        <title>Parenting Relationship Questionnaire - Communication Subscale</title>
        <description>The Parenting Relationship Questionnaire is completed by parents to describe their parenting relationship with the teen. A T-score is reported for the Communication subscale. A T-score of 50 indicates the population mean with a standard deviation of 10. Range of possible T-scores is 40 to 90. Lower T-scores indicate poorer communication. We present baseline (before intervention) and 3 month outcome (post intervention) T-scores.</description>
