  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to 1) investigate the effects of auricular transcutaneous&#xD;
      vagal nerve stimulation (taVNS) on brain-gut signaling using a liquid meal test in functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia (FD) and gastroparesis (GP) patients using combined gastric, autonomic and&#xD;
      neuroimaging measures, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of taVNS on FD and GP symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 FD and 25 GP patients will be enrolled in this study, both females and males,&#xD;
      ranging between 18 and 65 years of age. There will be multiple study visits consisting of a&#xD;
      screening, baseline testing, consumption of a liquid meal, and fMRI brain and gut imaging&#xD;
      sessions. Visits will include active and inactive taVNS delivered to the outer ear at a&#xD;
      moderate, non-painful level.&#xD;

    <time_frame>40 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be studied in the morning after overnight fast. The liquid meal test will be conducted in the following way: subjects consume 120 ml of Ensure every 4 min until full. At 5 min intervals, participants score fullness using a rating scale that combines verbal descriptors on a scale graded 0-5. Participants are told to stop when a score of 5 is obtained.</description>

    <measure>Short Form Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete multiple questionnaires during the sessions, including the SF-NDI. The SF-NDI consists of 10 questions regarding the effects of dyspepsia symptoms (&quot;stomach problems&quot;) on different aspects of life (tension, interference with daily activities, eating/drinking, knowledge/control, and work/study) as they pertain to the last week. Each response can be from 1 (not at all affected) to 5 (extremely affected), or 0 (N/A), for a total summed score out of 50.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete multiple questionnaires during the sessions, including the BPI. The BPI assesses the severity of the subject's pain as well as the degree of disability and impact on daily functioning over the past 24 hours and past 7 days. This questionnaire includes a diagram of the human body in which the subject would shade in where they feel pain, placing an X on the area that hurts the most, as well as series of questions rating the subject's pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) and on the relief felt from treatments or medications as measured from 0% (no relief) to 100% (complete relief).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete multiple questionnaires during the sessions, including the VAS. The VAS measures satiation, abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, bloating, and belching on a visual scale (0-100mm) with the descriptors &quot;unnoticeable&quot; and &quot;unbearable&quot; as anchors for 0mm and 100mm respectively. It will be administered at multiple time points across a session, with the sum of the 0-100mm scales for each symptom providing an aggregate symptom score.</description>
