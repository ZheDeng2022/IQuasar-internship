  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penicillin antibiotics are safe and inexpensive, and target selected bacteria rather than&#xD;
      killing a broad range. Unfortunately, around 10% of the population are labelled as&#xD;
      'penicillin allergic'. This is often based on side effects such as rash and diarrhoea, and&#xD;
      90-95% of people with the label are not actually allergic to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The label leads to the use of alternative antibiotics, which tend to more toxic, and less&#xD;
      specific about which bacteria they kill; this increases the risk of infections with so-called&#xD;
      'super-bugs', compared to patients without the label. People with the label also have an&#xD;
      increased length of hospital stay and rates of readmission. These are significant problems&#xD;
      for individuals, as well as wider society. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, the gold standard&#xD;
      test for allergy is an oral challenge. Patients undergo skin +/- blood tests prior to a&#xD;
      challenge, as these can help make the diagnosis. This combined pathway is expensive and time&#xD;
      consuming, so testing cannot be offered routinely to all patients. However in patients with&#xD;
      'historic' reactions (many years previously), skin and blood tests become much less useful;&#xD;
      in one study, 100% of patients who skin tested positive for amoxycillin allergy, tested&#xD;
      negative 5 years later. Patients with historic reactions can therefore proceed directly to an&#xD;
      oral challenge without prior skin or blood testing, since these offer little help in making&#xD;
      the diagnosis. This streamlines the pathway, making it quick, non-invasive and cheap. Already&#xD;
      established practice in several centres in Europe and beyond, this abbreviated pathway is&#xD;
      offered on an ad-hoc basis in some centres in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to demonstrate that this pathway offers a safe and effective way to perform&#xD;
      large-scale delabelling of elective surgical patients, who might not otherwise meet NICE&#xD;
      criteria for testing.&#xD;
