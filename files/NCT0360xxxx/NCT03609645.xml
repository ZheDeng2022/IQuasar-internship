  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip Fracture is a common orthopedic emergency in elderly people, which causes moderate to&#xD;
      severe pain. Until now, different methods of pain treatment have been used, including&#xD;
      pain-killer medication, which given in to the vein, and a nerve block.. A nerve block is the&#xD;
      defined as injection of a freezing/numbing medication (local anesthetic) around the nerve&#xD;
      area in order to stop pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Painkiller medications by themselves are not enough to stop pain, especially the pain that&#xD;
      start with movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Toronto Western hospital, patients with hip fracture will generally receive a fascia&#xD;
      iliac block (FIB) within 24 hours of hospital admission as a standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fascia iliaca block is a nerve block done by injecting local anestheticat the level of the&#xD;
      groin. This done to provide pain relief and is done either in the emergency room or in the&#xD;
      inpatient area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that nerves supplying other areas in the hip may be blocked to relive hip&#xD;
      pain fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional to this method, there is a newer type of nerve block, called the femoral articular&#xD;
      branch block (FAB) that aim to block the nerves supplying the hip joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new block has been described based on better understanding of the anatomy of the nerves&#xD;
      that control hip pain. This block consists on an injection in the groin at a similar location&#xD;
      as the Fascia iliaca block except that the needle has to go slightly deeper (by a few&#xD;
      centimeters) to reach a better target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current understanding on anatomy it is possible that this new technique may&#xD;
      provide better pain control than a Fascia Iliaca Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the degree of pain relief achieved by the two&#xD;
      different nerve block techniques: 1) Fascia iliaca block (FIB) and 2) Femoral and AON&#xD;
      articular branches block (FAB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anterior hip joint is innervated by articular branches from the femoral nerve (FN), the&#xD;
      obturator nerve (ON) and the accessory obturator nerve (AON). The posterior and inferior&#xD;
      parts of the hip joint capsule are innervated by the sacral plexus via a) the sciatic nerve,&#xD;
      b) the sciatic branch to the quadratus femoris muscle and c) the superior gluteal nerves.&#xD;
      Gerhardt et al showed that nociceptive fibers are predominantly present in the anterior and&#xD;
      superolateral parts of the joint capsule, suggesting that the femoral and obturator nerves&#xD;
      should be the most important nerves to target for hip analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3-in-1 block and FIB are currently used to provide hip analgesia. However, recent MRI&#xD;
      imaging studies have shown that proximal local anesthetic spread was not consistent following&#xD;
      a 3-in-1 block and did not consistently cover the obturator nerve. Similar findings were&#xD;
      reported for the FIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study on the innervation of the anterior hip revealed the relevant landmarks for the&#xD;
      articular branches of the FN, AON and ON. This study found that high branches of femoral&#xD;
      nerve, which were given off superior to the inguinal ligament, play a greater role in the&#xD;
      anterior hip innervation than previously reported. These high articular branches of the FN&#xD;
      and AON are consistently found between anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS) and iliopubic&#xD;
      eminence (IPE). With the help of ultrasound imaging, these landmarks can be identifiable and&#xD;
      it is possible to target them directly in order to provide hip analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These recent data suggests that blocking these branches as they course deep to the iliopsoas&#xD;
      muscle should result in superior hip joint analgesia compared to a FIB since the local&#xD;
      anesthetic spread from a FIB is neither proximal nor deep enough to cover these articular&#xD;
      branches consistently. Real-time ultrasound can help identify these proximal FN and AON&#xD;
      branches using the anterior inferior iliac spine and the iliopubic eminence as landmarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to determine in a prospective, randomized, double blind&#xD;
      manner, the analgesic profile associated with two different regional anesthetic techniques:&#xD;
      (1) FIB and (2) Femoral articular branches (FAB) block.&#xD;
