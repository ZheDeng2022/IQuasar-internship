    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab before&#xD;
      surgery in treating patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative stage II-III&#xD;
      breast cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of enrolling patients with hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor negative (HER2-) breast cancer onto a trial&#xD;
      evaluating investigational agents prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in patients with&#xD;
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses to tremelimumab and durvalumab in patients with&#xD;
      HR+/HER2- breast cancer who receive the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pathologic response in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer receiving&#xD;
      tremelimumab plus durvalumab prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo a biopsy and receive standard of&#xD;
      care neoadjuvant chemotherapy before undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up until the time of surgery.&#xD;
