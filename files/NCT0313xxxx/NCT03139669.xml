  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive cervical cancer incidence and mortality can be dramatically reduced through early&#xD;
      detection and treatment, but many women do not complete screening at recommended intervals.&#xD;
      Many low-income women in Virginia remain uninsured and are at significant risk of being&#xD;
      medically underserved and failing to complete regular cervical cancer screening. At-home&#xD;
      self-collection of specimens for HPV testing is an innovative approach that may increase&#xD;
      access to cervical cancer screening in populations that do not participate in traditional&#xD;
      clinic-based screening. The proposed community based participatory study aims to determine&#xD;
      whether offering at-home self-collection for HPV testing through a lay navigator network is&#xD;
      an acceptable and feasible method to increase access to cervical cancer screening for&#xD;
      under-screened women in the Tobacco Footprint in rural far Southwest Virginia (Health&#xD;
      Districts 1, 2 and 3). The procedures will be recruitment of under-screened women in Health&#xD;
      Districts 1, 2 and 3 of Southwest Virginia to complete HPV testing using self-collection kits&#xD;
      distributed by lay navigators. Regardless of HPV positivity, all women will be provided with&#xD;
      information about cervical cancer screening (locations, cost, etc.), and will be encouraged&#xD;
      to complete Pap screening by a clinician.&#xD;

      The catchment area for the University of Virginia Health System and Emily Couric Clinical&#xD;
      Cancer Center (EC4) extends throughout Southwest Virginia and into neighboring West Virginia,&#xD;
      encompassing a portion of Appalachia. State-wide incidence of cervical cancer was 6.6 cases&#xD;
      per 100,000 from 2005-2009, but variation exists county by county: Cumberland (Health&#xD;
      District 2), Roanoke, and Southside were among those with the highest incidence. The&#xD;
      significant decrease in cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in the US and in&#xD;
      Virginia since 1950 is directly attributed to increased early detection and screening. The&#xD;
      Virginia Department of Health's Comprehensive Cancer Control Program found that patient level&#xD;
      barriers to screening for women in this region include lower education, lower income, and&#xD;
      lack of health insurance. Systems-level barriers in this region include decreased access to&#xD;
      screening services, financial barriers, and transportation barriers. This study will assess a&#xD;
      novel approach to addressing patient level and systems-level barriers to accessing cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening in Virginia Health Districts 1, 2 and 3, and utilizes an innovative&#xD;
      technology (self-collection for HPV testing) and delivery model (distributed by lay&#xD;
      navigators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-collection for HPV testing paired with a community health worker program is a model that&#xD;
      has been found to have great utility in accessing at risk women in Little Haiti, South&#xD;
      Florida, as well as in rural Haiti. Community health workers often have training in a variety&#xD;
      of health issues and conditions. Patient navigators trained in cervical cancer screening and&#xD;
      treatment specifically have been utilized to understand patient barriers to in-clinic&#xD;
      screening. The lay navigator program the investigators will work with in Health Districts 1,&#xD;
      2 and 3 involves cancer-specific training (including but not limited to cervical cancer&#xD;
      training), and training on facilitating access to screening and treatment resources available&#xD;
      in Health Districts 1, 2 and 3, as well as at the University of Virginia Health System. Lay&#xD;
      navigators are therefore uniquely poised to provide education to women around the use of HPV&#xD;
      self-collection, and to navigate women to in-clinic Pap screening, treatment, and support&#xD;
      services as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reach of Current Lay Navigators Trained using the &quot;Understanding Cancer&quot; curriculum&#xD;
      (developed by partners listed above), lay navigators in Russell County (Cumberland Health&#xD;
      District) reported 312 encounters between 2/10/14 and 12/17/14 classified as &quot;preventative&quot;&#xD;
      specific to breast cancer. Between 1/23/14 and 9/24/14, navigators across Lenowisco Health&#xD;
      District provided 233 cancer-related encounters, including navigation services for 4 women&#xD;
      diagnosed with cervical cancer. The lay navigator program has the potential to be a rich&#xD;
      resources for community based research in Southwest Virginia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Development Dr. Mitchell is currently a Co-I on the NCI-funded project P30CA044579&#xD;
      (PI: Thomas Loughran, MD, 2014-2015). Through this work, the investigators are developing a&#xD;
      list of key stakeholders, which will be consulted in Phases I and II of this study.&#xD;
      Additionally, the community advisory board (CAB) of the Cancer Center Without Walls&#xD;
      initiative will be consulted throughout protocol development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Mitchell has developed a collaboration with Dr. Jennifer S. Smith, Associate Professor of&#xD;
      Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Smith and her research&#xD;
      team have extensive experience and expertise with HPV screening and prevention, specifically&#xD;
      exploring delivery models for HPV self-collection in medically underserved areas of North&#xD;
      Carolina. The investigators are planning to collaborate on this pilot study, and based on&#xD;
      these findings, to develop a proposal for an NIH/NCI R01 grant as co-PIs. Dr. Smith and the&#xD;
      research team have conducted two previous studies assessing the acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      and validity of HPV self-collection. Through these studies, the investigators have identified&#xD;
      brush designs that are minimally invasive, well-accepted, and effective for self-collection&#xD;
      and sample preservation media that is non-toxic, safe for mailing, and stable at a range of&#xD;
      temperatures; and have developed well-validated, field-tested illustrated instructions for&#xD;
      self-collection that are comprehensible to low-literacy women.&#xD;
