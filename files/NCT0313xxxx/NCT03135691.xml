  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung protective ventilation (LPV) has been proposed to reduce the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      pulmonary complications (PPCs), and protect against ventilator induced lung injury (VILI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LPV was first introduced in the intensive care units but has been recently adopted in the&#xD;
      operating rooms. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a widely prevalent condition in obese&#xD;
      patients and requires special attention in the operating room. Screening for OSA risk in&#xD;
      surgical patients is a common practice. The STOP-BANG questionnaire is a common screening&#xD;
      tool for OSA (Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, BMI, Age, Neck&#xD;
      circumference, and male Gender). The American Society of Anesthesiologists practice&#xD;
      guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with OSA do not recommend any&#xD;
      specific ventilation strategy to prevent PPCs in this population. To the knowledge of the&#xD;
      investigators, the association between intraoperative ventilation strategies and PPCs in&#xD;
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery patients, who have a high STOP-BANG score, has not been&#xD;
      adequately investigated. The investigators propose a retrospective chart review of patients,&#xD;
      18 years of age and older, who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery, in reverse&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position, using pressure controlled ventilation (PCV/PCV-VG) at the Ohio State&#xD;
      University Wexner Medical Center, between January 01, 2012 and November 22, 2016, to&#xD;
      determine whether intraoperative driving pressure is a predictor of postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications. No procedures will be done for the sake of conducting this study except for a&#xD;
      retrospective review of patient charts. Preoperative and intraoperative variables will be&#xD;
      collected to determine their predictive value of postoperative complications. No risks to the&#xD;
      patients' health or well being are anticipated due to the conduct of the proposed study. No&#xD;
      immediate benefits to the patients from whom data was collected is anticipated either.&#xD;
      Results obtained from this study may provide valuable information on the preferred&#xD;
      ventilation strategies in the operating room for future patients who have a high risk of&#xD;
      postoperative lung complications.&#xD;
