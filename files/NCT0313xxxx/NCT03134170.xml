  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled cross-over trial, in the form of a proof of concept&#xD;
      study that is designed to evaluate the health outcomes resulting from incorporating a&#xD;
      licensed clinical pharmacist in a health care team to provide case management for diabetic&#xD;
      patients at the Henry J Austin Health Clinic. The study uses a control group design and will&#xD;
      feature both an experimental group and a control group. The control group, of 80 patients,&#xD;
      will receive the standard treatment at the clinic. The experimental group, of 80 patients,&#xD;
      will receive the standard treatment as well as Medication Therapy Management and counseling&#xD;
      from a pharmacist. After one year the patients in the control group can cross-over to the&#xD;
      intervention group and receive care from the pharmacist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will put all patients into one of two groups by chance (like flipping a coin). One group&#xD;
      of 80 patients will get the regular care at the clinic (control group). The other group of 80&#xD;
      patients will get their regular care at the clinic plus care by a pharmacist. The pharmacist&#xD;
      and the regular provider will work as a team to manage the patient's drug therapy&#xD;
      (Intervention group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the status of the patient's diabetes at each visit. Tests may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring weight, heart rate, and blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Finger stick with a small needle to check lipid (fat) concentrations, fasting blood&#xD;
           sugar or HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examining feet, skin, and eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reviewing the patient's diary of blood sugars, diet, and exercise history&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Filling out a survey that measures quality of life and problems that make it hard to&#xD;
           control your diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Referral to other specialists such as a podiatrist (foot doctor), optometrist (eye&#xD;
           doctor), nutritionist, and dentist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have appointments with their current provider and possibly with the pharmacist&#xD;
      at least every 3 months. However, the total number of appointments is based on the patient's&#xD;
      health needs. The first appointment with the pharmacist will take about one hour. Additional&#xD;
      appointments will take about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group without the pharmacist will have regular appointment times. After 12 months in the&#xD;
      study if the patients glucose is not well controlled they can be treated by the pharmacist&#xD;
      for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final measures will be made after 12 mont&#xD;
