  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain human blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor&#xD;
      cells (HSPCs) to reconstitute a match human immune system in our PDX model. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that by using matched leukocytes and PDX from the same patient, rejection of the PDX by the&#xD;
      host immune system will not be observed and therefore a preclinical model to study&#xD;
      immunotherapy can be developed to study, understand and improve upon our current therapies.&#xD;
      HSPCs will be collected from bone marrow aspirate obtained from a bone marrow biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to use patient tumor biopsy samples or circulating tumor cell&#xD;
      samples to develop additional preclinical models of GU cancers, particularly prostate cancer,&#xD;
      that are clinically relevant by generating additional PDXs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria for Bone Marrow Biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with Genitourinary (GU) Cancers and presence of existing patient derived&#xD;
