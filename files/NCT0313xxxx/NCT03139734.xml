    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if sacral neuromodulation is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for pelvic pain associated with surgically treated endometriosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is typically associated with severe pelvic pain and pain is often combined with&#xD;
      dysfunctional symptoms of the urinary bladder and the bowel. Endometriosis impairs the&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and pain is the main reason for the decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      When the primary endometriosis treatments, i.e. hormonal therapy and surgery, fail to&#xD;
      alleviate pain or symptoms recur after successful treatment, the options are often limited.&#xD;
      Recurrent or long-lasting endometriosis pain commonly involves neuropathic pain component&#xD;
      with periferal or central sensitisation to pain. This kind of pain is likely more resistant&#xD;
      to traditional endometriosis treatments and thus neuromodulation offers a logical treatment&#xD;
      option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some case series and at least one randomized trial describing the effect of Sacral&#xD;
      Neuromodulation in chronic pelvic pain associated with interstitial cystitis and painful&#xD;
      bladder syndrome. These reports indicate that Sacral Neuromodulation may be effective in&#xD;
      treating chronic pelvic pain but the level of evidence is low. There is one report on&#xD;
      long-term pelvic pain with Visual Analogue Scale score dropping from 8.1 to 2.1 and the&#xD;
      effect lasting for five years. There are also few case reports on different difficult sacral&#xD;
      area pain conditions treated successfully with Sacral Nerve Modulation. The common consensus&#xD;
      seems to be that further studies are needed on the effects of Sacral Neuromodulation on&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate if sacral neuromodulation alleviates pelvic pain symptoms and&#xD;
      related dysfunctional symptoms in surgically treated endometriosis patients and improves&#xD;
      their health-related quality of life. The treating gynecologist does the screening for&#xD;
      suitable patients and a signed informed consent is needed from the patients prior to entering&#xD;
      the study. A test pulse generator is placed uni- or bilaterally under local or general&#xD;
      anesthesia and used during a 2-3-week test period. A permanent pulse generator is placed if&#xD;
      marked improvement of symptoms is detected, the patient is satisfied with the treatment and&#xD;
      willing to continue. Women not responding to sacral neuromodulation will not receive a&#xD;
      permanent generator. They are asked to continue in the 3 year follow-up and they serve as the&#xD;
      control group if applicable.&#xD;
