  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the effects of emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal, reassurance, and&#xD;
      empathy) on pain responses in children with cancer. Children with cancer were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one emotion regulation strategy during an experimental pain task (the cold&#xD;
      pressor task [CPT]). During the CPT, children rated their pain and provided saliva samples&#xD;
      immediately before, after, and then 15 minutes after the CPT. This study examined the&#xD;
      influence of emotion regulation on self-reported pain and physiological activity assessed&#xD;
      through saliva samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 12,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year and the&#xD;
      majority of these children will experience pain throughout their illness. Children with&#xD;
      cancer are required to undergo repeated invasive medical procedures, including bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirations (BMA) and lumbar punctures (LP), which have been described by children as the&#xD;
      most distressing and painful aspect of their illness. The experience and memory of procedural&#xD;
      pain can have a lasting effect and impact distress in future procedures; children learn to&#xD;
      anticipate pain and show increased distress and decreased cooperation at subsequent&#xD;
      procedures. Moreover, childhood medical distress has also been linked to adults' reports of&#xD;
      pain and fear around medical events and even avoidance of future health care. Early painful&#xD;
      procedures have also been associated with behavioral changes to medical events later in life,&#xD;
      a finding that is supported by recent physiological evidence indicating that activation of&#xD;
      the pain processing system in the brain can change neuropathways, which leads to increased&#xD;
      sensitivity to later stimulation of pain systems. Therefore, it is vital to develop&#xD;
      strategies to minimize the pain and distress that children undergo through cancer treatment&#xD;
      and understanding the impact of children's memory on pain is a crucial step in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this important need, this study involved identifying the strategies that children&#xD;
      use to cope with distress that promote positive memories of medical events, examining how&#xD;
      these strategies impact their immediate physiology (via salivary biomarkers) and&#xD;
      self-reported pain, and understanding how these coping strategies change children's distress&#xD;
      over time during future medical procedures. Specifically, certain coping strategies change&#xD;
      the way that children interpret stressful medical procedures, which affects the emotional&#xD;
      response to future procedures. These objectives were accomplished by the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify emotion-regulation (i.e., coping) strategies that promote more positive&#xD;
      memories of distressing medical procedures in children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Assess the impact of emotion-regulation strategies on children's distress response to&#xD;
      painful procedures over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide specific means for impacting children's pain and distress during&#xD;
      medical procedures. Specifically, because the emotion regulation strategies described in this&#xD;
      protocol are modifiable and teachable, they provide direct implications for clinical practice&#xD;
      in pain management by identifying strategies that can decrease children's pain and anxiety&#xD;
      throughout their course of cancer treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Time of hand removal from the cold pressor task was recorded and used to operationally define pain tolerance with longer durations reflecting greater pain tolerance. A four-minute ceiling was used such that children were instructed to remove their hand from the water after four-minutes if they had not already done so.</description>

    <time_frame>The exact time that participants removed their hands from water, which can range from 0-4 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Children were asked to report their pain when they removed their hand from the water using a numeric rating scale (NRS). Children ages 6 through 11 were asked &quot;How much is it hurting right now?&quot; on a scale of &quot;Not hurting&quot; = 0 to &quot;Hurting a whole lot&quot; = 10. Children 12 to 18 were asked &quot;How much pain are you in right now?&quot; on a scale of &quot;No Pain at All&quot; = 0 to &quot;A Lot of Pain&quot; = 10.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children between the ages of 6-18 years who were currently undergoing outpatient&#xD;
             treatment for cancer and who could speak, read, and write in English or Spanish were&#xD;
             eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment, such as a developmental delay or mental retardation that would&#xD;
             prevent children from participating in the experimental pain task.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children whose medical status require inpatient hospitalization or otherwise signify&#xD;
             health complications that would prevent participation will not be recruited.&#xD;
             Accordingly, all potential participants will be obtained via consultation with the&#xD;
             Attending Oncology physician and/or nursing team.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Following safety guidelines, participants will be excluded if they have a cut or sore&#xD;
             on their non-dominant hand, have high blood pressure, or have a history of upper&#xD;
             extremity vascular disease, cardiovascular disorder, fainting, seizures, frostbite, or&#xD;
             chronic pain (pain lasting for more than 4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because cortisol measures will be taken, participants will be asked to refrain from&#xD;
             eating 1 hour before the experiment, as this can affect cortisol sample readings. In&#xD;
             addition, because oral contraceptives can impact cortisol, participants taking hormone&#xD;
             medications will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
