  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs with radiation as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for Glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bavituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temozolomide&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Bavituximab as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Temozolomide as a treatment option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying how the combination of Bavituximab,&#xD;
      Temozolomide, and radiation affects this cancer. The current standard care of treatment for&#xD;
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma is the combination of Temozolomide and radiation. Temozolomide&#xD;
      causes cell death and radiation shrinks and kills the cancer cells. Bavituximab may activate&#xD;
      (cause) the immune system to attack the cancer cells as well as target tumor cells themselves&#xD;
      to kill them.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma or&#xD;

             brain.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  negative serum pregnancy test in WOCBP&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  INR/PT ≤1.5 x institutional ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy&#xD;
                  as long as PT or INR is within therapeutic range of intended use of&#xD;
                  anticoagulants&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aPTT ≤1.5 x institutional ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy&#xD;
                  as long as PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &lt; 4 mg dexamethasone daily (or equivalent if on another corticosteroid) at time of&#xD;
             start of therapy. Patients on a steroid taper post-surgery and are anticipated to be&#xD;
             on &lt;4 mg at time of chemoradiation initiation will be eligible to consent but to&#xD;
             initiate treatment on trial, the participant must be on &lt;4 mg or equivalent of&#xD;
             steroids otherwise participate will be deemed a screen fail and be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of bavituximab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of bavituximab administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to undergo an MRI scan and receive gadolinium-based contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1 cm3 of available tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to bavituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are moderate and/or potent&#xD;
             enzyme inducers or inhibitors which may have an effect on the metabolism of&#xD;
             bavituximab. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will&#xD;
             be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product (Appendix C for partial list).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bavituximab is an immunotherapy&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with bavituximab breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with bavituximab. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with bavituximab. In addition, these&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with other active malignancy in the past 3 years excluding in situ&#xD;
             tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet the following windows from procedures (there is no window&#xD;
             required for port placement since there is no anticipated impact on wound healing with&#xD;
             bavituximab):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Major surgery (ex. craniotomy) within 3 weeks of initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Brain biopsy within 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with history of bleeding disorder/coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with history of chronic or acute hepatitis C or B infection&#xD;
