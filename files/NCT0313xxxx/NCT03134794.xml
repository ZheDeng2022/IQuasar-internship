      The main objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To design an educational tool to train physicians in overcome cognitive factors associated&#xD;
      with therapeutic inertia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) To determine the feasibility and efficacy of an educational tool to overcome therapeutic&#xD;
      inertia among neurologists caring for MS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) identify the best strategy to disseminate an educational program to train physicians&#xD;
      taking into account regional and practice variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) To explore whether multiple sclerosis (MS) patients' risk category influence the&#xD;
      incidence of therapeutic inertia in neurologists that may require a segmentation strategy in&#xD;
      medical education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v) To assess how participants handle uncertainty when making treatment decisions by measuring&#xD;
      pupil variation from baseline (Canadian study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi) To evaluate the effect of the TLS on TI by assessing differences pupil variability&#xD;
      between the intervention and control groups (Canadian study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, randomized, study including an educational intervention (applying the traffic&#xD;
      light system) to overcome therapeutic inertia in MS care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is the application of an educational intervention (based on&#xD;
      best clinical practices) to reduce therapeutic inertia targeting neurologists caring for MS&#xD;
      patients. The investigators are also interested in evaluating whether an education&#xD;
      intervention decreases TI by reducing arousal response (pupil dilation), a proxy measure of&#xD;
      how physicians respond to uncertainty during treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to improve physicians' tolerance to uncertainty, which has been directly&#xD;
      related to therapeutic inertia in our previous studies. This proposal follows the results of&#xD;
      our study that identified factors associated with management errors and therapeutic inertia&#xD;
      by applying novel concepts and validated experiments from Behavioral economics/&#xD;
      Neuroeconomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the current study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physicians have limited education in risk management and formal training in decision&#xD;
           making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only a small proportion of MS patients are being treated according to the best clinical&#xD;
           practice guidelines. Physicians (cognitive biases affecting decision making) and health&#xD;
           system (e.g. access to an infusion center) factors are the most responsible causes of&#xD;
           practice gaps in MS care (Blum).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a previous study (JURaSSiC), physicians have shown poor estimation of the prognosis&#xD;
           of stroke patients. As this not unique to a single neurological condition and directly&#xD;
           affects the recognition of patients who would benefit from escalating therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapeutic inertia (TI) is a common phenomenon in medicine defined as lack of treatment&#xD;
           escalation when recommended according to the best practice guidelines. This phenomenon&#xD;
           lead to poorer patients outcomes, greater disability, and diminished quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a recent study conducted by our group including 136 neurologists and MS experts, the&#xD;
           investigators found TI was present in nearly 7 out of 10 (68.8%) of participants.&#xD;
           Similar results were observed for criteria of disease progression. Aversion to ambiguity&#xD;
           (situation when risk are unknown) and low tolerance to uncertainty were the stronger&#xD;
           predictors of TI among neurologists caring for MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although risk prognostic tools (e.g. EMA, modified Rio, clinical+radiological&#xD;
           progression) are available to assist physicians in stratifying patients, it is not known&#xD;
           whether or not neurologists use a systematic approach to improve the therapeutic&#xD;
           decisions in MS care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a limited understanding on how to ameliorate the physicians' factors (e.g. low&#xD;
           tolerance to uncertainty, aversion to ambiguity, etc) associated with TI, which leads to&#xD;
           worse clinical outcomes and poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some strategies has been proposed to reduce the effects cognitive factors and biases on&#xD;
      clinical decisions. A comprehensive narrative review comprising 41 studies on cognitive&#xD;
      interventions to reduce misdiagnosis found three main effective strategies: increasing&#xD;
      knowledge and expertise, improving clinical reasoning, and getting help from colleagues,&#xD;
      experts and tools.18 First, reflective reasoning counteracts the impact of cognitive biases&#xD;
      by improving diagnostic accuracy in second- (OR 2.03; 95%CI, 1.49-2.57) and first-year&#xD;
      residents [OR (odds ratio) 2.31; 95% CI, 1.89-2.73].19 Second, the implementation of tools&#xD;
      (e.g. cognitive checklist, calibration) may overcome overconfidence, the anchoring and&#xD;
      framing effects (figure 5).20-22 Third, heuristics approaches (shortcuts to ignore less&#xD;
      relevant information to overcome the complexity of some clinical situations) can improve&#xD;
      decision making. As shown by Marewski and Gigerenzer, the identification of three rules&#xD;
      (search for predictors to determine their individual importance, stop searching when relevant&#xD;
      information was already obtained, and a criteria that specify how a decision is made) may&#xD;
      facilitate prompt decisions and may help physicians to avoid errors in some clinical&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of training in cognitive biases in graduate and postgraduate programs might&#xD;
      foster medical education and thereby improve health care delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a new arsenal of disease-modifying agents became available in the last few&#xD;
      decades (and more will be approved in the next three years), but over half of neurologists&#xD;
      caring for MS patients do not escalate therapy when indicated by clinical best practices. As&#xD;
      such, physicians' decision-making process and access to new effective DMTs became the current&#xD;
      bottleneck in MS care. Physicians' factors that are directly associated with therapeutic&#xD;
      inertia in MS care. The investigators propose to creating and testing an intervention or tool&#xD;
      to train physicians to overcome biases, implement more standardized therapeutic approaches,&#xD;
      which will lead to reducing the incidence of TI and better MS outcomes.&#xD;

The active group will received an educational intervention applying proven concepts in medical education (cognitive reflection/checklist, traffic light system (TLS). Previous research showed that TL food labels prompted individuals to consider their health and to make healthier choices. A color-coded system influences the valuation process in favor of healthier choices by interfering with automatic decisions and triggering the re-evaluation process (Ena, Krajbich et al Judgement and DM 2016).&#xD;
The TLS is being implemented to facilitate the identification of patients at risk of developing a clinical and radiological progression that could result in escalation of therapy.</description>
