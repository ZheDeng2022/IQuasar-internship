      This is a single centred randomized controlled trial comparing surgeon versus anaesthetist&#xD;
      inserted rectus sheath catheters for management of analgesia post major abdominal surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and study aims Pain management post laparotomy (abdominal surgery) can be&#xD;
      difficult and in our trust we are increasingly using rectus sheath catheters (RSCs).This is&#xD;
      achieved by placing catheters, done by either by the surgeon or anaesthetist into the&#xD;
      potential space between the rectus muscle and the posterior rectus sheath. Two catheters are&#xD;
      placed, one on either side of the mid-line wound. Local anaesthetic is then infused through&#xD;
      the catheters for up to 3 days post-operatively. This provides analgesia to the central&#xD;
      abdominal wall in the region of the T7-T11 dermatomes. It only provides analgesia for somatic&#xD;
      pain, not visceral pain and hence needs to be used in addition to a multi-modal analgesic&#xD;
      regime usually including a patient controlled analgesia device (PCA) containing either&#xD;
      morphine or oxycodone. Advantages of a RSC infusion over an epidural include that it can be&#xD;
      used in patients with coagulopathy or systemic infection and can be safely performed asleep.&#xD;
      It is also less labour intensive to manage on the ward and does not carry the same risks of&#xD;
      hypotension and excessive fluid administration that are associated with an epidural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is randomised controlled trial evidence that RSC infusions in addition to PCA provide&#xD;
      superior analgesia when compared to PCA alone in surgery performed through a midline&#xD;
      incision. There is also a randomised controlled trial in progress that is comparing analgesic&#xD;
      quality of epidural infusions to RSC with PCA. In most published literature to date, RSC are&#xD;
      inserted by the anaesthetist using ultrasound to aid placement. In our hospital, some RSC are&#xD;
      inserted by anaesthetists although the majority are performed by surgeons at the end of an&#xD;
      operation. This is because we believe that this technique is less time consuming and both&#xD;
      insertion techniques result in equivalent analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim endpoint of this study is to determine any difference in insertion time for&#xD;
      rectus sheath catheters between those inserted by surgeons and those inserted by&#xD;
      anaesthetists. Observationally in our hospital, there is no difference in quality of&#xD;
      analgesia provided by the two insertion techniques. However, surgical insertion of RSC causes&#xD;
      less disruption of an operation as the patient already has their abdomen draped with&#xD;
      sterilised skin as part of their surgical procedure. Also, surgical insertion of RSC with an&#xD;
      open abdomen is potentially easier than ultrasound guided insertion by an anaesthetist before&#xD;
      an operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can participate? Any adults undergoing emergency or elective laparotomy (major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery.) What does the study involve? All participants will receive rectus sheath catheters&#xD;
      but will be randomly allocated to each group. Following the surgery, participants will have&#xD;
      to answer questions about their pain on 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? There are no specific benefits to&#xD;
      patients and the risks are the same if they were in the trial or not as it is routine in our&#xD;
      hospital to use rectus sheath catheters as a means of analgesia post laparotomy. These risks&#xD;
      include bleeding, dislodgement of catheter and failure of catheter and are low risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where is the study run from? This a single centre study at the Countess of Chester Hospital&#xD;
      in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When is study starting and how long is it expected to run for? We anticipate recruiting&#xD;
      patient from June 2017 for 6 months. How long will the trial be recruiting participants for?&#xD;
      No funding is required as all data collection will be carried out by doctors working in the&#xD;
      departments but the study is being supported and supervised by the Hospital's Research and&#xD;
      Development department.&#xD;
