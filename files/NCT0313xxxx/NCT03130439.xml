  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called Abemaciclib as a possible treatment for have&#xD;
      metastatic triple-negative type of breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment&#xD;
      for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some triple-negative breast cancers show expression of the Rb protein and are referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;Rb-positive.&quot; The Rb protein is important because it controls the way that cancer cells&#xD;
      divide and grow. Drugs like abemaciclib work by changing the way that Rb functions. This can&#xD;
      potentially stop cancer cells from dividing, and can also potentially lead to cancer cell&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are are looking to see how safe abemaciclib is and&#xD;
      how well it will work to help people with triple-negative breast cancer that is Rb-positive.&#xD;

                  staining present in &lt;1% by immunohistochemistry (IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HER2 status: the invasive tumor must be Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2&#xD;

             below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             --RB status: the invasive tumor must have greater than 50% of tumor cells staining&#xD;
             positive for RB.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients may have received 1-3 prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease&#xD;
                  (note: for patients who have first developed recurrent/metastatic disease within&#xD;
                  12 months of completing any (neo)-adjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast&#xD;
                  cancer, the (neo)-adjuvant therapy is counted as a prior line of therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have been off treatment with myelosuppressive chemotherapy for at&#xD;
                  least 21 days or nonmyelosuppressive agents for 14 days before registration.&#xD;

             the metastatic or early-stage setting. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 14&#xD;
             days prior to study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on bisphosphonates or RANK-L inhibitors may continue receiving these&#xD;
             therapies during study treatment. There is no washout period required between the last&#xD;
             dose of these therapies and the start of abemaciclib.&#xD;

                  5.0 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening. Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been&#xD;

             study treatment. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
             While on the study and for 3 months after final drug administration, women may not&#xD;
             breast-feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed availability of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with tumor that is felt to be accessible to biopsy must be willing to provide&#xD;
             tissue from a newly obtained core biopsy of a tumor lesion at baseline. Biopsies will&#xD;
             be obtained up to 1 week (7 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
             Patients who undergo an attempted research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this&#xD;
             protocol, and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are not required to undergo a&#xD;
             repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergone major surgery within 14 days of the initial dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received another investigational agent (defined as any agent/device that has not&#xD;
             received regulatory approval for any indication) within 14 days of the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug for a nonmyelosupressive agent, or 21 days of the first dose of study drug&#xD;
             for a myelosuppressive agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbid condition that renders the&#xD;
             patient inappropriate for enrollment in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection. Patients with known HIV&#xD;
             infection are excluded given the potential for interactions between antiretroviral&#xD;
             agents and abemaciclib, and the potential for increased risk of life-threatening&#xD;
             infection with therapy that is myelosuppressive. Patients with known Hepatitis B or&#xD;
             Hepatitis C infection are excluded only if there is evidence of active infection&#xD;
             (detectable Hepatitis B surface antigen, detectable Hepatitis C RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to&#xD;
             control symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible&#xD;
             if they have completed treatment at least one month prior to trial registration, are&#xD;
             neurologically stable, and have recovered from effects of radiotherapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without&#xD;
                  the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Treatment for brain metastases may have included whole brain radiotherapy,&#xD;
                  radiosurgery, or a combination as was deemed appropriate by the treating&#xD;
                  physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who meet the above criteria and are clinically stable on anti-convulsant&#xD;
                  medication are eligible only if their anti-convulsant does not alter hepatic&#xD;
                  cytochrome P450 activity in a way that might interfere with metabolism of&#xD;
                  abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactating women are excluding from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if they are diagnosed and have completed treatment within the&#xD;
             past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients&#xD;
             with other cancers diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of&#xD;
             recurrence should be discussed with the principle investigator to determine&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any live vaccination within 28 days of first dose of study drug.&#xD;
