  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation/safety evaluation to&#xD;
      provisionally identify a dose and regimen of SY-1365 for further evaluation in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the identification of a recommended dose and regimen from Part 1, the study entered&#xD;
      Part 2 to further evaluate safety and the antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients with&#xD;
      select solid tumors, and to confirm target engagement and downstream pathway impact in&#xD;
      patients with any solid tumor histology.&#xD;

      This study consists of two parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation/safety evaluation to identify a&#xD;
      dose and regimen for further evaluation in Part 2. SY-1365 will be administered intravenously&#xD;
      weekly &amp; twice weekly for 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. Dose escalation will proceed until&#xD;
      the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended dose and regimen for&#xD;
      evaluation in Part 2 of the study. Part 1 was concluded in September 2018 with a total of 32&#xD;
      evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the identification of a recommended dose and regimen from Part 1, the study entered&#xD;
      Part 2 to further evaluate safety and the antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients with&#xD;
      select solid tumors, and to confirm target engagement and downstream pathway impact in&#xD;
      patients with any solid tumor histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary anti-tumor activity will be evaluated in up to approximately 102 evaluable&#xD;
      patients in Part 2, with SY-1365 administered alone, in combination with carboplatin, or in&#xD;
      combination with fulvestrant. Part 2 will consist of five cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: approximately 24 patients with advanced ovarian cancer with 3+ previous lines&#xD;
           of treatment. Monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: approximately 24 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer with previous platinum&#xD;
           therapy. SY-1365 + Carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: approximately 12 patients with clear cell ovarian cancer. Monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: approximately 20-30 patients with biopsy-accessible, advanced solid tumors of&#xD;
           any histology. Monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: approximately 12 patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer post CDK4/6 +&#xD;
           hormonal therapy treatment. SY-1365 + fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the study may enroll up to approximately 137 evaluable patients across dose&#xD;
      escalation (Part 1) and expansion cohorts (Part 2, Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).&#xD;
