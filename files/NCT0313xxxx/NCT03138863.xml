  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects to be enrolled in this study are pregnant women whose unborn baby has been diagnosed&#xD;
      with severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). CDH is a birth defect occurring early in&#xD;
      pregnancy. It is characterized by the development of a hole in the diaphragm, the breathing&#xD;
      muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. As a result, the intestines and other&#xD;
      organs in the baby's abdomen can move into the chest and press on the developing lungs. CDH&#xD;
      is a serious condition which prevents the fetal lungs from developing normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of a new&#xD;
      procedure called Fetoscopic Endoluminal Tracheal Occlusion (FETO). FETO involves two surgical&#xD;
      procedures while the mother is still pregnant. During the early third trimester of pregnancy,&#xD;
      a special tiny balloon is placed in the baby's trachea. After the balloon has been in place&#xD;
      for several weeks, the balloon will be removed during a second procedure, generally done when&#xD;
      the baby has reached about 34 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of the FETO procedure is to improve development of the lungs in fetuses diagnosed&#xD;
      with severe CDH. If better lung development can be promoted, it is expected that overall&#xD;
      survival of babies with severe CDH after birth will also be improved.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Normal fetal karyotype with confirmation by culture results. Results by fluorescence&#xD;
             in situ hybridization (FISH) will be acceptable if the patient is &gt; 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolated Left CDH with liver up&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gestation age at enrollment prior to 29 wks plus 6 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SEVERE pulmonary hypoplasia with US O/E lung area to head circumference ratio (LHR) &lt;&#xD;
             25% (measured at 180 to 296 weeks) at the time of surgery; O/E LHR 25% to &lt;30%&#xD;
             (measured at 300 to 316 weeks) at time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gestational age at FETO procedure with O/E LHR &lt;25% at 27 weeks 0 days to 29 weeks 6&#xD;
             days; with O/E LHR 25% to &lt;30% at 30 weeks 0 days to 31 weeks 6 days as determined by&#xD;
             clinical information (LMP) and evaluation of first ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
