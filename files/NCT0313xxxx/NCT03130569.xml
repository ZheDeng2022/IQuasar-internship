      This study will have two phases, with an added usability test after Phase I and before Phase&#xD;
      2. Phase 1: Cognitive Interviews of materials in Spanish. Phase 2: Personalized Genomic&#xD;
      Testing for Skin Cancer (PGT-SC). The overarching goal of this study is to learn more about&#xD;
      how to maximize the availability, comprehension and appropriate uptake of personalized&#xD;
      genomics among different populations in New Mexico. Primary Care patients will be recruited&#xD;
      in their primary health clinic to complete surveys about their understanding and beliefs of&#xD;
      skin cancer and behaviors that might help prevent skin cancer. 6 out of every 7 patients will&#xD;
      then be asked to go to a website to learn more about skin cancer risk. Once participants have&#xD;
      completed the education modules on this site, participants will be given the option to&#xD;
      request and complete a skin cancer genetic testing kit. All participants will be contacted&#xD;
      again after three months to complete a follow-up set of surveys about skin cancer.&#xD;

      This study will have two phases, with an added usability test after Phase I and before Phase&#xD;
      2. Phase 1: Cognitive Interviews in Spanish. Phase 2: Personalized Genomic Testing for Skin&#xD;
      Cancer (PGT-SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this study is to learn more about how to maximize the availability,&#xD;
      comprehension and appropriate uptake of personalized genomics among different populations in&#xD;
      New Mexico. The study has been funded as an R01 by NCI for three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I: To examine the personal utility (that is, how does personal genomic testing help the&#xD;
      individual) of Personal Genomic Testing for Skin Cancer (PGT-SC) in terms of short-term&#xD;
      (three months after testing) sun protection, skin screening (i.e., behaviors), communication,&#xD;
      melanoma threat and control beliefs (i.e., putative mediators of behavior change). Guided by&#xD;
      Protection Motivation Theory, the investigators hypothesize that behaviors and putative&#xD;
      mediators will be higher in those who test, compared to those who decline testing or&#xD;
      wait-list controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Ia. An important challenge of personal genomics involves the potential for those who&#xD;
      receive &quot;negative&quot; genetic feedback to increase risky behaviors. To examine this potential&#xD;
      unintended consequence of testing, the investigators will conduct a subgroup analysis among&#xD;
      those who receive average risk PGT-SC findings, examining sun protection at three months as&#xD;
      the outcome. Predictors will include baseline skin cancer threat and control beliefs, skin&#xD;
      cancer risk factors, and demographics. These findings will be used in future studies to&#xD;
      develop messages for groups that receive average risk feedback, which accounts for large&#xD;
      segments of those tested for moderate risk susceptibility factors across many diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II: To examine differential reach of PGT-SC across Hispanics and Non-Hispanics, and&#xD;
      potential explanations for any differential reach. Reach is defined as the extent to which&#xD;
      genomic testing is spread throughout the population. Reach will be measured in individuals as&#xD;
      the consideration of the pros and cons of testing and registration of test decision.&#xD;
      Additional assessments of reach include baseline survey completion and decision to pursue&#xD;
      PGT-SC testing. The investigators hypothesize that those who are self-identified Hispanic&#xD;
      will show reduced reach, but that differences in health literacy, health system distrust, and&#xD;
      Hispanic sociocultural factors including cancer fatalism, family health orientation, and skin&#xD;
      cancer misperceptions will explain differences in reach between Hispanics and Non-Hispanics,&#xD;
      and provide guidance for future PGT-SC modifications for Hispanics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim III: Among those who undergo testing, to examine (two weeks after PGT-SC test result&#xD;
      receipt) test comprehension, recall, satisfaction, and cancer-related distress, and whether&#xD;
      these outcomes differ by ethnicity (Hispanic versus Non-Hispanic) or health literacy,&#xD;
      distrust, sociocultural, or demographic factors. The investigators hypothesize, based on&#xD;
      prior work delivering this intervention in primary care, the results will reflect high test&#xD;
      comprehension, accurate feedback interpretation, and low test distress in those who get&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Personalized genomics currently has extremely limited reach. First, most gene&#xD;
      discovery has not engaged diverse research cohorts. Second, the few translational research&#xD;
      efforts that address &quot;real world&quot; genomic challenges and opportunities have engaged those&#xD;
      with higher socioeconomic status and health literacy. Third, ethnic and racial minorities are&#xD;
      less likely to participate in basic genomics research, and are also less likely to utilize&#xD;
      available genomic technologies, even when they are offered. Ideally, the investigators should&#xD;
      all have fair access to the knowledge gained from sequencing the human genome, but if these&#xD;
      trends continue, the investigators will know little about how to maximize availability,&#xD;
      comprehension, and appropriate uptake of personalized genomics across large subpopulations&#xD;
      that stand to benefit from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin to address this, The Multiplex Study led by the National Human Genome Research&#xD;
      Institute (NHGRI) used population-based recruitment strategies in Detroit, Michigan to&#xD;
      evaluate an Internet-provided offer of genomic testing for common diseases, including&#xD;
      melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. Study findings indicate that this approach is&#xD;
      feasible - resulting in high test comprehension, accurate feedback interpretation, and low&#xD;
      test distress in those who sought testing. Yet this study did not include Hispanics nor&#xD;
      assess behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized genomic testing for skin cancer (PGT-SC) is an ideal context to extend Multiplex&#xD;
      to a new population, and new outcomes. Skin cancers are preventable, curable, very common in&#xD;
      the general population, and disproportionately increasing in Hispanics. The NHGRI Multiplex&#xD;
      Study offered testing for melanoma risk via the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R) because&#xD;
      MC1R is common in the general population (50% &gt;1 high risk variant), interacts with sun&#xD;
      exposure, and confers risk (2-3 fold; consistent with most moderate risk variants), even in&#xD;
      those with darker skin types. MC1R feedback is a promising vehicle to raise risk awareness&#xD;
      and protective behavior in the general population, including Hispanics who are largely&#xD;
      unaware of their melanoma risks. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      examining internet presentation of the risks and benefits of PGT-SC (shown to be feasible in&#xD;
      Multiplex) versus wait-list controls who are not offered testing, comparing personal utility&#xD;
      and reach in a general population, English or Spanish-speaking cohort in Albuquerque, New&#xD;
      Mexico, where there is year-round sun exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior investigator collaborations. This transdisciplinary effort will bring together the&#xD;
      combined expertise of investigators - many of whom have productive, longstanding&#xD;
      collaborations already - to integrate up-to-date research findings from their respective&#xD;
      disciplines, a necessary step given that the rapid unfolding of new cancer genomic,&#xD;
      communication, and behavioral science findings is the expected reality of these fields. The&#xD;
      investigators employ a Multiple PI Plan. Dr. Jennifer Hay, Principal Investigator is an&#xD;
      expert in risk communication and behavior change who has worked with Dr. Marianne Berwick,&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, a genetic epidemiologist and a leader in the field of the genetic&#xD;
      factors in melanoma for over 10 years. Drs. Hay and Berwick conducted studies examining&#xD;
      family communication and health behavior change (screening, sun protection) in melanoma&#xD;
      families, and found a high rate of discussion about melanoma risk in melanoma families, that&#xD;
      different patterns of family communication after melanoma diagnosis influence adoption of&#xD;
      prevention strategies, inconsistent adoption of such strategies in survivors, and that&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes associated with hypothetical melanoma genetic testing differ based on&#xD;
      positive versus negative risk feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot research conducted by the investigators at the University of New Mexico (UNM) indicate&#xD;
      that primary care patients are receptive to skin cancer genomic communication; UNM Hispanics&#xD;
      report higher skin cancer misconceptions. Drs. Hay and Berwick conducted this pilot study in&#xD;
      the UNM 1209 Clinic to examine 1) patients' receptivity to behavioral research studies in&#xD;
      skin cancer and genetics, 2) to document levels of sunscreen and protective clothing use,&#xD;
      shade-seeking, and health provider skin cancer screening examinations, 3) to examine prior&#xD;
      health information-seeking and family cancer discussions, and 4) prevalence of accurate skin&#xD;
      cancer beliefs. Most (71%) participants were female and they ranged in age from 19-81 years&#xD;
      (n=50), with racial/ethnic subgroups consistent with the Albuquerque population (46% were&#xD;
      Hispanic, 35% were Non-Hispanic White, 6% Native American, 3% African American, and 10%&#xD;
      other). Nine percent had not completed high school, and 55% had household incomes less than&#xD;
      $30k/year. About one third (30%) reported a family skin cancer history and 7% a personal skin&#xD;
      cancer history. About two-thirds (66%) reported interest in behavioral skin cancer research,&#xD;
      and while few (17%) had heard of genetic testing marketed directly to consumers, two thirds&#xD;
      (76%) said they would be interested in learning more about genetic testing for skin cancer.&#xD;
      Sun protection and skin cancer screening levels were consistent with recent national data;&#xD;
      29% reported that they consistently used sunscreen, 62% wore a shirt with sleeves, 34% a hat,&#xD;
      and 47% sought shade often or always while outside on a sunny day. Even fewer (26%) had ever&#xD;
      received a health provider skin examination. Non-Hispanic Whites reported more consistent use&#xD;
      of sunscreen, and were more likely to have received a prior health provider skin examination&#xD;
      than Hispanics and other racial/ethnic groups (all p values &lt;0.01). Two-thirds (62%) reported&#xD;
      that they were moderately or highly likely to develop skin cancer. Predominant reasons for&#xD;
      heightened risk included current or past sun exposure, fair skin, and family history or&#xD;
      genetic factors. Spontaneous health information-seeking was common, with 72% reporting that&#xD;
      they had ever sought information on medical topics, predominantly via the internet. Over half&#xD;
      (62%) had sought cancer information. About half (55%) had talked about cancer risk, and 37%&#xD;
      about skin cancer risk, in their family. Those with higher perceived skin cancer risk talked&#xD;
      more about it with their family (r=0.34, p=0.001) and were more interested in skin cancer&#xD;
      behavioral research participation (r=0.26, p=0.01). The investigators assess skin cancer&#xD;
      misconceptions as an explanation for reduced PGT-SC reach in Aim II of the current study,&#xD;
      because Hispanics reported more skin cancer misconceptions than Non-Hispanic Whites in the&#xD;
      investigators' UNM pilot study. Over half of Hispanics endorsed confusion about which skin&#xD;
      cancer recommendations to follow, and significant proportions of Hispanics agreed with the&#xD;
      statement &quot;it seems likely almost everything causes skin cancer&quot; (24%); and &quot;people with skin&#xD;
      cancer would have pain or other symptoms prior to diagnosis&quot; (24%). Also in the&#xD;
      investigators' prior work with nationally representative samples, the investigators found&#xD;
      that Non-Hispanic Whites had higher awareness of accurate skin cancer causes, prevention&#xD;
      strategies, and symptoms than Hispanics. Hispanics reported higher levels of information&#xD;
      overload and misconceptions.&#xD;
