    <textblock>
      Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to red cell alloimmunisation is an important cause&#xD;
      of hyperbilirubinemia with significant morbidity in the neonatal period . Hemolytic disease&#xD;
      of the newborn has unfortunately continued to contribute to perinatal and neonatal morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in developing countries . The degree to which the fetus is affected correlated&#xD;
      with the amount of maternal antibody that cross the placenta .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemolysis from ABO incompatibility is one of the most common cause of isoimmune hemolytic&#xD;
      disease during neonatal period. Infants with blood group type A or B , carried by blood group&#xD;
      type O mother, will have a positive antibody because of maternal anti-A or anti-B transfer in&#xD;
      to the fetal circulation. Ten percent of these infants will present with hemolytic disease .&#xD;
      Most of the infant presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the first 24 h of life&#xD;
      and it is rarely a cause in patients who are discharged from nursery and readmit with severe&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rh incompatibility can occur when an Rh-negative pregnant mother is exposed to Rh-positive&#xD;
      fetal red blood cells secondary to fetomaternal hemorrhage during the course of pregnancy&#xD;
      from spontaneous or induced abortion , trauma, invasive obstetric procedures, or normal&#xD;
      delivery. As a consequence, blood from the fetal circulation, and, after a significant&#xD;
      exposure, sensitization occurs leading to maternal antibody production against the foreign Rh&#xD;
      antigen. Once produced, maternal Rh immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies may cross freely from&#xD;
      the placenta to the fetal circulation, where they form antigen-antibody complexes with Rh-&#xD;
      positive fetal erythrocytes and eventually are destroyed, resulting in a fetal&#xD;
      alloimmune-induced hemolytic anemia and Jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional neonatal treatment of HDN consists of intensive phototherapy and exchange&#xD;
      transfusion (ET). However, ET is a high-risk invasive procedure associated with a significant&#xD;
      rate of adverse effects .Although the mortality rate associated with ET is currently reported&#xD;
      to be less than 0.3% in term infants , the morbidity rates can reach 74% and includes&#xD;
      catheter-related complications, sepsis, thrombocytopenia and hypocalcemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIG) therapy has been widely used for a variety of indications&#xD;
      in newborn period such as alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia and an adjunctive treatment of&#xD;
      neonatal infections. American Academy of Pediatrics, recommends high dose IVIG (0.5_1 g/kg)&#xD;
      as an additional treatment of Rh and ABO hemolytic disease and its use however there is no&#xD;
      consensus on its routine use in ABO hemolytic disease yet .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVIG &quot;contains a spectrum of antibodies capable of interacting with and altering the activity&#xD;
      of cells of the immune system as well as antibodies capable of reacting with cells such as&#xD;
      erythrocytes&quot;. When hemolytic disease occurs, maternal antibodies present in the infant's&#xD;
      blood attach to the antigen receptors on the infant's red blood cells. Specifically, the&#xD;
      maternal antibody attaches its Fc region, the lower portion of the antigen, to specific&#xD;
      immune system cells , such as machrophages, stimulating the destruction of the&#xD;
      antigen-antibody complex and the red blood cell. It has been proposed that IVIG blocks the Fc&#xD;
      receptor and therefore blocks the binding of the antibody to the antigen. With this blockade,&#xD;
      hemolysis no longer occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been suggested as an altenative&#xD;
      therapy to ET for isoimmune hemolytic jaundice to reduce the need for exchange transfusion&#xD;
      and duration of phototherapy and hospitalization in isoimmune hemolytic disease of the&#xD;
      newborn.&#xD;
