      the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib in a coated microsphere formulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 5-treatment, 6-sequence study in adult&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive up to four separate single oral 300 mg doses of a&#xD;
      coated microsphere (cMS) formulation of crizotinib. Period 1 through Period 3 will evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of food, and, the effect of multiple doses of a gastrointestinal acid reducing&#xD;
      agent, esomeprazole, in fasted state, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of crizotinib cMS. Period&#xD;
      4 will evaluate whether apple sauce or orange juice may reduce the effect of multiple doses&#xD;
      of esomeprazole on the PK of crizotinib cMS, if there is an effect.&#xD;

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
