  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild psoriasis not only progresses to moderate-to-severe psoriasis but also precedes systemic&#xD;
      inflammation that leads to psoriatic arthritis and cardiovascular comorbidities. By curing&#xD;
      mild psoriasis with a short-term anti- interleukin (IL)-17A treatment, investigators may&#xD;
      reduce the costs of treating psoriasis and associated medical conditions, including psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease of the skin that, even in mild disease, increases the&#xD;
      risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic derangements. Mild&#xD;
      psoriasis tends to be treated with topical drugs, while moderate-to-severe disease is&#xD;
      optimally treated with systemic immune modulators. However, the treatment of &quot;mild&quot; psoriasis&#xD;
      needs to be re-thought because recent studies have revealed that mild psoriasis is&#xD;
      characterized by stronger expression of pathogenic molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-17A,&#xD;
      and higher numbers of T cells in the skin, compared to severe psoriasis. A key distinction&#xD;
      between mild and severe psoriasis is now discovered to be the higher expression of negative&#xD;
      immune regulatory genes in mild lesions. Therefore, targeted immune therapy with anti-IL-17A,&#xD;
      which is highly effective in severe psoriasis, might be equally (or even more) effective in&#xD;
      mild disease. Also, restoration of immune tolerance might be more easily achieved in mild&#xD;
      disease. Thus, short-term anti-IL-17A treatment of mild psoriasis might prevent the&#xD;
      recurrence and eventually cure the disease. The aim of study is to test this hypothesis by&#xD;
      exploring whether 3 months or 6 months of anti-IL17A treatment will prevent relapses after&#xD;
      medication has been discontinued in mild psoriasis patients.&#xD;
