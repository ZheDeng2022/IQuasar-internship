  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to compare concentrations of hydrocodone and&#xD;
      acetaminophen in the blood after administration of a new and a marketed tablet formulation&#xD;
      under fasted and fed conditions in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, single-site, open-label, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover, single oral&#xD;
      dose Phase I trial in 32 healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of an Enrollment Visit, 4 treatment periods (each lasting&#xD;
      approximately 60 hours) separated by 3 washout periods (each lasting at least 7 days), and a&#xD;
      Final Examination.&#xD;
