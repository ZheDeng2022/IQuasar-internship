  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate pain therapy is important aspect of perioperative care. Sequelae of inadequate pain&#xD;
      management are patient dissatisfaction, post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), inadequate&#xD;
      nutrition, lack of mobilization, and an increased risk for the development of further&#xD;
      complications, such as postoperative delirium (POD). The use of patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      (PCA) systems, which allow patients to self-administer analgesics, has improved pain&#xD;
      management. Conventional i.v. PCA and the non-invasive administration of sufentanil&#xD;
      sublingual tablets (ZALVISO®) are available. The aim of this investigation is to study&#xD;
      patient controlled analgesia systems and to examine the incidence of POD, POCD and&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are strong evidence-based recommendations for an appropriate assessment and treatment&#xD;
      of postoperative pain. Due to the complex and subjective nature of pain, an adequate pain&#xD;
      therapy is an extremely challenging task, and the under- or overdosing of analgesics are&#xD;
      common. An inadequate pain therapy leads to patient dissatisfaction, post-operative nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting (PONV), inadequate nutrition, lack of mobilization, and an increased risk for&#xD;
      the development of further complications, such as postoperative delirium (POD). Other&#xD;
      long-term consequences of an insufficient postoperative analgesia include the chronification&#xD;
      of pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conversely, excessive opioid therapy may&#xD;
      be associated with increased risk of POD. Subsequently, patients with POD have an increased&#xD;
      risk for the consecutive development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The&#xD;
      latter is marked by a progressive and permanent loss of cognitive abilities, which can&#xD;
      ultimately lead to dementia. The use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) systems, which&#xD;
      allow patients to self-administer analgesics, has been an improvement in the prevention of&#xD;
      under- and overdosage of analgesics. Currently, there are two systems available: Conventional&#xD;
      i.v. PCA with patients being dependent on an i.v. line and a PCA-pump and a&#xD;
      patient-controlled, non-invasive administration of sufentanil sublingual tablets (ZALVISO®).&#xD;
      The aim of this investigation is to study patient controlled analgesia systems and to examine&#xD;
      the incidence of POD, POCD and postoperative pain.&#xD;
