    <textblock>
      Post-radiotherapy fragility fractures (caused by weakened bones) are an occasional&#xD;
      complication of orthopedic oncology of soft tissue sarcoma patients. Treatment for impending&#xD;
      fracture due to radiotherapy does exist in the form of operative stabilization, to prevent&#xD;
      the bone from breaking. Without the ability to predict those patients at a higher risk for&#xD;
      fracture, indications for treatment are difficult to determine. This study is to determine if&#xD;
      there is a correlation between patients undergoing radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma and&#xD;
      loss of bone density. The study wll evaluate bone loss for short and long term fracture&#xD;
      prediction using dual-energy xray, absorptiometry (DEXA [DXA]) and computerized tomography&#xD;
      scans (CT Scans)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-radiotherapy fragility fractures are a frequent complication of orthopedic oncology care&#xD;
      of sarcoma patients, who often receive radiotherapy (XRT) as adjunctive treatment. Prediction&#xD;
      of these fractures is difficult as there has been no demonstrable relationship shown, to&#xD;
      date, between bone density and fracture risk for this population. Treatment for an impending&#xD;
      fracture due to radiotherapy does exist in the form of prophylactic operative stabilization&#xD;
      with an intramedullary nail to prevent the bone from breaking. Without the ability to predict&#xD;
      those patients at higher risk for fracture, clinical indications for prophylactic treatment&#xD;
      are difficult to develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone density has been investigated as a possible fracture prediction tool. Work by Dhakal et&#xD;
      al. suggested specifically that bone density, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&#xD;
      (DXA), of the irradiated limb is not decreased following therapeutic doses of radiotherapy&#xD;
      (50 Gy) administered for soft tissue sarcomas. However, their technique did not measure&#xD;
      pre-radiotherapy bone mineral density (BMD), but rather compared post-radiotherapy BMD of the&#xD;
      irradiated site to contralateral and ipsilateral non-irradiated long bones of the extremity.&#xD;
      While this technique accounted for disuse osteopenia (bone loss due to decreased use of the&#xD;
      afflicted limb), it did not account for any systemic effects of radiation therapy. This is&#xD;
      important, because largely based on their work, BMD has not been utilized as a predictor of&#xD;
      risk of fracture, and other measures have been sought for this particular clinical situation&#xD;
      without success. Others have also failed to show decreased BMD within the irradiated field.&#xD;
      However, these studies have either lacked power to show statistical significance or the&#xD;
      patient population was pediatric, a growing population in which age related accrual of bone&#xD;
      density was a potential confounder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What Dhakal and others did not account for was the possibility of abscopal (systemic) effects&#xD;
      of radiotherapy that might also affect the contralateral and distant sites. Recent work in&#xD;
      this investigators laboratory and others using small animal models has suggested that&#xD;
      radiation to one limb has statistically significant effects on the contralateral limb in&#xD;
      terms of decreased bone mineral density and loss of bone strength. The importance and&#xD;
      clinical implications of such an abscopal effect is as of yet unclear. At the very least, its&#xD;
      presence calls into question the conclusion that bone density is not decreased at the site of&#xD;
      radiation, since differences may only be able to be shown when compared to non-irradiated&#xD;
      control subjects. Moreover, there may be an adverse effect on distant bones, further lowering&#xD;
      BMD and contributing to fragility fractures, particularly in post-menopausal women who are&#xD;
      already at some increased risk. There is mixed clinical data on this topic, with one series&#xD;
      of 45,662 prostate cancer patients showing a 76% increased risk of hip fracture (regional&#xD;
      bone) following pelvic radiation, but no increased risk of fractures outside the field of&#xD;
      radiation in three studies of patients with pelvic radiation for cervical and other female&#xD;
      cancers or prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this study propose to determine whether human subjects undergoing&#xD;
      radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas exhibit for abscopal bone loss. Patients in the PI's&#xD;
      (Dr. Damron) practice obtain baseline-staging studies, including computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
      of the chest/abdomen/pelvis prior to treatment. Post-treatment, patients then undergo&#xD;
      oncology surveillance utilizing routine repetitive computerized tomography of the chest and&#xD;
      sometimes of the abdomen/pelvis for a subset where the baseline abdomen/pelvis CT scans show&#xD;
      abnormalities that need to be followed. These CT scans, when combined with calibration&#xD;
      phantoms of known density, afford a prime opportunity to quantify bone mineral density based&#xD;
      on those scans at sites distant to the primary site of radiotherapy (typically in the&#xD;
      extremity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will also evaluate a secondary aim, that of comparing effectiveness of&#xD;
      utilization of CT vs BMD as a tool to evaluate bone loss in short term with a potential for&#xD;
      long term fracture prediction in this patient population. In order to accomplish this aim,&#xD;
      simultaneously, in a subset of patients who give consent for non-standard of care DXA scans,&#xD;
      the investigators will evaluate the potential abscopal bone loss by assessing changes in BMD&#xD;
      as measured by DXA, a tool that is a gold standard for bone density evaluation and for&#xD;
      fracture prediction in routine clinical practice. The investigators will compare BMD pre- and&#xD;
      post-radiotherapy at the site of irradiation, and further compare this change to that of the&#xD;
      change in BMD at distant sites.&#xD;
