      The objective of this expanded access program is to provide ONC201 to eligible patients with&#xD;
      previously-treated glioma that exhibits the H3 K27M mutation and/or that is located in the&#xD;
      midline region of the brain.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have one type of diagnosis below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A glioma that is positive for the H3 K27M mutation (performed in a laboratory&#xD;
                  with CLIA certification);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A grade III or IV glioma involving the thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem,&#xD;
                  cerebellum, midbrain, or spinal cord;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), defined as tumors with a pontine&#xD;
                  epicenter and diffuse involvement of the pons. These patients are eligible with&#xD;
                  or without a tissue biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unequivocal evidence of progressive disease on as defined by RANO criteria or have&#xD;
             documented recurrent glioma on diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have had previous therapy that includes radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Interval of at least 90 days from the completion of radiotherapy to the first dose of&#xD;
             ONC201. If patients are within 90 days of radiotherapy, they may still be eligible if&#xD;
             they meet one or more of the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Progressive tumor is outside the original high-dose radiotherapy target volume as&#xD;
                  determined by the treating investigator, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Histologic confirmation of tumor through biopsy or resection, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Nuclear medicine imaging, MR spectroscopy, or MR perfusion imaging consistent&#xD;
                  with true progressive disease, rather than pseudoprogression or radiation&#xD;
                  necrosis obtained within 28 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must be at least 3 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must weigh at least 10kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must be able to swallow and retain orally administered medication. For&#xD;
             patients unable to swallow capsules, oral ONC201 will be administered as a liquid&#xD;
             formulation in Ora-Sweet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must&#xD;
             have elapsed from prior anti-cancer treatments: 5 half-lives from any investigational&#xD;
             agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks&#xD;
             from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from anti-cancer antibodies (except 21 days for&#xD;
             bevacizumab), or 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor&#xD;
             therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Contrast-enhanced head CT or brain MRI within 21 days prior to start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm3 without growth factor use ≤ 7 days prior to&#xD;
                  treatment (cycle 1 day 1, C1D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 mg/dL without red blood cell transfusion ≤ 3 days prior to C1D1&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Total serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2 X ULN; ≤ 5 X ULN if there is liver involvement secondary&#xD;
                  to tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN (OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. For patients post pubertal: Female patients must agree to use effective contraception&#xD;
             while taking ONC201 and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment. Male&#xD;
             patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception while&#xD;
             taking ONC201 and for at least 90 days after completion of treatment. The decision of&#xD;
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign&#xD;
             it. Assent will be obtained when appropriate based on the subjects age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Qualifies for participation in an ongoing ONC201 clinical trial or is already&#xD;
             participating in an ONC201 clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an&#xD;
             investigational device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease or CSF dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any known systemic infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could&#xD;
             compromise the safety of the patient, while taking ONC201.&#xD;
