  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Per-dialytic hypotension is common in Intensive Care Unit patients under continuous renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy, and occurs in nearly 50% of the patients. To date, there is a lack of&#xD;
      study having characterized the underlying mechanism of hypotension in this setting. New&#xD;
      diagnostic methods are now available with high reliability to identify hypovolemia as the&#xD;
      underlying cause of hypotension, among which change in cardiac index during passive leg&#xD;
      raising may be the less affected by restrictive validity criteria. A change in cardiac index&#xD;
      greater than 10% during this test is highly predictive of preload dependence, i.e the&#xD;
      probability than cardiac index will increase if cardiac preload increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is then to identify, among hypotensive episodes occurring during renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy in Intensive Care Unit patients, the percentage of episodes related to&#xD;
      preload dependence as identified by passive leg raising.&#xD;

        This study concerns patients hospitalized in intensive care unit at the Croix-Rousse&#xD;
        hospital in Lyon with acute renal insufficiency (stage 3 of the Kidney Disease: Improving&#xD;
        Global Outcomes classification) for which treatment with continuous hemofiltration was&#xD;
        initiated less than 24 hours ago and for whom a hemodynamic monitoring device (PiCCO®&#xD;
        device) has been implanted due to acute circulatory failure and is functional.&#xD;
