      This is a prospective observational study to follow a cohort of patients with Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      and healthy controls for a period of two years. This study will include monitoring the&#xD;
      subjects lung clearance index (by performing a breathing test called the multiple breath&#xD;
      washout), as well as spirometry and their respiratory symptoms every three months as well as&#xD;
      during a pulmonary exacerbation and after their recovery.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational cohort study. During the 3 year study period, each&#xD;
      participant will be followed for a period of 2 years. The study will include quarterly&#xD;
      measurements of the lung clearance index (LCI), as well as spirometry, for CF patients at&#xD;
      their routine clinic visits. Parents of patients with CF will be asked to call the study&#xD;
      nurse or clinical nurse if they experience a worsening of pulmonary symptoms and to come to&#xD;
      the clinic for assessment of lung function. CF patients will then be assessed by a CF&#xD;
      physician to assess whether they require antibiotic treatment based on a clinicians decisions&#xD;
      to treat with antibiotics. The treatment decision will be left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      patient's responsible physician, who will be blinded to the MBW results. All patients who&#xD;
      meet the symptom based definition of a pulmonary exacerbation, regardless of treatment&#xD;
      decision, will have MBW measured after 4 weeks. Following these visits at the time of an&#xD;
      exacerbation, patients will have their MBW measured at their next clinic visit (usually&#xD;
      within 3 months), and every 3 months thereafter until the end of the 2 year observation&#xD;
      period, or the repeat onset of symptoms.This study will capture a maximum of two&#xD;
      exacerbations per patient over the 2 year study period.&#xD;

        There were 139 subjects recruited in the original preschool longitudinal study, and all&#xD;
        participants from this original study will be invited to participate in this follow up&#xD;
        study. We would like to recruit an additional 40 CF patients at the Hospital for Sick&#xD;
        Children to increase our cohort size.&#xD;
