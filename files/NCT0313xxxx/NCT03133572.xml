  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality rates from birth asphyxia in low-income countries remain very high. Face mask&#xD;
      ventilation (FMV) is the most common method of resuscitating neonates in such settings. It is&#xD;
      mostly performed by midwives but may not always be satisfactory. The i-gel® is a cuffless&#xD;
      supraglottic airway which is easy to insert and provides an efficient seal that prevents air&#xD;
      leakage with the potential to enhance the performance of neonatal resuscitation. Midwives can&#xD;
      be trained in a short time to use this method. A pilot study in Uganda has demonstrated that&#xD;
      midwives can safely perform resuscitation of newborn with the i-gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the use of a cuffless supraglottic airway compared to&#xD;
      face-mask ventilation during neonatal resuscitation can reduce early neonatal death (before 7&#xD;
      days of life) or morbidity in neonatal encephalopathy (NE) in asphyxiated neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN, SETTING AND POPULATION A single-centre randomized clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted at Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, among asphyxiated neonates&#xD;
      in the delivery units. Prior to the intervention, all staff in the labour ward performing&#xD;
      resuscitation will receive training according to the HBB curriculum with a special module for&#xD;
      training on supraglottic airway insertion. Resuscitation will be performed according to&#xD;
      international guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UTILITY OF THE STUDY It is crucial to explore alternative, cost-effective modalities that not&#xD;
      only would reduce mortality, but also the burden of neurological damage in survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the targets in the SDG-3 is to reduce neonatal mortality to less than 12 per 1000 live&#xD;
      births by 2030. This will require considerable effort in many low-income countries. Perinatal&#xD;
      mortality contributes to 40% of infant mortality in Uganda. Early neonatal death from birth&#xD;
      asphyxia (BA) could be as high 60%. New evidence-based strategies are needed to reduce&#xD;
      mortality from BA in order to achieve SDG-3 by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal care of the depressed newborn is crucial to prevent and manage BA. The challenge in&#xD;
      low-income settings is that highly qualified staff is not readily available to attend to the&#xD;
      newborn who require their expertise. In most cases, the midwives are the most skilled&#xD;
      personal attending to deliveries and also responsible for resuscitating newborns. At present&#xD;
      in low-income settings, FMV is the commonly used method for resuscitating depressed newborn.&#xD;
      Easy-to-use equipment such as a supraglottic airway could contribute to obtain more effective&#xD;
      ventilation, and improve the outcome of the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is based on a previous pilot trial ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02042118.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess if the proportion of either early neonatal death or neonatal encephalopathy&#xD;
      (admission to NICU with a Thompson score of 11 or above in day 1-5 during hospitalisation),&#xD;
      can be decreased from 40 % in the control arm (using FM) to 30 % or less in the intervention&#xD;
      arm (using i-gel supraglottic airway), a 25% decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of a supraglottic airway in the hands of lower cadre (non-doctor)&#xD;
           birth attendants in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the proportion of very early and early neonatal deaths is lower in the&#xD;
           intervention arm compared to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the proportion of neonatal encephalopathy (admission to NICU with maximum&#xD;
           Thompson score 11 or above), is lower in the intervention arm compared to the control&#xD;
           arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if the proportion of neonatal encephalopathy (admission to Neonatal Intensive&#xD;
           Care Unit - NICU - with maximum Thompson score 7 or above), is lower in the intervention&#xD;
           arm compared to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess if hospital admission rate in the first 7 days of life is lower in the&#xD;
           intervention arm compared to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the need of advanced resuscitation in the intervention arm compared to the&#xD;
           control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study justification and significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training midwives and other birth-attendants can save lives. However, delivering effective&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with FM is a delicate task that requires continuous&#xD;
      (re)training. In a previous phase II trial (NCT02042118), it has been shown that a&#xD;
      supraglottic airway is safe to use, even in the hands of midwives and with the potential to&#xD;
      deliver efficient PPV and perhaps even improve outcome of asphyxiated babies. The cuffless&#xD;
      i-gel is simple to use and could therefore be the ideal device to resuscitate newborn when&#xD;
      experienced physicians are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to interventions: training midwives in neonatal resuscitation skills&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) is an evidence-based educational program to teach neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation techniques in resource-limited areas. It is an initiative of the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), US&#xD;
      Agency for International Development (USAID), Saving Newborn Lives, the National Institute of&#xD;
      Child Health and Development, and a number of other global health organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of HBB is to train birth attendants in developing countries in the essential&#xD;
      skills of newborn resuscitation, with the goal of having at least one person who is skilled&#xD;
      in neonatal resuscitation at the birth of every baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second edition of HBB is now available and will be used in the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that around 5-10 % of babies born will need ventilation as part of the&#xD;
      resuscitation. This randomized trial will include all babies eligible for resuscitation. All&#xD;
      newborns in need of resuscitation will be randomized to receive initial treatment using&#xD;
      either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supraglottic airway (intervention arm) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Face mask (active comparator arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The midwife will immediately move the babies not responding to stimulation to the&#xD;
      resuscitation area. Ventilation with supraglottic airway or face mask will be initiated&#xD;
      immediately. Apgar score and admission to the neonatal ward will be recorded by a research&#xD;
      assistant. The intervention may be recorded on video to ensure quality assurance and data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the infant is hospitalised, daily assessment of Thompson score will be made by a skilled&#xD;
      paediatrician/physician. A follow-up visit on day 7 (or later) will determine the outcome (if&#xD;
      the infant is alive or not) together with the assessments of Thompson score.&#xD;
