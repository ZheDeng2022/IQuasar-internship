      This is an open label, dose-seeking phase 1/2 study using escalating doses of TRABECTEDIN&#xD;
      given intravenously with defined doses of IPILIMUMAB and NIVOLUMAB based on preliminary&#xD;
      results of the Checkmate 012 trial for NSCLC (Hellman et al., 2016). For the Phase 1 Part of&#xD;
      Study, only previously treated patients will be enrolled. For the Phase 2 Part of Study,&#xD;
      previously untreated patients will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      I. Dose Escalation Phase 1 of Study: The study will employ the standard &quot;Cohort of Three&quot;&#xD;
      design (Storer, 1989). Three patients are treated at each dose level with expansion to six&#xD;
      patients per cohort if DLT is observed in one of the three initially-enrolled patients at&#xD;
      each dose level. If no DLT occurs after 2 doses, escalation to the next dose level will be&#xD;
      permitted. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest safely tolerated dose, where&#xD;
      not more than one patient experienced DLT, with the next higher dose level having at least&#xD;
      two patients who experienced DLT. Patients in the dose escalation study may continue&#xD;
      treatment at their designated dose levels until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      occurs or up to 9 six-week cycles (one year) of therapy (up 18 TRABECTEDIN doses). No&#xD;
      intra-patient dose escalation will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of IPILIMUMAB: 1 mg/kg IV over 30 min. q 12 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after first dose of&#xD;
      TRABECTEDIN, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, up to 5 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of NIVOLUMAB: 3 mg/kg over 30 min. q 2 weeks, beginning 2 weeks after first dose of&#xD;
      TRABECTEDIN, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, up to 26 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of TRABECTEDIN: Escalating doses of TRABECTEDIN IV as continuous intravenous infusion&#xD;
      (CIV) over 24 hrs) q 3 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level I: 1 mg/m2 (n = 3-6); Dose Level II: 1.2 mg/m2 (n=3-6); Dose Level III: 1.5 mg.m2&#xD;
      (n=3-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Expansion Phase 2 of Study: Following dose escalation, an additional 22-28 previously&#xD;
      untreated patients will receive TRABECTEDIN at the MTD and defined doses of IPILIMUMAB and&#xD;
      NIVOLUMAB to assess overall safety and potential efficacy in a greater number of patients.&#xD;
      Patients in the expansion phase of the study may continue treatment until significant disease&#xD;
      progression (see criteria for discontinuation of therapy) or unacceptable toxicity occurs up&#xD;
      to 9 six-week cycles (one year) of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Resection: After one or more treatment cycles, the principal investigator may&#xD;
      recommend surgical debulking, complete surgical removal or a biopsy. If residual disease is&#xD;
      present either by histopathological examination or by CT scan/MRI, repeat treatment cycles&#xD;
      may be given 4 weeks after surgery, if the surgical incision has healed, and if the patient&#xD;
      has &lt; grade I toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resected or biopsied tumors will be analyzed for the effects of this triple therapy on&#xD;
      response, and immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment. Fresh and paraffin&#xD;
      embedded tissue blocks will be analyzed by FACS for PD-L1 and other biomarkers, including&#xD;
      Tregs, CD8+, CD4+ cells etc. Immunohistochemistry for cyclin G1, cyclin D1 and Ki67 will be&#xD;
      conducted to determine the tumor's proliferative state. Histopathologic examination for tumor&#xD;
      necrosis and mitotic index will also be determined.&#xD;

    <description>A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1, PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs (antigen presenting cells). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-medicated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.</description>
