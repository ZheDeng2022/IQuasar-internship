  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage kidney failure, but access to&#xD;
      transplantation is limited by a severe shortage of donor organs. Although the use of kidneys&#xD;
      from higher risk deceased donors has increased the availability of organs, these grafts are&#xD;
      associated with a greater risk of delayed function, inferior performance, and shorter&#xD;
      survival than standard criteria donor kidneys. The current standard of care for kidney graft&#xD;
      preservation prior to transplantation is static cold storage. Preliminary results from large&#xD;
      animal kidney transplantation studies and a human clinical trial suggest that normothermic&#xD;
      machine perfusion of kidneys prior to transplantation may ameliorate the injury sustained by&#xD;
      kidney grafts during cold static preservation, allow assessment of organ viability prior to&#xD;
      transplantation, and reduce the risk of delayed graft function or non-function. Such a&#xD;
      strategy may not only improve the performance of kidneys that are currently considered&#xD;
      acceptable for transplantation, but may also facilitate the assessment and utilization of&#xD;
      kidneys that are currently not considered for transplantation. This study will examine the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of normothermic ex vivo perfusion of human kidneys prior to&#xD;
      transplantation. The study will evaluate kidney function after transplantation using standard&#xD;
      clinical parameters. Study participants will be followed for 3 months following&#xD;
      transplantation and their outcomes recorded. Feasibility will be measured using the ratio of&#xD;
      actual:eligible kidney grafts preserved by normothermic ex vivo perfusion and will also take&#xD;
      into account logistical issues with respect to implementation and ease of use of the ex vivo&#xD;
      perfusion device. Safety will be assessed by rates of device failure resulting in organ&#xD;
      discard, primary graft non-function, delayed graft function, graft failure, and recipient&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for suitable patients with end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease as it results in lower morbidity and mortality rates when compared to dialysis.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the number of patients referred for transplantation has grown more quickly&#xD;
      than the number of suitable grafts from deceased donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of higher risk organs has expanded the donor pool but at a great cost due to the&#xD;
      higher probability that higher risk kidneys will never function (primary non-function, PNF),&#xD;
      or will have delayed graft function (DGF). The current standard of care for kidney graft&#xD;
      preservation prior to transplantation is static cold storage but higher-risk deceased donor&#xD;
      kidneys are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold storage. Preliminary results from&#xD;
      large animal kidney transplantation studies and a human clinical trial suggest that&#xD;
      normothermic machine perfusion of kidneys prior to transplantation may ameliorate the injury&#xD;
      sustained by kidney grafts during cold static preservation, allow assessment of organ&#xD;
      viability prior to transplantation, and reduce the risk of delayed graft function or&#xD;
      non-function. Such a strategy may not only improve the performance of kidneys that are&#xD;
      currently considered acceptable for transplantation, but may also facilitate the assessment&#xD;
      and utilization of kidneys that are currently not considered for transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the feasibility and safety of normothermic ex vivo perfusion of human&#xD;
      kidneys prior to transplantation. Kidneys will be retrieved in the standard fashion and&#xD;
      stored cold during transit. Upon arrival at the study transplant centre, kidneys will begin&#xD;
      perfusion with a normothermic near-physiologic, blood-based solution. Perfusion will last&#xD;
      1-10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate kidney function after transplantation using standard clinical&#xD;
      parameters. Study participants (n=25) will be followed for 3 months following transplantation&#xD;
      and their outcomes recorded. Feasibility will be measured using the ratio of actual:eligible&#xD;
      kidney grafts preserved by normothermic ex vivo perfusion and will also take into account&#xD;
      logistical issues with respect to implementation and ease of use of the ex vivo perfusion&#xD;
      device. Safety will be assessed by rates of device failure resulting in organ discard,&#xD;
      primary graft non-function, delayed graft function, graft failure, and recipient mortality.&#xD;
