      To compare the effectiveness of 3 strategies to inform patients of their risks associated&#xD;
      with misuse of opioid prescriptions after treatment in the ED from renal colic or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal back pain. Randomization will be to 3 arms for the Randomized Practical&#xD;
      Control Trial across 3 sites (A) standardized general risk information sheet only (B)&#xD;
      standardized general risk information sheet plus a visual probabilistic risk tool (C)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Amid a devastating public health crisis, in which 19,000 overdose deaths per year in the&#xD;
      United States are due to prescription opioids, the investigators ask the following questions:&#xD;
      Can risk-informed communication (with or without a narrative-enhanced tool) improve&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes in the domains of knowledge, opioid use, functional outcomes, and&#xD;
      patient provider therapeutic alignment? This question has implications for over 17 million&#xD;
      patients who present to acute care settings with acute pain from common conditions. Can these&#xD;
      goals be accomplished in a real-world setting, for a diverse patient population? The&#xD;
      investigators approach to this project includes a practical randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      conducted in nine acute care settings, at three geographically distinct hospital centers,&#xD;
      with broad inclusion criteria and a diverse population. Aims: This project aims to compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of 1) a standardized general risk information sheet only; 2 a standardized&#xD;
      general risk information sheet plus a probabilistic risk tool; and 3) a standardized sheet&#xD;
      plus narrative-enhanced probabilistic risk tool on the following outcomes: * Knowledge as&#xD;
      measured by risk awareness and treatment preferences for fewer opioids, particularly among&#xD;
      those at higher risk for addiction * Reduced use of opioids as measured by quantity of&#xD;
      opioids taken, functional improvement, and repeat use of unscheduled visits for pain at 14&#xD;
      days * Patient provider alignment as measured by concordance between patient preference and&#xD;
      finalized prescription plan, and the presence of shared decision making. These aims will be&#xD;
      achieved in a multicenter randomized practical clinical trial of 1,300 patients who are&#xD;
      planned for discharge from acute care settings after being treated for acute back or acute&#xD;
      kidney stone pain. The investigators hypothesize that, compared with patients receiving a&#xD;
      generalized risk information sheet or a probabilistic risk communication tool alone, patients&#xD;
      with acute renal colic and musculoskeletal back pain randomized to receive narrative-enhanced&#xD;
      risk communication, will do the following: (H1) demonstrate greater knowledge, as determined&#xD;
      by awareness of risk for opioid dependency; (H2a) select a treatment plan with fewer opioids;&#xD;
      (H2b) take fewer opioids for fewer days, while achieving the same degree of pain relief and&#xD;
      improved functional status; (H3a) enjoy greater levels of concordance between the&#xD;
      patient-preferred and provider-selected treatment plans; and (H3b) engage in greater shared&#xD;
      decision making with their providers. How these aims are important to patients: The research&#xD;
      question is important to patients because 1) patients are frequently exposed to the potential&#xD;
      for either under- or over-treatment of pain; 2) patients have different risk factors for&#xD;
      dependency, which may impact the appropriateness of certain medications for pain relief; and&#xD;
      3) opioid dependence and misuse which often begin with prescriptions for acute pain are&#xD;
      costly and common, and affect families, communities, and society as a whole.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of this study is for patients to gain an understanding of individual risk using the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). The ORT is a brief screening tool allowing patients to confidentially enter their own history to determine the probability opioid dependency and addiction. High concordance between measured risk and patient recall might indicate sustained effectiveness (or stickiness) of the risk communication tool. Discordance might indicate a failure of risk communication and knowledge of individualized risk. This outcome is dichotomous, categorized as &quot;Yes&quot; the person correctly recalled their risk category or &quot;No&quot;, either they did not correctly recall their risk category or they did not remember their risk category at all. The count of participants is the amount categorized as &quot;Yes&quot;, they correctly recalled their risk category.</description>

    <description>Probabilistic Risk Communication (PRT): The probabilistic risk communication tool (PRT) is a visual tool that communicates risk using the previously validated Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). The ORT is designed to assess risk of opioid dependency for patients for whom an opioid pain relief prescription is being considered in outpatient settings. Patients in this arm will be given an iPad which will prompt them to take a short survey that automatically communicates their risk score. After which the iPad will show them a color coded visual thermometer that informs them of their risk of having issues related to opioids.</description>

        <title>Risk Awareness and Recall</title>
        <description>The primary outcome of this study is for patients to gain an understanding of individual risk using the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). The ORT is a brief screening tool allowing patients to confidentially enter their own history to determine the probability opioid dependency and addiction. High concordance between measured risk and patient recall might indicate sustained effectiveness (or stickiness) of the risk communication tool. Discordance might indicate a failure of risk communication and knowledge of individualized risk. This outcome is dichotomous, categorized as &quot;Yes&quot; the person correctly recalled their risk category or &quot;No&quot;, either they did not correctly recall their risk category or they did not remember their risk category at all. The count of participants is the amount categorized as &quot;Yes&quot;, they correctly recalled their risk category.</description>

        <population>The control group was never made aware of their risk score as determined by the ORT. Additionally, there were participants who did not fill out the follow-up survey on Day 14, which is why their recall was not analyzed.</population>

The ORT is designed to assess risk of opioid dependency for patients for whom an opioid pain relief prescription is being considered in outpatient settings. Patients in this arm will be given an iPad which will prompt them to take a short survey that automatically communicates their risk score. After which the iPad will show them a color coded visual thermometer that informs them of their risk of having issues related to opioids.&#xD;

          <title>Generalized Risk Communication (GRC)</title>
          <description>Generalized Risk Communication (GRC): Participants in this arm will receive standard discharge instructions similar to instructions they would receive during usual care. This arm represents a standardized way of communicating post-discharge risk-benefit information about treatment options for patients with back pain and renal colic. The GRC, includes a standardized discharge information sheet about the clinical condition of interest and a written overview of population based evidence describing comparative benefits and side effects of alternative classes of medication acute pain.</description>

          <title>Probabilistic Risk Communication (PRT)</title>
          <description>Probabilistic Risk Communication (PRT): The probabilistic risk communication tool (PRT) is a visual tool that communicates risk using the previously validated Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). The ORT is designed to assess risk of opioid dependency for patients for whom an opioid pain relief prescription is being considered in outpatient settings. Patients in this arm will be given an iPad which will prompt them to take a short survey that automatically communicates their risk score. After which the iPad will show them a color coded visual thermometer that informs them of their risk of having issues related to opioids.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="E3">
          <title>Narrative Enhanced Risk Tool (NERT)</title>
          <description>Narrative Enhanced Risk Tool (NERT): Participants assigned to this arm will receive the PRT described above but will also be instructed to watch one or more narrative videos. This video intervention will include a brief narrative video of an individuals' cautionary tale related to prolonged opioid use. Narrative videos are developed from actual patient stories - put into a in a structured format of ~ 2-minute length and recorded.</description>
