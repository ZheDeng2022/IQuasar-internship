    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Transcutaneus Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS)&#xD;
      during the labour. TENS is a low frequency electrotherapy technique, analgesic type,&#xD;
      generally used in musculoskeletal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will have three groups of participants to be administered the TENS, a&#xD;
      different dose in two groups, while the third will correspond to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is to verify if the TENS is effective as a non-pharmacological&#xD;
      method in the relief of pain during childbirth&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain during labour is one of the most intense pain that many women could experience&#xD;
           during their lives, and it can be influenced by the anatomical and physiological factors&#xD;
           of the labouring women, and also, by their psychological experiences, as well as by&#xD;
           cultural, social, and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neuraxial analgesia during labour is the most effective method for pain relief, but it&#xD;
           appears to be associated with certain side effects, such as maternal hypotension,&#xD;
           decreased uteroplacental perfusion, foetal bradycardia, fever, pruritus, an increased&#xD;
           oxytocin requirement, a prolonged second stage of labour, a higher rate of operative&#xD;
           delivery, and high costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of non-pharmacological methods for pain relief includes a wide variety of&#xD;
           techniques aimed at improving physical sensations and preventing psychoemotional&#xD;
           perception of pain. Among the main nonpharmacological methods of pain relief at delivery&#xD;
           is the application of Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Its&#xD;
           application during childbirth is based on the Gait Control theory of pain of Melzack and&#xD;
           Wall. According to their theory, the application of TENS reduces the excitability of the&#xD;
           delta A and C pain fibers, thus reducing the amount of painful messages ascending the&#xD;
           spinal cord. Activation of these fibers stimulates the release of natural pain&#xD;
           inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, many non-pharmacological methods of managing pain increase the satisfaction&#xD;
           of women with their childbirth experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TENS have used for labour analgesia and there are several studies which show its&#xD;
           effectiveness. The effectiveness of TENS depends on the duration, frequency and&#xD;
           amplitude of the stimulating current and the site of application of the electrodes. TENS&#xD;
           can be administered by either dermatomal stimulation or by stimulation of acupuncture&#xD;
           points for labour analgesia. In addition, all studies stated that it was safe and there&#xD;
           was no side effects on the mother and the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This work was conducted to study the effectiveness of TENS on labour analgesia, maternal&#xD;
           and fetal outcome using TENS by dermatomal stimulation technique. Thus, device will be&#xD;
           used as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Through electrodes applied to the lower back, the parturient can control both&#xD;
           parameters, the frequency and intensity of the low-voltage electrical impulses emitted&#xD;
           from the TENS device. When applying to the lower back, the TENS unit emits electrical&#xD;
           impulses which excite afferent nerves, and thus inhibit the transmission of painful&#xD;
           stimuli arising from the uterus, vagina and perineum during labour. These electrodes are&#xD;
           attached to the skin bilaterally at paravertebral positions T10 and S2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the present study the investigators will use three equal devices (two different dose&#xD;
           and one placebo) .They will be assigned a number that associate to each group of&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety profile in the use of TENS:&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is a non-invasive technique, easy to administer, without side effects or interactions&#xD;
           with other drugs, it cannot produce toxicity in the tissue or cellular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The current literature does not reflect any complications, either on the part of the&#xD;
           pregnant woman and in the fetus, during the application of TENS in the labor phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of TENS should be contraindicated in women whose gestational age does not exceed&#xD;
           37 weeks, women with pacemakers and water births. It should not be applied in the&#xD;
           maternal abdomen, at any time during pregnancy or childbirth, to avoid stimulation near&#xD;
           the fetal heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To know if the application of TENS is effective in reducing pain during childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the most effective dose in the use of TENS in pregnant women during&#xD;
                labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To analyze the degree of satisfaction of the pregnant women who participate in the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate whether the use of TENS reduces the dose of the painkillers during&#xD;
                childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a triple blind randomized trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding&#xD;
      for some outcomes, and intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was accepted by the Ethic Committee of the Hospital Complejo Hospitalario Universitario&#xD;
      Insular Materno Infantil of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain, with&#xD;
      registration number CEIm-CHUIMI-2016/875.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Allocation: All participants will be recruited from a group of women admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital. If the pregnant woman meets the inclusion criteria, she will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. If yes, they must sign the informed consent, approved by the same&#xD;
      ethical committee of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assignment to each group was made through the website www.random.org to perform&#xD;
      randomization. In addition, each group has a different TENS, which has the group number.&#xD;
      Participants in all groups will receive all the other routine obstetric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Sample size determination: The sample size and power calculations were performed using&#xD;
      the software GRANMO 7.11. Calculations were based on detecting differences of 2 units in a 10&#xD;
      numerical pain rate scale at post-data, assuming a standard deviation of 1.9, a 2-tailed&#xD;
      test, an alpha level of 0.05, and a desired power of 80%. These assumptions generated a&#xD;
      sample size of 63 subjects, 21 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a specialiced nurse that will supervised the correct functionality every day. He&#xD;
      will be responsible for resolving dispositive problems like low charge or insufficient&#xD;
      electrodes.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will use a scale called Care in Obstetrics : measure for testing satisfaction (COMFORTS). This scale measures satisfaction during delivery and the postnatal period.&#xD;
. This scale is a valid and reliable scale to measure women's satisfaction with the care during labour and postpartum period. The investigators obtained the authorization to use the Spanish version of the COMFORTS scale.</description>
