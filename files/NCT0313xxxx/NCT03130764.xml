      Despite aggressive surgery and chemotherapy, the risk of lung cancer recurrence remains high&#xD;
      in most patients. This study aims to determine if a novel immune therapy consisting of two&#xD;
      drugs is feasible and potentially increases the chance of cure in lung cancer patients after&#xD;
      surgery and standard chemotherapy. The immune-based therapy being given in this study&#xD;
      consists of two medications named durvalumab and tremelimumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer and leading cause of cancer related death worldwide,&#xD;
      accounting for more than 1.3 million deaths annually. The 5 year survival of clinical stage&#xD;
      IIIA NSCLC, a technically curable lung cancer by surgery, chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy&#xD;
      delivered in the perioperative setting, remains a modest 15%, with systemic recurrence&#xD;
      occurring in the majority of patients. 5 year overall survival (OS) for patients with stage&#xD;
      IB and II disease is also modest at 53% and 25% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA approvals of T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      has changed the landscape of NSCLC. Although robust responses to anti-PD-1 can be observed,&#xD;
      it is a small subset of patients with durable benefit. In phase 3 trials, the response rate&#xD;
      to anti-PD- 1 is 19% with only ½ of these patients experiencing durable benefit. Even NSCLC&#xD;
      tumors with high levels of PD-L1 have only a 30% response rate and combination immunotherapy&#xD;
      has improved efficacy modestly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials in resectable lung cancer, have traditionally attempted to institute new&#xD;
      agents in the adjuvant setting. However clinical endpoints take years of follow-up to&#xD;
      ascertain. For example, The ANITA study was the most recent phase III study of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy in NSCLC. In this study, results were published 12 years after study initiation.&#xD;
      Thus, while OS remains the gold standard for assessment of benefit of adjuvant therapy,&#xD;
      studies that are 12 years long are slow, expensive, and may yield results that are out of&#xD;
      date by the time they are published. Thus the use of valid surrogate endpoints for OS is a&#xD;
      high priority in NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for durable benefit in the advanced NSCLC setting has, not unexpectably, led to&#xD;
      a foray with immune checkpoint blockade treatment into the adjuvant setting for resectable&#xD;
      NSCLC. Randomized trials with durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab are all underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in the resected setting, adjuvant patients cannot be monitored radiologically for&#xD;
      treatment response due to the absence of measurable disease thus requiring innovative in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo methods to study therapeutic response to immune checkpoint blockade.&#xD;
      Encouragingly, as proof of concept, single-agent ipilimumab has demonstrated improved&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival at 3 years in resected stage III melanoma compared to placebo&#xD;
      leading to FDA approval in this setting. Less encouragingly, the hazard ratio favored the&#xD;
      higher risk patients suggesting the benefit may be restricted to those tumors more apt to&#xD;
      have residual disease and may represent the subset where benefit is most realized.&#xD;
      Furthermore the data are not sufficiently mature to demonstrate an overall survival advantage&#xD;
      nor is it known if this data can be extrapolated to NSCLC where responses are numerically&#xD;
      lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with resectable NSCLC will undergo surgical resection and bone marrow procurement at&#xD;
      the same time. Tumor will be dissociated into single cell suspension and separated into&#xD;
      viable cryopreserved tumor cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes will be expanded in media&#xD;
      and high dose IL-2. Post-operatively, after recovery from surgical resection, patients will&#xD;
      receive adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy as determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
      Subsequently patients will receive adjuvant durvalumab for 12 doses and tremelimumab for 4&#xD;
      doses. Serial PBMCs will be obtained every 4 weeks during therapy. Primary resected tumor&#xD;
      will undergo whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing and clonal neoantigens will be&#xD;
      predicted with established algorithms. Neoantigen specific T cell reactivity will be tested&#xD;
      in autologous PBMCs with multimer (quantitative) and ICS (functional) assays.&#xD;
