    <textblock>
      Keynote 695 will be a Phase 2 study of intratumoral tavokinogene telseplasmid (tavo; pIL-12)&#xD;
      Electroporation (EP) plus IV Pembrolizumab. Eligible patients will be those with pathological&#xD;
      diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma who are progressing or have progressed on&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of a screening period, a treatment period (up to 2 years), a long&#xD;
      term follow-up period, and a survival follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days&#xD;
      1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for&#xD;
      18 tavo-EP cycles and 35 pembrolizumab cycles (from baseline) of continued treatment&#xD;
      (approximately 2 years), or until disease progression. As many accessible lesions may be&#xD;
      treated as deemed feasible by the treating physician assuming the size of each lesion is&#xD;
      greater than 0.3 cm x 0.3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term Follow-up: All subjects will be followed after End of Study (EOS) Treatment visit&#xD;
      for SAEs (through 90 days from last dose of study drug). Subjects who discontinue treatment&#xD;
      due to disease progression will directly enter the survival follow-up period following the&#xD;
      End of Study Treatment visit. Subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason other than&#xD;
      disease progression or withdrawal of consent enter the long-term follow-up period. They will&#xD;
      have scans, photographs, and investigator-assessed disease evaluation per RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      collected every 3 months until disease progression, subject receives a new anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment (with the exception of maintenance pembrolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on all subjects' first new anti-cancer therapy will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival Follow-up: Once a subject receives a new anti-cancer treatment or progresses during&#xD;
      long-term follow-up, they will move into survival follow-up. All subjects will be followed&#xD;
      for survival and disease status-, every 3 months until treatment period, long-term follow-up&#xD;
      period, and survival follow-up period reaches a total duration of 5 years, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, or until Sponsor terminates the study.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible for participation in this study, the subject must meet all of the&#xD;
        following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pathologically documented unresectable melanoma, American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
             (AJCC) version 8, Stage III or IV. Subjects must have histological or cytological&#xD;
             confirmed diagnosis of unresectable melanoma with progressive locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be refractory to anti PD 1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (pembrolizumab or&#xD;
             nivolumab either as monotherapy or in combination with other approved checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitors or targeted therapies according to their approved label) and subjects must&#xD;
             meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Received treatment of FDA-approved anti-PD1 mAb (dosed per label of the country&#xD;
                  providing the clinical site) for at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Progressive disease after anti-PD-1 mAb will be defined according to RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
                  The initial evidence of PD is to be confirmed by a second assessment, no less&#xD;
                  than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented PD, in the absence of rapid&#xD;
                  clinical progression. For cases of rapid clinical progression, patients may be&#xD;
                  allowed to enroll without a confirmatory scan after discussion with the sponsor.&#xD;
                  (This determination is made by the Investigator; the Sponsor will collect imaging&#xD;
                  scans for retrospective analysis. Once PD is confirmed, the initial date of PD&#xD;
                  documentation will be considered the date of disease progression).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Documented disease progression within 12 weeks of the last dose of anti- PD-1&#xD;
                  mAb. Subjects who were re treated with anti-PD-1 mAb and subjects who were on&#xD;
                  maintenance with anti-PD-1 mAb will be allowed to enter the study as long as&#xD;
                  there is documented PD within 12 weeks of the last treatment date (with anti-PD-1&#xD;
                  mAb).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: anti-PD-1 combination therapy is acceptable as the last prior treatment and may&#xD;
             include, anti-PD-1 anti-CTLA4 antibody combination therapy and anti-PD-1 combinations&#xD;
             with investigational or injectable therapy.&#xD;

                  treatment due to treatment-related adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Subject must have had disease progression on ipilimumab + nivolumab or stopped&#xD;
                  treatment due to treatment-related adverse event. Subjects with progression on&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Exposure to ipilimumab + nivolumab should have occurred within 12 months of study&#xD;

                  nivolumab doses administered with a gap of 6 months or longer, criteria a, b and&#xD;
                  c should be applied to the most recent ipilimumab course.&#xD;
&#xD;
             All Cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Resolution/improvement of anti-PD-1 mAb related AEs (including immune related AEs;&#xD;
             irAEs) back to Grade 0-1 and ≤10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent dose) for irAEs for&#xD;
