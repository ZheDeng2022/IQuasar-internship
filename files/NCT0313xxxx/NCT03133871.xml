  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish whether the use of a special digital camera (SIAscopy)&#xD;
      can provide an accurate and reliable measure of vitiligo which is at least equivalent to the&#xD;
      current gold standard of planimetry. If so, SIAscopy could be used as an objective diagnostic&#xD;
      and prognostic tool in the management of vitiligo patients within dermatology departments and&#xD;
      allow a fair and accurate assessment of new potential treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a common, disfiguring skin complaint which affects between 0.5 and 2% of the&#xD;
      world population and which presents with de-pigmented patches of skin. Highly stigmatising it&#xD;
      has a profound psychological impact on those affected and negatively impacts quality of life.&#xD;
      Efficacy of current therapies which include topical steroids/calcineurin inhibitors and&#xD;
      ultraviolet light are limited and new treatments are required. Numerous papers including the&#xD;
      2010 Cochrane review have highlighted the need for a consensus on outcome measures which&#xD;
      could then facilitate meta-analyses and provide robust clinical recommendations. No standard&#xD;
      method of measuring skin re-pigmentation has been identified to date and current best&#xD;
      practice relies on clinician assessment and use of various non-standardised grading systems&#xD;
      (of which there are over 40 none of which has been proven superior or accepted by the&#xD;
      consensus of clinicians) and in addition are neither robust nor objective. Measurement of&#xD;
      skin pigment levels can be achieved using portable devices such as Spectrophotometric&#xD;
      Intracutaneous Analysis scope (SIAscope) using an imaging modality called ScanoskinTM. Unlike&#xD;
      other digital methods reported in the literature, this has been validated as a quantitative&#xD;
      measure of melanin content in the skin, it is portable, easy to use and not prohibitively&#xD;
      expensive. The aim of this study is to determine if ScanoskinTM is equivalent to the current&#xD;
      gold standard of planimetry (mainly used in research setting) for establishing extent of&#xD;
      vitiligo. In addition the investigators want to assess whether it offers a more objective&#xD;
      standardised measure of vitiligo compared with clinician assessment (current accepted best&#xD;
      clinical practice) which could then be utilised to provide a meaningful assessment of new and&#xD;
      existing treatment modalities. In addition the investigators will assess whether ScanoskinTM&#xD;
      is able to identify subclinical disease which could affect clinical decisions regarding&#xD;
      treatment strategies and also assess whether improvements in pigmentation correlate with&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and quality of life scores.&#xD;
