      The purpose of this study is to find the best cleaning and collection methods to obtain a&#xD;
      'non-contaminated' clean catch mid-stream urine sample to diagnose suspected urinary tract&#xD;
      infection (UTI).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major public health issue resulting in more&#xD;
      than 3-million visits to Emergency Departments in the United States each year. As part of the&#xD;
      diagnostic work up, a sterile urine sample is requested for culture. The preferred urine&#xD;
      specimen is a &quot;Clean Catch Midstream Urine Sample&quot;. When patients are ambulatory and&#xD;
      competent, this is a self-obtained specimen in a private bathroom. If the urine is not&#xD;
      collected in a sterile manner the urine sample may be 'contaminated' by bacteria that&#xD;
      originate from the skin or genital area, and not from the urinary tract. This is often&#xD;
      described by the clinical laboratory as 'mixed growth bacteria'. A contaminated sample may&#xD;
      lead to a false-positive urine culture result. In a non-contaminated urine specimen, only a&#xD;
      single bacterial growth is identified as the source of the infection. Mixed bacterial flora&#xD;
      with two or more microorganisms makes interpretation of the urine culture more difficult and&#xD;
      prone to error. The American College of Pathologists has published results of national&#xD;
      laboratory surveys on Urine Culture Contamination in 1998 and 2008 that document the scope of&#xD;
      the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE: Adult ambulatory patients in the Emergency Department who have a suspected UTI and&#xD;
      have a urine culture ordered by a physician. A total of 2000 patients will be enrolled (500&#xD;
      per group). This is estimated to result in 600 urine samples (150 per group). Written consent&#xD;
      is not normally required for a self-obtained urine sample. The study will be explained and&#xD;
      participants will verbally consent or decline to participate, as approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: Emergency Department of an academic medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 4 groups that compare different&#xD;
      patient self-cleaning and self-collection methods. All study supplies materials are&#xD;
      commercially available in the United States. Each participant will be provided with&#xD;
      study-specific visual aids for male or female participants and their randomly assigned group.&#xD;
      The four groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Standard moist wipes and standard collection container. Group 2: Silver impregnated&#xD;
      moist wipes and standard collection container. Group 3: Standard moist wipes and funnel&#xD;
      collection container. Group 4: Silver impregnated moist wipes and funnel collection&#xD;
      container. The urine samples will be sent to the Hospital Microbiology Laboratory for&#xD;
      analysis. Urine samples with a positive leuk-esterase pre-screen will be sent for urine&#xD;
      culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:This study is powered to detect a large effect size change in any study groups&#xD;
      (2. 3. 4) compared with control (group 1). The sample size is sufficient to identify the&#xD;
      method(s) with the lowest urine sample contamination rate.&#xD;
