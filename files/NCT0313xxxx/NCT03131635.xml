    <textblock>
      This is a research study examining the effectiveness of a Developmental Reciprocity Treatment&#xD;
      Program (DRT-P) in treating social deficits in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).&#xD;
      Developmental Reciprocity Treatment is an early intervention that applies&#xD;
      developmentally-informed teaching methods in naturalistic settings in order to target social&#xD;
      and communication deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have begun to develop strategies to investigate the effectiveness of combining a&#xD;
      parent training program teaching parents how to implement DRP with in-home,&#xD;
      therapist-implemented treatment. To determine the effectiveness of the DRT-P, it will be&#xD;
      compared to a delayed treatment group (DTG) by conducting a randomized controlled 24-week&#xD;
      trial. This research will allow us to help in the development of therapeutic approaches that&#xD;
      can meet the increasing service demands for families. We hope that investigating&#xD;
      interventions that aim to improve core deficits will aid in providing better care for&#xD;
      children with autism.&#xD;
