  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis (HD) patients have decreased physical functioning, diminished muscle mass and&#xD;
      altered muscle quality thus the increased mortality rate compared to their age-matched&#xD;
      population. Risk factors include their sedentary lifestyle and altered nutritional status&#xD;
      [1]; the sedentary lifestyle or the lack of exercise is known to be a risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular complications [2] and contributes to worsen protein energy wasting (PEW),&#xD;
      which is described as the loss of body protein mass and fuel reserves [1]. Therefore the&#xD;
      health of the HD patients and consequently their quality of life (QOL) is deteriorated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that aerobic exercise during HD improves aerobic capacity, blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, muscular strength, dialysis efficacy and quality of life; however, such studies&#xD;
      were not done on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) HD patients and there is no protocol for&#xD;
      implementing exercise in the UAE HD units [3-4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Intradialytic aerobic exercise will result in significantly improved clinical,&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic and quality of life outcomes and reduced cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To investigate whether the intradialytic exercise (IDE) within the routine practice of&#xD;
      hemodialysis in the UAE will improve adequacy of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effect of clinical and cardio-metabolic outcomes of the HD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore whether the trial would improve the cost effectiveness of this patient&#xD;
           population's health care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the nature of the IDE programs (intensity, duration, modality), and feasibility&#xD;
           of its application in routine setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pioneering research in the Middle East and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries&#xD;
           where the effect of intradialytic exercise will be studied for the first time on Arab&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will contribute in identifying the exact strategies to integrate within the&#xD;
           hemodialysis unit to improve clinical and cardio-metabolic outcomes, quality of life and&#xD;
           healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usefulness of this research to the UAE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will improve the health care cost and reduce cost wastage in the UAE (lean&#xD;
           management).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will put UAE on the pedestal in front of other countries in integrating innovative&#xD;
           methods for a better care of hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each patient will be asked to follow an Intradialytic aerobic low intensity exercise program&#xD;
      of 45 minutes per each HD session throughout the 6-month study duration. The exercise will be&#xD;
      tailored to each HD patient's ability (measured by VO2Max), supervised by the hospital&#xD;
      physiotherapist and the research team. Continuous support and encouragement to the patients&#xD;
      will be provided to assure they complete the 45 minutes of exercise on each HD session.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will be educated on the health benefits of exercise and how to&#xD;
      integrate safe exercise into their daily life (by the research assistants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research assistants will be trained by the principal investigator (PI) on the study&#xD;
      instruments and data collection methods. These assistants will administer 4 questionnaires (5&#xD;
      minutes each) for each HD patient separately and will collect data from the medical chart of&#xD;
      each patient. The assessment will take place during the HD session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistants will also collect from the patient's file blood test results on a&#xD;
      monthly basis (relevant to the study mentioned in table1); additional needed parameters will&#xD;
      be analysed from the same blood sample that the hospital already collect for the patients&#xD;
      monitoring, and will be analysed by the hospital for a fee from the research fund. For the&#xD;
      Î²-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) tests - cardiometabolic marker, 5 ML of the blood sample from&#xD;
      each patient will be transported to a specialized lab for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the parameters, except the demographics (collected only at t0), will be collected and&#xD;
      monitored at 3 time points: Baseline (t0), post-intervention (t1) and follow up (t2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment tools include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics: Height - Weight - Age - Social and Work status - Comorbidities - Education&#xD;
           level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical markers: C-reactive protein, Urea reduction ration, Phosphorus (P), BAIBA,&#xD;
           Vitamin D3, Parathyroid Hormone, Calcium and Phosphorus Product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of hospitalization days and emergency HD sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Behavior questionnaire consists of 7 questions to assess the activity level of&#xD;
           the patient before implementing the program. It will reflect the patient's activity&#xD;
           level and importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers to physical activity questionnaire [5], which includes questions related to&#xD;
           different categories of disease- and patient- specific barriers to physical activity&#xD;
           (psychological, physical, and economical barriers) in addition to the lack of time&#xD;
           factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) [6]: This is a comprehensive scoring system with&#xD;
           significant associations with prospective hospitalization and mortality as well as&#xD;
           measures of nutrition, inflammation, and anemia in HD. MIS has 10 components, each with&#xD;
           four levels of severity from 0 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal). The sum of all 10 MIS&#xD;
           components ranges from 0 (normal) to 30 (severely abnormal); a higher score reflects&#xD;
           more severe degree of malnutrition and inflammation. The scoring sheet consists of four&#xD;
           sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (QOL) measured using the EuroQOL -5 health questionnaire [7]. It&#xD;
           assesses 5 health concepts: mobility, self-care, usual activities (work, study,&#xD;
           housework, and family or leisure activities), pain / discomfort, and anxiety /&#xD;
           depression. Patients have 5 choices for each question to choose from to describe their&#xD;
           health today. In addition, patients have to indicate on a scale marked from 0-100 their&#xD;
           opinion about how good or bad their health state is today.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise effort test: Heart rate monitoring to assess the level of exercise performed&#xD;
           [8]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Fitness Level: measure using the Borg Scale of perceived Exertion [9]&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires that are originally not Arabic, will be translated to Arabic (local&#xD;
      language), prior to study by 2 translators whose first language is Arabic. Next step, each&#xD;
      questionnaire will be translated back to English by a dietitian whose first language is&#xD;
      English and who also knows Arabic. All questionnaires will be validated by running them on 10&#xD;
      patients and accordingly modifying their feasibility to the Emirates HD patient's culture,&#xD;
      language level and comprehension status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapist and the research assistants will be responsible for training the patients&#xD;
      on the exercise program and recording the intensity, duration, and modality of the exercise&#xD;
      for each patient as well as patient's complaints and reasons for drop out, if any. The&#xD;
      intervention will be given within the HD session: no extra time required beyond the time of&#xD;
      HD. During the intervention, patient will be at all times under direct supervision of the&#xD;
      physiotherapist and medical team; in case of any discomfort, the intervention will be&#xD;
      immediately stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was chosen based on convenient sampling. Patients of the HD unit who received&#xD;
      clearance from the medical team, met the inclusion criteria and consented, were included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed through Scientific Package for Social Sciences version 18. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to analyze the data. Correlations will be conducted through ANOVA.&#xD;
      Effect of the study will be analyzed by paired t test on continuous data and Chi-square on&#xD;
      categorical data&#xD;
