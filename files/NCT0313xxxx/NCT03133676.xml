  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of KA34 when administered via&#xD;
      intra-articular injection to subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee. OA patients are&#xD;
      randomized to receive either placebo or KA34 active drug in the range of 50-400 ug by&#xD;
      intra-articular injection. The first portion of the study is with single ascending doses, the&#xD;
      second portion of the study is with multiple ascending doses.&#xD;

In the single-ascending dose (SAD) part, 24 subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of KA34 or placebo in 1 of 4 cohorts. After a thorough review of the Day 29 safety data from the SAD cohorts by the blinded Data Safety Monitoring Board, 36 subjects were randomized in the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) part of the study to receive 4 weekly doses of KA34 or placebo in 1 of 3 cohorts.</recruitment_details>
