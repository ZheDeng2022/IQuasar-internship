        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects of non-child bearing potential who, at the time of&#xD;
             screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as&#xD;
             no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full&#xD;
             physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG&#xD;
             or clinical laboratory tests. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must meet&#xD;
             at least 1 of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses&#xD;
                  for at least 24 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or&#xD;
                  physiological cause; with a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level&#xD;
                  confirming the postmenopausal state;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including&#xD;
                  females with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) are considered to be&#xD;
                  of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that&#xD;
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. -. Subjects who&#xD;
             are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive urine drug test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening supine 12-lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or&#xD;
             a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG&#xD;
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be&#xD;
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with family history of myocardial infarction, congenital long QT syndrome,&#xD;
             torsades de pointes or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. Subjects should&#xD;
             be within normal range of potassium, magnesium and corrected calcium calculation at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; female subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential; male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects&#xD;
             who are unwilling or unable to use two highly effective methods of contraception as&#xD;
             outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at least 90 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of investigational product and, refrain from sperm donation for the&#xD;
             duration of the Study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
