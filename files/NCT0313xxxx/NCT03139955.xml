    <textblock>
      Bodytrak® is a wireless earpiece which can monitor the user's vital signs such as tympanic&#xD;
      (ear) temperature and heart rate. The earpiece is non-invasive and should fit comfortably&#xD;
      within the right ear, similar to an earphone with an over-the-ear hook. Bodytrak is currently&#xD;
      in a prototype stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a trial investigating&#xD;
      the integration of Bodytrak in an NHS (National Health Service) environment at Chelsea and&#xD;
      Westminster Hospital; to collect patient vital sign data for the development of Bodytrak&#xD;
      algorithms to detect the transition point of recovery/deterioration of health, as well as the&#xD;
      level of consciousness; and to obtain nurse and patient feedback regarding their user&#xD;
      experience of Bodytrak.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Sepsis claims many lives annually, and poses a substantial drain on NHS (National&#xD;
      Health System) resources. The use of a 'track-and-trigger' monitoring system, or the National&#xD;
      Early Warning System (NEWS) has reduced mortality rates in recent years, by detecting the&#xD;
      early onset of Sepsis. However, the acquisition of vital signs, required as part of NEWS, is&#xD;
      a manual, error-prone, and time consuming process. Therefore, scope exists for improvement in&#xD;
      the care pathway by automation and subsequent improvements in reliability, staff&#xD;
      productivity, and patient treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative patients are typically monitored for a period of time before they are&#xD;
      discharged. Potentially, patient safety can be further improved, and earlier discharge can be&#xD;
      enabled by means of a continuous vital signs monitoring device, with algorithms that can&#xD;
      track deterioration/recovery rate. This complementary information, together with the NEWS&#xD;
      score, can then provide objective metrics to aid the attending physician. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to assess the effectiveness of Bodytrak in monitoring patient&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, within the set of vital signs monitored by NEWS, it is most difficult to&#xD;
      automate the measurement of the Level of Consciousness/Alertness (LOC). Therefore, one&#xD;
      objective of the proposed project is to investigate the feasibility of developing an&#xD;
      unobtrusive method for automatically measuring LOC, of patients who are not under the&#xD;
      influence of general anesthesia, which leads to the introduction of Bodytrak. Bodytrak® is a&#xD;
      non-invasive, wireless ear-based device which can continuously monitor physiological&#xD;
      parameters including tympanic temperature, photoplethysmography (PPG) derived heart rate and&#xD;
      heart rate variability and accelerometer based motion metrics. The earpiece should fit&#xD;
      comfortably within the right ear, similar to a earphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the physiological and biomechanical signals required for LOC algorithm&#xD;
      development will be acquired using Bodytrak®. Automating the measurements of two other vital&#xD;
      signs - Tympanic temperature and heart rate, will be carried out using Bodytrak® as well.&#xD;
      Since these vitals are important predictors of Sepsis, and because they are currently part of&#xD;
      the NEWS framework, providing reliable means of measurement, and automating the acquisition&#xD;
      process is consistent with the goal of improving patient safety and staff productivity. As an&#xD;
      important part of the study, these primary vital signs will be evaluated against validated&#xD;
      medical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, critical to eventual improvement of the care pathway by means of Bodytrak® is the&#xD;
      feedback that can be gathered from both patients and clinical staff, since they are the end&#xD;
      users of the system. If this application is approved, Inova intends to work closely with its&#xD;
      partner, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, in order to gather information necessary for the&#xD;
      integration of Bodytrak® into the NEWS framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL DESIGN The trial is a non-blind, non-randomised single group feasibility study. 8&#xD;
      participants will be recruited who have scheduled elective surgery and aftercare in the HDU&#xD;
      (high dependency unit). Patient participation will include 2 visits: a screening visit during&#xD;
      a pre-clinic visit; and an intervention visit which will last approximately 2.5 days during&#xD;
      their elective surgery in-patient stay in the high dependency unit. During their in-patient&#xD;
      stay, participants will wear a Bodytrak earpiece during the day (for approximately 8 hours&#xD;
      per day during the working hours of the research nurse), alongside continuous vital sign&#xD;
      monitoring from hospital standard equipment (Philips Intellivue MP50 Monitor). The research&#xD;
      nurse will carry out hourly checks on the patient to ensure the earpiece is not causing any&#xD;
      discomfort. Patients will be asked to complete a feedback questionnaire regarding their&#xD;
      experience of wearing Bodytrak. Research nurse's will also complete a feedback questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding their use of Bodytrak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the sample size is admittedly small, note that the purpose of this study is NOT to&#xD;
      validate Bodytrak® as a medical device, but rather to determine if it is feasible to devise&#xD;
      reliable algorithms for reliably detecting the LOC and patient status, as well as to carry&#xD;
      out a preliminary evaluation of the vital signs derived from Bodytrak®. A power analysis test&#xD;
      will be carried out after the data collection has completed, in order to ascertain the&#xD;
      validity of the statistical tests used and to determine if the sample size is sufficiently&#xD;
      large. This would provide useful information for further studies that need to be carried out.&#xD;
