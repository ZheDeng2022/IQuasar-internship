  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WestPORTS will recruit a randomly selected population consisting of 25% of all individuals&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease (ICD G209) that have visited any of the seven major outpatient&#xD;
      neurology or geriatrics clinics in West Sweden (population 1.7M) during a predefined 12 month&#xD;
      period between Sept 2016 and April 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline clinical and demographic data will be collected along with a 6 x 24h accelerometry&#xD;
      recording using the Parkinson Kinetigraph (Global Kinetics). Repeated data collections will&#xD;
      be made with regular intervals of up to 2 years as long as subjects are alive and willing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following data will be collected at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date of birth Handedness Family history of Parkinson's disease Time of first motor symptom&#xD;
      onset Laterality of symptom onset Time of diagnosis Time of first pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention (if applicable) First antiparkinsonian drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected at every visit/update Current living conditions Current&#xD;
      non motor complications Current medications Hoehn and Yahr staging Clinical Impression of&#xD;
      Severity Index in Parkinson's disease (CISI-PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient self assessments: PDQ8, NMS-Questionnaire, EQ5D-5L, Patient Reported Outcome in&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PRO-PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson Kinetigraph (PKG) accelerometry based recording of spontaneous movement patterns&#xD;
      over a 6x24h period. The following indices will be extracted: median bradykinesia score&#xD;
      (BKS), median dyskinesia score (DKS), Fluctuation Dyskinesia Score (FDS), Percent daytime&#xD;
      with Immobility (PTI%), Percent daytime with tremor (PTT%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be descriptive and include demographic composition of the&#xD;
      population, clinical characteristics and objective measurement data. In addition to indices a&#xD;
      standardized qualitative assessment of PKG recordings will be made to identify motor&#xD;
      fluctuations. Correlations between clinical ratings, patient reported outcomes, disease&#xD;
      duration, age, medication and objective measurement indices will be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the prospective phase of the study the development of objective movement recordings will&#xD;
      be studied along with the development of clinical ratings and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
