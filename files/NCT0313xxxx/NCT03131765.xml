  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of YS-ON-001 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors who have limited available treatment options, and exploratory evaluation of the&#xD;
      pharmacological effect and efficacy of YS-ON-001. The study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
      dose escalation and cohort expansion&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1 study of YS-ON-001 vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
      as a single agent to patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients are eligible if they are&#xD;
      refractory, resistant or intolerant to prior therapies.The study will assess YS-ON-001&#xD;
      administered as a single agent, three times per week for 21-days with 1 week wash out period&#xD;
      (28 days as 1 cycle) for 12 cycles in a continuous regimen. A dose escalation design will be&#xD;
      applied in cohorts of 3-6 patients in Part I of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose will be 2ml (3 times/ week). Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is&#xD;
      established, the cohort will be expanded with at least 10 additional patients to further&#xD;
      characterize the safety and tolerability at RP2D with specific tumour types, Breast cancer&#xD;
      and Liver Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with YS-ON-001 may be continued for up to 12 cycles or until disease progression or&#xD;
      if patient is withdrawn or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients who complete 12 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment will be considered to have completed the trial. Patients who continue to benefit&#xD;
      from treatment after 12 cycles may have the option to continue treatment upon agreement&#xD;
      between the investigator and sponsor, and pending study drug availability.&#xD;
