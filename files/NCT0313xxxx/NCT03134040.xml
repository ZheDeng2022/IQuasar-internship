  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for physically inactive adults with an active membership at a Greater&#xD;
      Providence Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive weekly feedback on their attendance at the YMCA, and will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of three conditions, to either receive weekly: (i)&#xD;
      monetary incentives, (ii) donations to a charity of their choice, or (iii) feedback only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to continue to receive incentives, participants must maintain an active membership&#xD;
      at the YMCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a pilot study to test feasibility and proof-of-concept&#xD;
      for two incentive programs to promote exercise among low-active overweight and obese adults.&#xD;
      To address weaknesses in the literature, the programs will be (a) conducted in a community&#xD;
      setting by the Greater Providence YMCAs and (b) financially sustainable, such that they do&#xD;
      not require removal of the incentives after a specified period of time. In both incentive&#xD;
      programs, participants will pay the standard monthly YMCA membership fee. In the Rebate&#xD;
      incentive program, participants will have the opportunity to earn a small monetary incentive&#xD;
      to exercise for each day that they attend the YMCA (verified by objective swipe-card data),&#xD;
      with a maximum of 5 exercise sessions being incentivized per week. In the Donation incentive&#xD;
      program, participants will have the opportunity to earn a small monetary incentive to&#xD;
      exercise in the form of donations (using the same incentive schedule) to a registered local&#xD;
      charity of the participant's choice. Thus, the proposed study will compare three experimental&#xD;
      conditions: (a) Rebate incentives (n=25); (b) Donation incentives (n=25); and (c) Control&#xD;
      (i.e., no incentives) (n=25). The Primary Aims are to test (1) feasibility of the two&#xD;
      incentive programs, (2) feasibility of the research methods to evaluate the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the two incentive programs, and (3) proof-of-concept for the two incentive&#xD;
      programs (relative to control), through comparison of average number of sessions/week with&#xD;
      incentives over one year. Secondary outcomes will be self-reported minutes per week of&#xD;
      exercise over one year. The proposed research will provide a preliminary investigation into&#xD;
      two community-based, financially sustainable incentive programs to promote exercise for&#xD;
      adults who are at increased risk for cancer. Positive findings from such a trial would&#xD;
      provide a fast-track for a community-based ready-to-implement exercise promotion&#xD;
      intervention. Additionally, such findings would have significant implications for the use of&#xD;
      financially sustainable incentive programs for exercise through other community organizations&#xD;
      (e.g., privately-owned health clubs), healthcare organizations, or employers (e.g., employer&#xD;
      fitness facilities), as well as providing a model for incentive programs for other&#xD;
      health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation, weight loss).&#xD;
