  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to learn how safe and how effective the study drug Zydelig works, after&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplant as a maintenance therapy in patients with indolent or&#xD;
      transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (iNHL or tiNHL).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is focused on maintenance Zydelig for patients with indolent or transformed&#xD;
      indolent B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (iNHL or tiNHL) after autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Oral Zydelig at 150 mg (or adjusted dose) twice daily continuously on 28-day&#xD;
      cycles. Patients will continue on Zydelig up to one year or to progression/relapse/death or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically documented (by HPI or pathology report) iNHL as defined by follicular&#xD;
             lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom&#xD;
             disease (LPL/WM) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or tiNHL as defined by large B&#xD;
             cell transformation of any of the above entities including chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
             leukemia (CLL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be eligible to undergo high dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by ASCT as&#xD;
             a form of remission consolidation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients without evidence of documented disease progression clinically or&#xD;
             radiographically after ASCT (stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR) or complete&#xD;
             remission (CR)) who have had count recovery (ANC &gt; 500, non-transfused platelet count&#xD;
             &gt; 20,000) and are at least 30 days post ASCT but no more than 120 days post ASCT&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients may have received any prior therapy deemed necessary for them to be eligible&#xD;
             to HDT/ASCT except for patients whom have progressed while on Zydelig. Patients who&#xD;
             have responded to Zydelig previously are eligible for enrollment on the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Age &gt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status &lt;4&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of greater than four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have normal organ function as defined below (after the HDT/ASCT):&#xD;

             III and above are excluded), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
