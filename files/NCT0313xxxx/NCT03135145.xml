      Lite Run is a new assistive device that may have FDA listing as a Class I device by mid 2017&#xD;
      based on clinical testing of adults, independent agency testing and in-house evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a combined study with multiple purposes with respect to the evaluation of its&#xD;
      use with the post-operative pediatric population. A first purpose is to verify safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of the device on pediatric patients. A second purpose is to statistically test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Lite Run to decrease physical burden on the therapist during&#xD;
      post-operative gait training for children and adolescents with cerebral palsy as compared to&#xD;
      current methods of body weight-supported gait training. A third purpose is to measure and&#xD;
      qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the device on patient outcomes and improving&#xD;
      patient and therapist satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of disorders affecting movement and is&#xD;
      attributable to a non-progressive injury to the developing brain. CP is the most common cause&#xD;
      of physical disability in childhood with a prevalence of 3.1 - 3.6 per 1000 births. At this&#xD;
      prevalence, we estimate that over 300,000 children under 21 in the US have CP. Children with&#xD;
      CP have a variety of neuro-motor impairments including muscle weakness and abnormal muscle&#xD;
      tone that leads to progressive musculoskeletal impairments over time. These children&#xD;
      experience discomfort and limitations in functional mobility such as walking (ambulation)&#xD;
      that severely impact their quality of life. Surgical intervention is often used to improve&#xD;
      ambulation quality and quantity for children with cerebral palsy anytime from childhood into&#xD;
      adulthood. Depending on treatment goals, it is not unusual for an individual with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy to undergo surgery involving muscles, tendons, bones or nerves of the feet, ankles,&#xD;
      legs or hips. Two common surgical interventions for ambulatory children with cerebral palsy&#xD;
      include single event multilevel orthopedic surgery to correct muscle lengths and bone&#xD;
      alignment, and selective dorsal rhizotomy to decrease spasticity. Post-operative treatment&#xD;
      course varies depending on the child's condition, pre-operative functional level, and&#xD;
      specific surgical intervention selected to improve their particular deficiencies.&#xD;
      Post-orthopedic surgery, children may be non-weight-bearing for 2-6 weeks. After selective&#xD;
      dorsal rhizotomy, patients exhibit surgical site instability and significant trunk and leg&#xD;
      weakness. They are non-weight-bearing for 2-4 weeks post-surgically, and may begin to stand&#xD;
      and walk once cleared by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When beginning mobility training after orthopedic or selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery,&#xD;
      children typically demonstrate significant weakness and can experience fear, pain and anxiety&#xD;
      as they begin to move. One aspect of mobility that is a significant milestone for children&#xD;
      post-surgically is getting back up and walking. The process to get back up and walk is&#xD;
      facilitated by physical therapists and is termed &quot;gait training&quot; which includes the&#xD;
      components of moving from sit to stand, bearing weight through the lower limbs, taking steps,&#xD;
      and returning to a sitting position. Body weight-supported gait training is often used in&#xD;
      therapy for adults and children to ease the transition from non-weight-bearing back to being&#xD;
      able to walk at their previous level of gait function. Support during this transition may be&#xD;
      provided by a physical therapist using a gait belt, a harness system attached to an overhead&#xD;
      track or device to support body weight, or other assistive devices. Current body weight&#xD;
      support systems for gait training are not optimal. Also there are reports in the literature&#xD;
      of difficulties with harness discomfort and donning and doffing. An unpublished survey of&#xD;
      twelve physical therapists was conducted by a University of Minnesota PT student who was able&#xD;
      to identify 20 deficiencies in available devices for body weight supported gait training.&#xD;
      More than 50% of the therapists cited the following sub-optimal aspects from their&#xD;
      experiences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapist providing majority of the body weight support when using a gait belt takes&#xD;
           away from therapeutic touch for gait therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current harness devices cannot adjust the percent of how much support the device gives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is not sufficient therapeutic evidence for the efficacy of current body weight&#xD;
           support devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current harness devices do not feel like they will help us prevent injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current body weight support devices only work in limited applications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using physical therapist support for gait training without a body weight support device can&#xD;
      require multiple people to assist, result in fatigue, and has the potential of injury for the&#xD;
      therapist. In a survey of physical therapists working in rehabilitation facilities, 67%&#xD;
      reported musculoskeletal pain or discomfort within the past year. Half reported that patient&#xD;
      repositioning (49%) and gait training (47%) also caused or contributed to their pain. Another&#xD;
      study reports survey results of over 1,000 occupational and physical therapists. The survey&#xD;
      indicated that functional activities such as gait training and settings such as pediatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation were associated with injury. An ergonomic analysis of physical therapists&#xD;
      working in rehabilitation concluded that physical therapists are at high risk for work&#xD;
      related musculoskeletal injuries while performing sit-to-stand transfers and overground gait&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve gait training therapy for both therapist and patient and to reduce a therapist's&#xD;
      need to lift and support the body weight of a patient, Lite Run Inc. has developed the Lite&#xD;
      Run Gait Trainer (Lite Run). Lite Run is a new system for the treatment of patients with gait&#xD;
      and balance difficulties that uses differential air pressure inside a specially designed&#xD;
      lower body suit to effectively reduce up to 50 percent of a patient's body weight. The suit&#xD;
      is similar to a pair of pants in appearance and is as easy to don and doff as a pair of&#xD;
      pants. The suit uses technology like astronaut spacesuits to achieve comfort and flexibility&#xD;
      while providing a unique &quot;unweighting&quot; effect that facilitates patient ambulation from&#xD;
      sitting through taking steps. The suit is used in conjunction with the Lite Run Gait Trainer,&#xD;
      which provides air pressure to the suit and support for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lite Run features include: (1) control for the amount of body weight support (up to 50% of&#xD;
      the patient's weight), (2) electro-mechanical and pneumatic controls for providing assistance&#xD;
      in transferring the patient from sitting to standing and ambulation, (3) an open design that&#xD;
      permits access to a patient's body and legs by the therapist, (4) a compact profile that&#xD;
      provides easy maneuverability, and (5) a &quot;base spread&quot; function that permits positioning&#xD;
      close to a patient when seated in a wheelchair, bed or therapy table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Together, these features provide safety and stability for the patient and reduced physical&#xD;
      burden on the therapist while improving the gait training experience and potentially&#xD;
      preventing patient or therapist injury. The system also frees the therapist to focus on&#xD;
      skilled therapeutic activities because the patient is secure in the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lite Run conducted a product demonstration and pediatric needs survey for six physical&#xD;
      therapists at Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare. Current support devices used for&#xD;
      training include overhead harness supports, robotic systems, and harness gait trainers.&#xD;
      Therapists indicated that current devices can be uncomfortable, cause patients to &quot;hang&quot; on&#xD;
      the support, and limit natural motion during sit-to-stand and walking. Gait trainers and&#xD;
      walking devices provide trunk and pelvic support using a seat or harness, and are used with a&#xD;
      treadmill which can be both uncomfortable and scary for children right out of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lite Run may have FDA listing as a Class I device by mid 2017 based on adult clinical&#xD;
      feasibility testing, and completion of independent agency testing and in-house evaluations. A&#xD;
      clinical safety and feasibility trial for adult patients was performed at the Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Center at North Memorial Medical Center, Robbinsdale, MN with 18 adults with a range of&#xD;
      neurological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult physical therapists participating in this trial have indicated the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lite Run is comfortable. Harnesses at the groin are uncomfortable for many patients.&#xD;
           Lite Run has the potential to decrease pain, and improve security, support, compression,&#xD;
           adjustability, and flexibility in combination with support. It provides improved&#xD;
           mobility during sit-to-stand. The device may allow the patient to get back up walking&#xD;
           sooner after surgery than if they were using another device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is easy for therapists to use. Pants donning time is less than 5 minutes, and&#xD;
           requires two quick attach points to engage the patient into the device. It is easily&#xD;
           adjustable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It decreases the burden on the therapist. Because the device supports the patient's body&#xD;
           weight, therapists hands are free to provide cuing and facilitation rather than physical&#xD;
           support. It could prevent therapist injury particularly to the back. It is fall proof.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The device is able to quantify the amount of support provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study indicated that there were no adverse events or safety issues from&#xD;
      using the system on adults. In addition to safety and feasibility testing, the following user&#xD;
      design requirements were tested: time to don liner and pants, transfer-in time, therapist's&#xD;
      access to patient, patient's arm mobility, hindrance of patient's stride, patient directed&#xD;
      steerability, brake stability, overall stability, sit-to-stand functionality, wheelchair&#xD;
      compatibility, sit-to-stand sufficiency, odometer acceptability, ease of use, and the&#xD;
      physical effort required by the PT. After training, all therapists were all able to operate&#xD;
      the Lite Run safely and independently. The device allowed them to use their hands to provide&#xD;
      skilled therapeutic maneuvers, as the device provided stability and patient unweighting. The&#xD;
      study demonstrated that the Lite Run is a safe system and shows potential for pediatric&#xD;
      application to improve the rehabilitation experience and outcomes. Therefore, continued&#xD;
      investigation regarding the feasibility of using the device in a post-operative pediatric&#xD;
      population using pediatric sized lower body pressure suits is warranted.&#xD;
