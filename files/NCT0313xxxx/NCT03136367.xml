      What Matters Most is a study that aims to determine how best to help women of lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic status make high-quality decisions about early stage breast cancer treatments.&#xD;
      What Matters Most will be comparing two decision aids used in the clinic visit to usual care&#xD;
      (what normally happens in the clinic). The first decision aid (Option Grid) presents&#xD;
      evidence-based information about lumpectomy and mastectomy in a tabular format using text&#xD;
      only. The second decision aid (Picture Option Grid) presents evidence-based information about&#xD;
      lumpectomy and mastectomy using pictures, pictographs and simplified text. What Matters Most&#xD;
      aims to show that the interventions can reduce disparities in decision-making and treatment&#xD;
      choice between women of high and low SES.&#xD;

      Background and Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Despite improvements in&#xD;
      survival, women of low socioeconomic status (SES) diagnosed with early stage breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue to experience poorer doctor-patient communication, lower satisfaction with&#xD;
           surgery and decision making, and higher decision regret compared to women of higher SES;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Often play a passive role in decision making;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are less likely to receive optimal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those differences are disparities that predominantly affect women of low SES with early stage&#xD;
      breast cancer, irrespective of race or ethnicity. For early stage breast cancer, low SES is a&#xD;
      stronger predictor of poorer outcomes, treatment received and death, than race or ethnicity.&#xD;
      The investigators define low SES as a lower income, lower educational attainment, and&#xD;
      uninsured or state-insured status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although BCS is the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer (stages I to IIIA),&#xD;
      research confirms equivalent survival between mastectomy and BCS. Both options are offered&#xD;
      yet have distinct harms and benefits, valued differently by patients. The patient and&#xD;
      stakeholder partners involved in this study have emphasized the critical importance of&#xD;
      supporting women in making high quality breast cancer surgery decisions (good knowledge and&#xD;
      alignment between the patient's choice, values and priorities) irrespective of SES and health&#xD;
      literacy. Yet, research shows that women of low SES are not usually involved in an informed,&#xD;
      patient-centered dialogue about surgery choice. There is no evidence that women of low SES&#xD;
      have distinct preferences that explain a lower uptake of BCS and limited engagement in&#xD;
      decision making. Further, communication strategies are not typically adapted to women of low&#xD;
      SES and low health literacy. Most decision aids for breast cancer have been designed for&#xD;
      highly literate audiences, with poor accessibility and readability. Simpler, shorter decision&#xD;
      aids delivered in the clinical encounter (encounter decision aids) may be more beneficial to&#xD;
      underserved patients, and could reduce disparities. It is critical to determine how to&#xD;
      effectively support women of low SES in making informed breast cancer surgery choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will assess the comparative effectiveness of two effective encounter&#xD;
      decision aids (Option Grid and Picture Option Grid) against usual care on decision quality&#xD;
      (primary outcome), shared decision making, treatment choice and other secondary outcomes&#xD;
      across socioeconomic strata (Aim 1). Second, the investigators aim to explore the effect of&#xD;
      the Picture Option Grid on disparities in decision making (decision quality, knowledge, and&#xD;
      shared decision making), treatment choice, as well as mediation and moderation effects (Aim&#xD;
      2). Third, in order to maximize the implementation potential, the investigators will explore&#xD;
      strategies that promote the encounter decision aids' sustained use and dissemination using a&#xD;
      theoretical implementation model (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority&#xD;
      trial with stratification by SES (Aims 1 and 2) and randomization at the clinician level. One&#xD;
      thousand, one hundred patients (half of higher SES and half of lower SES) will be recruited&#xD;
      from five large cancer centers. In preparation for the trial (Year 01), the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct semi-structured interviews with women of low SES who have completed treatment&#xD;
      for early stage breast cancer to adapt the &quot;What Matters Most to You&quot; subscale of the&#xD;
      Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) for women of low SES. Lastly, the investigators will use&#xD;
      interviews, field-notes, and observations to explore strategies that promote the&#xD;
      interventions' sustained use and dissemination using the Normalization Process Theory (Aim&#xD;
      3). Community-Based Participatory Research will be used throughout the trial (with continuous&#xD;
      patient and stakeholder involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (I to IIIA)&#xD;
      from both higher and lower SES will be included in the trial, provided they have a basic&#xD;
      command of English, Spanish, or Mandarin. About 367 patients will be recruited per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions have been developed, tested, and shown to be effective. The Option Grid&#xD;
      (intervention 1) is a one-page evidence-based summary of available options presented in a&#xD;
      tabular format, listing the trade-offs that patients normally consider when making breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery decisions. The Picture Option Grid (intervention 2) uses the same evidence and&#xD;
      tabular layout, but it is tailored to women of lower SES and low health literacy and includes&#xD;
      simple text and images. Because decision aids are not routinely available in real world&#xD;
      settings, usual care is a coherent and legitimate comparator. It will include the provision&#xD;
      of usual information resources about breast cancer but will exclude the provision of other&#xD;
      decision aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include treatment choice, the validated 3-item CollaboRATE&#xD;
      measure of shared decision-making (SDM), Chew's validated one-item health literacy screening&#xD;
      question, PROMIS, an 8-item validated anxiety short form, EQ-5D-5L, a validated, standardized&#xD;
      6-item quality of life measure, and four items from COST, a validated financial toxicity&#xD;
      measure. Participants will also be asked to estimate their out-of-pocket expenses over the&#xD;
      past month. All measures will be available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. Observer&#xD;
      OPTION5 will be used to rate the level of shared decision making in the clinical encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A regression framework (logistic regression, linear regression, mixed effect regression&#xD;
      models, generalized estimating equations) and mediation analyses will be used in the&#xD;
      analysis. The investigators will also use multiple informants analysis to measure and examine&#xD;
      SES and multiple imputation to manage missing data. Heterogeneity of treatment effects&#xD;
      analyses for SES, age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site will be performed.&#xD;
      The investigators will also use the recordings of surgical consultations to analyze the&#xD;
      conversations about costs and treatment recommendations made by providers.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Decision Quality: Knowledge Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the index surgical consultation visit, immediately after the index surgical consultation visit and at one week post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Change in decision quality, measured using the validated 16-item Decision Quality Worksheet for Breast Cancer Surgery. Decision quality is measured through three constructs: knowledge, decision process, and concordance. Knowledge is five questions that results in a score from 0 to 5 with higher numbers indicating higher knowledge. Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance summary score (0-100%) indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately before the index surgical consultation visit, immediately after the index surgical consultation visit, at 1 week post-surgery, and at 12 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported anxiety, measured using the validated 8-item PROMIS anxiety short form. Each question was coded from one to five. Total scores were obtained by scoring the raw score of each item answered. The lowest possible raw score was 8; the highest possible raw score was 40 with higher numbers indicating higher anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Shared Decision-making (Self-reported)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the index surgical consultation visit</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported shared decision-making about breast cancer surgical options measured using the validated 3-item CollaboRATE measure. Each item was rated on a scale from 0 to 9 with a possible score range from 0 to 27. We dichotomized this measure using the top score approach, grouping participants scoring 9 on all three items versus all others.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shared Decision-making (Observed)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the index surgical consultation visit</time_frame>
    <description>Shared decision-making observed during the surgical consultation, measured using the validated observer-rated OPTION5. The five items on the measure ask raters to score the consultation on how much the clinician: 1) confirms that alternatives exist, 2) reassures that they will support the patient to become informed, 3) gives information or checks understanding about the options, 4) makes an effort to elicit the patient's preferences, and 5) integrates the patient's elicited preferences. Each of the five items is scored from zero to four for a summary score ranging from zero to 20 and a scaled score ranging from zero to 100. Higher numbers indicate more shared decision making was observed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Regret</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 week post-surgery, 12 weeks post-surgery, and 1 year post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported feelings of decision regret, measured using the validated 5-item decision regret scale. Items 2 and 4 were reverse coded so a higher number indicated more regret. Scores were then converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from each item then multiply by 25. To obtain a final score, the items were summed and averaged. A score of 0 meant no regret and a score of 100 meant high regret.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between September 2017 and February 2019, we screened 2,057 of a target 2,200 patients; 1,031 patients remained eligible. We approached 885 eligible patients, of which 622 (76.6%) consented. Sixteen surgeons saw 571 of 622 consented patients.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Sixteen surgeons saw 571 of 622 consented patients. The imbalanced allocation to arms was due to differences in the number of patients seen by each surgeon, or changes in their role or attendance. Of 440 patients who consented to recording, we collected 311 (70.7%) usable recordings.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Arm 1: Option Grid</title>
          <description>Patients in this arm will receive the Option Grid for breast cancer surgery, an encounter decision aid, when they first meet with the breast surgeon to discuss their surgical options for breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
Option Grid: The Option Grid(TM) encounter decision aid for early stage breast cancer surgery is a one-page, evidence-based summary of available options presented in a tabular format.</description>

          <description>Patients in this arm will receive the Picture Option Grid for breast cancer surgery, an encounter decision aid, when they first meet with the breast surgeon to discuss their surgical options for breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
Picture Option Grid: The Picture Option Grid was derived from the Option Grid for early stage breast cancer. It uses the same evidence and integrates images and simpler text, thus exploiting pictorial superiority. The Picture Option Grid has been specifically designed for women of lower SES and low health literacy.</description>

        <title>Change in Decision Quality: Knowledge Subscale</title>
        <description>Change in decision quality, measured using the validated 16-item Decision Quality Worksheet for Breast Cancer Surgery. Decision quality is measured through three constructs: knowledge, decision process, and concordance. Knowledge is five questions that results in a score from 0 to 5 with higher numbers indicating higher knowledge. Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance summary score (0-100%) indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference.</description>

        <title>Change in Decision Quality: Decison Process Subscale</title>
        <description>Change in decision quality, measured using the validated 16-item Decision Quality Worksheet for Breast Cancer Surgery. Decision quality is measured through three constructs: knowledge, decision process, and concordance. Knowledge is five questions that results in a score from 0 to 5 with higher numbers indicating higher knowledge. Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale from 0 to 7 with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance score indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference.</description>

The five items on the measure ask raters to score the consultation on how much the clinician: 1) confirms that alternatives exist, 2) reassures that they will support the patient to become informed, 3) gives information or checks understanding about the options, 4) makes an effort to elicit the patient's preferences, and 5) integrates the patient's elicited preferences. Each of the five items is scored from zero to four for a summary score ranging from zero to 20 and a scaled score ranging from zero to 100. Higher numbers indicate more shared decision making was observed.</description>

          <description>Semi-structured interviews with clinic stakeholders and patients 12 weeks post-surgery, field notes, and clinic observations to explore strategies that promote the interventions' sustained use and dissemination</description>
          <population>The results are reported in two groups: patients and all surgeons. The data collection method used was semi-structured interview (using a purposive sampling technique). This was a qualitative exploration of the data. We did not interview all participants but only purposively selected 42 participants in the intervention arms. Some results in this section only apply to patients (e.g., helped with decision) and some only apply to surgeons (e.g., would recommend to other health professionals).</population>
