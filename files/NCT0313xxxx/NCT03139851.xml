  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the administration of pembrolizumab combined to metronomic&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide may be an interesting therapeutic option for female patients breast cancer&#xD;
      with lymphopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Include only patients with breast cancer with lymphopenia is based on the particularly poor&#xD;
      prognosis of these patients. The approach suggested here is to deplete and active the immune&#xD;
      response of these immunosuppressed patients. The combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide would provide a higher gain in anti-tumor response in these patients than in&#xD;
      those without lymphopenia and in chemotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators proposal is to conduct a multicentric, non-comparative, single arm,&#xD;
      two-stage, Phase II trial in lymphopenic patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a safety run-in Phase aiming to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy&#xD;
           pembrolizumab + metronomic cyclophosphamide based on the occurrence of severe&#xD;
           toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a two-stage Phase II aiming to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination therapy&#xD;
           pembrolizumab + metronomic cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, patients will receive cyclophosphamide (50 mg/day, daily, per os)&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks, intravenously [IV]). The adverse events of the two&#xD;
      drugs are well known.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initiation of different stage of the study depend on the occurrences of severe toxicities&#xD;
      in safety run-in phase and Clinical Benefit rate after 24 weeks in the two-stage Phase II of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both study drugs will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical&#xD;
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease&#xD;
      progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic&#xD;
      data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
