  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Finland, there are no guidelines concerning post-operative pain medication of ambulatory&#xD;
      surgery patients. There is a wide variety in drug prescription and medication practices of&#xD;
      various doctors and clinics. To treat patients' pain safely, type of surgery, unique patient&#xD;
      needs, risks, adverse effects and patient's capacity to follow instructions should be&#xD;
      assessed during the few hour visit at the clinic. In many clinics, pain is treated after&#xD;
      hospital discharge with strong opioid oxycodone, but the amount and dose of prescribed&#xD;
      oxycodone varies. In Helsinki Universitys Hospital, Peijas Hospital, investigators have over&#xD;
      2000 ambulatory surgery procedures annually. Investigators have strict policy in oxycodone&#xD;
      use after patient discharge compared to some other Finnish ambulatory surgery clinics. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to evaluate, whether the prescribed pain medication is sufficient and&#xD;
      whether patients' suffer from adverse effects after discharge from ambulatory surgery (letter&#xD;
      interview). The study proceeds in three phases: 1) observation of current medication&#xD;
      practice, 2) observation after optimization and standardization of hospitals drug&#xD;
      prescription protocol, 3) evaluation of mobile phone app in pain medication follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After informed consent, all patients operated as ambulatory surgery patients during the study&#xD;
      period are given a letter interview for pain, pain medication and symptom follow up. They are&#xD;
      also given a return envelope (with paid postal fee) to return the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the first interview phase, our pain medication practice is&#xD;
      reconsidered by anesthetists and surgeons to create a standard operating protocol for pain&#xD;
      medication. The standard operating protocol is informed to personnel. Then, patient interview&#xD;
      phase is repeated for another 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, investigators continue with a pilot study on using a mobile phone app in evaluating&#xD;
      patients pain, sufficient pain medication and adverse effects. All patient with informed&#xD;
      consent, suitable mobile phone, and willing to use it for reporting pain for hospital&#xD;
      personnel are contacted via the mobile app. Other patients operated during that study period&#xD;
      are interviewed by either letter interview or phone interview. Investigators try to estimate&#xD;
      whether mobile apps are suitable for pain and medication follow-up.&#xD;
