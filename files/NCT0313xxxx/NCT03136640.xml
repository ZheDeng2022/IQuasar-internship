  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety, feasibility and pharmacokinetic study to confirm that the recommended safe&#xD;
      dose and schedule of ModraDoc006/r (oral docetaxel with ritonavir) as determined in a&#xD;
      previous phase I study is also safe and feasible in the target population of patients with&#xD;
      CRPC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety, feasibility and pharmacokinetic phase II study to evaluate treatment with&#xD;
      ModraDoc006/r (oral docetaxel with ritonavir) in chemotherapy na√Øve patients with&#xD;
      castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer for whom treatment with intravenous docetaxel&#xD;
      is indicated. The primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended dose&#xD;
      determined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of docetaxel (as ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets)&#xD;
      that can safely be administered in combination with ritonavir to patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer in a bi-daily weekly schedule without interruption and&#xD;
      results in an adequate systemic exposure to docetaxel. On a predefined day of the first and&#xD;
      every subsequent week, the patient will receive oral docetaxel (as ModraDoc006 10 mg&#xD;
      tablets). This regime will be continued weekly (intake around the same time) until completion&#xD;
      of the study, progressive disease or until adverse events, which require dose modification or&#xD;
      discontinuation of therapy, are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose escalation design will be used to determine the recommended dose of ModraDoc006 in&#xD;
      combination with ritonavir that is safe and feasible and provides an adequate systemic&#xD;
      docetaxel exposure in the target population of the projected pivotal study in patients with&#xD;
      CRPC. Three castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) patients will be assigned&#xD;
      to the starting dose level 1A of 30-20 mg ModraDoc006 in a bi-daily weekly schedule, each&#xD;
      intake of ModraDoc006 will be combined with 200 mg ritonavir. If no more than one DLT has&#xD;
      occurred during the first four weeks of treatment on dose level 1A (30-20 mg ModraDoc006 and&#xD;
      bi-daily ritonavir 200 mg) and the pharmacokinetic results are favorable, than three&#xD;
      additional patients will be added to this dose level. If no more than 1 DLT in these first 6&#xD;
      patients has occurred, this will be the recommended dose and this dose level will be expanded&#xD;
      until a total of 20 for toxicity evaluable patients have been treated on this dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 2 DLTs have occurred directly in the first 3 patients or in the first 6 patients (after&#xD;
      the previous described addition of 3 patients), during the first four weeks of treatment on&#xD;
      dose level 1A (30-20 mg ModraDoc006 and bi-daily 200 mg ritonavir) and the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      results are favorable, the dose may be de-escalated to the next lower dose-level, depending&#xD;
      on the pharmacokinetic results and the study schedule will start again from the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no more than one DLT has occurred in the first 6 patients during the first four weeks of&#xD;
      treatment on dose level 1A and the pharmacokinetic results are not favorable, than the dose&#xD;
      will be escalated depending on the pharmacokinetic results and the study schedule will start&#xD;
      again from the beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If two or more DLTs have occurred in the first 6 patients during the first four weeks of&#xD;
      treatment on dose level 1A and the pharmacokinetic results are not favorable, the dose will&#xD;
      be altered according to the type of DLT.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Any treatment with investigational drugs, chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to receiving the first dose of investigational treatment. Palliative&#xD;
