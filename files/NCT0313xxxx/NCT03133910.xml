  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mortality benefit has been proven with early antibiotic administration in sepsis.&#xD;
      Antimicrobial therapy should be based on early achievement of effective drug concentrations&#xD;
      by optimizing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of individual drugs. Optimal dosing in the&#xD;
      critically ill patient can be challenging with the rapidly changing physiology of sepsis&#xD;
      during the first days of hospitalization with capillary leak, fluid overload, changes in&#xD;
      cardiac output, and alterations renal clearance. Ceftazidime is the preferred beta-lactam for&#xD;
      empiric treatment of sepsis at Lurie Children's Hospital because of its anti-pseudomonal and&#xD;
      anti-enteric bacilli coverage, however, the majority of pharmacokinetic data currently&#xD;
      published in pediatrics does not include Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Adult&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics data suggest that critically ill adults with high level of&#xD;
      illness severity may benefit from continuous or extended infusion beta lactam therapy to&#xD;
      optimize the therapeutic concentration particularly for pathogens that are relatively&#xD;
      resistant to beta-lactams. Understanding the changing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      ceftazidime with the progression of illness in the ICU may help determine if current dosing&#xD;
      regimens are adequate to maintain appropriate drug concentrations to optimize antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Severe sepsis continues to be a leading cause of admission and death in the pediatric&#xD;
      critical care population. Mortality benefit has been proven with early antibiotic&#xD;
      administration. Optimal antimicrobial therapy should be based on early achievement of&#xD;
      effective drug concentrations by optimizing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      individual drugs. Ceftazidime is the preferred beta-lactam for empiric treatment of sepsis at&#xD;
      Lurie Children's Hospital because of its anti-pseudomonal and anti-enteric bacilli coverage,&#xD;
      however, the majority of pharmacokinetic data currently published in pediatrics does not&#xD;
      include ICU patients. For beta-lactams like ceftazidime, the time that free (nonprotein&#xD;
      bound) drug concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the&#xD;
      bacteria (t&gt;MIC) best defines the bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Based on previous&#xD;
      animal studies and subsequent clinical studies, beta-lactams require about 50% t&gt;MIC. Adult&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics data suggest that critically ill adults with high level of&#xD;
      illness severity may benefit from continuous or extended infusion beta lactam therapy to&#xD;
      optimize time above MIC particularly for pathogens that are relatively resistant to&#xD;
      beta-lactams. Positive outcome results using extended infusion have been found with respect&#xD;
      to mortality benefit, clinical cure, reduced length of stay, and increased ventilator free&#xD;
      days. It is likely that because children experience changes in physiology with critical&#xD;
      illness likely leading to alteration in antibiotic clearance, additional data are needed to&#xD;
      determine if our current dosing strategies are achieving optimal antimicrobial exposure.&#xD;
      Understanding the changing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of ceftazidime with the&#xD;
      progression of illness in the ICU may help determine if current dosing regimens are adequate&#xD;
      to maintain appropriate t&gt;MIC. In this study all patients between the ages of 2 months and 18&#xD;
      years admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit/ Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (PICU/CICU)&#xD;
      who will receive ceftazidime for empiric or definitive antimicrobial therapy with an expected&#xD;
      duration of greater than or equal to 48 hours who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this prospective, non-interventional, pharmacokinetic study. Sampling of serum to determine&#xD;
      concentrations will occur around ceftazidime doses during the first 48 hours after admission&#xD;
      or onset of hospital associated illness, with additional sampling up to 7 days if antibiotic&#xD;
      use continues. Using a traditional FDA-approved dosing regimen (50 mg q 8hr with maximum&#xD;
      dosing of 6g/d), samples will be drawn following the 2nd or 3rd dose of Ceftazidime received&#xD;
      by the patient at times: 0 min (predose), 30 min, 1 hour, and 4 hours following dose. During&#xD;
      the second 24 hours of therapy, one sample will be drawn between hours 2 and 4 post dose and&#xD;
      if therapy continues additional samples will be drawn daily between hours 2 and 4 post dose&#xD;
      up to 7 days. Additional information will be collected to better assess volumes of&#xD;
      distribution, drug clearance, kidney function, and cardiac output to determine patient&#xD;
      covariates that may help delineate which patient populations associated with altered&#xD;
      ceftazidime exposure. Population pharmacokinetic modeling will be performed and various&#xD;
      regimens will be simulated to identify optimal dosing.&#xD;
