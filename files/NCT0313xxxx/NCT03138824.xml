  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the 2nd most common urological malignancy. The vast&#xD;
      majority of newly diagnosed cases are non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC), which&#xD;
      represent about 75%, and it can be treated with transurethral resection (TURBT). The goal of&#xD;
      TURBT in Ta and T1 NMIBC is to make the correct diagnosis and completely remove all visible&#xD;
      lesions. The quality of TURBT strongly determines patient prognosis and overall treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White light cystoscopy (WLC) remains despite of its limitations the cornerstone of the&#xD;
      diagnosis and subsequent treatment of NMIBC. The sensitivity and specificity of WLC range&#xD;
      from 62% to 84% and 43% to 98%, respectively. Its sensitivity is lower for small papillary&#xD;
      bladder tumors and carcinoma in situ (CIS). Moreover, the accuracy of WLC has been shown to&#xD;
      be operator dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smaller or satellite tumors can be missed, which contributes to almost 40% rate of residual&#xD;
      bladder cancer found at the time of 'second-look' TUR. Indistinct borders and difficult&#xD;
      visualization of submucosal tumor margins during TUR can lead to incomplete tumor resection&#xD;
      and understaging of bladder cancer and leads to tumor recurrence which range from 15% to 61%&#xD;
      at one year after surgery based on combined analysis of seven EORTC studies. 3 Non-papillary&#xD;
      and flat malignant lesions such as carcinoma in situ (CIS) can be difficult to differentiate&#xD;
      from inflammation, with detection rates of CIS only 58% to 68% by WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence cystoscopy also known as blue light cystoscopy or photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)&#xD;
      requires preoperative intravesical administration of protoporphyrin IX precursor as the&#xD;
      contrast agent, a blue light source that illuminates at 375 to 440 nm. Protoporphyrin&#xD;
      accumulates preferentially in neoplastic cells and emits fluorescence in the red part of the&#xD;
      spectrum under blue light excitation. Though PDD also does not distinguish high-grade from&#xD;
      low-grade bladder cancer, PDD has an increased rate of detection of flat appearing CIS vs WLC&#xD;
      (87% vs 75% pooled sensitivity; P= .006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recurrence rate of PDD-guided TUR of bladder tumor is a matter of controversy. In a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of prospective studies on 1345 patients with overall 12 months recurrence rate&#xD;
      was significantly lower with PDD compared with WLC (34.5% vs 45.4% pooled sensitivity;&#xD;
      P=0.006). However, a prospective randomized multi-institutional trial found no difference in&#xD;
      tumor recurrence and progression between PDD and WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow band maging (NBI) devices filter out the red spectrum from white light, with the&#xD;
      resultant blue (415 nm) and green (540 nm) spectra absorbed by hemoglobin, thus highlighting&#xD;
      the contrast between capillaries and mucosa with no significant difference in detection rate&#xD;
      of bladder tumor between new and experienced users. Under NBI, the more vascularized CIS or&#xD;
      tumor areas are accentuated in appearance as green or brown. However visibility of NBI&#xD;
      cystoscopy is reduced with bleeding or inflammation, due to the strong absorption of light by&#xD;
      hemoglobin. In contrast to PDD, systems integrating WLC and NBI are already available. In a&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis of 8 studies including 1022 patients, the detection of bladder cancer&#xD;
      was higher by NBI compared with WLC on a per-person basis (94% vs 85% pooled sensitivity) and&#xD;
      a per-lesion basis (95% vs 75% pooled sensitivity); however, the pooled specificity on a&#xD;
      per-lesion basis was lower by NBI compared with WLC (55% vs 72%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to PDD, NBI does not distinguish bladder cancer grade. The detection of CIS was&#xD;
      significantly improved by NBI over WLC (100% vs 83% sensitivity) in a study of 427 patients.&#xD;
      Another multicenter, prospective study reported a significantly increased sensitivity for the&#xD;
      detection of CIS from 50% for WLC to 90% for NBI in 104 patients. In a recent, single-center,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial to assess whether NBI improved TUR of bladder tumors in 254&#xD;
      patients with 2-year follow-up, a reduced recurrence rate (22% vs 33%; P=.05) and improved&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (22 vs 19 months; P =.02) were reported by NBI compared with WLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storz Professional Image Enhancement System (SPIES) offers several image enhancement&#xD;
      modalities: Spectra A mode is based mainly on the green (~500-570 nm) and blue (~400-480 nm)&#xD;
      light spectral signals that are separated in the (Red-Green-Blue) of the camera system within&#xD;
      these bands the hemoglobin absorption is significantly higher compared to the red spectral&#xD;
      band above 570 nm. Due to the limited penetration depth in the blue to green spectral part,&#xD;
      this mode allows to highlight the contrast of capillaries and vessels in the superficial&#xD;
      mucosa and submucosa. The SPIES Spectra B pronounces as well as the Spectra A mode the blue&#xD;
      to green spectral part in order to reach a higher contrast in the superficial mucosa and sub&#xD;
      mucosa. However SPECTRA B is obtained by adding 15% of red colour to SPECTRA A. The Chroma&#xD;
      modality enhance the sharpness of the image. The Clara modality create a clearer image of&#xD;
      darker regions within the image. Together they should provide a clearer and sharper image of&#xD;
      the original WL image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPIES enhances the blue and the green wavelengths of the transmitted image and a three-colour&#xD;
      image is built from these components of the spectral input. This effect is achieved by&#xD;
      suppression of the red portion of the spectrum. By adding different colours to the blue- and&#xD;
      green-coloured image (e.g. orange or violet), three types of SPIES images are produced,&#xD;
      giving the surgeon three different options for visualization. SPIES proposes the option to&#xD;
      choose the best enhancement method in different clinical situations, e.g. SPIES A or C mode,&#xD;
      if high contrast is desired or SPIES B mode in case of visual interferences during cystoscopy&#xD;
      as hematuria.&#xD;
