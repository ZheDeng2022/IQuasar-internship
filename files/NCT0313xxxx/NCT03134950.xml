  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to test a stepped care behavioral intervention approach for youth with&#xD;
      functional abdominal pain (FAP) that is feasible to administer in medical settings. Screening&#xD;
      and a brief intervention (i.e. psychoeducation and relaxation training) are provided to youth&#xD;
      with FAP with more than minimal functional disability (FDI score &gt;7) during their medical&#xD;
      visit as part of enhanced usual care (EUC). Patients are re-assessed after two weeks. Those&#xD;
      that fail to respond to EUC (as evidenced by FDI score &gt;7) are eligible to undergo a baseline&#xD;
      assessment and then are randomized to receive either 1) a more intensive and tailored CBT&#xD;
      approach, Aim to Decrease Anxiety and Pain Treatment (ADAPT), provided by a trained&#xD;
      psychologist, or 2) medical treatment as usual (TAU). It is hypothesized that youth who&#xD;
      participate in ADAPT will have lower average pain rating scores, less pain-related functional&#xD;
      disability, and less anxiety symptoms (if elevated) at post-assessment as compared to youth&#xD;
      receiving medical TAU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to pilot test different levels of behavioral intervention for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with FAP who are presenting for pediatric gastroenterology care. Patients&#xD;
      are screened during their medical visit. Those with more than minimal levels of functional&#xD;
      disability (Functional Disability Inventory (FDI) score &gt;7), receive Enhanced Usual Care&#xD;
      (EUC), brief pain-focused psychoeducation administered as part of their medical visit. As&#xD;
      part of EUC, patients receive access to a web module for home use that reiterates educational&#xD;
      material and offers relaxation training tools for home practice (i.e., audio recordings). Two&#xD;
      weeks following EUC, patient outcomes are re-assessed with a focus on pain-related&#xD;
      disability. Those who fail to respond to EUC (i.e., FDI remains &gt;7) are invited to complete&#xD;
      the next phase of the study. Eligible participants undergo a baseline assessment consisting&#xD;
      of a diagnostic interview and child measures pertaining to pain, anxiety, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, and pain-related worries. Caregivers complete forms about their child's pain&#xD;
      history, child disability, and child worries. Caregivers also complete a form about their own&#xD;
      stress symptoms. After baseline assessment, patients are randomized to medical treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) or ADAPT, a tailored CBT delivered by a trained psychologist. ADAPT content&#xD;
      differs based on the individual needs of the patient (i.e., all patients receive 4&#xD;
      pain-focused coping skills sessions, and those who present with clinical levels of anxiety&#xD;
      receive 2 additional sessions to address anxiety symptoms). Participants complete 4 or 6&#xD;
      sessions (2 in person sessions and 2-4 web modules with phone support). Approximately six&#xD;
      weeks after randomization, the patient and caregiver undergo follow-up assessment to assess&#xD;
      pain, anxiety, and disability. It is hypothesized that youth who participate in ADAPT will&#xD;
      have lower average pain rating scores, less pain-related functional disability, and lower&#xD;
      levels of anxiety symptoms (if elevated) at post-assessment as compared to youth receiving&#xD;
      medical TAU.&#xD;
