  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health diagnosis in the US and are associated&#xD;
      with avoidance that causes functional impairments and decreases quality of life. Social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder is among the most prevalent anxiety disorders, with most common age of onset&#xD;
      being in adolescence. The frontline treatment for social anxiety disorder is cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy with exposure. However, a significant number of adolescent patients do not&#xD;
      get better after completing cognitive behavioral therapy or experience relapse. This could be&#xD;
      explained by findings in both mice and humans suggesting that cue-based extinction learning&#xD;
      occurs less readily in adolescents than in children and adults. Studies using mouse-models&#xD;
      have overcome this age disparity by enhancing contextual cues when fear extinction learning&#xD;
      takes place. Providing realistic learning contexts for exposure could be the key to enhancing&#xD;
      treatment effects in adolescents. This is often challenging for a variety of reasons,&#xD;
      including difficulty realistically mimicking anxiety-provoking social situations due to&#xD;
      limited resources, clinician training, time, or motivation. Virtual reality environments&#xD;
      could provide contextual exposures for social anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will test the feasibility of integrating virtual reality technology in&#xD;
      exposure-based treatment in youth ages 13-23 diagnosed with social anxiety disorder with the&#xD;
      goal of approximating equivalent efficacy with traditional cognitive behavioral therapy, and&#xD;
      assessing feasibility of virtual reality technology with this population. We will also pilot&#xD;
      a fear conditioning and extinction learning paradigm to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      extinction learning and efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy, using physiological&#xD;
      assessment indicators to mark changes in fear response. These markers will also be used prior&#xD;
      to the initiation of the therapy to assess the degree to which virtual reality environments&#xD;
      invoke a true fear response, comparing the 12 participants with social phobia to 12 age&#xD;
      matched, non-anxious control participants. The aims of this study are threefold: to assess&#xD;
      feasibility of using virtual reality in treatment of social anxiety in youth, to examine&#xD;
      whether virtual reality invokes arousal similar to anxiety and test the physiological&#xD;
      assessment protocol, and to evaluate whether exposure using virtual reality environments&#xD;
      reduces symptoms of social anxiety and related functional impairment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifetime prevalence of social anxiety disorder in adolescents is estimated to be 8.6%, with&#xD;
      the most common age of onset being ages 15-17. Social anxiety disorder is related to&#xD;
      significant functional impairment and, if untreated, puts youth at risk for depression and&#xD;
      substance abuse, and results in failure to meet important academic, social, and occupational&#xD;
      milestones. The current literature supports cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure&#xD;
      therapy, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor medications, and their combination for the&#xD;
      treatment of anxiety disorders with good effects. However, even with gold standard treatment,&#xD;
      a significant number of patients do not get better or experience relapse. Exposure therapy is&#xD;
      based on the principles of fear extinction, such that cues associated with threat are&#xD;
      presented in a safe and controlled way until they are experienced as safe and fear responses&#xD;
      are reduced. Studies in mice and non-anxious humans have demonstrated cue-based fear&#xD;
      extinction learning to be less robust in adolescence than it is in childhood or adulthood.&#xD;
      However, mouse-models suggest that context-based extinction learning closes the gap between&#xD;
      age-groups, with adolescents performing as well on extinction learning tasks when put back in&#xD;
      the original environment where the fear was acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, clinical research suggest that exposure therapy is most useful when exposures are&#xD;
      conducted in the same or similar environments to where the fear is experienced in everyday&#xD;
      life. However, there are many barriers to providing contextual based exposure therapy,&#xD;
      particularly for social anxiety, including paucity of well-trained exposure therapists in&#xD;
      many areas of the country, and difficulty generating or accessing realistic social situations&#xD;
      for convincing exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality offers a promising avenue for contextual exposures, by increasing the&#xD;
      availability of certain contexts that cannot be readily mimicked in therapy. Furthermore, in&#xD;
      vivo exposure situations can feel overwhelming for some individuals (patients and&#xD;
      therapists), resulting in refusal to engage in exposure altogether. Virtual reality&#xD;
      technology could allow for more gradual titration of exposure for those patients that require&#xD;
      lower intensity exposures, and can be done in the therapy office for clinicians who do not&#xD;
      have the time, resources, experience, or comfort level to travel outside of their office in&#xD;
      pursuit of appropriate exposure environments. Even for seasoned exposure therapists, virtual&#xD;
      reality could serve as a practice step in preparation for in vivo exposures or could be used&#xD;
      in lieu of in vivo exposures if necessary. There has been extensive research on the use of&#xD;
      virtual reality in facilitating exposure in a variety of populations. However, its&#xD;
      effectiveness has not been demonstrated in adolescents with social phobia, and research is&#xD;
      limited in adolescent samples in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study proposed for this National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and&#xD;
      Depression award would test the overall hypothesis that virtual reality technology is&#xD;
      feasible, acceptable, and will enhance exposure-based therapy for socially anxious youth.&#xD;
      Studies will be focused on testing the feasibility of integrating virtual reality technology&#xD;
      into exposure-based treatment in adolescents and young adults (ages 13-23) diagnosed with&#xD;
      social anxiety disorder with the goal of approximating equivalent efficacy with traditional&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy, and assessing feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the&#xD;
      virtual reality technology with this population. In addition, we would pilot a fear&#xD;
      conditioning and extinction learning paradigm with the subjects to explore the relationship&#xD;
      between extinction learning and efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy, using&#xD;
      physiological assessment indicators to mark changes in fear response, including skin&#xD;
      conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability, and startle. These physiological markers&#xD;
      would also be used prior to the initiation of the therapy to assess the degree to which the&#xD;
      virtual reality environments invoke a true fear response, comparing the 12 subjects with&#xD;
      social phobia to 12 age-matched, non-anxious control subjects. If feasible and effective,&#xD;
      these procedures would be used for a larger future study, and pilot data would be used for a&#xD;
      K-award, R21, or R01 grant application, including neuroimaging to learn more about the neural&#xD;
      circuitry involved in fear learning via virtual reality technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of simulated exposure&#xD;
      using virtual reality environments in treatment of social anxiety in youth ages 13-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the use of this technology will be feasible, evidenced by 75%&#xD;
      completion of the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To examine the degree to which virtual reality environments invoke arousal&#xD;
      consistent with anxiety, and test the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of&#xD;
      psychophysiological assessment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that subjects will exhibit elevated arousal during virtual&#xD;
      reality-assisted exposures, evidenced by increased skin conductance, heart rate, and startle&#xD;
      response, and expect the procedures to be feasible and acceptable as evidenced by high&#xD;
      completion and low drop out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of simulated exposure using virtual reality&#xD;
      environments in reducing symptoms of social anxiety and related functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that subjects will exhibit a decrease in anxiety evidenced by&#xD;
      reduction in Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule Clinician Severity Rating ≤ 4 and&#xD;
      improvement in global functioning evidenced by Clinical Global Impression- Improvement rating&#xD;
      ≤ 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: 12 adolescents and young adults (ages 13- 23) with social anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (cognitive behavioral therapy + virtual reality), and 12 age-matched comparison subjects&#xD;
      (Controls) will be recruited for participation in this pilot feasibility study. Subjects on&#xD;
      psychiatric medication must be on a stable dose for at least 2 months prior to study&#xD;
      participation and remain symptomatic to the level identified for inclusion in the cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy + virtual reality group (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule Clinician&#xD;
      Severity Rating ≥ 4). Controls must not meet criteria for any anxiety disorder. Control&#xD;
      subjects will not complete the intervention, but will participate solely in the initial&#xD;
      virtual reality arousal test and the fear extinction paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment measures: Clinician administered measures include the Anxiety Disorder Interview&#xD;
      Schedule for DSM 5 to determine initial diagnostic status. The Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
      Scale (CGI) will assess overall symptom severity and improvement. Self-report measures&#xD;
      include the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders and the World Health Organization&#xD;
      Disability Scale-12 assessment of global functioning. Subjects in the virtual reality +&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy group will complete these measures at pre-treatment, at&#xD;
      post-treatment, and at 3 month follow up. Controls will complete these measures at only one&#xD;
      time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual Reality technology: virtual reality simulation allows subjects wearing a head-mounted&#xD;
      display to view computer-generated 3-D imagery of a variety of social environments which&#xD;
      evoke distress in individuals diagnosed with social anxiety. Subjects report on distress&#xD;
      levels throughout the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Intervention: The manualized cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
      intervention used in this study will be a modified version of the Unified Protocol for&#xD;
      Emotional Disorders in Youth (UP-Y), which is a modular cognitive behavioral therapy protocol&#xD;
      for anxiety disorders and depression with demonstrated efficacy in youth. The modular&#xD;
      approach allows for patient engagement in exposure therapy at earliest readiness, and also&#xD;
      allows for the structured implementation of other cognitive behavioral therapy components.&#xD;
      The 10-session intervention includes psychoeducation about anxiety disorders and their&#xD;
      treatment (1 session), emotion awareness and regulation (2 sessions), exposure therapy using&#xD;
      virtual reality environments (6 sessions), and review and relapse prevention (1 session). All&#xD;
      treatment sessions will be videotaped to ensure fidelity to treatment manual and modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychophysiological measures: The Biopac system will measure physiological arousal through&#xD;
      measures of skin conductance, heart rate, heart rate variability, and startle response (via&#xD;
      eye blink reflex). Each of the tests involved in collection of biological measures is a&#xD;
      standard, non-painful and non-invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear Conditioning &amp; Extinction Paradigm: Subjects will participate in a laboratory test of&#xD;
      extinction training during their initial assessment in order to establish extinction learning&#xD;
      as a potential predictive marker of treatment outcome. Subjects will be exposed to two shapes&#xD;
      on a computer screen, one shape (conditioned stimulus; CS+) will be paired with an aversive&#xD;
      stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) on 38% of the trials, whereas the other shape will never be&#xD;
      paired with aversive stimulus (conditioned stimulus-). Later, they will undergo extinction&#xD;
      training in which the two conditioned stimuli will be repeatedly presented without the&#xD;
      unconditioned stimulus. Extinction will be measured as the difference score of skin&#xD;
      conductance response to the conditioned stimulus+ and conditioned stimulus-.&#xD;
