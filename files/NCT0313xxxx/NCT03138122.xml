      A random sample a random sample of half of all men born in 1943 and living in the city of&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Sweden, have been investigated in 1993 at 50 years of age and will be followed&#xD;
      continuously with repeated re-examinations and follow-up concerning mortality and&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In January 1993 a random sample of half of all men born in 1943 and living in the city of&#xD;
      Gothenburg, Sweden, was selected and invited to participate a longitudinal observational&#xD;
      cohort study. Out of 1463 invited men, 798 (54.5%) accepted the invitation and were examined&#xD;
      for 1st time between February 1993 and June 1994. All participants, at 50 years of age,&#xD;
      underwent a physical examination including anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and&#xD;
      ECG. Several questionaires about previous diseases, life style, physical stress, family&#xD;
      history, medications, symptoms and psychosocial factors were included. Blood samples were&#xD;
      drawn from an antecubital vein after a nights fast. Basal laboratory analysis were performed.&#xD;
      In addition several samples of whole blood, serum and plasma were stored in a freezer (-80○&#xD;
      Celsius) for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, at 60 years of age, a 2nd examination was performed with similar methodology and&#xD;
      examination´s. At this time 655 of the original 798 men participated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3rd examination was performed between May 2014 and December 2014. In addition to physical&#xD;
      examinations, questionnaires and laboratory analysis an echocardiographic examination, a&#xD;
      sleep recording, screening for atrial fibrillation with thumb-EKG and investigation with&#xD;
      Arteriography was added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic examinations were performed by experienced cardiologist in accordance with&#xD;
      clinical routine using ultrasound system (Vivid 7 Dimension, GE Medical systems, Horten,&#xD;
      Norway), together with commercially available analysis software (GE Vingmed Ultrasound&#xD;
      EchoPAC PC, General Electric Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and in agreement with ESC&#xD;
      guideline for echocardiography EAE recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep recording was conducted for one night in the patients home using Apnélink, Apnélink&#xD;
      plus or Apnélink air. All participants also answered the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and&#xD;
      the functional outcome of sleep questionnaire (FOSQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for atrial fibrillation were performed using a thumb-ECG (Zenicor Medical System,&#xD;
      Sweden), during a two week-period immediately after the physical examination. ECG was&#xD;
      registered by the participants at their home, by placing their thumbs on two electrodes for&#xD;
      30 seconds two times a day, one time in the morning and one in the evening, and also&#xD;
      additionally in case they experience any symptoms such as dizziness or palpitations, in a&#xD;
      duration of a 2-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sweden, all hospital admissions since 1978 are registered in the National Patient Register&#xD;
      (NPR) and classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 8 until&#xD;
      1986; ICD 9 until 1996, ICD 10 since 1997 and continuing). At each examination, information&#xD;
      about hospitalizations, medication and morbidity was obtained. During follow-up, death&#xD;
      certificates, autopsy reports, and medical records were obtained and studied for all&#xD;
      participants. Follow-up will be continues for each of the original 798 participants until&#xD;
      death. New examinations will be performed every 5-10 years during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints that are registered include: death, cause of death, myocardial infarction, ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease, heart failure with reduced, mid-range and preserved ejection fraction, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, diabetes mellitus, deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, any cancer, fractures and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocols was approved by&#xD;
      the Ethical Committee of Gothenburg (DNR 157-93 in 1993, DNR: 67-03, in 2003 and DNR 649-13&#xD;
      in 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular&#xD;
           diseases in a random sample from the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study secular trends in cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases by&#xD;
           comparing this cohort of men born in 1943 to other cohorts of men born in 1913, 1923,&#xD;
           1933, 1953 and 1963 living in the same geographic area and investigated using the same&#xD;
           methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study risk factors for various cardiovascular diseases in a longitudinal cohort&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In 2016 all men who participated in the 2014 examiniation was invited to a cognitive&#xD;
           screening. In total 333 of these men particpated in the screening which included the&#xD;
           following tests: Immediate and Delayed Text Recall, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT),&#xD;
           reduced version of The Boston Naming Test, The Clox and Cube Test, The Token Test,&#xD;
           Stroop III, Ray-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), F-A-S verbal fluency test.&#xD;
           Parallel Serial Mental Operations (PaSMO), and Trailmaking A.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An additional aim was then added:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study risk factors for dementia / cognitive impairment&#xD;
