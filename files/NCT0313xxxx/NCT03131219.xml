    <measure>Proportion Of Complement Inhibitor Treatment-naïve Participants With Complete Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Complete TMA response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period is a composite outcome measure that required normalization of hematological parameters (platelet count and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) and improvement in kidney function (≥25% reduction in serum creatinine from baseline); for participants on dialysis, baseline was established at least 6 days after the end of dialysis. Participants had to meet these criteria for 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. To be considered a responder during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, the latest time point a participant could first meet the response criteria was 28 days before the Week 26 (Day 183) assessment. Formal statistical comparison analyses were not planned for this study. Proportion based on the responders among treated participants. Confidence interval (CI) based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper Pearson method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time To Complete TMA Response In Complement Inhibitor Treatment-naïve Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through at least Week 52 and up to Week 111</time_frame>
    <description>Participants that did not have a response were censored at the date of last visit or study discontinuation at the time when the analysis was performed. The time to complete TMA Response is reported in days. The time of the event of a confirmed complete TMA response was considered the first time point at which all the criteria for complete TMA response were met. Participants had to meet all complete TMA response criteria at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Who Do Not Require Dialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>For participants requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to ALXN1210 treatment initiation, the number of participants no longer requiring dialysis is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion Of Complement Inhibitor Treatment-naïve Participants With Complete TMA Response Through All Available Follow-Up</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 52 weeks and up to a maximum of 111 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants considered responders, along with a 2-sided 95% CI based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper Pearson method through all available follow-up (up to Week 111), is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observed Value And Change From Baseline In eGFR At Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Kidney function evaluated by eGFR was summarized at baseline and the Week 26 time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value, as well as the change from baseline. The baseline value was defined as the average of the values from the assessments performed prior to the first study drug infusion (these could include results from Screening and the Day 1 visit). A value of 10 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for eGFR was imputed for participants requiring dialysis for acute kidney injury. The observed value and change from baseline are reported in mL/min/1.73 m^2. An increase indicated improvement in kidney function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants With Change From Baseline In CKD Stage At Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The CKD stage is presented as the change from baseline in the participants that Improved (excluding those with Stage 1 [normal renal function] at baseline as they cannot improve), Worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and Stayed the Same, compared to the CKD stage at baseline. Baseline was derived based on the last available eGFR before starting treatment. Stage 5 was considered the worst category, while Stage 1 was considered the best category. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion, based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method, was provided for each category. The CKD stage was classified based on the National Kidney Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease Stage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In Platelet Count At Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The hematologic TMA parameter of platelet count was summarized at baseline and at Week 26 using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the change from baseline. Results are reported in platelets*10^9/liter (L) blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In LDH At Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The hematologic TMA parameter of serum LDH was summarized at baseline and at Week 26 using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the change from baseline. Results are reported in units (U)/L serum.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In Hemoglobin At Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The hematologic TMA parameter of hemoglobin level was summarized at baseline and at Week 26 using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the change from baseline. Results are reported in grams (g)/L blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion Of Complement Inhibitor Treatment-naïve Participants With An Increase From Baseline In Hemoglobin ≥20 g/L Through Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with an increase from baseline in hemoglobin ≥20 g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between, was assessed through Week 26 and is presented as the proportion of responders, along with a 2-sided 95% CI. The 95% CIs are based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method. To be considered a responder during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, the latest time point a participant could first meet the response criteria was 28 days before the Week 26 (Day 183) assessment (components of the response maintained for at least 28 days).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life As Measured By The Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Version 4 Questionnaire (Participants ≥5 Years Of Age) At Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed in participants &gt;5 years of age by the Pediatric FACIT-Fatigue Questionnaire (reported by participants who were ≥8 years of age at the time of enrollment; caregiver reported or caregiver assistance for participants who were 5 to &lt;8 years of age at the time of enrollment). The FACIT Fatigue data were summarized at baseline and each post baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. The FACIT Fatigue Version 4 questionnaire at baseline and each post-infusion time point was scored using standard scoring algorithms. The score ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. An increase in score indicated an improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Proportion Of Complement Inhibitor Treatment-naïve Participants With Complete Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) Response</title>
        <description>Complete TMA response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period is a composite outcome measure that required normalization of hematological parameters (platelet count and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) and improvement in kidney function (≥25% reduction in serum creatinine from baseline); for participants on dialysis, baseline was established at least 6 days after the end of dialysis. Participants had to meet these criteria for 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. To be considered a responder during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, the latest time point a participant could first meet the response criteria was 28 days before the Week 26 (Day 183) assessment. Formal statistical comparison analyses were not planned for this study. Proportion based on the responders among treated participants. Confidence interval (CI) based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Observed Value And Change From Baseline In eGFR At Week 26</title>
        <description>Kidney function evaluated by eGFR was summarized at baseline and the Week 26 time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value, as well as the change from baseline. The baseline value was defined as the average of the values from the assessments performed prior to the first study drug infusion (these could include results from Screening and the Day 1 visit). A value of 10 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for eGFR was imputed for participants requiring dialysis for acute kidney injury. The observed value and change from baseline are reported in mL/min/1.73 m^2. An increase indicated improvement in kidney function.</description>

        <title>Participants With Change From Baseline In CKD Stage At Week 26</title>
        <description>The CKD stage is presented as the change from baseline in the participants that Improved (excluding those with Stage 1 [normal renal function] at baseline as they cannot improve), Worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and Stayed the Same, compared to the CKD stage at baseline. Baseline was derived based on the last available eGFR before starting treatment. Stage 5 was considered the worst category, while Stage 1 was considered the best category. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion, based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method, was provided for each category.

        <title>Proportion Of Complement Inhibitor Treatment-naïve Participants With An Increase From Baseline In Hemoglobin ≥20 g/L Through Week 26</title>
        <description>The proportion of participants with an increase from baseline in hemoglobin ≥20 g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between, was assessed through Week 26 and is presented as the proportion of responders, along with a 2-sided 95% CI. The 95% CIs are based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method. To be considered a responder during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, the latest time point a participant could first meet the response criteria was 28 days before the Week 26 (Day 183) assessment (components of the response maintained for at least 28 days).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life As Measured By The Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Version 4 Questionnaire (Participants ≥5 Years Of Age) At Week 26</title>
        <description>Quality of life was assessed in participants &gt;5 years of age by the Pediatric FACIT-Fatigue Questionnaire (reported by participants who were ≥8 years of age at the time of enrollment; caregiver reported or caregiver assistance for participants who were 5 to &lt;8 years of age at the time of enrollment). The FACIT Fatigue data were summarized at baseline and each post baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. The FACIT Fatigue Version 4 questionnaire at baseline and each post-infusion time point was scored using standard scoring algorithms. The score ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. An increase in score indicated an improvement in quality of life.</description>
