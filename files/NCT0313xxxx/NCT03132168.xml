    <textblock>
      In this study, post-operative delirium will be measured in patients undergoing surgery for&#xD;
      bladder resection, and associated microRNA biomarkers will be evaluated in patients&#xD;
      considered delirious and non-delirious after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With voluntary participation, this study requires participants to complete a&#xD;
      self-administered cognitive evaluation (SAGE) before surgery to assess baseline cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and early dementia; vital signs will be documented prior to surgery. During&#xD;
      surgery, participants will receive a standardized general anesthesia regimen as described in&#xD;
      the protocol. Several parameters will be measured during surgery, including bispectral&#xD;
      monitoring to measure processed EEG. After surgery, fitness for cognitive evaluation will be&#xD;
      determined by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scale, and then emergence delirium&#xD;
      will be assessed using the CAM-ICU scale. Fitness for discharge from PACU will be determined&#xD;
      by an Aldrete score of 9 or more. Postoperative pain will be assessed using the 11-point&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11). Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) level will also be&#xD;
      documented. Postoperative Delirium (POD) assessment will be achieved by administering the&#xD;
      memorial delirium assessment scale (MDAS) twice a day starting on day 1 through day 3&#xD;
      postoperatively. Pain NRS-11 score and PONV levels will also be documented at each visit. For&#xD;
      microRNA testing, blood probes will be collected in 5mL purple top tube at surgical&#xD;
      preadmission and post-surgery days one, two and three. Risks associated with participating in&#xD;
      this study include normal risk associated with having surgery and general anesthesia; no&#xD;
      greater than minimal risk is associated with blood collection. For the participant, there are&#xD;
      no immediate anticipated benefits for participating in this study. The importance of the&#xD;
      knowledge that is expected to result includes lower post-operative complications as a result&#xD;
      of post-operative delirium, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stay.&#xD;
