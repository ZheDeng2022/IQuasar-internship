    <textblock>
      The study aims to test if combination of quizartinib (AC220) and omacetaxine mepesuccinate&#xD;
      (OM, also known as homoharringtonine) results in durable composite complete remission (CRc)&#xD;
      in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      carrying FLT3-ITD (Fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 - Internal Tandem Duplication).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The type of AML being studied in this clinical trial is known as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3&#xD;
      (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) positive AML. This type of AML has an alteration (or&#xD;
      mutation) in genes, which may associated with high risk of relapse after conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy and hence an extremely poor clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second generation FLT3 inhibitors including quizartinib are effective in inducing remission.&#xD;
      However, their effects are only transient. There is an unmet clinic need to enhance their&#xD;
      effectiveness, hence clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II single-arm open-labeled study. A total of 40 eligible patients with&#xD;
      consent will be recruited, including 20 patients with newly diagnosed and 20 with R/R&#xD;
      FLT3-ITD AML. For newly diagnosed patients, diagnostic bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral&#xD;
      blood (PB) will be evaluated by next generation sequencing (NGS) based on myeloid panel that&#xD;
      comprises 54 myeloid genes as well as their in vitro response to QUIZOM based on an in-house&#xD;
      platform that was established in our laboratory. FLT3-ITD allelic burden will also be&#xD;
      evaluated. For R/R patients, FLT3-ITD status and allelic burden will be confirmed before&#xD;
      QUIZOM treatment. Both groups of patients will receive quizartinib 30 mg daily continuously&#xD;
      and OM 1.5 mg/m2 daily for 7 days every 28 days until progression or allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT). BM examination will be performed on day 21 to document&#xD;
      morphological response and FLT3-ITD allelic burden. At leukemia progression, BM and/or PB&#xD;
      samples will be collected and their in vitro response to QUIZOM examined. The tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      domain (TKD) of FLT3 will also be sequenced and FLT3-ITD allelic burden will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive QUIZOM comprising quizartinib and OM. The starting dose of&#xD;
      quizartinib will be 30 mg/day unless the patients are taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor in&#xD;
      which case the dose will be 20 mg /day. Quizartinib should be taken continuously throughout&#xD;
      the treatment period unless there is no evidence of response at first assessment on day 21 or&#xD;
      progressive disease at any time during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OM will be given at 1.5 mg/m2/day (maximum dose 3 mg) for 7 days (concurrently with&#xD;
      quizartinib) in 28-day cycle. QUIZOM will be continued until leukemia progression or&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT. Thereafter, patients will be followed up and information about disease&#xD;
      status and survival will be collected.&#xD;
