    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and tolerability of ABX-1431 in patients with central&#xD;
      pain when added on to background pain therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of this study, each participant will take a daily dose of 20 mg of ABX-1431&#xD;
      or a matching placebo for approximately 7 to 9 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, randomized, crossover study of&#xD;
      ABX-1431 HCl as add-on therapy in the treatment of central neuropathic pain.The efficacy of&#xD;
      ABX-1431 will also be assessed by the change in pain intensity scores using a numerical&#xD;
      rating scale (NRS-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a screening visit for enrollment criteria. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be treated with daily medication for 7 to 9 weeks, which will include some treatment with&#xD;
      placebo and some treatment with ABX-1431 HCl. Patients will use a web based application to&#xD;
      record their daily average pain using a numerical rating scale (NRS-11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll up to 32 patients with chronic central pain due to one of the four&#xD;
      following diagnostic groups: Neuromyeliltis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), longitudinally&#xD;
      extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Transverse Myelitis (TM).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic central pain, present for at least 3 months due to one of the&#xD;
             four following diagnostic groups: NMOSD, LETM, MS, or TM.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has a diagnosis of NMOSD with anti-AQP4 IgG or without AQP4-IgG as&#xD;
                  defined by the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
                  the screening visit (IPND 2015)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with idiopathic, LETM, comprising an intramedullary MRI lesion or&#xD;
                  continuous segments of spinal cord atrophy with a clinical history consistent&#xD;
                  with acute myelitis, and with chronic pain syndrome consistent with the lesion&#xD;
                  neuroanatomy may be enrolled. These LETM patients must also demonstrate evidence&#xD;
                  of acute, inflammatory myelopathy in the past (e.g. clinically acute symptomatic&#xD;
                  myelitis plus inflammatory CSF analysis (e.g. elevated WBC and IgG index) or&#xD;
                  imaging consistent with inflammatory myelopathy). LETM must be diagnosed at least&#xD;
                  3 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient with MS defined by McDonald criteria [1] or Poser criteria [2] at least 3&#xD;
                  months prior to screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with post-infectious, autoimmune or idiopathic TM diagnosed by a&#xD;
                  neurologist at least 6 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's chronic pain must be neuropathic in nature, and anatomically plausible based&#xD;
             on underlying neuropathology. If patient has an additional source of pain (e.g.,&#xD;
             vascular ischemic pain, transient spasm associated pain, headache, chronic lower back&#xD;
             pain or concomitant osteoarthritic joint pain), the central neuropathic pain must be&#xD;
             clearly identifiable by the patient, as assessed by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Investigator determines that the patient can enter daily NRS-11 pain intensity&#xD;
             data on an internet connected device such as a smart phone, tablet computer or desktop&#xD;
             computer with reliable internet service. Patients that do not have a device will be&#xD;
             supplied one for the duration of the study. At the direction of the patient, the&#xD;
             patient's caregivers may enter the pain intensity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At Visit 2, patient's pain is ≥ 4 on the NRS-11 pain intensity scale, on at least 4 of&#xD;
             the 7 days preceding randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for relapse prevention of NMOSD or TM&#xD;
             or taking disease modifying therapy (DMT) for MS must be on a stable maintenance&#xD;
             dose(s) of IST or DMT for 30 days prior to screening and must be expected to maintain&#xD;
             the IST or DMT regimenduring this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking oral corticosteroids must be on a stable dose of medication for at&#xD;
             least one week before study start and must be expected to remain on a stable dose&#xD;
             during this study. The dose may be no more than prednisolone 20 mg daily or&#xD;
             equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients taking antibody therapy for NMOSD relapse prevention (e.g. rituximab,&#xD;
             eculizumab or tocilizumab), therapy must be discontinued at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening and patients must be willing to refrain from use during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking daily neuropathic or central pain medications (e.g. gabapentin,&#xD;
             amitriptyline, lamotrigine) must be on a stable dose of medication for 30 days before&#xD;
             study start and must be expected to remain on a stable dose during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test [serum&#xD;
             human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)]. They must practice a highly effective, reliable&#xD;
             and medically approved contraceptive regimen during the study (i.e. theoretical&#xD;
             failure rate less than 1% per year including oral or parenteral hormonal&#xD;
             contraception, Nuvaring, intrauterine device (IUD) or male condom plus spermicide).&#xD;
             Post-menopausal women may enter this study. Post-menopausal women are defined as those&#xD;
             without menses in the past 12 months, and with a serum follicle stimulating hormone&#xD;
             (FSH) in the post-menopausal range. Women who are surgically sterile may enter this&#xD;
             study with historical documentation of surgical procedure and a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients must be willing to use a condom with sexual partners during this study&#xD;
             until the poststudy visit. Male patients must be willing to abstain from sperm&#xD;
             donation for 3 months after the completion of this study.&#xD;
