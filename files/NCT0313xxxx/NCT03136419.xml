      Microbiota and innate immunity in pouchitis: predisposing factors and modulation of the&#xD;
      inflammation with probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 20-25% of ulcerative colitis patients undergo restorative proctocolectomy with ileal&#xD;
      pouch anal anastomosis. Pouchitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disease that may occur in&#xD;
      ileal pouches. In our recent studies, we showed altered microbiota and innate immunity&#xD;
      relationships in pouchitis. We plain to perform a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      probiotic therapy vs placebo starting at the time of ileostomy closure to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of microbiota that colonizes the pouch mucosa in the pathogenesis of pouchits, to determine&#xD;
      how expression and activation status of the innate immunity system in different cell types&#xD;
      and anatomical districts of pouch mucosa relate to microbiota population and follow-up the&#xD;
      clinical outcome of anal pouches in light of microbiota-innate immune system interplay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will include three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. analysis of the intestinal microbiota with High Throughput Sequencing Unit and anaerobes&#xD;
           cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. characterization of innate immunity with TLR, NLR, nicotinic receptors and LPMC analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assessment of microbiota and innate immune system in the ileal pouch before ileostomy&#xD;
           closure, 2 months after ileostomy closure and after 1 year follow up.&#xD;

      Study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypothesis is that a disruption of gut microbiota homeostasis, either spontaneous&#xD;
      or caused by the deregulation of the innate immunity machinery within the pouch mucosa,&#xD;
      contributes to the onset of chronic/relapsing pouchitis. Taking into account that bacterial&#xD;
      colonization of the pouch mucosa can be ideally studied since its generation, this can be&#xD;
      considered as an ideal model to study the interplay between gut microbiota and innate immune&#xD;
      system. Therefore, the goal of this Research Unit is to establish how dysbiosis and innate&#xD;
      immunity machinery dysfunction are established and how this disfunction contributes to the&#xD;
      onset and maintenance of pouchitis. To address these relevant pathophysiological issues in&#xD;
      light of their therapeutic implications, we plan to perform a randomized double-blind study&#xD;
      probiotics vs placebo in patients who will undergo colectomy and subsequent ileal pouch-anal&#xD;
      anastomosis to enrolling the patients at the time of ileostomy colure to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate composition and pathogenic properties of the microbiota that colonizes the&#xD;
           pouch mucosa after ileostomy closure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine how expression and activation status of the innate immunity system in&#xD;
           different cell types and anatomical districts of pouch mucosa relate to ileostomy&#xD;
           closure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. follow-up the clinical outcome of anal pouches in light of microbiota-innate immune&#xD;
           system interplay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design In a two year period we calculated to enrol at least 32 patients who will be&#xD;
      randomized at ileostomy closure in a group receiving placebo (16 patients) and in a group&#xD;
      receiving lactobacillus casei GD oral supplementation for 8 weeks (16 patients). Mucosa&#xD;
      samples will be harvested at ileostomy closure and at pouch endoscopy at 8 weeks and at 12&#xD;
      months.We will consider eligible candidates all patients with UC who will undergo restorative&#xD;
      proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and that will attend our outpatient's&#xD;
      clinic for routine endoscopic and clinical follow-up. Patients with cuffitis (inflammation of&#xD;
      the rectal mucosa remnant) or Crohn's disease of the pouch (with perianal fistulae or with&#xD;
      inflammation of the afferent ileal limb), as well as patients who will have received&#xD;
      antibiotic or probiotic therapy during the previous 30 days will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Patients with PDAI&gt;7 will be considered as overt pouchitis. The protocol will comply with the&#xD;
      principles of the amended Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be provided with detailed information about the study aims and methodology&#xD;
      and will be asked to give written, informed consent prior to enrolment. During this period&#xD;
      patients will be asked to undergo pouch endoscopy with mucosal biopsies, faecal and blood&#xD;
      sampling at three following time: a) before ileostomy closure, b) 2 months after ileostomy&#xD;
      closure, c) 12 months after ileostomy closure (or before, in case of overt pouchitis). Based&#xD;
      on clinical, endoscopic and histological criteria and PDAI we will assess the disease&#xD;
      severity [5]. Based on histological and endoscopic acute inflammation as well as clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, patients with a total PDAI &gt;7 will be classified as having acute pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy of the pouch will be performed without sedation. The afferent loop, the pouch will&#xD;
      be carefully examined and biopsy sampling will be performed: two samples for microbiota&#xD;
      characterization, two for conventional histology, four for molecular biology and&#xD;
      cytofluorimetric analysis. Biopsies will be handled and stored accordingly to the different&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiota assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize bacteria adherent to the pouch mucosa biopsies from the ileal pouch will be&#xD;
      either immediately gently washed to remove loosely adherent microbes and then frozen in&#xD;
      liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA extraction, or placed in thioglycolate medium to preserve&#xD;
      anaerobic microbes for subsequent cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative abundance of bacterial phyla in faecal specimens will be estimated by sequencing the&#xD;
      PCR amplicons targeting 16S rRNA gene for the DNA samples extracted from each faecal&#xD;
      specimen. PCR will be performed using the primer set (784F:&#xD;
      5&amp;#8242;-AGGATTAGATACCCTGGTA-3&amp;#8242; and 1061R: 5&amp;#8242;-CRRCACGAGCTGACGAC-3&amp;#8242;) that&#xD;
      targets the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA genes [38]. To amplify the targeted region, 1 μl of&#xD;
      extracted DNA will serve as template in 50-μl reactions using Prime STAR HS premix (Takara&#xD;
      Bio Inc., Japan). Products of the two reconditioning PCR reactions per sample will be&#xD;
      combined and purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen). The amplified PCR&#xD;
      products will be used as a template for pyrosequencing with the GS Junior platform (454 Life&#xD;
      Sciences). Pyrosequencing will be performed by following the manufacturer's instruction using&#xD;
      MID tags. We expect to obtain about 15,000 sequencies for each sample, on the average. The&#xD;
      obtained data will be subjected to a data analysis performed by computational tools.&#xD;
      Bacterial rRNA typing will be performed by BLASTN search against the comprehensive rRNA&#xD;
      database &quot;silva&quot; release 94 [39] using a threshold of E-value &lt;1E-40. All the bacterial&#xD;
      species obtained from each faecal sample will be classified into their phylogenetic groups&#xD;
      and the proportion of different phyla will be estimated. The estimation of operational&#xD;
      taxonomic unit (OTU) will be performed by the program ESPRIT using default settings [40].&#xD;
&#xD;
      For microbiological cultures biopsies immediately placed in thioglycolate medium (to protect&#xD;
      anaerobic microbes from oxygen exposure) will be further manipulated in an anaerobic hood&#xD;
      filled with C02:H2 (95:5) atmosphere. Biopsies will be washed in sterile dye-gassed saline&#xD;
      solution supplemented with 0.016% dithioerythritol to remove the mucus and following cell&#xD;
      hypotonic lysis in sterile water, seeded in proper agar plates to evaluate the superficial&#xD;
      microflora. [35]. Samples will be seeded on non-selective (Brain Heart Infusion Agar, BHA)&#xD;
      and selective media for Enterobacteriacae spp (MacConkey agar) and Lactobacillus spp (Rogosa&#xD;
      SL agar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BHA and MacConkey agar plates will be cultured in anaerobic and aerobic conditions (24 and 72&#xD;
      hrs, respectively), while Rogosa SL Agar plates will be only cultured in anaerobic conditions&#xD;
      (72 hrs) at 37°C. Colonies will be counted, grouped on the basis of morphological appearance&#xD;
      and subjected to morphological analysis by Gram staining (Biolife S.r.l.). Then microbes will&#xD;
      be subjected to molecular characterization, performed by sequencing of PCR amplicons of 16S&#xD;
      rRNA using an &quot;Abi Prism TM Big Dye TM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit&quot; [24].&#xD;
      Isolates will be further characterized according to their pathogenicity potential (i.e.&#xD;
      toxigenic profile and antibiotic resistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal innate immune environment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the inflammatory network in the pouch mucosa will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. quantification of cytokines [IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF- , TGF ß, IL-10 and IL-4 and chemokines&#xD;
           [MCP1,] level by Bio-Plex cytokine immunoassay. One biopsy will be homogenated and the&#xD;
           clear supernatant used for the contemporary quantification of multiple cytokines and&#xD;
           chemokines by custom-designed assays;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. analysis of TLRs network (mRNA quantification and protein distribution) by quantitative&#xD;
           RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. assessment of activation status of macrophages, dendritic cells, infiltrating&#xD;
           lymphocytes evaluating surface markers (i.e.) and intracellular cytokines pattern (i.e.&#xD;
           TNF , IFN , IL4, IL10) by cytofluorimetric analysis. Two biopsies will be subjected to&#xD;
           gentle enzymatic digestion and then stained with properly labelled antibodies directed&#xD;
           against surface antigens or intracellular cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucosal anti-microbial activity. To characterize the anti-bacterial peptide-network in the&#xD;
      pouch mucosa responsible to shape-up the adherent microbiota we will a) determine the&#xD;
      anti-microbial properties of mucosal extracts by performing in vitro anti-bacterial toxicity&#xD;
      assay [37]; b) quantify epithelial and leucocytes-derived anti-microbial defensins (such as&#xD;
      Def2, Def3; DEFA5; DEFA6) by quantitative RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For routine histological examination two biopsies will be fixed in 4% PFA for 24 Hrs, then&#xD;
      dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, and sections (5 μm thick) will be cut and subjected to&#xD;
      standard haematoxylin/eosin (H&amp;E) stain. To quantify inflammatory severity will be used the&#xD;
      Floren et al. score [41].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic and intestinal inflammation assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic and local inflammatory state will be assessed at each experimental timeline by:&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count (WBC), platelets blood count&#xD;
      (PLT), CRP and fecal lactoferrin, respectively. ESR will be measured by the Westergren&#xD;
      method. CRP will be detected by immuno-nephelometry (normal: &lt;6 mg/l; pathological &gt;6mg/l).&#xD;
      Total protein and albumin will be assessed with the biuret method. WBC, platelets counts and&#xD;
      haemoglobinaemia will be obtained with standard full blood cell count. Fecal lactoferrin will&#xD;
      be dosed by an ELISA test that uses rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for human&#xD;
      lactoferrin on frozen stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using Windows Microsoft Excel and a Statistica 7.1&#xD;
      (Statsoft, Inc.) software. Continuous data will be expressed as median (range); dichotomic&#xD;
      data will be expressed as frequency and proportion. Non-parametric tests will be used.&#xD;
      Correlation between bacteria strains and inflammatory parameters will be calculated with&#xD;
      Spearman test to evaluate the etio-pathogenetic role of each strain. Relevant correlation&#xD;
      coefficient will be not inferior to 0.50 and, setting a two-tails statistic significance&#xD;
      level at 0.05 and power at 0.20, the consequent sample size will have to be at least of 29&#xD;
      patients. Comparison between pouchitis and healthy pouch will be performed with Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test. Set a level of statistical significance at 0.05 and a power at 0.20 the consequent&#xD;
      sample size required for comparison will be 16 patients for each group. In conclusion at&#xD;
      least 32 patients will be enrolled in this study. Statistical significance will be set at&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
