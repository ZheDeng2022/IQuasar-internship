    <textblock>
      High neonatal mortality rates accounts for a substantial early loss of lives in Malawi; and&#xD;
      has thus been a hindrance for Malawi to eradicate child deaths. From 2000 to 2011, Malawi&#xD;
      achieved an overall reduction of 23% in under-five child mortality. The reduction was more&#xD;
      substantial between the second and the fifth year of life, being 28%. However, in the&#xD;
      neonatal period the reduction was half, at 14%. Neonatal deaths in developing countries are&#xD;
      due to prematurity or low birth weight, neonatal infections, birth trauma related conditions&#xD;
      and congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being of low birth weight increases the risk of death four fold in the neonatal period. Even&#xD;
      when low birth weight infants survive, their poorly developed immune function exposes them to&#xD;
      increased morbidity in early life. Maternal nutrition represents by far the greatest&#xD;
      influence among pregnancy environmental on birth weight in low income countries. There is&#xD;
      strong evidence that health and dietary counselling is effective in improving child nutrition&#xD;
      outcomes. Thus we propose to test the effectiveness in improving birth weight by a low cost&#xD;
      intervention, community based health and nutrition counselling delivered to mothers during&#xD;
      pregnancy in Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in the Malawian context offering individualized dietetic counselling could&#xD;
      be impeded by the healthcare workforce short fall. Currently the health workforce does not&#xD;
      include dieticians . The use of lay health workers (LHW) has been identified as one of the&#xD;
      effective strategies to meet the health workforce shortage challenges in low resource&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is on this basis that a study was planned, aimed at developing lay health worker delivered&#xD;
      community based nutrition counselling to mothers during pregnancy and measuring its&#xD;
      effectiveness in improving birth weight in the Malawian context. The study was comprised of&#xD;
      an initial i) formative study, followed by ii) a cross-sectional survey. Findings of these&#xD;
      two sub-studies were utilized to develop a nutrition counselling intervention. Finally iii) a&#xD;
      cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT) aimed at measuring the effect of the intervention&#xD;
      on birth size (weight, length, arm and abdominal circumferences) will now be conducted which&#xD;
      is being elaborated in this protocol.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Three hundred pregnant women, at ≥12 weeks but ≤ 16 weeks of gestation, will be recruited&#xD;
      from Nankumba Traditional Authority (TA) area, in Mangochi district. They will be offered&#xD;
      community based dietary counselling aiming at improving dietary intake to meet their&#xD;
      nutritional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of study outcomes will be as follows: Infant birthweight will be collected at the&#xD;
      end of the study while as dietary intake (including dietary perceptions), anthropometric&#xD;
      status, and biochemical nutrition status will be assessed at enrollment, and two additional&#xD;
      time points before the end point.&#xD;

    <description>The dietary counseling will be delivered to mothers through group sessions (will include cooking demonstration) and home visits by lay health workers. The counseling will promote foods that are nutritious and locally available and general better food preparation practices. The choices of the foods to be promoted will be based on linear programming results from a preceding survey on dietary intake of pregnant women in the area as well as results of analysis of foods associated with infant birth size (same data). The goal in the linear programming was to find a model of food combinations among the most frequently consumed foods which better meets required intakes during pregnancy. Additionally, adherence to pregnancy iron supplements will also be promoted.</description>
