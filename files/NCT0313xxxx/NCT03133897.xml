  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current corticosteroid regimens for children hospitalized with asthma typically include a&#xD;
      5-day course of prednisone or prednisolone. However, these medications taste poorly and are&#xD;
      associated with vomiting and poor compliance. Outpatient evidence suggests that a 2-day&#xD;
      course of dexamethasone is as effective as a longer course of prednisone and prednisolone,&#xD;
      and better tolerated. Studies in hospitalized patients are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary objective is to determine the feasibility of a non-inferiority&#xD;
      trial, comparing 2 days of dexamethasone to 4 days of inpatient prednisone/prednisolone for&#xD;
      inpatient asthma treatment. The investigators also wish to determine the feasibility of 1)&#xD;
      enrolling patients upon admission to hospital, 2) asking patients and/or caregivers to&#xD;
      complete a symptom weekly for 4 weeks, 3) reassessing patients post hospital discharge, 4)&#xD;
      successfully completing phone follow up 4 weeks post hospital discharge, and 5) collecting&#xD;
      health utilization data post hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will inform a future multi-site trial comparing prednisone/prednisolone to&#xD;
      dexamethasone in inpatient asthma treatment. It has the potential of improving the delivery&#xD;
      of care in asthma, by improving compliance with a mainstay of treatment. It will also enhance&#xD;
      collaboration within Ontario pediatric hospitals, facilitating knowledge translation and&#xD;
      standardization of care across institutions.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Background Information Summary of the problem Asthma is the&#xD;
           most common childhood chronic disease, affecting over 15% of children between the ages&#xD;
           of 4 and 11 years. In 2004, asthma contributed to 10% and 8% of all Canadian hospital&#xD;
           admissions for children aged 0 to 4 years and 5 to 14 years, respectively. In Ontario,&#xD;
           the burden of illness caused by asthma is enormous, accounting for one third of&#xD;
           government expenditures for the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A key element for treating children with acute asthma exacerbations is the&#xD;
           administration of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids (CS) reduce the need for&#xD;
           hospitalization and the risk of relapse after initial treatment, and may also facilitate&#xD;
           an earlier discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While some hospitals already use a short course of dexamethasone for the inpatient&#xD;
           asthma treatment, there is no evidence to support this practice in the inpatient&#xD;
           population. Most current CS treatment regimens for the treatment of children&#xD;
           hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation consist of a 5-day course of prednisone or&#xD;
           prednisolone. However, prednisone and prednisolone are associated with poor taste and&#xD;
           significant vomiting, as well as poor compliance with the treatment course. The lifetime&#xD;
           prevalence of asthma in Canadian children has been estimated at 11% to 16% and asthma&#xD;
           exacerbations are the leading cause of hospitalization in children. At the Children's&#xD;
           Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), 215 children were admitted to the inpatient units&#xD;
           for asthma in 2015, representing 5.4% of the yearly medical admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Current corticosteroid standard of care for inpatient treatment of asthma CS are one of&#xD;
           the cornerstones of therapy for acute asthma. They should be administered as early as&#xD;
           possible in the Emergency Department (ED). Treatment with CS reduces the need for&#xD;
           hospitalization, decreases the risk of relapse post treatment, and leads to a shorter&#xD;
           length of stay. Current corticosteroid treatment regimens for the treatment of children&#xD;
           hospitalized with an asthma exacerbation typically consist of a 4-day course of&#xD;
           prednisone or prednisolone in addition to the dose of oral CS received in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dexamethasone vs prednisone/prednisolone treatment A recent meta-analysis has shown that&#xD;
           2 days of once daily dexamethasone is a least as effective as 5 days of prednisone for&#xD;
           preventing relapse in outpatient pediatric asthma. In addition, patients receiving&#xD;
           dexamethasone were significantly less likely to experience vomiting in the ED and even&#xD;
           after returning home. Preliminary cost-estimates suggest that dexamethasone may result&#xD;
           in at least a $3500 cost savings per 100 patients compared to traditional treatment with&#xD;
           prednisone or prednisolone. At CHEO, this would result in over $7000 in savings per&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compliance with corticosteroid treatment Prednisone is only available in Canada as a&#xD;
           tablet or compounded suspension, which limits use due to swallowing ability and&#xD;
           accessibility. When compared to dexamethasone, prednisolone is associated with poor&#xD;
           palatability, significant vomiting and poor compliance. Prednisone and prednisolone are&#xD;
           compounded with similar recipes, and therefore have a similar taste. Compliance with 5&#xD;
           days of prednisone has been estimated in one study to be as low as 64% for pediatric&#xD;
           asthma. As mentioned above, outpatient evidence shows that a 2-day course of&#xD;
           dexamethasone is as effective as a longer course of prednisone and prednisolone, and&#xD;
           better tolerated. However, as determined by a systematic review conducted by the&#xD;
           principal investigator of this current proposal (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016041766), studies&#xD;
           in hospitalized patients are lacking. Promisingly, a retrospective cohort study in&#xD;
           pediatric inpatients hospitalized with asthma has suggested that dexamethasone, when&#xD;
           compared to prednisone/prednisolone, may result in a shorter length of hospital stay and&#xD;
           reduced costs with no difference in number of transfers to intensive care or&#xD;
           readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety of dexamethasone Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with a long half-life,&#xD;
           therefore concerns have been raised regarding its potential for adrenal suppression.&#xD;
           However, a study of high-dose (~1.7 mg/kg) IM dexamethasone in acute asthma found no&#xD;
           significant difference in adrenal function at day 14 between single-dose dexamethasone&#xD;
           and 5 days of oral prednisone. The degree of adrenal suppression induced by&#xD;
           dexamethasone is likely comparable to that observed with intravenous methylprednisolone&#xD;
           or moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids. Children in our proposed study&#xD;
           will receive a cumulative dexamethasone dose of 1.2 mg/kg orally, significantly less&#xD;
           than used in the aforementioned study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Rationale Given the importance of CS in the treatment of asthma, the significant&#xD;
           decrease in relapse associated with their use, and the high prevalence of childhood&#xD;
           asthma, there is a need to determine whether a better tolerated and more palatable CS&#xD;
           can be used as first line therapy. Although outpatient data on this issue exists,&#xD;
           extrapolating treatment regimens from the outpatient population may not be appropriate&#xD;
           as hospitalized children represent a sicker group of patients than those discharged from&#xD;
           the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to determine whether dexamethasone is at least as effective of&#xD;
           prednisone/prednisolone in the treatment of inpatient asthma, the investigators propose&#xD;
           a feasibility study, as a first step in the development of a future multi-site trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to determine the feasibility of a non-inferiority trial, comparing 2&#xD;
      days of dexamethasone to 4 days of inpatient prednisone/prednisolone for inpatient asthma&#xD;
      treatment. Specifically, The investigators we will determine the feasibility of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enrolling patients upon admission to hospital, after they receive their first dose of&#xD;
           corticosteroid (CS) in the ED&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Asking patients and/or caregivers to complete a symptom diary weekly for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reassessing patients 7 days after hospital admission day&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Successfully completing phone follow up 4 weeks post hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Collecting health utilization data post hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 METHODOLOGY 3.1 Trial design A pragmatic randomized trial is proposed. Children presenting&#xD;
      to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) Emergency Department (ED) will receive&#xD;
      CS (typically prednisone/prednisolone 2mg/kg) as per standard of care outlined in the ED&#xD;
      pre-printed order and Nursing Medical Directive. . This practice differs from most other&#xD;
      pediatric EDs across the country where children typically receive dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg on&#xD;
      presentation to the ED. As there is significant outpatient evidence showing that&#xD;
      dexamethasone is non-inferior to prednisone for outpatient asthma treatment, it is possible&#xD;
      that the CHEO ED will have switched over to administering dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg to children&#xD;
      presenting with acute asthma exacerbation by the time this study is implemented. Blinding of&#xD;
      the participants and members of the health care team will not be feasible. Given that the&#xD;
      investigators are aiming to test the effectiveness of their intervention across routine&#xD;
      clinical practice, they elected to conduct a pragmatic trial. Since the palatability of the&#xD;
      CS is likely to affect compliance, masking the taste of the CS to ensure blinding would&#xD;
      decrease the ability to detect a difference in compliance due to taste. Moreover, given the&#xD;
      length of therapy for prednisone/prednisolone is longer than that of dexamethasone,&#xD;
      introducing placebo doses to ensure similar length of treatment would also potentially impact&#xD;
      compliance and undermine the investigators' ability to detect a difference between groups.&#xD;
      Investigators, data analysts, and research assistant completing patient assessment at the&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be blinded to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant will review the list of admissions for the previous 12 hours, on a twice&#xD;
      daily basis, from Monday to Friday. The research assistant will then ask a member of the&#xD;
      patient's health care team (bedside nurse, charge nurse, resident, staff physician) to ask&#xD;
      the family members for permission to approach them about the study. The research assistant&#xD;
      will then complete an eligibility screen, and maintain a phone follow-up ledger for consented&#xD;
      patients. If the patient is eligible and the family gives their informed consent, they will&#xD;
      be allocated to one of the study groups. Once written, informed consent has been obtained,&#xD;
      the research assistant will communicate with the health care team to ensure the patient&#xD;
      continues on the CS initiated in the ED, for the appropriate number of doses as determined by&#xD;
      CS group assignment. A record will be kept of all screened patients, patient eligibility,&#xD;
      allocation, and follow up to allow reporting according to CONSORT guidelines. Additional&#xD;
      consent will be requested to access patients' health utilization data (readmissions, ED&#xD;
      visits, visits to family physicians) through linkage with ICES data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment, the patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups.&#xD;
      The randomization schedule will have been previously generated using a computer.&#xD;
      Randomization will be blocked with randomly chosen block lengths of 4 or 6. Treatment&#xD;
      assignments will be written on a piece of paper and concealed in sequentially numbered opaque&#xD;
      envelopes kept in a secure locked location in the study research office. The PI and analyst&#xD;
      will be blinded to the treatment intervention, but the research coordinator in charge of&#xD;
      assessing eligibility and allocation and the patient's treating team (physicians and nurses)&#xD;
      will not because of the nature of the pragmatic nature of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. ANALYSIS 4.1 Sample size The investigators sought a sample size that would allow them to&#xD;
      estimate their feasibility outcomes with reasonable precision. As such, they have set out to&#xD;
      achieve a 15% margin of error (i.e. half-width of 95% confidence interval=0.15) for any&#xD;
      proportions to be estimated (e.g. allocation success, retention success). At a hypothesized&#xD;
      proportion of 50%, they determined that 43 patients will be needed to achieve this level of&#xD;
      precision. This provides a most conservative estimate since any proportions other than 50%&#xD;
      will require fewer patients. Factoring in an additional 15% of patients as allowance for&#xD;
      attrition or incomplete data they have set a recruitment target of n=51 in total. With&#xD;
      approximately 18 asthma admissions per month, assuming 70% are eligible and 50% of eligible&#xD;
      patients consent, the investigators expect to meet this sample size requirement in 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Quantitative Data Analysis For all relevant feasibility outcomes, binary proportions&#xD;
      (e.g. % success) and the associated 95% confidence interval will be estimated using the&#xD;
      Wilson method. To help inform the design of main trial (i.e. expected effect sizes), the&#xD;
      investigators will apply intention-to-treat principles and estimate the treatment effect (and&#xD;
      95% CI) by comparing outcomes (proposed for the main trial) between intervention groups using&#xD;
      statistical techniques appropriate to the type and distribution of the various outcomes (e.g.&#xD;
      continuous, binary, count data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Qualitative Data Analysis Semi-structured interview at week 4 will be audio taped and&#xD;
      transcribed verbatim. Analyses will be conducted using NVivo 9 software. Inductive analysis&#xD;
      will be used to identify categories, patterns and themes.&#xD;
