      This study will explore whether ivabradine lowers heart rate, and thus improves exercise&#xD;
      capacity, in survivors of lymphoma who have an elevated resting heart rate as a side effect&#xD;
      of prior radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ivabradine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study intervention for this particular problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying a drug called ivabradine. The&#xD;
      investigators are exploring whether ivabradine can be used to reduce heart rate, increase&#xD;
      exercise duration, and improve quality of life in survivors of lymphoma who received&#xD;
      radiation to their chest as a part of their cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ivabradine for this specific&#xD;
      disease, but it has approved the drug as an oral medication to lower heart rate in heart&#xD;
      failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survivors of lymphoma who were treated with neck and/or chest radiation can have an elevated&#xD;
      resting heart rate and an abnormal rate of decline in their heart rate after exercise, also&#xD;
      known as cardiac autonomic dysfunction. These abnormalities can limit exercise duration and&#xD;
      worsen quality of life in some radiation treated survivors of lymphoma&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Survivors of mediastinal lymphoma (either Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's&#xD;
             Lymphoma) with no active malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior mediastinal or mantle radiation ≥ 5 years prior to enrollment in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥ 80 bpm on screening EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on findings in animals, ivabradine may cause fetal harm when administered to a&#xD;
             pregnant woman. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction to ivabradine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers&#xD;
             of cytochrome P450 3A4 are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, symptomatic&#xD;
             known coronary artery disease, severe valvular heart disease, active malignancy, or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ivabradine is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             ivabradine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             ivabradine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with sick-sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, third degree heart block, atrial&#xD;
             fibrillation, and those with permanent pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other established indications for ivabradine: stable, symptomatic&#xD;
             chronic HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35% and in sinus rhythm with a&#xD;
             resting HR ≥ 70 bpm, who are taking maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have&#xD;
             contraindications to beta-blocker use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (Child Pugh Class C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
