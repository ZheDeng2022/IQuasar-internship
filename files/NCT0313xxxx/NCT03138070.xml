    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single arm, preoperative window of opportunity study with a&#xD;
      biomarker endpoint (expression profiling by RNA sequencing). Patients with resectable,&#xD;
      histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for whom surgical&#xD;
      treatment is planned as definitive management will be eligible. The median time from&#xD;
      consultation to major head and neck surgery at our institution is 3.2 +/- 2.0 weeks (1&#xD;
      standard deviation). To provide the maximal opportunity to achieve a biomarker response and&#xD;
      potentially observe clinical responses, patients will receive BYL719 orally daily at the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (400 mg/day) for 14 days. All patients will receive surgery as the&#xD;
      standard of care. The gene expression profile, including Ki-67, from the surgical specimen&#xD;
      and mandatory baseline tumor biopsy will be evaluated for primary and secondary&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic endpoints.&#xD;

             birth control or abstinence) during dosing and for 8 weeks after the final dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Hormonal contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 and are&#xD;
             therefore not considered effective for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the study drug and for 4 weeks&#xD;
             after the final dose of study medication. In addition to avoiding potential risks to a&#xD;
             child conceived while on the study medication, a condom use will prevent delivery of&#xD;
             the study drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study investigator has reviewed the patient's medication list and has taken&#xD;
             appropriate measures if the patient is taking any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of another malignancy within 2 years prior to starting study treatment, except&#xD;
             for cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has history of hypersensitivity to any drugs or metabolites or similar&#xD;
             chemical classes as BYL719&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently receiving or has received systemic corticosteroids &lt; 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to starting treatment with BYL719, or has not fully recovered from side effects&#xD;
             of such treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be moderate or&#xD;

             Switching to a different medication prior to treatment start is allowed. Refer to&#xD;
             Appendix B for a list of strong and moderate CYP34A and CYP2CA inducers and&#xD;
             inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly&#xD;
        consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
        http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the&#xD;
        Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient receiving medication with a known risk of prolonging the QT interval or&#xD;
             inducing Torsades de Pointes (TdP) and the treatment cannot be discontinued or&#xD;
             switched to a different medication prior to starting study treatment. Refer to&#xD;
             Appendix B, Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin derived anti-coagulant for&#xD;
             treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight&#xD;
             heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received live attenuated vaccines within 1 week of start of study&#xD;
             medication and during the study. Patient should also avoid close contact with others&#xD;
             who have received live attenuated vaccines. Examples of live attenuated vaccines&#xD;
             include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever,&#xD;
             varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or medical conditions that would, in the treating&#xD;
             physician's judgment, contraindicate patient participation including, but not limited&#xD;
             to: active or uncontrolled infection, chronic active hepatitis, immune-compromised,&#xD;
             acute or chronic pancreatitis, uncontrolled high blood pressure, interstitial lung&#xD;
             disease, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any of the following cardiac abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. History of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association&#xD;
                  functional classification III-IV), documented cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. known Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. symptomatic pericarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. QTcF &gt; 480 msec on the screening ECG (using the QTCF formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
             HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with BYL719. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who has not recovered to grade 1 or better (except alopecia, chronic stable&#xD;
             neuropathy or hearing impairment) from related side effects of any prior&#xD;
             antineoplastic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who has undergone major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study&#xD;
             treatment or who has not recovered from side effects of such procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a&#xD;
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a&#xD;
             positive hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL). Patients with elevated hCG at baseline that&#xD;
             is judged to be related to the tumor are eligible if hCG levels do not show the&#xD;
             expected doubling when repeated 5-7 days later, or pregnancy has been ruled out by&#xD;
             vaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the treatment with&#xD;
             BYL719 and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of BYL719:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
                  and for 4 weeks* after the final dose of alpelisib and should not father a child&#xD;
                  in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of sperm. A&#xD;
                  condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent&#xD;
                  delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all female physiologically capable&#xD;
                  of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the IPP and&#xD;
                  through at least 4 weeks* after the final dose of alpelisib&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
             the subject. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
        hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before starting&#xD;
        treatment with alpelisib. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;
        of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment iii. Male partner&#xD;
        sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in&#xD;
        the ejaculate). [For female patients participating to this IPP, the vasectomized male&#xD;
        partner should be the sole partner for that patient] iv. Use a combination of the following&#xD;
        (both a+b):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and implanted) are not allowed&#xD;
        as alpelisib BYL719 may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
