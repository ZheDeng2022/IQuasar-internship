  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reversal agent is commonly given to improve neuromuscular function after intra-operative&#xD;
      administration of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. The administration of&#xD;
      conventional reversal agent neostigmine is associated with many undesirable side effects. For&#xD;
      almost a decade, a new novel drug sugammadex has been used to specifically antagonize the&#xD;
      effect of aminosteroidal neuromuscular blocking agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 paediatric patients planned for general anaesthesia were divided into two&#xD;
      groups and were given either neostigmine+atropine, or sugammadex for reversal once the&#xD;
      operation had completed.&#xD;

      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sugammadex has a shorter recovery time (from TOF count of 2 or 3 to TOF ratio of more&#xD;
           than 0.9) as compared to neostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sugammadex has a more stable haemodynamic profile as compared to neostigmine when used&#xD;
           to reverse rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in paediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sugammadex causes less complications or side effects when used in paediatric patients as&#xD;
           a reversal for rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade when compared to neostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a prospective, double blinded, randomized control study involving 80 selected&#xD;
      paediatric patients undergoing various surgeries under general anaesthesia in the operation&#xD;
      theatre of Hospital University Sains Malaysia (USM), Kubang Kerian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The sample size for this study was calculated using Power and Sample Size&#xD;
      Calculation Programme Version 3.0.10.software based on different each respective objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the recovery time from Train of four (TOF) count of 2 or 3 to TOF ratio of&#xD;
           more than 0.9 between neostigmine and sugammadex in reversal of rocuronium induced&#xD;
           neuromuscular blockade in paediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • For objective 1, 33 participants in each respective groups are needed to detect the&#xD;
           difference of 8 minutes (480 seconds) in time taken to achieve TOF ratio of 0.9&#xD;
           post-administration of reversal agent (SD was 590, according to Olzem Sacan et al) with&#xD;
           90% power, alpha 0.05. 20% is added for drop out participant. Therefore sample size, n =&#xD;
           33 + (0.2 x 33) = 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the haemodynamic changes between neostigmine and sugammadex in reversal of&#xD;
           rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade in paediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For objective 2 (referring to blood pressure), 22 participants in each respective&#xD;
                groups are needed to detect the difference of 10 mmHg in mean arterial blood&#xD;
                pressure 5 minutes post-administration of reversal agent (SD was 10, according to&#xD;
                Olzem Sacan et al) with 90% power, alpha 0.05. 20% is added for drop out&#xD;
                participant. Therefore sample size, n = 22 + (0.2 x 22) = 26 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For objective 2 (referring to heart rate), 22 participants in each respective&#xD;
                groups are needed to detect the difference of 8 beats per minute in heart rate, 5&#xD;
                minutes post-administration of reversal agent (SD was 8, according to Olzem Sacan&#xD;
                et al) with 90% power, alpha 0.05. 20% is added for drop out participant. Therefore&#xD;
                sample size, n = 22 + (0.2 x 22) = 26 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the total patients in each group will be 40 patients per group. Total sample size&#xD;
      is 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After gaining approval from USM Research Ethics Committee, the study was conducted in the&#xD;
      Operation Theatre Hospital University Sains Malaysia (HUSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study were counselled, and&#xD;
      those who agreed to participate in the study were given full explanation about the study and&#xD;
      written consent was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Subjects were divided into two groups using allocation sequence generated from&#xD;
      online randomisation software (http://www.randomization.com). These respective allocations&#xD;
      were concealed in sealed envelopes, which were not opened until it was time to administer the&#xD;
      respective reversal agents in the Operation Theatre after completion of surgery. Patients&#xD;
      were randomised to receive either 'Drug A' or 'Drug B' to reverse rocuronium induced&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization generated by the computer was only known to the anaesthetic assistant&#xD;
      nurse, who is not involved in recruiting patients or carrying out the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding This is a double blinded study. There were 2 important measures taken to ensure&#xD;
      this. For this purpose, a specific anaesthetic assistant nurse is allocated before the study&#xD;
      was carried out. This nurse is not involved in recruiting the subjects or carrying out the&#xD;
      study, and is not related to the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 : Prior to sample collection, all subjects have already been randomized according to a&#xD;
      sequence derived from online computer randomization. The anaesthetic assistant nurse prepares&#xD;
      80 envelopes, each respectively numbered 1-80, and 80 cards that will fit into the envelope,&#xD;
      40 labelled 'A' and 40 labelled 'B'. The cards were inserted into the envelopes and sealed&#xD;
      according to the sequence that was derived from computer randomization. For example if&#xD;
      subject 1 falls under group A, the card labelled 'A' is inserted into the envelope labelled&#xD;
      1, and firmly sealed. This is continued until all 80 cards have been inserted into all 80&#xD;
      numbered envelopes according to the determined sequence, all being firmly sealed. This&#xD;
      process is carried out without the presence of the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 : On the day of surgery, prior to inducing the patient under general anaesthesia, the&#xD;
      anaesthetic assistant nurse had prepares the reversal agents labelled 'Drug A' and 'Drug B'.&#xD;
      To ensure desired double blinding, both reversal agents had to be diluted into similar&#xD;
      volumes for equivalent dose for each respective drug for reversal of moderate block of&#xD;
      Rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade (TOF count 2 or 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 mg of Atropine (1ml) was mixed with 2.5mg of Neostigmine (1ml) and diluted into 10 mls&#xD;
           with Normal Saline 0.9% in a 10ml standard syringe. This would be a solution of 0.1&#xD;
           mg/ml Atropine with 0.25 mg/ml Neostigmine. A normal standard reversal dose for TOF&#xD;
           count of 2 to 3 would be 0.05 mg/kg of Neostigmine with 0.02 mg/kg of Atropine.&#xD;
           Therefore the volume would be 0.2mls per kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100 mg Sugammadex (1ml) is diluted into 10mls in a standard 10mls syringe with Normal&#xD;
           Saline 0.9%. This will provide a new solution of 10mg/ml. The required dose for reversal&#xD;
           of reversal of Rocuronium induced neuromuscular blockade with a TOF count of 2 or 3&#xD;
           would be 2mg/kg. This will also be equivalent to a volume of 0.2mls per kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process was also done without the presence of the researcher. All medications were&#xD;
      discarded by the end of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the anaesthetic assistant nurse is aware which drug, either Neostigmine-Atropine&#xD;
      combination or Sugammadex belongs to either group A (drug A) and group B (drug B), till all&#xD;
      80 samples have been collected. After completion of the study, the researcher is informed&#xD;
      which drug was labelled as 'Drug A' and 'Drug B' respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol In the operating room, the patient was put under routine monitoring for&#xD;
      general anaesthesia, including non-invasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, pulse&#xD;
      oxymetry, end tidal carbon dioxide. The TOF Watch Sx, was also placed at the patients hand&#xD;
      appropriately along the ulnar groove to monitor the neurotransmission activity of ulnar nerve&#xD;
      . TOF reading was not taken at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring was also placed on the patient's forehead, to&#xD;
      ensure the patient was adequately induced prior to any painful stimulation for example&#xD;
      intravenous access placement or TOF monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was induced via sevoflurane gaseous induction, with a fresh gas flow rate of 8&#xD;
      litres per min of oxygen. Sevoflurane was dialled between 4 to 6 percent, to ensure&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters were within acceptable range, and BIS count achieved was 40-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient was fully relaxed and induced, a good functioning appropriate sized&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous access was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 mcg/kg of fentanyl was given for analgesia. After administration of fentanyl, the TOF Watch&#xD;
      Sx was calibrated and a baseline TOF reading was taken and recorded.The patient was paralyzed&#xD;
      with 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium, and intubation of the trachea was done once TOF count was less&#xD;
      than 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOF monitoring was assessed at 15 minute intervals once patient was under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. Boluses of intravenous rocuronium 0.2 mg/kg was administered intermittently to&#xD;
      maintain a TOF count of 2-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline haemodynamic values (blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxymetry, end tidal&#xD;
      carbon dioxide) were documented prior to induction, post-intubation and the subsequent 15&#xD;
      minutes interval, to obtain a baseline and mean reading. The TOF readings were documented&#xD;
      prior to Rocuronium administration (post-induction), post-intubation, then every 15 minutes&#xD;
      interval, and just prior to reversal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were given suppositories paracetamol 20-30mg/kg for analgesia. No further&#xD;
      opioids were served other than on induction. Where applicable, regional blocks or local&#xD;
      infiltration at the surgical site were given for analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administration of the reversal agent as determined by randomization, it was ensured&#xD;
      that the TOF reading was 2-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following time was taken and recorded :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from administration of reversal agent to TOF ratio more than 0.9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from administration of reversal to spontaneous ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from administration of reversal to adequate ventilation (tidal volume at least 6mls/kg&#xD;
           and adequate respiratory rate for age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  from administration of reversal to extubation The haemodynamic parameters (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, pulse oxymetry, respiratory rate, tidal volume, end tidal carbon&#xD;
           dioxide) were documented in 5 minute intervals upon administration of the reversal&#xD;
           agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemodynamic parameters in the recovery bay (blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oxymetry,&#xD;
      respiratory rate) were also documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were also observed for any complications or side effects post-extubation such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, secretions, respiratory distress, etc in the recovery bay.&#xD;
