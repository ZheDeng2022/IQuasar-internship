  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving&#xD;
      treatment for blood cancers reduces the risk of bleeding or death, and the need for platelet&#xD;
      transfusions. Patients will be randomised to receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously&#xD;
      through a drip, or orally) or a placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancers of the blood often develop low blood cell counts either as a&#xD;
      consequence of the disease or the treatment by chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
      Platelet transfusions are commonly given to raise any low platelet count and reduce the risk&#xD;
      of clinical bleeding (prophylaxis) or stop active bleeding (therapy). But recent studies have&#xD;
      indicated that many patients continue to experience bleeding, despite the use of platelet&#xD;
      transfusions. Tranexamic acid is a type of drug that is called an antifibrinolytic. These&#xD;
      drugs act to reduce the breakdown of clots formed in response to bleeding. These drugs have&#xD;
      been used widely in both elective and emergency surgery and have been shown to decrease blood&#xD;
      loss and the use of red cell transfusions. The purpose of this study is to test whether&#xD;
      giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving treatment for blood cancers reduces the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding or death, and the need for platelet transfusions. Patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously through a drip, or orally) or a placebo. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure the rates of bleeding daily using a short structured assessment of&#xD;
      bleeding and will record the number of transfusions given to patients.&#xD;

A time-to-event analysis will be used to determine this proportion to ensure that all patients are included in the primary outcome analysis, not just those who are followed up for the full 30 days.
