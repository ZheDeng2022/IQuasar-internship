  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if GSK2636771 given in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab can help to control the disease in patients with refractory (has not responded&#xD;
      to treatment) metastatic melanoma. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      and FDA approved for the treatment of several types of cancer, including melanoma. GSK2636771&#xD;
      is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research&#xD;
      purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 41 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 35 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have metastatic cancer, you may be enrolled in Phase 1 of this study. If you have&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma, you may be enrolled in Phase 1 or Phase 2 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of GSK2636771 in combination with pembrolizumab you&#xD;
      receive will depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive&#xD;
      the lowest dose level of GSK2636771. Each new group will receive a higher dose of GSK2636771&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of GSK2636771 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive GSK2636771 at the highest dose that was&#xD;
      tolerated in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take GSK2636771 by mouth every day for 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive pembrolizumab by vein for 30 minutes one (1) time on Day 1 of every&#xD;
           cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should receive the study drugs at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive the study drugs for up to 2 years. If the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest, you may continue to receive either GSK2636771 or pembrolizumab for 1 more year. You&#xD;
      will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the Follow-Up Visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have an ECHO and&#xD;
           MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing before the&#xD;
           dose, at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours after the dose. (Cycle 1 only). PK&#xD;
           testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune function testing (Cycles 3 &amp; 5&#xD;
           only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a PET/CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease (Cycle 5 only and&#xD;
           then every 12 weeks after that).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, 8 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1½ teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for PK testing before the dose. (Cycle 2 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECHO and MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 5, and every 12 weeks after that, you will be asked to have a&#xD;
      core biopsy. Only 1 of these will be required, and the others will be optional. Though it is&#xD;
      preferred that this be performed at Cycle 2, you and your doctor will choose which of these&#xD;
      biopsies will be the required one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 weeks after Cycle 5, blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop receiving the study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECHO and MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the disease got worse while you are on study, you may have a core biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 days after the End-of-Study Dosing Visit and every 6 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECHO and MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time every 12 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a PET/CT) scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be called by a member of the study staff to check your health. These calls&#xD;
           should last about 5 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Beyond Progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may&#xD;
      still be able to receive the study drug if you and your doctor decide it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. Sometimes the disease appears to get worse but the study drug is actually working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug because the disease may&#xD;
      actually be getting worse. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug. This&#xD;
      could also delay starting other treatments. The disease may get worse to the point that you&#xD;
      are no longer able to receive other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to receive the study drug after the disease gets worse, you will continue to&#xD;
      have study visits. The study doctor will discuss this option with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol and Activity Restriction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days when you have multiple PK blood draws, you should not have alcohol for at least 24&#xD;
      hours before your dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should not exercise for 48 hours before each PK and/or routine testing blood draw.&#xD;

             follows: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are excluded from this&#xD;
             study as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,&#xD;
             autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]). Patients with motor&#xD;
             neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome and&#xD;
             Myasthenia Gravis) are excluded. Patients with a history of autoimmune thyroiditis are&#xD;
             eligible if their current thyroid disorder is treated and stable with replacement or&#xD;
             other medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has active infections or serious general medical conditions (such as active myocardial&#xD;
             infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or respiratory failure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any unresolved &gt; Grade 1 toxicity (per CTCAE 4.0) from previous anti-cancer therapy or&#xD;
             previously administered agent at the time of enrollment, except for alopecia, Grade 2&#xD;
             anemia (if hemoglobin is &gt;9 grams per deciliter (g/dL)) Note: If the subject received&#xD;
             major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or&#xD;
             complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of any clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormality or other&#xD;
             condition(s) that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major&#xD;
             resection of the stomach or substantial portion of the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active peptic ulcer disease or history of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, or intra&#xD;
             abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated&#xD;
             respiratory, hepatic, renal or cardiac disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a QTc &gt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;480 msec for subjects with bundle branch&#xD;
             block (BBB) NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate by Bazett's&#xD;
             formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or&#xD;
             manually over-read. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility&#xD;
             and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation&#xD;
             of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate&#xD;
             the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or&#xD;
             discontinue the subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis QTcF will be&#xD;
             used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following: -&#xD;
             Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities including second degree&#xD;
