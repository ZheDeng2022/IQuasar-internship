    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of Phase 1A are to evaluate the safety of KITE-718, determine a&#xD;
      recommended Phase 1B dose, and to evaluate the efficacy of KITE-718 in Phase 1B.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants found to be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DPB1*04:01 positive and whose tumors&#xD;
      are MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6 positive can participate if all eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
      Other tests required to determine eligibility include a physical exam, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) of the heart, CT or MRI scans, and blood draws. Eligible&#xD;
      participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis. These cells are genetically&#xD;
      modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-718. The desired outcome is that the&#xD;
      genetically modified T cells will target tumor cells that express MAGE-A3 and/or MAGE-A6,&#xD;
      which are proteins that can be expressed by cancer cells. Participants receive chemotherapy&#xD;
      prior to the KITE-718 infusion. After the KITE-718 infusion, participants will be followed&#xD;
      for side effects and have scans performed to see any potential impact on their cancers. Study&#xD;
      procedures may be performed while hospitalized and/or in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
