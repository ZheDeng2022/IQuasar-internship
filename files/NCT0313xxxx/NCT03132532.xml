      stage 2/3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study which dose of proton radiotherapy is best for patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with stage 2/3 diagnosed with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in equal proportions (1:1) to a single dose level (60 vs 72 Gy) balanced based on&#xD;
      the stratification factors. The duration of radiation therapy and chemotherapy will be about&#xD;
      6-7½ weeks. Patient will receive concurrent chemotherapy, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (weekly&#xD;
      during radiotherapy followed 3-6 weeks later by 2 cycles of consolidation). Duration of trial&#xD;
      participation is about 5 years. The investigator will permit study-related monitoring,&#xD;
      audits, and inspections by the IRB, and government regulatory agencies, of all study related&#xD;
      documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study&#xD;
      data etc.). The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable&#xD;
      study-related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by&#xD;
      government regulatory authorities and applicable compliance offices. 42 total (n=21 per arm)&#xD;
      evaluable patients will need to be accrued onto this randomized phase II study unless undue&#xD;
      adverse events are encountered. Anticipated accruing an additional 6 patients (3 per dose&#xD;
      level) to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other&#xD;
      reasons. Maximum projected accrual is therefore 48 patients total.&#xD;

    <description>PFS time is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression the patient will be censored on the last date the disease was evaluated. In the case of a patient starting treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be censored for progression on day 1 post-randomization. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form, have begun treatment, and have not been declared a major treatment violation will be evaluable.</description>
