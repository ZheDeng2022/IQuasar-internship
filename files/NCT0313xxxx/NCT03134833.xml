    <textblock>
      The focus of this study (Engaging Seronegative Youth to Optimize HIV Prevention Continuum) -&#xD;
      will be to stop HIV-related risk acts and to encourage youth at high risk for HIV to adopt&#xD;
      antiretroviral medications as treatment and prevention (either pre exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) or post exposure prophylaxis) among gay, bisexual and transgender and/or homeless&#xD;
      youth with contact with the criminal justice system in the HIV epicenters of Los Angeles and&#xD;
      New Orleans. A cohort of 1500 youth at the highest risk of seroconverting over 24 months will&#xD;
      be identified. The goal will be to optimize the HIV Prevention Continuum over 24 months. The&#xD;
      proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to compare youth outcomes when randomized to&#xD;
      one of four automated and person-mediated social media delivered intervention conditions: 1)&#xD;
      Automated Messaging and Monitoring Intervention (AMMI) only (n=900) consisting of daily&#xD;
      motivational, instructional, and referral text-messaging (SMS), and brief, weekly SMS&#xD;
      monitoring surveys of outcomes; 2) Peer Support through social media plus AMMI (n=200) via&#xD;
      private online discussion boards; 3) Coaching plus AMMI (n=200) to provide service linkages,&#xD;
      eligibility support, appointment coordination and follow-up, communication with healthcare&#xD;
      providers, and brief motivational and strengths-based counseling for linkage and retention to&#xD;
      prevention, mental health, and substance abuse services; and, 4) Coaching plus Peer Support&#xD;
      and AMMI (n=200).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite dramatic improvements in the biomedical treatments for both preventing and treating&#xD;
      HIV infection, American adolescents are increasingly likely to become infected, are not using&#xD;
      ARV for prevention or treatment, and are not learning they are HIV seropositive when they&#xD;
      have become infected. America's HIV epidemic among youth has more than doubled in the last 15&#xD;
      years and now represents 26% of the epidemic. These youth are not found in every community -&#xD;
      geography is destiny in HIV prevention (www.AIDSVu.com). YLH are concentrated along I-95 on&#xD;
      the East Coast, in Southern cities, and West Coast. Given the distribution of emerging&#xD;
      infections, we have chosen two HIV epicenters, Los Angeles (LA) and New Orleans, to test a&#xD;
      strategy to identify, link to care, and intervene to prevent HIV. Even in those two areas,&#xD;
      adolescent HIV will not be found in every neighborhood. In LA, six neighborhoods account for&#xD;
      80% of HIV cases in the County - reflecting the concentration of HIV within neighborhoods and&#xD;
      settings. In each epicenter, the youth at highest risk of infection will be gay, bisexual,&#xD;
      and transgendered youth (GBTY), especially those who are Black and Latino. Homeless youth&#xD;
      will also be at highest risk: the last HIV seroprevalence study showed a 5.3% rate among&#xD;
      homeless youth. Youth who are incarcerated are at higher risk of being in risk setting and&#xD;
      will be targeted for recruitment to this study. Having a sexual orientation as GBTY is highly&#xD;
      stigmatizing and youth are developmentally challenged about who, when, how, and what to&#xD;
      disclose their sexual orientation of HIV status to their families and their peers.&#xD;
      Unfortunately 42% of GBTY's parents eject their children when children disclose being GBTY&#xD;
      resulting in 40% of homeless youth being GBTY. Homeless GBTY had a seroprevalence of 24.8% in&#xD;
      1989.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sites that typically serve GBTY and High Risk Youth (HRY) (gay-identified CBO and&#xD;
      homeless shelters) in HIV epicenters only provide HIV testing to about 10% of youth&#xD;
      currently. To effectively stop HIV among youth, a more integrated strategy that tests for HIV&#xD;
      and STIs repeatedly, links youth to care, and helps youth access all HIV prevention&#xD;
      strategies, including Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), is&#xD;
      needed. The proposed research will test such a strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To eliminate HIV among youth, scalable, efficacious, and cost-effective strategies are needed&#xD;
      to optimize the HIV Prevention Continuum of repeat testing, linkage to biomedical and&#xD;
      behavioral prevention, and retention and adherence over time to PrEP, PEP, condom use and&#xD;
      reduced number of partners. The HIV Prevention Continuum is a framework for guiding&#xD;
      prevention efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in mobile and social media technologies have created opportunities to engage and&#xD;
      intervene with large numbers of youth at relatively low costs, technologies that permeate&#xD;
      their daily routines. This study will use two primary technology platforms: text-messaging&#xD;
      and social media. Text-messaging, email, internet and social media use are nearly universal&#xD;
      among youth, including homeless youth. Rates of mobile phone, smartphone, and internet usage&#xD;
      increase with age, and nearly 90% of young adolescents (age 13-17) having a mobile phone.&#xD;
      Texting is particularly important for adolescents; 90% of those with phones text, typically&#xD;
      receiving and sending 30 texts each day. Similarly, over 90% of adolescents under age 18 go&#xD;
      online daily, more than half several times a day, which is facilitated the three quarters&#xD;
      with smartphones that are crossing the digital divide. African-American and Latino youth have&#xD;
      higher rates of smartphone and internet use than White. All of these rates increase for&#xD;
      adolescents 18 and over. Ownership, access, and use rates are similar for homeless youth,&#xD;
      although with less frequency and some inconsistency. Much of this online activity is driven&#xD;
      by social media, particularly via smartphones, with over 70% of adolescents under 18, for&#xD;
      example, using Facebook and other applications (about half also use Instagram and Snapchat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions proposed in this study will use text-messaging and social media to engage&#xD;
      &quot;youth where they're at&quot; in the digital environment as preferences and functions change.&#xD;
      Importantly, mobile phones continue to receive text-messages even when data plans run out of&#xD;
      credit to use apps' and mobile-web browsers or send text-messages. Therefore, the core&#xD;
      component our technology strategy will be text-messaging in the Automated Messaging and&#xD;
      Monitoring Intervention (AMMI) for all youth in the cohort. Social media will be used by Peer&#xD;
      Supporters to engage and support their peers through online discussion boards while Coaches&#xD;
      will engage through social media, text-messaging, and voice and video-chats (however most&#xD;
      acceptable to individual youth), as well as in person contacts. Mobile and social media&#xD;
      technology-based engagement, retention, prevention, and mobilization strategies are likely to&#xD;
      be scalable. This study will test whether they are also efficacious and cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon study launch in April 2017, decisions were made with the funder to provide three-site&#xD;
      STI testing at baseline and every follow-up assessment. In December 2018, the funder changed&#xD;
      priorities and reduced support for STI testing to rectal testing only at baseline, 12- and&#xD;
      24-month follow-up, unless the participant displays STI symptoms or requests testing at other&#xD;
      follow-up assessments. The funder has also decided to terminate the intervention and&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 12 months, rather than 24 months, for youth who are at lower&#xD;
      behavioral risk for HIV acquisition.&#xD;

    <description>Youth will receive messages 1-5 messages per day for 24 months. Message banks of about 750 text messages (70-120/domain) will focus on the HIV Prevention Continuum, with messages dedicated to healthcare, wellness, sexual health, drug use and medication reminders (e.g., for PrEP) for MSM and non-MSM. Youth will be able to choose the time that they receive daily texts. Text timing and the frequency of texts (e.g., if the youth &quot;comes out&quot;) will be updated at 4-month intervals.&#xD;
Youth will complete weekly monitoring surveys by text message. The survey will cover seven domains related to the HIV Prevention Continuum. In case of non-response, reminder messages will be sent to the youth. After three days of non-response, a follow-telephone call will occur.</description>
