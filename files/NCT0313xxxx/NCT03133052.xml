    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and mechanism of internet-based cognitive control training&#xD;
      on episodic memory function in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment(aMCI). Half&#xD;
      of participants will receive adaptive internet-based cognitive control training program,&#xD;
      while the other half will receive a fixed, primary difficulty level task.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia in elderly populations, and amnestic mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (aMCI) refers to a transitional stage between normal aging and early&#xD;
      dementia. Patients with aMCI are at higher risks of evolving toward AD. Although it has been&#xD;
      widely recognized that early intervention of aMCI holds the potential to delay or even&#xD;
      reverse the cognitive impairment, no treatment is available yet. Episodic memory dysfunction&#xD;
      is the characteristic impairment in aMCI, cognitive control training significantly improved&#xD;
      executive function in patients with aMCI . Whether and how cognitive control training&#xD;
      improves episodic memory function in patients with aMCI remains largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this double-blinded, randomized RCT is to assess whether&#xD;
      internet-based cognitive control training in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      improves their episodic memory function. The second objective is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      cognitive control training on neural plasticity, including brain activation and white matter&#xD;
      integrity, which are assessed by functional and structural MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that will&#xD;
      include 70 patients diagnosed with aMCI from the neurology clinics at The First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital, Zhejiang University. The patients will be randomized to either a training or a&#xD;
      control group. The intervention is internet-based cognitive control training performed for 30&#xD;
      minutes over 60 sessions. Neuropsychological assessment and functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) will be performed before and 12 weeks after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no known treatment available for aMCI. The proposed study is to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of cognitive control training on episodic memory function in patients with aMCI.&#xD;
      Secondly, using functional and structural MRI, this study is to reveal the potential&#xD;
      mechanism underlying cognitive control training.&#xD;
