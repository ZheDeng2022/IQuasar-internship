      Our aim is to evaluate whether translocator binding protein (TSPO)-imaging correlates to&#xD;
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and other disease progression-related clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical parameters in a homogenous cohort of 40-50-year old MS-patients, who are at risk&#xD;
      of progression. The A2A-AR expression in this cohort will also be studied using the adenosine&#xD;
      A2A-receptor (A2A-AR)-binding radioligand 11C-TMSX. The study cohort will also form the basis&#xD;
      for a later follow-up study, which will be performed to evaluate the prognostic value of&#xD;
      baseline TSPO-imaging in terms of disease progression. TSPO-imaging could thus be used as an&#xD;
      imaging biomarker to help identifying patients to therapeutically prevent progression of MS.&#xD;
      At the 5 year time point synaptic density will be evaluated using 11C-UCB-J radioligand and&#xD;
      PET imaging.&#xD;

      Protocol title: Role of microglia in the pathogenesis of progressive multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study: The investigators have demonstrated earlier a statistically&#xD;
      significant correlation between TSPO-binding and EDSS in a heterogeneous MS-population&#xD;
      comprising both early RRMS and late secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients.&#xD;
      Now the investigators aim to evaluate whether TSPO-imaging correlates to EDSS and other&#xD;
      disease progression-related clinical and paraclinical parameters in a homogenous cohort of&#xD;
      40-50-year old MS-patients, who are at risk of progression. The A2A-AR expression in this&#xD;
      cohort will also be studied using the A2A-AR-binding radioligand 11C-TMSX. The study cohort&#xD;
      will also form the basis for a later follow-up study, which will be performed to evaluate the&#xD;
      prognostic value of baseline TSPO-imaging in terms of disease progression. TSPO-imaging could&#xD;
      thus be used as an imaging biomarker to help identifying patients to therapeutically prevent&#xD;
      progression of MS. At the 5 year time point synaptic density will be evaluated using&#xD;
      11C-UCB-J radioligand and PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will consist of a clinically homogenous group of 25&#xD;
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients with MS-diagnosis for at least 5&#xD;
      years, age 40-50 years, who may be using any first-line MS therapy. The patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Division of Clinical Neurosciences of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Turku, Finland. In addition the investigators will image a group of 10&#xD;
      age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives Primary: To evaluate how TSPO-ligand binding in the normal appearing white&#xD;
      matter (NAWM) correlates to EDSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: 1) To evaluate how TSPO-ligand binding in the NAWM at baseline correlates to other&#xD;
      standard clinical and paraclinical parameters typically associated with disease progression&#xD;
      2) To evaluate how 11C-TMSX-binding (to A2A-AR) correlates to the clinical and paraclinical&#xD;
      parameters, and to TSPO-binding. 3) To evaluate how synaptic density evaluated using&#xD;
      11C-UCB-J binding correlates to patients cognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: RRMS, age 40-50 years, MS-diagnosis for a minimum of five years.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Previous or present treatment with immunosuppressive medication or&#xD;
      biologicals. Steroid treatment within 30 days of evaluation Evaluation of patients: Baseline&#xD;
      brain MRI and PET using 11C-PK11195 and 11C-TMSX with a protocol used in our previous&#xD;
      studies. MS functional composite (MSFC), brain atrophy, quantitative diffusion tensor&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (DTI-MRI) measures, and neuropsychological status. At 5 years PET&#xD;
      using 11C-UCB-J radioligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging methods: 1) Detection of microglial activation.&#xD;
      The investigators shall use the TSPO-ligand 11C-PK11195 to evaluate the level of microglial&#xD;
      activation in the NAWM, in normal appearing gray matter (NAGM) and in the periplaque areas.&#xD;
      The 11C-PK11195 imaging. 2) A2A-AR detection. The investigators shall investigate the&#xD;
      distribution of the A2A-ARs using PET and (11C-TMSX). This will be performed to correlate&#xD;
      A2A-AR expression with microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS) of RRMS&#xD;
      patients at risk of converting to SPMS. The 11C-TMSX imaging.3) Evaluation of synaptic&#xD;
      density using 11C-UCB-J-PET. The association between 11C-UCB-J binding and cognitive&#xD;
      functions will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on earlier experience with PET ligands it is estimated that 15 subjects per group is&#xD;
      enough to reveal 15% difference in 11C-PK11195 and 11C-TMSX uptake between the study groups&#xD;
      with 90% power at p-level &lt;0.05. The correlation analyses between the variables will be&#xD;
      performed with Spearman's non-parametric test for non-linear, and Pearson's test for linear&#xD;
      association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facilities: Turku PET Centre (TPC) is the national PET Centre in Finland. It has six state-of&#xD;
      the-art PET scanners and a long history of performing PET scanning in neurological disorders,&#xD;
      and in animal models thereof (www.turkupetcentre.fi). Radiochemical synthesis of 11C-PK11195&#xD;
      has been established in TPC and study projects on MS patients have been completed and&#xD;
      published by our research group previously. The 11C-TMSX and 11C-UCB-J are already in use in&#xD;
      the TPC.&#xD;
