  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schistosomiasis remains an important parasitic disease in the tropics, special in Africa&#xD;
      including Zanzibar. The WHO-recommended strategy to eliminate schistosomiasis involves&#xD;
      large-scale treatment of affected populations through periodic, targeted treatment of&#xD;
      school-children with praziquantel. Donated praziquantel is the key to achieving elimination.&#xD;
      The increase in the number of treatments is attributable to many factors, including improved&#xD;
      availability of donated praziquantel, essentially from Merck; new countries starting to&#xD;
      implement large-scale schistosomiasis control programmes; geographical scale-up of treatment&#xD;
      within countries; and improved reporting to WHO. The global target set by WHO in the Roadmap&#xD;
      on neglected tropical diseases is to attain at least 75% coverage of preventive chemotherapy&#xD;
      in pre-school and school-age children by 2020. Experience from China demonstrates that&#xD;
      preventive chemotherapy (that is, large scale treatment without individual diagnosis) with&#xD;
      high coverage can significantly impact indices of infection and reduce transmission. The&#xD;
      praziquantel made in China has been used from 1990s, and have effectively activity against S.&#xD;
      haematobium, special the good economic benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will propose to conduct an open-label, randomized trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      comparative efficacy of Chinese-made Praziquantel versus WHO Praziquantel in the treatment of&#xD;
      200 people infected with S. haematobium in Pemba island Zanzibar. To do this the&#xD;
      investigators will screen about 4000 people by examination of urine for schistosome eggs.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of Chinese-made and WHO&#xD;
      Praziquantel. Four weeks after treatment, the participants will be assessed for cure and egg&#xD;
      reduction. The study may provide an alternative drug treatment for S. haematobium.&#xD;

      Participants There about 4000 peoples (aged 7-60 years) were enrolled from three Shehias in&#xD;
      Pemba island Zanzibar. Urine will be collected and tested on April 2017. Eligible people will&#xD;
      be enrolled based on the criteria of inclusion and exclusion. A series of meetings will be&#xD;
      held at Shehias and schools to explain the objectives, procedures, and potential risks of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive Chinese-made versus WHO-PQ&#xD;
      praziquantel. The randomization sequence was computer generated by the study sponsor. The&#xD;
      staff of NTD office will give the assigned study drug after confirming the treatment&#xD;
      allocation from the randomisation sequence. The NTD staff and and study participants will be&#xD;
      unmasked to treatment assignment, but the laboratory technicians will be masked to treatment&#xD;
      assignment throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Firstly, every participant provided a fresh urine sample, which was used to detect&#xD;
      the presence of S. haematobium. The NTD staff will do a physical examination, and checked the&#xD;
      eligibility of every participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose urines tested positive for S. haematobium eggs and who met all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria were invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chines-made and WHO-PQ praziquantel will be give the participants one dose of 40 mg/kg per&#xD;
      day. All study drugs were given orally, and the NTD staff will also record the exact time of&#xD;
      drug ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be observed for 2 h after taking the drug to ensure retention and check for&#xD;
      any immediate adverse events. If vomiting occurred within 2 h of drug ingestion, a second&#xD;
      full dose was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one month after enrolment, the follow-up visit will be provided, and urine will be&#xD;
      collected and tested for S. haematobium eggs. As a quality control measure for inter-observer&#xD;
      variability, a third technician reread a random selection of 10% of slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined as a sign, symptom, intercurrent illness, or abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      finding that just occurred during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, all participants who have still excreting S. haematobium eggs (ie,&#xD;
      not cured) will be treated with praziquantel again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis There serial report forms will be used to data collection from&#xD;
      participants, and Epi Info will be used to data enter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cure rate, the mean egg count and economic benefits will be analysed between the&#xD;
      different group.&#xD;
