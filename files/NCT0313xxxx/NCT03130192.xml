  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common causes of cancer&#xD;
      mortality. Also, the first leading cause of death is lung cancer in Taiwan 2012. Most&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and their median survival with supportive care is&#xD;
      only 3-6 months. The common regimens used on advanced NSCLC treatment consists of&#xD;
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, the survival benefit of which is able to extend the&#xD;
      survival to approximately 10 months. However, disease and treatment-related toxicities in&#xD;
      cancer patients may result in fatigue and interfered quality of life (QoL). According to the&#xD;
      others reports, eight QoL areas including physical functioning, fatigue, pain, and appetite&#xD;
      loss have been showed a statistically significant association with survival rate of NSCLC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), an indicator of QoL, has been reported as the most frequent and&#xD;
      distressing toxicity of lung cancer chemotherapy. Proposed criteria for CRF have been adopted&#xD;
      for inclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health&#xD;
      Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Therefore, more in-depth&#xD;
      researches on CRF are needed in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, electrolyte disturbance like hyponatremia has been reported to be counted as one&#xD;
      of the many contributing factors for fatigue in palliative care patients and associated with&#xD;
      poorer overall survival rate (OS) in lung cancer. Thus, the correlation between CRF and&#xD;
      electrolyte possibly would be a strong link for physician to improve the QoL and survival&#xD;
      rate of NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this observational study is to evaluate the correlation between CRF,&#xD;
      survival and physiological factors in NSCLC patients under chemotherapy. The study will&#xD;
      compare the effect of QoL and CRF on survival with or without CRF treatment and investigate&#xD;
      the correlation between the variation of CRF and physiological factors which have been&#xD;
      examined and recorded on medical record under clinical practice. These results will supply&#xD;
      physicians with more understanding about CRF, and help them to enhance the quality on lung&#xD;
      cancer care to being perfected in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with chemotherapy will be enrolled. Patients will&#xD;
      be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study activity schedule and all regulatory&#xD;
      requirements that must be satisfied for informed consent. Only patients who give consent to&#xD;
      participate in this study and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      eligible to enroll into this study. ICD-10 fatigue criteria, Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwan&#xD;
      Form (BFI-T), the visual analog scale (VAS) for appetite and Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy-General quality of life questionnaire (FACT-G7) will be used to evaluate patients'&#xD;
      fatigue and quality of life. Patients who enrolled in this observational study will complete&#xD;
      the evaluation and questionnaire of fatigue and quality of life according to clinical&#xD;
      schedule. The first survey (baseline) will be collected after enrollment, the further surveys&#xD;
      will be completed every three chemotherapy cycles following subject's chemotherapy schedule&#xD;
      and after finish the whole course of chemotherapy. Subject demographic and disease-related&#xD;
      information and routine laboratory data will also be collected from medical record for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
