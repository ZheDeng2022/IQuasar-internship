  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who undergo surgery routinely for surgery that risk high levels of circulatory&#xD;
      changes (eg heart surgery) is currently used routinely monitoring as regional oxygenation&#xD;
      technology of the brain (NIRS). Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique for&#xD;
      measuring regional oxygen saturation, indirect autoregulation of brain. We know that reduced&#xD;
      oxygenation of the brain can occur with severe immediate blood loss. We in the research group&#xD;
      has been able to note that in children who undergo surgery for cranioplasty interventions &lt;1&#xD;
      year old, when they have ongoing excessive bleeding, decreases oxygenation in the brain and&#xD;
      sometimes sharply before we can replace the loss of blood, even the blood pressure can be&#xD;
      adequately maintained. Perioperative hypovolemia is a risk factor upset autoregulation of&#xD;
      brain. Respect of which the mean arterial pressure (MAP) required to maintain intact&#xD;
      autoregulation during general anesthesia still lacks a scientific consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By illuminating the skin and underlying tissue with infrared light in the spectra of 700 to&#xD;
      1100nm, it is possible to measure regional oxygen saturation in various tissues. At cerebral&#xD;
      measuring sensor is placed frontally, just below the hairline. INVOS then returns the&#xD;
      absolute values of cerebral oxygen saturation frontally in the area where the sensor is&#xD;
      placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A frontal placement may in some cases be impractical / impossible and thus limits the ability&#xD;
      to monitor the brains of children with different types of surgery or body positions. At&#xD;
      certain cranioplastic intervention surgery a frontal placement is not always possible, partly&#xD;
      because of surgical technic reasons, but also that the child may have to lie prone during&#xD;
      surgery. An alternative placement of INVOS sensor could mean greater opportunities to monitor&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation and thus increase patient safety within the mentioned categories&#xD;
      of patients. An occipital location is practically possible in many cases. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether a occipital located sensor can measure cerebral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation in a reliable manner.&#xD;

      We want to study patients undergoing cleft lip and palate plastic surgery at Sahlgrenska&#xD;
      University Hospital. This population has been chosen because it is an age group that is&#xD;
      homogeneous and suits our aim &quot;two different measuring points (frontal and occipitalt) of&#xD;
      sensors for regional cerebral oxygenation in children under 1 yrs old, during general&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery. We will use a INVOS 5100 (the latest version of INVOS). A sensor will&#xD;
      be applied, frontally and occipital on the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled consecutively when they have been planned for surgery, at&#xD;
      Salhgrenska University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative data will be registered in 5-minute intervals from frontally and occipital&#xD;
      measurements. The measurements begin before the patient is anesthetized and ends when the&#xD;
      patient is extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All monitoring data during the general anesthesia will be obtained and documented in a data&#xD;
      sheet.&#xD;
