  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have suggested that maternal periodontitis affects the&#xD;
      fetal-placental unit, with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Indeed, it has&#xD;
      been suggested that the direct or indirect action of parodontopathogenic bacteria induces an&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade that leads to spontaneous premature labor. Also, non-treatment of caries&#xD;
      and periodontal disease can lead to acute pain and stress. This may promote self-medication&#xD;
      and the inappropriate use of analgesic medications, potentially harmful to the health of the&#xD;
      fetus. As part of the prevention of complications of pregnancy associated with oral diseases,&#xD;
      the National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health (ANAES) has set up a system&#xD;
      that allows any pregnant woman to consult between the 4th and 7th month of pregnancy, an oral&#xD;
      health professional to carry out a complete assessment and free care. This study aims at&#xD;
      evaluating this device among pregnant women and healthcare professionals 4 years after its&#xD;
      implementation. On the other hand, it will make it possible to look for a possible link&#xD;
      between the realization of an oral prenatal follow-up and the outcome of the pregnancy.&#xD;
