    <textblock>
      Surgery remains a main pillar in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (HNSCC). The margin status is the main prognostic factor of local tumor control in surgically&#xD;
      treated HNSCC and will determine the postoperative treatment strategy. A margin of ≤1 mm of&#xD;
      normal tissue is considered a positive margin and requires either a re-operation or&#xD;
      postoperative chemoradiation with a combination of cisplatin and 5-FU, which substantially&#xD;
      increases morbidity. Margins wider than 1 mm but less than 5 mm require re-operation, or, if&#xD;
      that is not possible, post-operative radiotherapy without the concomitant use of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Currently, no technology is available in the operating room, which reliably&#xD;
      supports tumor excision in terms of margin status. In fact, surgeons can only combine pre-&#xD;
      operative imaging data with tactile and visual information during surgery for assessing tumor&#xD;
      margins with limited accuracy. With the introduction of molecular imaging techniques using&#xD;
      near infrared (NIR) fluorescent optical contrast agents coupled to targeted compounds, new&#xD;
      avenues have opened up for intra-operative assessment of tumor margins. Tracers are based on&#xD;
      antibodies directed against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A, i.e.&#xD;
      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, in patients with breast cancer or against Epidermal Growth Factor&#xD;
      Receptor, i.e. cetuximab-IRDye800CW, in patients with HNSCC. First trials have shown that&#xD;
      systemic administration of these compounds is safe and tumor specific. These findings&#xD;

      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, in patients with breast cancer or against Epidermal Growth Factor&#xD;
      Receptor, i.e. cetuximab-IRDye800CW, in patients with HNSCC. First trials have shown that&#xD;
      systemic administration of these compounds is safe and tumor specific. These findings&#xD;
      prompted us to design this innovative application in a clinical trial for the intraoperative&#xD;
      assessment of tumor margins during surgical treatment of HNSCC using cetuximab-IRDye800CW.&#xD;
      The study is subsidized by the Dutch Cancer Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The main purpose is to establish the intraoperative use of cetuximab-IRDye800CW as&#xD;
      a reliable marker for residual tumor in resection margins after surgical removal of HNSCC.&#xD;
      The objective is to establish the positive predictive value of cetuximab-IRDye800CW&#xD;
      fluorescence as a marker for a tumor positive resection margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study is designed as a phase 1-2, single center prospective cross sectional&#xD;
      diagnostic study in patients with HNSCC that require surgical excision. First, a dose finding&#xD;
      study will be performed in 9 patients using 10, 25 and 50 mg of cetuximab-IRDye800CW with&#xD;
      three patients per dose cohort. In the first and only performed study at the University of&#xD;
      Alabama (UAB) using cetuximab-IRDye800CW in the visualization of HNSCC, the dose found to be&#xD;
      optimal was 25mg/m2. We therefore think that a sufficient dose will be found within the&#xD;
      proposed range. The most optimal dose from the three studied doses will be used in the second&#xD;
      part of the study which will include a cohort of 70 patients. The choice of&#xD;
      cetuximab-IRDye800CW dose will be a balance between the lowest dose vs. a clinically usable&#xD;
      tumor to background ration (TBR) on the fluorescence images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second phase of the study tumor margins will be studied in a cohort of 70 patients&#xD;
      to determine the positive predictive value of optical imaging to identify positive margins.&#xD;
      Based on historical data retrieved from our HNSCC database at UMCG we anticipate in a cohort&#xD;
      of 70 patients at least 14 (20%) margin-positive patients and a 90% EGFR overexpression rate.&#xD;
      We anticipate a sensitivity of 90% of the cetuximab-IRDye800CW conjugate based on the EGFR&#xD;
      overexpression rate, which we will be able to measure with sufficient precision ( 95%CI of&#xD;
      60-96%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients eligible for inclusion should suffer from a squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      in the head and neck region (HNSCC) of which the head and neck tumor board of the UMCG has&#xD;
      advised to be treated by surgical removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient related study procedures Tracer administration: patients will visit the hospital four&#xD;
      days prior to the planned surgery of their HNSCC. The cetuximab-IRDye800CW will be injected&#xD;
      by slow infusion and patients will be monitored for potential side effects. The dose will be&#xD;
      either 10, 25 or 50 mg of cetuximab-IRDye800CW which is less or equal to 10% of the dose of&#xD;
      cetuximab when used for curative treatment of HNSCC (usually 400mg/m2 loading dose and&#xD;
      250mg/m2 maintenance dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative fluorescence imaging, spectroscopy and assessment of tracer&#xD;
      concentration/stability Only during phase 1, patient will undergo pre-operative imaging and&#xD;
      spectroscopy measurement one day prior to surgery. Furthermore, 6 blood samples will be drawn&#xD;
      and tissue will be collected at different time point during the study for assessment of&#xD;
      tracer concentration/stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy Study aims: The aim is to identify&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma as fluorescent spots in the margin of a tumor resection specimen or&#xD;
      in the wound bed in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters: Fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy: Fluorescence images will provide an&#xD;
      overview of where cetuximab-IRDye800CW fluorescence is located in the resection specimen and&#xD;
      the wound bed in the patients. The intra operative camera is very sensitive for&#xD;
      cetuximab-IRDye800CW fluorescence. One drawback is that on the fluorescence image the exact&#xD;
      depth from which the fluorescence signal is generated cannot be established. Furthermore,&#xD;
      most likely there will be background fluorescence signals from normal tissue. Therefore,&#xD;
      confirmation of the fluorescence signal on images requires quantification of the fluorescence&#xD;
      signal. This can be performed by using a spectroscopy technique (MDSFR spectroscopy) that can&#xD;
      quantify (in M/m3) specifically IRDye800CW-fluorescence by placing a fiber tip in contact&#xD;
      with the tissue. This spectroscopy technique has a shallow sampling depth of 1-2 mm. If&#xD;
      fluorescence is generated from deeper layers, the signal of spectroscopy will be low (only&#xD;
      background signal from muscle, connective tissue and salivary glands). If the&#xD;
      IRDye800CW-fluorescence signal is generated from tumor in the resection margin the&#xD;
      fluorescence signal will be much higher because SCC-tumor cells overexpress EGFR. The&#xD;
      parameter that will be established is the threshold level at which background&#xD;
      cetuximab-IRDye800CW spectroscopy signal can be separated from much higher spectroscopy&#xD;
      signals of cetuximab-IRDye800CW accumulated in tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology: The tumor specimen will be processed for histology according to the current&#xD;
      standard used in clinical cancer care. Diagnosis on margins, selected histological features&#xD;
      necessary for clinical decision making will be provided. Next to this fluorescence images&#xD;
      will be collected from the tumor specimen and biopsies. Margin width and number of positive&#xD;
      margins will be noted and correlated to the location of fluorescent locations in the margins.&#xD;
      From this positive predictive value will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden, risks and benefit related to participation Burden - Time investment: Patients need to&#xD;
      make one extra visit to the UMCG four days before their planned surgery that will take&#xD;
      approximately 2 hours. Usually patients are admitted one day prior to the planned surgery.&#xD;
      Therefore the measurements one day before surgery will not require extra time investment&#xD;
      Burden-extra procedures: 1) Intravenous administration of cetuximab-IRDye800CW. 2)&#xD;
      Fluorescence images will be taken from the tumor one day prior to surgery in the first cohort&#xD;
      of nine patients. 3) The estimated time for taking fluorescence images and spectroscopy&#xD;
      measurements is approximately 30min. Therefore the time under general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      prolonged. The usual time of surgical procedures for removal of HNSCC ranges from 2 hours to&#xD;
      15 hours, depending on complexity of the surgical procedure. 4) from the wound bed in the&#xD;
      patient that exists after tumor excision, biopsies will be taken in the ongoing general&#xD;
      anesthesia, of spots positive of cetuximab-IRDye800CW as seen on the fluorescence imaging and&#xD;
      confirmed by spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: Allergic reactions to cetuximab have been reported but this is considered a low risk.&#xD;
      No preclinical or clinical study reported higher than grade 2 adverse events. the first study&#xD;
      with cetuximab-IRDye800CW no serious events were reported in six patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit: Patients will have no benefit from this study directly. Surgery will be planned as&#xD;
      usual. During surgery, no decisions will be made based on the fluorescence imaging. The&#xD;
      benefit of this study will be the establishment of usefulness of cetuximab-IRDye800CW during&#xD;
      surgery to identify margins containing tumors. The results of these types of study will be at&#xD;
      least beneficial for other patients with cancer in the future. Clinical experience will be&#xD;
      obtained with fluorescent labeled antibody in intra operative margin assessment during&#xD;
      surgery of HNSCC.&#xD;
