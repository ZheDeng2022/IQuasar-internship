  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study that will be open label and include a total of five patients who&#xD;
      will receive the investigational product. These patients will have histological testing to&#xD;
      rule out competing etiologies and require 3rd party adjudication/confirmation on agreement of&#xD;
      the diagnosis. These patients will undergo 12 weeks of ixekizumab dosed every 2 weeks with&#xD;
      follow-up until week 16.&#xD;

    <description>We have received funding for only a small pilot study to prove a benefit from Interleukin-17 inhibition in Pyoderma Gangranosum . Therefore, there is only one treatment arm. The primary outcome will be a comparison of week 12 to baseline regarding a two-point improvement in the Investigator Global Assessment.</description>

             determined by the investigator and an external reviewer on the basis of results from&#xD;
             clinical, histological and laboratory assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At screening, have a Pyoderma Gangrenosum ulcer characterized by 'item a' AND 3/5&#xD;
             features in 'item b' OR 2/5 features in 'item b' with support from one of the&#xD;
             conditions listed in c.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Stable or increasing size within 2 months preceding screening by patient report or&#xD;
             documentation b. Features such as violaceous border, undermining, d. Intralesional&#xD;
             corticosteroids within 8 weeks of day 0; topical immunomodulators are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             e. Wound debridement within 2 weeks of Day 0; dressing changes allowed per&#xD;
             investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             g. Systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks of Day 0 h. Live, attenuated vaccines within 3&#xD;
             months of Day 0; or live, seasonal-flu- or H1N1 vaccines within 2 weeks of Day 0.&#xD;
             Note: recombinant- and/or killed vaccines are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Hyperbaric treatment within 4 weeks of Day 0 j. Investigational drug or&#xD;
             investigational device within 30 days or 5 half-lives of Day 0, whichever is longer k.&#xD;
             Prior exposure to ixekizumab l. Other treatments not described above should be&#xD;
             maintained at a stable dose and frequency throughout the study as best as possible 13.&#xD;
             Major, general surgery within 3 months of screening, or anticipated general surgery&#xD;
             during the study period 14. Pregnancy, plans to become pregnant during the course of&#xD;
             the study, delivery within 3 months of screening, or breast-feeding 15. If previous&#xD;
             use of cyclosporine or systemic corticosteroids, failure to have any&#xD;
             stabilization/response is exclusionary. This potentially indicates the disease is not&#xD;
             Pyoderma Gangrenosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  consent, may put the subject at significant risk, may jeopardize the subject's&#xD;
                  safety after exposure to the study drug, may confound the study results, or may&#xD;
                  interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. History of malignancy within 2 years of screening other than carcinoma in situ of&#xD;

                  spontaneously, as confirmed by HCV PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction to monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Systemic infection (excluding wound colonization) requiring oral antibiotics&#xD;

                       medication (including cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate,&#xD;
                       mycophenolate mofetil, apremilast, dapsone, or corticosteroids) within 2&#xD;

&#xD;
                    3. Systemic corticosteroids &gt; 20 mg per day (prednisone or prednisone&#xD;
