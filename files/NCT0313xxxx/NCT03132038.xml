      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, phase II study in patients&#xD;
      who are suffering from recurrent and/or metastatic Salivary Glands Carcinoma, who have&#xD;
      progressed during the 6 months period before entering the study and who are eligible for&#xD;
      nivolumab monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will receive nivolumab treatment for a maximum of 12 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment. 92 eligible patients will be dosed with nivolumab intravenously over 60 minutes (±&#xD;
      5 minutes) at 3 mg/kg every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each 28-day dosing period will constitute a cycle.&#xD;

    <description>Developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <time_frame>The time from the date of first dose until the end of treatment, assessed up to 84 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This EORTC head &amp; neck cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.&#xD;
The head &amp; neck cancer module is a 35-item questionnaire designed for use among a wide range of patients with head &amp; neck cancer, varying in disease stage and treatment modality. It includes 7 multi-item scales that assess pain (4 items), swallowing (4 items), senses (2 items), speech (3 items), social eating (4 items), social contact (5 items), and sexuality (2 items). There are also 11 single items. Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems.</description>
