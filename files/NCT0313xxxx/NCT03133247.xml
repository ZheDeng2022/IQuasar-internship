  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many types of human tumors, PD-L1 is highly expressed. Such high expression has often been&#xD;
      associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. SHR-1316 is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that binds specifically to human PD-L1.&#xD;

      This is a two-part, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation, Phase I study&#xD;
      of repeated doses of SHR-1316 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have&#xD;
      failed current standard anti-tumor therapies.&#xD;

                  for subjects with liver metastases, ALT and AST ≤5× ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5×ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (using&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who fulfill any of the following criteria at screening will be ineligible to&#xD;
        participate in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known history of hypersensitivity to any components of the SHR-1316 product;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any investigational or concurrent cancer therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, hormone therapy, or target therapy), administered within 4 weeks or 5&#xD;
             half-lives, whichever is longer, before the first dose of SHR-1316; or within 6 weeks&#xD;
             in the case of certain therapies (e.g., extensive radiotherapy, major surgery,&#xD;
             mitomycin C and nitrosoureas). Any such, prior systemic therapy needs to be outside of&#xD;
             five half-lives, unless discussed and explained with the sponsor. Any AEs from prior&#xD;
             therapy must have returned to ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE level;&#xD;

             cerebral edema, steroid requirement, or progressive disease. Prior treated brain or&#xD;
             meningeal metastases must be clinically stable (MRI) for at least 8 weeks and off&#xD;
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids (&lt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for&#xD;
             at least 4 weeks before study drug administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant cardiovascular condition, including: (1) history of congestive&#xD;
             heart failure (NYHA Class &gt;2), (2) history of unstable angina, (3) myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within the past 12 months, or (4) history of supraventricular arrhythmia or&#xD;
             ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment or intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is&#xD;
             clinically meaningful:&#xD;
&#xD;
             • For example, a screening QTcF interval that is prolonged (&gt;450 milliseconds [msec]&#xD;
             in males; &gt;470 msec in females).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active infection or an unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during screening visits or on the&#xD;
             first scheduled day of dosing (at the discretion of the investigator, subjects with&#xD;
             tumor fever may be enrolled);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of immunodeficiency including seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV), or other acquired or congenital immune-deficient disease, or any active&#xD;
             systemic viral infection requiring therapy (e.g., hepatitis B or C);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any other medical (e.g., pulmonary, metabolic, congenital, endocrinal or CNS disease,&#xD;
             etc.), psychiatric, or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to&#xD;
             interfere with a subject's rights, safety, welfare or ability to sign informed&#xD;
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation&#xD;
             of the results.&#xD;
