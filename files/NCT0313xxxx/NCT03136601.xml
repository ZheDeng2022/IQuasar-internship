  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of the standard monthly&#xD;
      maintenance therapy for percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), to sessions as the&#xD;
      patient needs (prn) between 2 weeks and 12 weeks, based on overactive bladder symptoms. This&#xD;
      is study is to help determine feasibility for conducting a larger trial that is appropriately&#xD;
      powered to provide meaningful data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient will be recruited from the Urogynecology clinic on the first floor of the hospital.&#xD;
      Patients who have completed 12 weeks of PTNS therapy will be identified by the clinic nurse&#xD;
      or nurse practitioner and then a member of the research team will approach the patient&#xD;
      regarding involvement in the study. Patients will be asked if they would like to take part in&#xD;
      this study and will be given the human bill of rights and well as consent forms in their&#xD;
      preferred language (English or Spanish) if they agree to participate. Once they agree to&#xD;
      participate, they will be asked to sign the consent forms in a private patient room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study for feasibility designed as an equivalence and cost analysis study.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at the 12th session of PTNS (conclusion of treatment and before&#xD;
      maintenance therapy starts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be from the Urogynecology clinic at Harbor UCLA Medical Center who have OAB and&#xD;
      who have been treated with the standard 12 sessions of PTNS. Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      &quot;every month PTNS maintenance&quot; or &quot;as needed PTNS maintenance (Q2-12 weeks).&quot; At enrollment,&#xD;
      questions will be read to patients in either Spanish or English based on patient's preferred&#xD;
      language and study staff will fill out the surveys for the patient. The patient with the&#xD;
      study staff will complete the validated questionnaires, Overactive Bladder Questionnaire&#xD;
      (OAB-q), the Benefit, Satisfaction and Willingness to Continue the Treatment questionnaire&#xD;
      (BSW) and the Visual analogue scale for satisfaction with treatment. Urinary symptoms will be&#xD;
      measured by the validated Overactive Bladder Symptom Scale (OAB-SS) and a modified voiding&#xD;
      diary. All patients will have a urine dip completed at this visit to rule out a bladder&#xD;
      infection. Finally patients, with the help of study staff, will answer open ended questions.&#xD;
      All of these measures will be repeated 3 months after enrollment and one year from&#xD;
      enrollment. After the yearlong study, participants can continue treatment which will be&#xD;
      decided by the patient and treating clinician. A cost analysis will compare the cost to&#xD;
      patients and the cost to the clinic between the monthly PTNS maintenance group and the&#xD;
      patient prn maintenance group. All of the above measures will be recorded at enrollment, 3&#xD;
      months from enrollment and 1 year from enrollment. This will be done in person with the help&#xD;
      of the study staff at enrollment and either in person, via the phone or in writing at 3 month&#xD;
      and 1 year follow up. No payment and no other recruitment methods will be used.&#xD;
