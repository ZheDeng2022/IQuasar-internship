  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our prior study on the therapeutic mechanism of UCB, changes in cytokine levels were&#xD;
      observed but the results are inconclusive and further studies on animal models and changes of&#xD;
      protein expression before and after UCB therapy in the clinical settings are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in protein expression will be assessed by multiplex RT-PCR mRNA assay. Clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of UCB therapy will be evaluated with various functional assessment tools. Factors&#xD;
      regarding UCB therapy (number of transplanted cells, HLA matching status, serum level of&#xD;
      immunosuppressant, etc.) and patient factors (age, functional status, etc.) will be analyzed&#xD;
      for correlation with protein expression after UCB therapy. Several target proteins for&#xD;
      analysis are available. Pentraxin and toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 are receptors modulating&#xD;
      intrinsic immune reaction and was shown to have a significant correlation with clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of stem cell therapy. Ubiquitine is a regulatory protein that combines with the&#xD;
      target protein and affects its degradation, interaction, localization and activation. The&#xD;
      ubiquitine system controls total protein quantity for homeostasis and can be found in all&#xD;
      tissues. Deubiquitination (DUB) enzyme down-regulates this ubiquitine and is known to&#xD;
      modulate all cellular changes&#xD;

    <description>UCB with total nucleated cell count ≤ 7x108/kg will be used for this clinical trial. Suitable UCB (i.e., containing total nucleated cell count ≥2x107/kg with three or less mismatch among HLA-A, -B, and -DR) will be selected. This criterion was selected upon the rationale that even though minimal HLA mismatch is preferred, prior studies indicate significant effects of UCB therapy for patients with 3 HLA mismatches.</description>
