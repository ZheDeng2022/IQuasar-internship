      This study will investigate cortical stimulation to treat mood and behavioral symptoms in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression, anxiety and impulse control disorders are among the most prominent&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) that greatly impact patients' and&#xD;
      caregivers' quality of life. However, the neural correlate underlying these symptoms is still&#xD;
      largely unknown preventing the development of comprehensive treatment for these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to 1) Determine the neural correlates of non-motor symptoms, 2)&#xD;
      Determine how cortical stimulation can reduce these symptoms and normalize the abnormal brain&#xD;
      signals, 3) Develop closed-loop stimulation paradigms and 4) Teach patients how to&#xD;
      voluntarily modulate the abnormal brain signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten PD patients undergoing deep brain surgery (DBS) implantation and diagnosed with mild to&#xD;
      moderate mood disorder and/or impulsive behavior will be enrolled in this study. In addition&#xD;
      to the standard therapeutic DBS electrode used to treat motor symptoms, a flexible electrode&#xD;
      will be placed over the prefrontal cortex. Both electrodes will be attached to the Medtronic&#xD;
      Activa PC+S pulse generator (and Medtronic Summit RC+S pulse generator as replacements),&#xD;
      investigational devices that allows therapeutic stimulation and chronic brain recordings. At&#xD;
      multiple time points, up to 2 years post-implantation, in our clinic or patient's home, brain&#xD;
      signals will be recorded while patients are resting or performing emotion/cognition tasks.&#xD;
      Symptoms will be assessed using validated questionnaires and tasks to allow identification of&#xD;
      neurophysiological correlates of non-motor symptoms. There is also an optional sleep study&#xD;
      included for better understanding of the brain's physiology. The investigators will then&#xD;
      investigate the effect of cortical stimulation on both symptoms severity and brain signals&#xD;
      that may be related to symptom expression. These signals will then be used to implement&#xD;
      closed-loop controlled cortical stimulation and neuro-feedback controlled strategies.&#xD;
