    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to monitor the response from the cochlea as the electrode&#xD;
      is inserted during the operation to receive a cochlear implant. The Cochlear Response&#xD;
      Telemetry tool aims to measure the response from the cells within the cochlea and may be&#xD;
      useful in the future to help to improve the surgical technique and potentially help surgeons&#xD;
      better preserve any natural hearing that is available. The measurements are obtained using&#xD;
      the cochlear implant and sound processor while a sound is presented to the ear through an&#xD;
      earphone (like an earplug) placed into the ear canal.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Low-frequency Hearing Thresholds Assessed Audiometrically Pre- and Post-operatively.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline measurement (pre-operatively) compared to 4 to 6 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Average low-frequency (LF) hearing thresholds (average thresholds at 500, 750, and 1000 Hz) will be measured for the implanted ear 4 to 6 weeks following surgery and compared with average LF hearing thresholds measured relative to the pre-operative baseline measured within 90 days of CI surgery. The outcome measure of interest is the change in average LF hearing thresholds pre- to postoperative for each subject. The average change observed for individual subjects will then be compared with individual electrophysiological cochlear microphonic (CM) measures made during the surgery using the Cochlear Response Telemetry System. Of specific interest is whether or not compromised CM measures relate to pre-to-postoperative changes in low-frequency hearing. In other words, are larger changes in average LF hearing thresholds observed in subjects with compromised CM measures made intraoperative versus those with uncompromised CM response?</description>

    <measure>Change in Low-frequency Hearing Thresholds Assessed Audiometrically Pre- and Post-operatively.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-operative) compared to 3 months post cochlear implant activation</time_frame>
    <description>Average low-frequency (LF) hearing thresholds (average thresholds at 500, 750, and 1000 Hz) will be measured for the implanted ear 3 months following cochlear implant activation and compared with average LF hearing thresholds measured preoperatively. The outcome measure of interest is the change in average LF hearing thresholds pre- to postoperative for each subject. The average change observed for individual subjects will then be compared with individual electrophysiological cochlear microphonic (CM) measures made during the surgery using the Cochlear Response Telemetry System.

    <measure>Correlation of Preoperative High-frequency Hearing Thresholds and Cochlear Microphonic Response (Number of Electrodes Inserted When CM Detected).</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The onset of the cochlear microphonic (CM) response will be measured intraoperative to determine if there is a relationship between the onset of the CM response during electrode insertion and the preoperative high-frequency acoustic hearing thresholds. The onset of the CM response will be tracked by impedance measures that are interleaved with the CM recordings. As each electrode in the array enters the perilymph in the cochlea there will be a measured reduction in impedance. CM onset will be defined in terms of the nth electrode (out of the 22 electrodes) to enter the cochlea. Preoperative high-frequency hearing will be defined as the average of preoperative thresholds at frequencies of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz for each individual subject.</description>

        <title>Change in Low-frequency Hearing Thresholds Assessed Audiometrically Pre- and Post-operatively.</title>
        <description>Average low-frequency (LF) hearing thresholds (average thresholds at 500, 750, and 1000 Hz) will be measured for the implanted ear 4 to 6 weeks following surgery and compared with average LF hearing thresholds measured relative to the pre-operative baseline measured within 90 days of CI surgery. The outcome measure of interest is the change in average LF hearing thresholds pre- to postoperative for each subject. The average change observed for individual subjects will then be compared with individual electrophysiological cochlear microphonic (CM) measures made during the surgery using the Cochlear Response Telemetry System. Of specific interest is whether or not compromised CM measures relate to pre-to-postoperative changes in low-frequency hearing. In other words, are larger changes in average LF hearing thresholds observed in subjects with compromised CM measures made intraoperative versus those with uncompromised CM response?</description>

        <description>The onset of the cochlear microphonic (CM) response will be measured intraoperative to determine if there is a relationship between the onset of the CM response during electrode insertion and the preoperative high-frequency acoustic hearing thresholds. The onset of the CM response will be tracked by impedance measures that are interleaved with the CM recordings. As each electrode in the array enters the perilymph in the cochlea there will be a measured reduction in impedance. CM onset will be defined in terms of the nth electrode (out of the 22 electrodes) to enter the cochlea. Preoperative high-frequency hearing will be defined as the average of preoperative thresholds at frequencies of 2 kHz, 3 kHz and 4 kHz for each individual subject.</description>

        <population>40 data points with a CM response were eligible to be analysed for this outcome. Those excluded were due to an absence of CM under visual inspection (n =16), an absence of the impedance measurement used to calculate depth (n = 4), or an array that was withdrawn or reinserted at any time (n = 5).</population>
