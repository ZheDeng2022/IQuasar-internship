      Aim: To investigate the effect of pre-operative exercise on hemodynamics in the fistula&#xD;
      artery and vein, pre and post AV fistula formation as well as the suitability of cannulation&#xD;
      of AV fistula at 8weeks post sugery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a randomised control study with 20 patients each in the exercise arm and&#xD;
      the control arm. The subjects will be randomised 1:1 into one of the two groups. Chronic&#xD;
      Kidney failure patients with eGFR less than 20mls/min and have chosen Haemodialysis as their&#xD;
      modality of renal replacement therapy will be included the study. All the subjects will have&#xD;
      an ultrasound doppler vein mapping done prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol for the intervention group will be to squeeze a soft ball 10 times for&#xD;
      set and perform 3 sets of 10 squeezes each at an 1 minute interval. Three sets of exercises&#xD;
      to be performed twice in the morning and twice in the evening, for a total of six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have a follow up ultrasound doppler of the AV fistula at 8 weeks and 16&#xD;
      weeks post-surgery, looking at the AV fistula vein diameter, arterial diameter and blood flow&#xD;
      rate. All the subjects will also be seen by a single vascular surgeon following the scan, to&#xD;
      assess the suitability for AVF cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the proposed study and benefits: A well functioning arterio-venous fistula is&#xD;
      the gold standard vascular access for Hemodialysis patients due to its low rates of&#xD;
      complications. The primary failure rate of the AVFs remain high at around 20 -25%,&#xD;
      contributed by several factors including the diameter of the vessels. If pre-operative&#xD;
      exercise improves the hemodynamics of the AV fistula and aids the maturation rate in our&#xD;
      study, it can be incorporated into clinical guidelines to reduce the primary failure rate of&#xD;
      AV fistulas.&#xD;
