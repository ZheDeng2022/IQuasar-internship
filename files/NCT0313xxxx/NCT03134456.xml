  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, single arm study in patients with metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 after failure of platinum-based combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with Pembrolizumab according to the dosage and administration in&#xD;
      Product Information of Keytruda in Korea (2mg/kg) until it is changed to 200mg flat dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient should have their-own patient-derived xenograft (PDX) before enrollment of the&#xD;
      study. The PDX will be used to set up their humanized CD34 PDX (Hu-CD34 PDX).&#xD;

      Part A: Clinical trial (single arm study) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 after failure of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: PDX experiment using Hu-CD34 PDX model in specific population selected from Part A&#xD;
      (Clinical trial part) - responder and non-responder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vivo experiment using Hu-CD34 PDX will be done for about seven subjects, and thirty-two&#xD;
      (32) Hu-CD34 PDX mice will be established from single patient to see in-vivo response. This&#xD;
      research using PDX (Part B) will be conducted sequentially on clinical trial part in&#xD;
      selected-population based on clinical response of Pembrolizumab.&#xD;
