  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to establish a research project to test the impact of gaming by&#xD;
      carrying out a digital gaming interventions, monitoring its cognitive and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      while concurrently performing a multimodal brain imaging experiment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the gaming intervention will be assessed using a controlled, controlled,&#xD;
      single-blind clinical trial with a pragmatic, three-arm parallel-group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Participants will be randomised into three groups: Cognitive training&#xD;
      (intervention group, CogniFit, N=78), entertainment video gaming (active control group,&#xD;
      SIMS4, N=78) and treatment as usual (a passive control group, N=78). The mechanism of&#xD;
      CogniFit (intervention) lies on the evidence for computerised exercises focusing on auditory&#xD;
      and verbal processing, which are likely to yield improved verbal learning and memory and&#xD;
      activate reward systems of the brain that drive brain plasticity in adults with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. SIMS4 game (active control) offers entertainment without any known cognitive&#xD;
      or health-related outcome. The data collection, subject recruitment and training will be&#xD;
      carried out in an outpatient psychiatric units or outpatient clinics, mental health&#xD;
      associations, and residential homes in Hong Kong. The study is aimed for patients' diagnoses&#xD;
      of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: An extended informed consent process will be used. The health service's medical&#xD;
      records at the study site will be screened by the authority of the staff of the organisation.&#xD;
      Patients will be screened to determine their eligibility for study participation. Eligible&#xD;
      participant will first receive a short leaflet of the study from the staff or during a short&#xD;
      information session organised for the participants to consider their availability. If an&#xD;
      eligible patient shows interest, more detailed written and oral information will be shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent forms (two identical copies), baseline data with background&#xD;
      information, Intelligence Quotient (IQ, if available) and MMSE will be collected to show&#xD;
      evidence of the participants' capacity to give informed consent. Medication dosage&#xD;
      [chlorpromazine equivalence] will be collected as some medications currently used in&#xD;
      schizophrenia may affect the response to cognitive training strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will continue until the required sample size has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: After baseline data collection, the Trial Manager will be informed (by email,&#xD;
      text message, WhatsApp) about a new participant and he/she will allocate the participant to&#xD;
      one of the three arms based on a list of computer-generated random numbers provided by an&#xD;
      external clinical trial randomisation service (blocks of 6 consecutive patients, a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio). Allocation will be masked to the outcome assessors, and the trial statistician, but&#xD;
      it cannot be masked from the RAs who recruit the patients and the treatment staff working&#xD;
      with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For neuroimaging assessment (EEG, fMRI, resting state), a sub-sample from our total sample&#xD;
      will be randomised at baseline. Randomisation will be based on a list of computer-generated&#xD;
      random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis and sample size: The investigators calculated the sample size based on (1) the&#xD;
      number of actual pairwise tests to be made for the efficacy of the primary outcome and (2)&#xD;
      the two-level modelling approach in the final data analysis, in which the type I error has&#xD;
      been adjusted. The statistical efficiency will be ensured using the MANOVA method for&#xD;
      multiple group comparison. First, given that video gaming is a fairly novel strategy, the&#xD;
      investigators will base the sample size calculation (a priori) on a cognitive-efficacy&#xD;
      meta-analysis for patients with schizophrenia showing and overall effect size (ES, Cohens' D)&#xD;
      of 0.58 on verbal working memory (a primary outcome). Based on our hypothesis, the primary&#xD;
      endpoints are the effects in verbal working memory at 3 and 6 months of cognitive training in&#xD;
      the gaming group, in comparison with the other two groups: cognitive training vs.&#xD;
      entertainment gaming, cognitive training vs. non-gaming control group. Four pairwise&#xD;
      interactions between the contrast of the two comparisons and the two time points will be&#xD;
      tested. For multiple comparison tests of four, for a type I error level of 5% (two-sided), an&#xD;
      adjusted significant level should be = (1- (1- 0.05)4) /2 = 0.01274 /2 = 0.0064, and the&#xD;
      corresponding z score for a one-sided test is 2.49. Given the effect size 0.58, assuming&#xD;
      equal sample size of the three groups, with a statistical power of 0.8 and = 0.01274, the&#xD;
      investigators require at least 198 subjects (66 per group) by applying the equation, 2(Z1- +&#xD;
      Z1- /2)2 / ES2. According to a meta-analysis,40 the total sample size in previous cognitive&#xD;
      training studies has typically been 50 (range 10-138).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using evidence-based rationale for patient flow in this study, the investigators can assume&#xD;
      that about 60% of patients that will be screened will not be eligible for the study due to&#xD;
      age or lack of capacity to participate in the study. Based on the literature, about 45% of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia will refuse to participate in the RCT studies, and 16% will&#xD;
      drop-out during the course of intervention. Thus, the investigators need a total of 234&#xD;
      participants to be randomply allocated to three study groups, and 198 participants in&#xD;
      follow-ups. Based on this knowledge, a total of 985 subjects need to be approached. The&#xD;
      numbers are realistic given that the total number of patients with schizophrenia in our study&#xD;
      sites is about 5,500, and the total number of schizophrenia patients in Hong Kong is 40,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, for neuroimaging assessment, a sub-sample of 126 participants from our total sample&#xD;
      (N = 198) will need (63%) to be randomised at baseline. Randomisation will be based on a list&#xD;
      of computer-generated random numbers. The investigators assume that 30% will drop-out between&#xD;
      baseline and the 3-month follow-up assessment, which leave us with 29 patients in each group&#xD;
      (totally 87 participants at baseline). The sample size will be appropriate for our&#xD;
      neuroimaging assessment; the average number of participants in RCT studies assessing patient&#xD;
      cognition or changes in brain structure has been about 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also verify whether the interventions have been delivered as designed&#xD;
      (intervention fidelity). Therefore, patient gaming logs (gaming frequency [number of gaming&#xD;
      sessions per week], the length of each session [minutes], number of drop-outs) and patient&#xD;
      gaming diaries including descriptions of possible strengths and limitations of the&#xD;
      interventions will be analysed with the content analysis based on the data to be collected&#xD;
      from patient diaries.&#xD;
