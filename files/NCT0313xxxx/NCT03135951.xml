  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a fixed dose of&#xD;
      SPI-2012 in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving docetaxel and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      (TC) chemotherapy, as measured by the serum concentration of SPI-2012 on specific days&#xD;
      following drug administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-arm multicenter study to evaluate the PK and safety of SPI-2012 (a&#xD;
      long acting myeloid growth factor) in breast cancer patients treated with TC chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle will be 21 days and patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with 2 additional&#xD;
      cycles based on the investigator's discretion. On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will receive&#xD;
      TC chemotherapy and on Day 2 of each cycle, patients will receive SPI-2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics will be evaluated only in Cycles 1 and 3.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or study procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is any AE that occurs from the first dose of study treatment through 35 (±5) days after the date of patient early discontinuation.</description>

    <description>A linear mixed effects modeling approach will be used to quantify the relationship between the plasma concentrations of SPI-2012 and change from baseline in QT intervals (∆QTc). Plasma concentration, intercept, and subject are to be included as random effects.</description>
