  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, the French population over 75 years of age was 9%; It will be 13% in 2030 and 19% in&#xD;
      2050 according to estimates. The incidence of falls is high in the elderly population, with&#xD;
      at least one fall per year for one-third of the over-65s and for half of the over-80s. These&#xD;
      data are consistent with the international medical literature, particularly in Japan, the&#xD;
      United States and France, with a high rate of recurrence from the first fall. Falling is a&#xD;
      complex phenomenon that is of great importance in terms of morbidity and mortality since it&#xD;
      can be followed by serious complications: failure to recover, recurrences, trauma (fractures,&#xD;
      hematomas, wounds), complications of decubitus and ulcers, Immobilization, loss of autonomy,&#xD;
      hospitalization, institutionalization, psychological complications (post-fall syndrome,&#xD;
      depressive syndrome), death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fall risk factors are well known and described and relayed by learned societies of geriatrics&#xD;
      and medical literature. In addition, HAS reported on this issue in 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SFGG) defines fragility as a clinical&#xD;
      syndrome that reflects a decrease in reserve physiological capacities that alters the coping&#xD;
      mechanisms of stress. Its clinical expression is modulated by comorbidities and&#xD;
      psychological, social, economic and behavioral factors. Frailty syndrome is a risk marker for&#xD;
      mortality and pejorative events, including disability, falls, hospitalization and&#xD;
      institutionalization. The fall and its complications are closely related to the fragility&#xD;
      syndrome. The very fragile patient must take an active part in his own care. He is the first&#xD;
      advocate of fall prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand medical desertification and the low number of geriatricians makes this&#xD;
      implication problematic even more so if the person is isolated or has cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is important to make the patient actor of his own prevention. This is the&#xD;
      first study to describe the knowledge of older adults about their own risk of falling.&#xD;
