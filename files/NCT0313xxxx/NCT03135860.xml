    <textblock>
      The objective of this exploratory study is to examine the utility of high resolution computed&#xD;
      tomography (HRCT) to measure changes in functional pulmonary imaging parameters as a function&#xD;
      of long term iNO administrationusing the device INOpulse for 4 weeks in relation to Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcome (PRO) and exercise tolerance in subjects with WHO Group 3 PH associated with&#xD;
      COPD on LTOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes from baseline to 4 weeks of pulsed iNO and after 2 weeks of withdrawal from pulsed&#xD;
      iNO will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as systolic pulmonary arterial pressure&#xD;
      (sPAP) ≥ 38 mmHg by 2-D echocardiogram with Doppler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NO cylinder concentrations (4880 ppm) at a dose of 30 mcg/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW)/hr&#xD;
      (INOpulse setting of 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr) will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening visit all the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will return to the site for visit 1. During visit 1 baseline HRCT scans with&#xD;
      contrast agent will be obtained at Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) and Total Lung Capacity&#xD;
      (TLC). Before the scans are taken a urine pregnancy test will be obtained in female patients&#xD;
      with childbearing potential. A retest of the eGFR CKD-EPI value should also be performed&#xD;
      before administering the contrast agent, if there is a clinical indication according to the&#xD;
      investigator. The treatment will be started after all baseline assessments (physical&#xD;
      examination, patency of nares, eGFR CKD-EPI determination, urine pregnancy test, HRCT scans,&#xD;
      vital signs including oxygen saturation measurement, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Arterial Blood&#xD;
      Gas (ABG), MetHb, 6-minutes walking distance (6MWD) (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg&#xD;
      Category Ratio (Borg CR10) leg fatigue and dyspnea scale will be executed and during the 6MWD&#xD;
      the oxygen saturation will be measured), PRO, spirometry). A second TLC and FRC scan with&#xD;
      contrast agent during the iNO treatment will be taken. The scans will be taken whilst the&#xD;
      patient is under iNO treatment for at least 20 minutes on the iNOpulse specific cannula.&#xD;
      After the scans taken during the iNO treatment are performed some of the baseline assessments&#xD;
      will be repeated whilst the patient is on iNO treatment (vital signs including oxygen&#xD;
      saturation measurement, ABG, MetHb, 6MWD (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg CR10 leg fatigue&#xD;
      and dyspnea scale will be executed and during the 6MWD the oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      measured), PRO, spirometry). During visit 1 the investigator will discontinue iNO to assess&#xD;
      if rebound pulmonary hypertension occurs. In the first 2 patients, iNO therapy will be&#xD;
      discontinued while 2D echo is performed to assess sPAP. Furthermore, NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be&#xD;
      measured. In the remaining patients the following additional safety assessments (NIBP, HR,&#xD;
      SpO2) will be performed while the patient is discontinued at least 20 minutes of iNO. If the&#xD;
      investigator considers it is safe to restart the iNO-therapy, the patient will start chronic&#xD;
      iNO treatment. After the results of the safety assessments of the 2 first patients are&#xD;
      collected a safety meeting will be held to evaluate the results. Depending on the results,&#xD;
      the additional 2D echo may be performed in additional patients. Subjects will be contacted&#xD;
      via telephone or e-mail ± 24 hours after visit 1, for assessment of vital status, concomitant&#xD;
      medications and the occurrence of new AEs or worsening of previously existing recorded AEs&#xD;
      and PRO (= visit 2). After 2 weeks of treatment of iNO with a dosage of 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr&#xD;
      during at least 12 hours a day patients will be asked to return to the site for visit 3.&#xD;
      During that visit following measurements will be performed: patency of nares will be checked,&#xD;
      vital signs including oxygen saturation measurement, MetHb, 6MWD (with Borg CR10 leg fatigue&#xD;
      and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation measurement), PRO and AE assessment. After 4 weeks&#xD;
      treatment visit 4 will be conducted. 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler (immediately after the&#xD;
      2D - echocardiogram with Doppler NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be measured) and HRCT scans with&#xD;
      contrast agent under iNO pulse will be taken. Before the scans are taken an urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be obtained, if applicable. A retest of the eGFR CKD-EPI value should also be&#xD;
      performed before administering the contrast agent, if there is a clinical indication&#xD;
      according to the investigator. Spirometry assessments will be performed, patency of nares,&#xD;
      ECG, ABG, MetHb, 6MWD (with Borg CR10 fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen saturation&#xD;
      measurement), PRO will be assessed. After all assessments are completed, iNO will be&#xD;
      discontinued. Twenty minutes after discontinuation of iNO-therapy, spirometry, PRO, MetHb,&#xD;
      6MWD (before and after the 6 MWD a Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale will be executed&#xD;
      and during the 6MWD the oxygen saturation will be measured) and 2D-echocardiogram with&#xD;
      Doppler measurements measurement will be repeated. Vital signs with oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      measured immediately after the 2D-echocardiogram with Doppler. After all the assessments the&#xD;
      patient is placed back on his/her prescribed dose of LTOT using their usual cannula. The&#xD;
      patient will be assessed for any signs of acute withdrawal. Therefore vital signs including&#xD;
      oxygen saturation will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 5, two weeks after discontinuation of iNO treatment repeat vital signs with oxygen&#xD;
      saturation measurement, physical examination, patency of nares, spirometry, 2D-echocardiogram&#xD;
      with Doppler (immediately after the 2D - echocardiogram with Doppler NIBP, HR, SpO2 will be&#xD;
      measured), ABG, MetHb, 6MWD(with Borg CR10 leg fatigue and dyspnea scale and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation measurement), and PRO will be performed. If applicable a last urine pregnancy test&#xD;
      will be executed to make sure no pregnancy occurred during the study. If there are no&#xD;
      follow-up actions for a patient at this visit, it will be considered as a completion of study&#xD;
      participation / end of study for that particular patient.&#xD;
