  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability. The objectives of treatment are to&#xD;
      reduce pain, improve function, and slow down further breakdown of the knee. Recently,&#xD;
      research on nonsurgical treatment options for knee OA has increased significantly. One&#xD;
      potential treatment of interest is the use of stem cell injections. Stem cells are one's own&#xD;
      cells that have the ability to divide into other types of cells, and may cause regrowth of&#xD;
      cartilage when injected into the knee. There have been few, but promising, studies that show&#xD;
      improvements in pain and function with stem cell injections in those with knee OA. Therefore,&#xD;
      more research is needed to identify patients who might benefit from this injection. This&#xD;
      pilot study will look at changes in pain and function for 20 patients at 1, 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months after a stem cell injection into the knee. Patients will also undergo magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging at 6 months and 12 months following the injection.&#xD;
