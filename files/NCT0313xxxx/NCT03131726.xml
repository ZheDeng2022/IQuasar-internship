    <textblock>
      In an investigator initiated multicenter trial (Malmö, Odense, Århus) the investigators aim&#xD;
      at evaluating activity of Graves´ophthalmopathy (GO) and progress to severe GO in patients&#xD;
      with mild to moderate Graves´ ophthalmopathy treated with simvastatin or no treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progression of GO from mild-moderate to severe disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for start of treatment with corticosteroids, retrobulbar irradiation, or orbital&#xD;
      decompression are severe soft tissue swelling (NO SPECS class 2c), risk of corneal ulcers&#xD;
      with or without exophthalmos, double vision within 30 degrees, and optic nerve dysfunction.&#xD;
      Patients who progress will be followed until the end of the study with the ongoing randomized&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients may withdraw from the trial at any time without any consequences for their&#xD;
           future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients may be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator if judged&#xD;
           to be non-compliant with trial procedures or due to safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients must be withdrawn from the trial if they become pregnant or develop congestive&#xD;
           heart failure, renal insufficiency, coagulopathy, gastric ulcer, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
           disease, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, severe myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations before randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TSH, fT4, fT3, TRAb, TPOAb, p-glucose, HbA1c, creatinine or cystatin C for estimation of GFR&#xD;
      according to the routines of the individual study centers. Biobank samples for analysis of&#xD;
      potential markers of ophthalmopathy, DNA (buffy coat), RNA (whole blood), serum, and plasma&#xD;
      according to separate sampling instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical appointments and treatment of ophthalmopathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endocrinologist and ophthalmologist judge the presence of ophthalmopathy in patients with&#xD;
      Graves´ disease and asses inclusion and exclusion criteria before randomization to treatment&#xD;
      with or without simvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of ophthalmopathy is judged according to CAS (clinical activity score) and&#xD;
      registered by the ophthalmologist:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous retrobulbar pain 0. No 1. Yes Painful eye-movements 0. No 1, Yes Eye lid erythema&#xD;
      0. No 1. Yes Conjunctival injection 0. No 1. Yes Chemosis 0. No 1. Yes Swollen caruncula 0.&#xD;
      No 1. Yes Eye lid edema or swelling 0. No 1, Yes Sum (points)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, evaluation with modified CAS is performed and registered by the ophthalmologist:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous retrobulbar pain 0. No 1. Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe Painful eye-movements 0. No&#xD;
      1. Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe Eye lid erythema 0. No 1. Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe&#xD;
      Conjunctival injection 0. No 1. Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe Chemosis 0. No 1. Mild 2. Moderate&#xD;
      3. Severe Swollen caruncula 0. No 1. Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe Eye lid edema or swelling 0.&#xD;
      No 1. Mild 2. Moderate 3. Severe Sum (points)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity is judged by the following parameters and registered in the ophthalmologist´s&#xD;
      protocol: vision, sense of colour, eye papillae edema, eye protrusion, impaired eye&#xD;
      movements, corneal ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Judgement of thyroid function and ophthalmopathy is performed by an&#xD;
      endocrinologist/ophthalmologist at inclusion and after 3 and 6 months. The ophthalmologist&#xD;
      who evaluates activity and severity of ophthalmopathy is not aware of which treatment arm&#xD;
      (simvastatin or control) the patient has been randomized to (single-blind design).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are photographed at each visit and every fifth photograph of ophthalmopathy status&#xD;
      is sent to the other centers for evaluation of selected parameters in CAS to evaluate the&#xD;
      inter-observer variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and lack exclusion criteria and have signed&#xD;
      informed consent will be randomized to treatment simvastatin 40 mg 1x1 or no additional&#xD;
      treatment for 6 months. Drugs for treatment are prescribed for 3 months and repeated at&#xD;
      control visits. Information on collection of drugs is checked with lists obtained from the&#xD;
      pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Graves ´ hyperthyroidism are treated with ATD. This can be done with the block&#xD;
      and replace approach or by titration of ATD according to the local tradition as long as&#xD;
      euthyroidism is achieved during the study period (normal fT4 and fT3 with TSH below the upper&#xD;
      limit of the local reference interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with clinical ophthalmopathy at diagnosis can be included no earlier than 2 months&#xD;
      after treatment with ATD and only if biochemical or clinical euthyroidism has been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have stopped medication with ATD can be included at the earliest after 2 months&#xD;
      and only if clinically and biochemically euthyroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been treated with radioiodine can be included 6 months after radioiodine if&#xD;
      euthyroid. In case of hypothyroidism, patients must be treated with L-thyroxine and be&#xD;
      clinically and biochemically euthyroid before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had thyroidectomy can be included when euthyroidism has been achieved with&#xD;
      L-thyroxine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations and study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary evaluation variable is change in CAS after 6 months. If it is assumed that the&#xD;
      spontaneous change without treatment is -0.6 and if the treatment groups improvement in CAS&#xD;
      is -1.9, 34 patients in each group are needed to achieve 80 % power at significance level of&#xD;
      0.05. The basis of this calculation is a study on the effects of selenium treatment in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate ophthalmopathy (Marcocci 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will stratify for smoking at randomization which will be performed in&#xD;
      blocks of 6 within each participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary exclusion and lost to follow-up rate of patients is estimated to 10 % during&#xD;
      the study period. The investigators therefore plan to include a total of 80 patients. The&#xD;
      following reasons are expected to cause secondary exclusion/ loss of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Side effects of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lack of compliance or safety routines not being followed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive written information on treatment alternatives, possible&#xD;
      side-effects of any drugs used, and the aim of the study which has been approved by relevant&#xD;
      ethics committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication and authorship:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary results will be reported in an appropriate medical journal after discussion with&#xD;
      the participants of the study and authorship can be claimed if the participant has included&#xD;
      at least 10 % of the total number of patients.&#xD;
