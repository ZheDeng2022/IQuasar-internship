  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of disease-targeted drugs for the treatment of pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) has significantly improved within the last years. Combining drug products&#xD;
      with different mechanisms of action such as Endothelin-Receptor-Antagonists (ERAs) and&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase-Type-5-inhibitors (PDE-5-Inhibitors) has become increasingly important for&#xD;
      the treatment of PAH. Recently, the results of the AMBITION study reported that an upfront&#xD;
      combination treatment of ambrisentan and tadalafil immediately after diagnosis leads to a&#xD;
      delayed disease progression. On the other hand, the sequential combination of bosentan and&#xD;
      sildenafil did not show a similar positive clinical effect and this was attributed to a&#xD;
      negative clinically relevant pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction. Although, recent&#xD;
      guidelines have extrapolated that initial upfront combination treatment follows a class&#xD;
      effect in terms of efficacy and safety, there is an imperative need to support this notion&#xD;
      with other combinations of ERAs and PDE-5-Inhibitors.&#xD;

      The primary objective of BOTA study is to compare the change in clinical and hemodynamic&#xD;
      measures of PAH after the initiation of first line combination therapy with bosentan and&#xD;
      tadalafil in adult patients with PAH. The safety and tolerability of first line combination&#xD;
      therapy will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with PAH initial upfront combination treatment with bosentan and tadalafil&#xD;

             -  Exercise capacity as expressed by distance walked in six minute walk test and WHO&#xD;

             -  Hemodynamics in terms of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), mean pulmonary artery&#xD;
                pressure (mPAP) reduction and cardiac index (CI) elevation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NTproBNP serum levels&#xD;

             -  Echocardiographic prognostic parameters such as right atrial area and presence of&#xD;
                pericardial effusion.&#xD;

        2. Is safe as assessed by&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) is a surrogate marker of heart failure. The geometric mean ratio will be calculated as the ratio between the month 6 value and the Baseline value and presented as percent change = 100 * (geometric mean ratio - 1). The Baseline value is the last value prior to administration of study drug; this may be prior to or on the day of study drug initiation.</description>
