  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the combination of&#xD;
      oral pazopanib, intravenous or oral irinotecan, and oral temozolomide in pediatric and young&#xD;
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory sarcomas. This study will use a 3 + 3 design for&#xD;
      dose escalation (Part 1), followed by an expansion cohort (Part 2) at the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose level.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide is well-tolerated and provides an active&#xD;
      therapy option for heavily pre-treated patients with sarcoma. The toxicity profile and&#xD;
      activity level suggest that this combination will provide a useful platform onto which novel&#xD;
      compounds may be added. Pazopanib has been shown to demonstrate single-agent activity in&#xD;
      sarcomas in the preclinical and clinical settings. Pazopanib has also been shown to have&#xD;
      additive or synergistic effects in preclinical models of sarcomas when combined with&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic studies of pazopanib and irinotecan as well as&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic studies of pazopanib to assess anti-angiogenesis will be performed.&#xD;
      Exploratory studies to assess non-invasive methods of monitoring tumor response [circulating&#xD;
      tumor DNA and functional imaging by positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) will be performed].&#xD;
