  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to compare concentrations of hydrocodone and&#xD;
      acetaminophen in the blood after administration of different amounts of tablets of a new and&#xD;
      a marketed tablet formulation in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a randomized, single-site, open-label, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover, single oral&#xD;
      dose Phase I trial in 32 healthy male and female subjects. Part will consist of an Enrollment&#xD;
      Visit, 4 treatment periods (each lasting approximately 90 hours), and a Final Examination.&#xD;
      The treatment periods will be separated by a washout period each lasting at least 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is optional and depending on pharmacokinetic data review after Part 1. It is a&#xD;
      randomized, single-site, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover, single oral dose part&#xD;
      in healthy male and female subjects. Part 2 will consist of an Enrollment Visit, 2 treatment&#xD;
      periods (each lasting approximately 90 hours) and a Final Examination. The treatment periods&#xD;
      will be separated by a washout period lasting at least 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must fast for approximately 10 hours prior to administration of Investigational&#xD;
      medicinal product (IMP) and until approximately 4 hours after the administration of the IMP.&#xD;
