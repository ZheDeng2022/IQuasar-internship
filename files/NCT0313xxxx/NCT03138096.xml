  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the underlying study, a genetically modified P. berghei parasite is used. P. berghei is&#xD;
      one of the four Plasmodium species that causes malaria in rodents. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      immunization of humans with P. berghei will induce a cross-species immune response without&#xD;
      the risk of a breakthrough infection. To further increase the potential for protective&#xD;
      efficacy, the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS)- protein gene has been integrated in the P.&#xD;
      berghei parasite, generating a genetically modified P. berghei parasite, abbreviated as&#xD;
      Pb(PfCS@UIS4).&#xD;
