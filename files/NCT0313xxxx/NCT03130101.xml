  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the time spent in glucose target range (4.0-10.0&#xD;
      mmol/L) during exercise and in recovery using three different basal insulin management&#xD;
      strategies for prolonged aerobic exercise: A) pump suspension for the duration of the&#xD;
      activity, starting at the onset of exercise; B) A 50% basal rate reduction, performed&#xD;
      90-minutes in advance of exercise for the duration of the activity; and C) An 80% basal rate&#xD;
      reduction, performed 90-minutes in advance of exercise for the duration of the activity.&#xD;

      This project focuses on the effectiveness of various basal insulin reductions on the time&#xD;
      spent in target range during and after aerobic exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#xD;
      on OmniPod® insulin pump therapy. The OmniPod® is a Health Canada approved tubing-free&#xD;
      insulin pump device that uses an insulin delivery 'pod' and a Personal Diabetes Manager&#xD;
      (PDM). The PDM is a wireless handheld device that programs the pod, captures diabetes&#xD;
      management events (food, exercise, etc.), and acts as a glucose meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the protocol is to determine if a moderate basal insulin reduction&#xD;
      (-50% of basal), performed 90-minutes before a 75-minute aerobic exercise session (with three&#xD;
      5-minute breaks), improves the time in target range compared to either a more aggressive&#xD;
      basal rate reduction (-80%) or complete pump suspension at the onset of exercise in patients&#xD;
      with T1D on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. The time in target will&#xD;
      be determined for both the exercise period and during a three-hour window after a&#xD;
      standardized meal ingestion performed 30-minutes after the end of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three sessions, aerobic exercise (brisk walking/light jogging) will be performed in&#xD;
      the post-absorptive state, ~ four hours after the last meal with their usual bolus insulin&#xD;
      given. The exercise will consist of four 15-minute bouts of jogging at 50-60% of the&#xD;
      participant's pre-determined aerobic capacity, separated by three 5-minute breaks (to&#xD;
      simulate what is typically done in most team and individual workouts and sports). The&#xD;
      subjects exercise intensity will be monitored continuously using heart rate and activity&#xD;
      monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned to a sequence of the three experimental visits through a&#xD;
      randomization process. Each exercise session will be separated by at least three days and&#xD;
      participants will be expected to complete all sessions within ~ 12 weeks from the time of the&#xD;
      baseline/screening visit. Participants will be advised to avoid any vigorous exercise within&#xD;
      24 hours before or after the laboratory-based exercise tests. Subjects will be asked about&#xD;
      activity during each clinic visit and phone call to monitor adherence to these&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following each exercise session, the participant will rest for 30-minutes and then consume a&#xD;
      standardized meal (50 g of carbohydrate, ~17g protein and ~8g of fat, Lean Cuisine). The&#xD;
      amount of bolus insulin given at the post-exercise meal will be based on the carbohydrate&#xD;
      content of the meal and the patient's own individualized insulin to carbohydrate ratio, and&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity index and glycemic targets on their OmniPod® PDM, corrected to 75% of&#xD;
      total dose to account for the increase in insulin sensitivity post-exercise. Insulin&#xD;
      &quot;corrections&quot; will be given based on the patient's own OmniPod® settings (i.e. usual care).&#xD;
      Insulin will be administered 10-minutes before the start of consuming the meal. If&#xD;
      hypoglycemia occurs prior to the meal (blood glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L), subjects will be treated&#xD;
      with 16 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates (Dex4, AMG Medical) prior to meal consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be monitored for at least three hours after the standardized meal prior&#xD;
      to discharge. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) low- and high-glucose 'alerts' will be&#xD;
      activated. They will also be instructed to perform a standardized basal insulin reduction&#xD;
      overnight to help reduce the risk of post-exercise nocturnal hypoglycemia (-20% from bedtime&#xD;
      for 6 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM sensors will be removed the next day at home and patients will be instructed to perform&#xD;
      data upload using the appropriate websites (i.e. Dexcom Share/Clarity). The participant will&#xD;
      bring the device to the next visit or an investigator will arrange for pickup.&#xD;
