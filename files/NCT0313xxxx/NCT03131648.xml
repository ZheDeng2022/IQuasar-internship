    <textblock>
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab compared with placebo in treating moderate to severe&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab on severity and extent of AD, itch, and health&#xD;
      related quality of life compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate maintenance of effect with continued tralokinumab dosing up to 52 weeks compared&#xD;
      to placebo for subjects achieving clinical response at Week 16.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects found eligible following the screening period were randomized 3:1 to initial&#xD;
      treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or placebo. Randomization was&#xD;
      stratified by region (North America, Europe, and Japan) and disease severity (Investigator's&#xD;
      Global Assessment [IGA] 3 or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects achieving a clinical response at Week 16 (defined as IGA of 0 or 1 on a 5-point&#xD;
      scale ranging from 0 [clear] to 4 [severe], or at least 75% reduction in Eczema Area and&#xD;
      Severity Index [EASI] score from baseline [EASI75]) continued into maintenance treatment that&#xD;
      continued until Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period and who achieved a&#xD;
      clinical response at Week 16 (defined by IGA 0 or 1, or EASI75) were re-randomized 2:2:1 to&#xD;
      one of the following Q2W maintenance regimens stratified by region (North America, Europe,&#xD;
      and Japan) and IGA response at Week 16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA &gt;1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W (alternating dose administrations tralokinumab 300 mg and&#xD;
           placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (Subjects randomized to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieved a&#xD;
           clinical response at Week 16 [defined by IGA 0 or 1, or EASI75] continued to receive&#xD;
           placebo Q2W in the maintenance treatment period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects not achieving a clinical response at Week 16 as well as those who met the criteria&#xD;
      listed below during maintenance treatment were transferred to open-label tralokinumab 300 mg&#xD;
      Q2W treatment with optional use of topical corticosteroid (TCS) up to Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfer to open-label treatment during maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with IGA=0 at Week 16: IGA of at least 2 and not achieved EASI75 over at least a&#xD;
      4-week period (i.e. over 3 consecutive visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with IGA=1 at Week 16: IGA of at least 3 and not achieved EASI75 over at least a&#xD;
      4-week period (i.e. over 3 consecutive visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with IGA &gt;1 at Week 16: not achieved EASI75 over at least a 4-week period (i.e. over&#xD;
      3 consecutive visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects transferring to open-label treatment had the option to self-administer tralokinumab&#xD;
      in their home after adequate training (at 3 dosing visits in the open-label period after&#xD;
      additional consent has been obtained) by site staff at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the maintenance treatment period (or open-label treatment), all subjects,&#xD;
      except for those who entered the open-label long-term extension trial, continued in a 14-week&#xD;
      off-treatment follow-up period for the assessment of safety and anti-drug antibody (ADA).&#xD;

It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their quality of life (QoL) over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0 = not at all ⁄not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor QoL.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>The screening period was 2 to 6 weeks and included 1 or 2 visits. The exact duration depended on the wash-out period defined by the exclusion criteria. If no wash-out or only a 2-week wash-out was required, screening Visits 1 and 2 were combined. Eligibility was assessed at the (first) screening visit and on Day 0 prior to randomisation.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Week 0 to Week 16:&#xD;
Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W&#xD;
Tralokinumab: Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that specifically binds to human IL-13 and blocks interaction with the IL-13 receptors. It is presented as a liquid formulation for SC administration&#xD;
At Day 0, each subject received 4 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab to receive a total loading dose of 600 mg tralokinumab (4.0 mL). At subsequent visits (Q2W) each subject received 2 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab to receive a total dose of 300 mg tralokinumab.</description>

Placebo: Placebo contains the same excipients, in the same concentration, only lacking tralokinumab.&#xD;
At Day 0, each subject received 4 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of placebo to receive a total loading dose (4.0 mL). At subsequent visits (Q2W) each subject received 2 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of placebo.</description>

          <title>Dermatology Life Quality Index</title>
          <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their health-related quality of life (HQoL) over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all ⁄not relevant'; 1 = 'a little'; 2 = 'a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor HQoL.</description>

        <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their quality of life (QoL) over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0 = not at all ⁄not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor QoL.</description>

        <title>Reduction From Baseline to Week 16 of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) of ≥4 Points Among Subjects With Baseline DLQI ≥4</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their QoL over the last week such as dermatology related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor QoL.</description>
