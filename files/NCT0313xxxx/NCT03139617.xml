    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of fascia iliaca compartment block comparing to&#xD;
      femoral nerve block. If it is proven effective, this technique should be implemented as a&#xD;
      method of analgesia (pain relief) prior positioning for spinal anaesthesia. As fascia iliaca&#xD;
      compartment block is relatively easy to be done without the need of advanced equipment, it&#xD;
      has the potential role for good pain management in patient with femur fracture. Thus this&#xD;
      will reduce the need of intravenous or oral analgesic such as opioid or nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and side effects that comes with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single blind randomized study of a total of 60 patients ASA I - III who&#xD;
      were scheduled to undergo fixation of femur fractures. Patients who fulfilled the criteria&#xD;
      were recruited after informed consent was taken. This study was conducted in the operation&#xD;
      theatres of the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is no difference in term of success rate between ultrasound guided Femoral 3 in 1&#xD;
           nerve block versus Single shot blind Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block prior positioning&#xD;
           for spinal anaesthesia in femur fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is no difference in term of analgesic effect between ultrasound guided Femoral 3&#xD;
           in 1 nerve block versus Single shot blind Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block prior&#xD;
           positioning for spinal anaesthesia in femur fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is no different in term of onset of analgesia between Femoral 3 in 1 nerve block&#xD;
           versus Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block prior positioning for spinal anaesthesia in femur&#xD;
           fracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Randomization Eligible patients will be approach and offered to participate&#xD;
      in this study prior operation. Agreed patients will have to sign informed consent Subject&#xD;
      will be randomized into 2 groups using computer assisted randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation The sample size was calculated based on reduction of visual analog&#xD;
      score in a study done by Newman et al with score 3.7±2.6, α = 0.05 and power of study 80%.&#xD;
      The patients were randomized per a computerized generated random number and divided into two&#xD;
      groups. Group A (FICB) n = 30, received single shot fascia iliaca compartment block (blind&#xD;
      technique) and the other group B (FNB) n = 30 received ultrasound guided femoral 3 in 1&#xD;
      block. Initial target sample of 66 was calculated including drop out, however as there was no&#xD;
      drop out from the study we decided to stop at 60 samples only. As 30 samples for each arm was&#xD;
      adequate for a clinical study to be conducted and data acquired can be statistically&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol After ethic approval, written informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      participants that met inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 66 adults who are planned for open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of proximal&#xD;
      femur fracture will be enrolled. Easy sample random sampling using opaque and sealed envelope&#xD;
      will be used to divide patient into Group 1 (Group Femoral 3 in 1 Block) and Group 2 (Fascia&#xD;
      Iliaca Compartment Block) with ratio 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random sampling will be done upon patient arrival to reception area in operation theatre&#xD;
      complex. Both block will be performed by principal investigator in induction anaesthetic room&#xD;
      while waiting for surgery. Data will be collected by registered nurse anaesthetist monitoring&#xD;
      preoperatively and resident anaesthetist who's in charge in the operating theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block will be performed in induction room near the recovery area in operating theatre (OT)&#xD;
      complex. Basic and standardized monitoring as listed by American Society of Anaesthesiologist&#xD;
      (ASA) will be applied such as Non-invasive blood pressure monitoring (NIBP), Heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and electrocardiogram (ECG). Patient will be monitored continuously&#xD;
      during the procedure. Apart from that, a variable performance oxygen delivery system will be&#xD;
      given using nasal cannula at 3 litre/min. At least 1 functioning cannula will be made&#xD;
      available with running IV drip. Preparation for emergency airway intervention and&#xD;
      resuscitation drug will also be prepared before performing intended block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both group, block will be performed with patient in supine position, under aseptic&#xD;
      technique using chlorhexidine solution and drape with sterile medical towel. Both group will&#xD;
      be given Lignocaine 2% for local infiltration at puncture site. Ropivacaine 0.375% will be&#xD;
      used in both groups with a total volume depends on weight basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (Femoral 3 in 1 Block/FNB) This group will be given femoral 3 in 1 block Needle:&#xD;
      Stimuplex or Locoplex 22-gauge 50-mm insulated needle Using Ultrasound guidance and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve stimulator. Total Volume of Local anaesthetic: 20-40mls. Ultrasound will be&#xD;
      use to locate the femoral vessel and nerve. Using 'in plane' technique, the needle will be&#xD;
      puncture and advance in transverse plane at a 30 angle to the skin. Peripheral Nerve&#xD;
      stimulator will be used if there is difficulty in recognizing the nerve, stimulation of the&#xD;
      nerve will cause contraction of quadriceps femoris muscle. A total 20-40mls of local&#xD;
      anaesthetic solution as per ideal body weight will be injected over a 2-3minutes duration&#xD;
      after careful negative aspiration of blood to rule out inadvertent intravascular puncture.&#xD;
      Careful aspiration will be done in every 3-5mls injection until a total of 20-40mls local&#xD;
      anaesthetic being delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block (FICB) This group will be given fascia iliaca&#xD;
      compartment block as shown in figure 3. Needle: Luer Lock cannula (Plexufix) 24-gauge 50-mm&#xD;
      insulated needle Total Volume of Local anaesthetic: 20-40mls based on ideal body weight The&#xD;
      technique is done as described by Dalens et al, 1989 using anatomical landmark technique. A&#xD;
      line is drawn from pubic tubercle to anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and divided into 3&#xD;
      equal parts. The puncture point is 2-3cm distal to the point where medial 2/3rd and lateral&#xD;
      1/3rd of the line meet. The femoral vessel will be identified and should lie medial to the&#xD;
      puncture site. The fascia iliaca block will be perform without using the nerve stimulator or&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using a blunted needle (24G, plexufix needle), identification of puncturing intended space&#xD;
      is by feeling 2 times loss of resistance (described as clicks or plops). This indicates the&#xD;
      puncture of fascia lata and fascia iliaca. After careful aspiration with syringe to rule out&#xD;
      inadvertent vascular injection, a total volume of local anaesthetic (LA) will be given&#xD;
      according to group allocation and body weight. Bolus of LA given in 2-3minutes duration with&#xD;
      repeated aspiration. In case of accidental vascular puncture, needle is withdrawn and&#xD;
      punctured site will be compressed for 5 minutes to avoid haematoma before reattempt lateral&#xD;
      1-2cm from initial site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both group, any signs of complication will be look for, documented and treated&#xD;
      accordingly. Examples are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Local anaesthetic toxicity such tingling sensation around mouth, metallic taste, light&#xD;
           headache, confusion, altered conscious level, seizures, visual disturbances, arrhythmias&#xD;
           and cardiovascular collapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Swelling at site of puncture due to hematoma or localization of local anaesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bleeding from puncture site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precaution to avoid complication from procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dose local anaesthetic should be precalculated to avoid toxicity, total maximum dose of&#xD;
           Ropivacaine is 3mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Careful negative aspiration before giving intended local anaesthetic in titrating dose&#xD;
           to avoid inadvertent vascular puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total volume of local anaesthetic given in repeated aspiration and in titrating dose in&#xD;
           2-3 minutes' duration&#xD;
