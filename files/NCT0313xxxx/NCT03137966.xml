    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most invalidating complication of diabetes and&#xD;
      represents a big economic burden for the society. No specific therapy is available for&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers.The aim of this study is to define a new approach for treatment of&#xD;
      chronic diabetic wounds. Our concept is based on the improvement of the cellular reaction to&#xD;
      hypoxia. It will address the transcriptional factor HIF-1 (Hypoxia inducible factor-1) which&#xD;
      is the cellular sensor for oxygen and which is specifically repressed by hyperglycemia. The&#xD;
      study will investigate the effect of local deferoxamine (0.66 mg/ml), the only known HIF-1&#xD;
      inducer, on the wound healing rate in patients with neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the study will be the reduction with &gt;50% of the wound area after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions and is predicted to affect 300 millions people&#xD;
      worldwide in 2025. Chronic complications of diabetes represent the main concern for the&#xD;
      modern therapy of diabetes and it has become a priority to further characterize their&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms to develop novel rational therapeutic strategies. It is a high&#xD;
      need to identify additional mechanisms that contribute to the development of chronic&#xD;
      complications of diabetes. Today's strategies aiming to improve blood glucose levels have&#xD;
      limited efficiency mainly because they induce hypoglycemia when used in the optimal&#xD;
      therapeutically range. It is therefore important to develop additional therapeutic strategies&#xD;
      that can compensate the relative inefficient blood glucose control. There are other examples&#xD;
      where &quot;out of the box thinking&quot; strategies such as treatment of hypertension have shown to be&#xD;
      at least as efficient as glucose control to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulceration represents a major medical, social and economic problem. The&#xD;
      lifetime risk of a person with diabetes for developing a foot ulcer is 25% and it is believed&#xD;
      that every 30 seconds a lower limb is lost in the world due to diabetes. The condition is&#xD;
      also followed by a high 5 years mortality which has been estimated to be 45% after ulceration&#xD;
      and 79% after amputation. The mortality of the patients with DFU is worse than the mortality&#xD;
      in patients with many common cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present clinical management for patients with DFU is limited and in consequence 40% of&#xD;
      the ulcers are still not healed after one year of treatment. This limited efficacy of the&#xD;
      present therapy is the consequence of the relative poor understanding of the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of this complication. Even though prolonged exposure of the tissues to hyperglycemia seems to&#xD;
      be the primary causative factor for chronic complications of diabetes it has recently become&#xD;
      increasingly evident that hypoxia plays an important role in all diabetes complications and&#xD;
      especially in chronic diabetic wounds. A low oxygen concentration is the consequence of&#xD;
      either a deficient blood supply due to functional circulatory deficiency, micro- and&#xD;
      macro-vascular disease but also by a poor local diffusion of the oxygen due to local oedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive responses of cells to hypoxia are mediated by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF)&#xD;
      which is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of two subunits, HIF-1 alfa and HIF-1&#xD;
      alfa both of which are constitutively expressed in mammalian cells. Regulation of HIF-1&#xD;
      activity is critically dependent of the degradation of the HIF-1 alfa subunit in normoxia.&#xD;
      The molecular basis of its degradation is O2 dependent hydroxylation of at least one of the&#xD;
      two proline residues in the oxygen dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of HIF 1-alfa by&#xD;
      specific Fe 2+-, oxoglutarate dependent prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF hydroxylases). In this&#xD;
      form HIF-1 alfa binds to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein that acts as an&#xD;
      E3 ubiquitin ligase and targets HIF-1 alfa for proteasomal degradation (recently reviewed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under hypoxic conditions HIF-1alfa is stabilized against degradation and binds to HRE&#xD;
      (hypoxic responsive elements) and up-regulates a series of genes involved in angiogenesis&#xD;
      (such as VEGF, angiopoietin-2, -4), glycolytic energy metabolism, cell proliferation and&#xD;
      survival which enable the cells to adapt to reduction in oxygen availability . The same&#xD;
      induction and activation of HIF-1 can be achieved by inhibiting the degrading enzymes (HIF&#xD;
      hydroxylases) with substances that compete with their cofactors i.e. iron or oxoglutarate.&#xD;
      Deferoxamine is such a substance which stabilizes and activates HIF-1 by chelating iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIF-1 alfa plays a pivotal role in wound healing, and its expression in the multistage&#xD;
      process of normal wound healing has been well characterized. In essence, HIF-1 alfa is&#xD;
      necessary for expression of multiple angiogenic growth factors, cell motility and recruitment&#xD;
      of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that hyperglycemia impairs HIF-1 alfa stability and function. Low&#xD;
      levels of HIF-1 alfa expression were also found in foot ulcer biopsies in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes. The hypothesis is that the wound healing defect present in diabetes is due to an&#xD;
      inhibition of HIF-1. This concept has been demonstrated by showing that local activation of&#xD;
      HIF-1 either by two structurally different HIF-hydroxylases inhibitors (deferoxamine and&#xD;
      DMOG) or by direct adenovirus mediated transfer of stabile HIF in wounds is followed by&#xD;
      improvement of wound healing in diabetic mice (db/db) despite of chronic hyperglycemia. The&#xD;
      local activation of HIF induces several pivotal processes for wound healing such as&#xD;
      recruitment of the EPCs, angiogenesis, cell migration. Same improvement of wound healing were&#xD;
      registered using other methods to induce HIF in the wounds in different animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned to investigate the efficacy of the local stimulation of HIF for&#xD;
      improving wound healing in patients with DFU. It is proposed to use local applied&#xD;
      deferoxamine which is the only HIF inducer that is approved for clinical use and has been&#xD;
      already tested and proved to be effective in animal models of impaired diabetes on wound&#xD;
      healing rate. The dose proposed was evaluated as the most effective in preliminary&#xD;
      experiments performed in db/db mice.&#xD;
