      This is a randomized, controlled study which aims to show whether iodine impregnated&#xD;
      incisional foil (IobanTM) has a place in the prevention of prosthetic joint infection (PJI).&#xD;
      1200 patients will be included in this study and will be followed through out a ten year&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will center on the function of the prosthetic knee, early and late infection rates&#xD;
      and revision surgery due to aseptic loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our purpose is to gain insight in to the causes of post-operative infection in joint&#xD;
      alloplasty surgery. Our hypothesis' are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient's skin flora is the main source of intraoperative contamination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative contamination can be reduced by using IobanTM&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intraoperative contamination strongly predicts postoperative infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unsuccessful clinical outcomes of knee arthroplasty are caused by low-grade infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge this is the first study with this large a sample size and as long a follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background PJI is a devastating complication with substantial morbidity and high socio&#xD;
      economic costs. Revision surgery due to infection costs as much as six times more than the&#xD;
      primary surgery and has a poorer outcome for the patient i.e. disability, pain or loss of&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two main arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative contamination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stage aims to document that patients with intraoperative contamination have a&#xD;
      larger risk of developing postoperative infection and include a study of the effect of&#xD;
      Ioban™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage are to include methods of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and fluorescence&#xD;
      microscopy, to demonstrate bacterial contamination and/or infection of any implants removed&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives This study will give us new insight in the causes of PJI and the correlation&#xD;
      with contamination during surgery. If IobanTM is proved to prevent infection it is a simple&#xD;
      way to prevent post-operative infection and can be implemented in any orthopedic department.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Approximately 8,000 primary knee arthroplasty procedures are performed annually&#xD;
      at Danish hospitals (1). Infection is a serious complication that occurs with a frequency of&#xD;
      around 2 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mean of hindering infection is the use of IobanTM, an incisional drape impregnated with&#xD;
      iodine. This costs 69 DKK pr. sheet. A two-stage stage operation for infection costs 253,122&#xD;
      DKK. (2) Using IobanTM for 8000 knee operations costs 552,000 DKK. Besides high socio&#xD;
      economic costs infections cause considerable morbidity and have severe consequences for the&#xD;
      independent mobility of the patient (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the estimated number of arthroplasty procedures continuously increase so will the number&#xD;
      of infections (6), and prevention is therefore of high priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inestigators' purpose is to gain insight in to the causes of post-operative infection in&#xD;
      joint arthroplasty surgery. The investigators' hypothesis' are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient's skin flora is the main source for intraoperative microbial contamination,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative contamination can be reduced by using an iodine impregnated incisional&#xD;
           drape,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intraoperative contamination strongly predicts postoperative infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unsuccessful clinical outcomes of knee arthroplasty are caused by low-grade infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives If intraoperative contamination can be shown to be a strong predictor of&#xD;
      postoperative infection, then contamination will be an obvious outcome parameter for studies&#xD;
      of preventive measures for infection. Demonstration of a strongly predictive role of&#xD;
      intraoperative contamination may allow new prophylactic strategies for preventing&#xD;
      postoperative infection, and one will have to consider prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis or&#xD;
      treatment for patients, where contamination has been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the study will provide information that will shape future strategies for&#xD;
      preventing, diagnosing and treating peri-prosthetic joint infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of adverse outcome for the participants is largely outweighed by the probability of&#xD;
      discovering an early infection following surgery. This project's findings will be of great&#xD;
      value for future patients undergoing knee replacement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and theory Recent studies have shown that a considerable proportion of orthopedic&#xD;
      procedures performed under supposedly sterile conditions are contaminated. Contamination of&#xD;
      the surgical field is found using swabs during surgery. There are several possible sources of&#xD;
      intraoperative contamination. An obvious source is the patient's skin flora. Under normal&#xD;
      circumstances, these bacteria are considered harmless, but in the presence of biomaterials&#xD;
      like prosthetic implants, they have a significant pathogenic potential (7). It is well&#xD;
      recognized that these bacteria adhere to the surface of the implant, where they multiply and&#xD;
      transform into a biofilm formation making them more resistant to antibiotics and host defense&#xD;
      mechanisms (8, 9). As a result they are involved in the development of low-grade persistent&#xD;
      infections, which today still represent a major diagnostic challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is suggested that an unknown proportion of implant loosening are caused by&#xD;
      infections of low virulence that do not result in recognizable infection (10). In this&#xD;
      respect, reported infection rates are probably underestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard procedures have been developed to reduce skin contamination including the use of&#xD;
      preoperative skin antiseptics. However, even with optimal skin preparation, total&#xD;
      sterilization of the skin is not possible. Some microorganisms will remain in the deeper&#xD;
      parts of the skin, such as the hair follicles, and appear at the skin surface during surgery,&#xD;
      where they will potentially contaminate the surgical field (11). One strategy of preventing&#xD;
      microbial re-colonization on the skin is the application of an iodine impregnated incision&#xD;
      drape preoperatively. In theory, this drape provides continuous antimicrobial activity&#xD;
      throughout the surgical procedure thereby reducing skin contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are only few studies on the efficacy of iodine impregnated drapes. Some studies show&#xD;
      reduced contamination rate with or without impact on infection rate. Other studies, however,&#xD;
      have not been able to support this observation (12-14). All of these studies have had an&#xD;
      insufficient amount of patients included. Consequently, there are no conclusions for&#xD;
      standardized practice regarding the use of iodine impregnated incisions drapes. To clarify&#xD;
      their correlation with intraoperative contamination as well as their preventive effect on the&#xD;
      development of peri-prosthetic infection, large clinical trials are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost benefit analysis One sheet of IobanTM costs 69 DKK. A two stage operation with removal&#xD;
      of implant, implantation of a spacer and subsequent removal of spacer and implantation of a&#xD;
      secondary implant costs 253.122 DKK (2). The one year revision rate I 1.8 % and a total of&#xD;
      8298 knees operated. Assuming half of these revisions are due to infection and are operated&#xD;
      on using a two stage technique 18.731.028 DKK could be saved every year. These numbers are&#xD;
      solely covering hospital expenses and not physiotherapy or rehabilitation or any other costs&#xD;
      related to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using IobanTM in all patients undergoing total knee joint replacement costs 572.532 DKK a&#xD;
      year. If this can prevent half of the one year revisions rates a total of 18.2 mio DKK could&#xD;
      be saved each year. There is reason to believe that the investigators' findings could be&#xD;
      extrapolated to other orthopedic procedures were implants are used saving the hospital large&#xD;
      amounts of money on revisions every year. Not to mention the amount that could be saved on&#xD;
      sickness benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility An unpublished pilot study, performed by this research group, of 86 primary&#xD;
      arthroplasty procedures showed a 10.5 % frequency of intraoperative contamination. Two of&#xD;
      nine intra-operatively contaminated patients developed infection post-operatively, whereas&#xD;
      only one of the 77 non-contaminated patients developed post-operative infection. A randomized&#xD;
      sub-study showed that the use of an iodine impregnated incisional drape resulted in no&#xD;
      intra-operative contamination in 19 patients compared to 3 cases of contamination in 11&#xD;
      patients operated without the use of an incisional drape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      400 patients are already included in this study and have been operated and have had samples&#xD;
      taken. Preliminary results show a contamination rate of 5 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples will be collected at Orthopedic Departments at Herlev og Gentofte Hospital,&#xD;
      Frederiksberg Hospital, Nordsjællands Hospital Hillerød and Aarhus Universitetshospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will undergo plating and susceptibility testing at the Clinical Microbiological&#xD;
      Departments of Herlev og Gentofte Hospital and Aarhus Universitetshospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All orthopedic departments involved are highly dedicated to this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations There are large variations in the reported frequencies of&#xD;
      intraoperative contamination, presumably because of differences in sterile techniques and&#xD;
      sample methods. According to the investigators' calculations a sample size of 1200 operations&#xD;
      are needed. To demonstrate the effect of incisional drape on intraoperative contamination the&#xD;
      investigators' have chosen to make the two groups of equal size with 600 operations in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is centered on an infection paradigm where intraoperative contamination plays a&#xD;
      pivotal role, and the study has two main arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative contamination (source, patient/surgeon, incisional drape).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative infection (correspondence with intraoperative contamination, microbiology,&#xD;
           radiology, serology, patient-reported outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These arms together form a comprehensive study of the effects of intraoperative&#xD;
      contamination. The study will attempt to answer all questions that arise secondary to the&#xD;
      paradigm above, and this will be done in stages. The first stage will aim to document that&#xD;
      patients with intraoperative contamination do indeed have a larger risk of developing&#xD;
      post-operative infection. The first stage will also include a study of the effect of iodine&#xD;
      impregnated incisional drape. The second stage will include highly sensitive methods of PCR&#xD;
      and fluorescence microscopy, to demonstrate bacterial contamination and/or infection of any&#xD;
      implants removed during the study period.&#xD;
