             poorly differentiated carcinoma, with pathology reviewed at MSKCC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has incurable disease defined as at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Presence of metastases to other organs (Stage IV), now or previously&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has locally advanced disease and are not candidates for surgery or more radiation&#xD;
                  treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has received the maximal radiation therapy to the primary site, or has been&#xD;
                  assessed by radiation oncology as not being a candidate for chemoradiation&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;/= 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No endoluminal stent in place at the time of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous esophageal dilation is permitted, provided the patient has developed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have received any systemic therapy (including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             biologic therapy or immunotherapy) &lt;/= 7 days prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation or surgery to the esophagus is permitted for patients with locally&#xD;
             recurrent/persistent disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on prophylactic or full-dose anticoagulation are eligible, provided the&#xD;
             treating physician believes it is safe to temporarily withhold anticoagulation (see&#xD;
             Section 9.2)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must undergo&#xD;
             a negative pregnancy test (either serum or urine) prior to study entry. Both sexes&#xD;
             must use contraception while on study. WOCBP include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or oophorectomy) or who is&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Women on hormone replacement therapy with documented serum follicle stimulating&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  T4 tumors with involvement of any adjacent structure, including the trachea, aorta or&#xD;

             unstable angina or coronary artery disease or severe pulmonary disease, that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the study investigator, would make the patient a poor candidate for the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
