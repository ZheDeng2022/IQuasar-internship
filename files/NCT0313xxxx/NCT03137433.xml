  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine whether meal-replacement therapy is able to enhance weight loss&#xD;
      among teens with severe obesity. In addition, we are also interested in examining the degree&#xD;
      of weight loss needed to improve important cardiometabolic risk factors among adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve 130 adolescents (ages 13-17 years old) participating in meal&#xD;
      replacement therapy and will last one year (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to strictly follow the individually-prescribed eating regimen,&#xD;
      which will include shakes (breakfast and lunch) and pre-packaged frozen entrée meals for&#xD;
      dinner, two servings of fruit, and three servings of vegetables per day. Daily caloric&#xD;
      allotment will be tailored for each individual (number of shakes and frozen meals) by&#xD;
      calculating the average daily caloric deficit necessary to achieve negative energy balance&#xD;
      (using the metabolic rate/energy expenditure data). Shakes/meals will be provided free of&#xD;
      charge - fruits/vegetables will be purchased by the participants. Guidance will be provided&#xD;
      regarding the use of the meal replacement shakes at school, and participants will be&#xD;
      encouraged to engage in family meal sessions despite eating different foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure the changes in resting metabolic rate, traditional clinical risk markers (TG,&#xD;
      HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, glucose, insulin), vascular function, weight-related quality of life, and&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
