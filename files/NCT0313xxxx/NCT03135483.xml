    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 20% of hospitalized patients and up to 67% of&#xD;
      those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), making it among the most common organ&#xD;
      dysfunctions among the critically ill.Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after non cardiac&#xD;
      surgery are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The reported incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI) among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is&#xD;
      between 3% and 6%.The aim of this study is to Identify the impact of acute kidney injury on&#xD;
      the development of myocardial injury after non cardiac surgery and to correlate it with other&#xD;
      risk factors of for MINS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is classically described as an abrupt or rapidly reversible&#xD;
      reduction in the excretion of nitrogenous waste products, including urea, nitrogen, and&#xD;
      creatinine. Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 20% of hospitalized patients and&#xD;
      up to 67% of those admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), making it among the most common&#xD;
      organ dysfunctions among the critically ill. Depending on severity, AKI contributes to&#xD;
      short-term mortality rates between 40% and 70%, and survivors are at increased risk for&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease. Because surgical care and perioperative events and comorbidities&#xD;
      interact to contribute to renal dysfunction in different patterns than in nonsurgical&#xD;
      patients, surgical patients have unique risk factors for renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after non cardiac surgery are a leading cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The reported incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (POMI)&#xD;
      among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is between 3% and 6%. Early recognition and&#xD;
      timely treatment of POMI after surgery are very important. Therefore, routinemonitoring of&#xD;
      cardiac troponin has been recommended to identify patients at risk of early postoperative&#xD;
      cardiovascular events after surgery. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is&#xD;
      defined as follows: myocardial injury caused by ischemia (that may or may not result in&#xD;
      necrosis), has prognostic relevance, and occurs duringor within 30 days after noncardiac&#xD;
      surgery. MINS can be measured by postoperative troponin elevation in the presence or absence&#xD;
      of clinical symptoms. MINS occurs in 8% to 22% of adults undergoing major non cardiacsurgery.&#xD;
      To date, there have been few studies investigatingthe risk factors of MINS in critical&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The postoperative AKI is a new risk factor of MINS in critical patients, and the impact of&#xD;
      AKI on MINS has not been evaluated in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear by what mechanisms AKI influences theMINS in critical patients. A possible&#xD;
      explanation of this finding is that in patientswith postoperativeAKI, disturbed autonomic&#xD;
      nerve functions may induce postoperative hypotension and hypoperfusion, which may lead to&#xD;
      MINS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other idependent risk factors for myocardial injury after non cardiac surgery such as&#xD;
      emergency surgery and long time operation.The aim of this study is to Identify the impact of&#xD;
      acute kidney injury on the development of myocardial injury after non cardiac surgery and to&#xD;
      correlate it with other risk factors of for MINS.&#xD;
