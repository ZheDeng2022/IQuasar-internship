      This is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial testing the real-world&#xD;
      effectiveness of two different electronic health record (EHR) behavioral interventions in&#xD;
      improving a number of patient- and family-centered processes and outcomes of care among&#xD;
      seriously ill hospitalized patients. The investigators hypothesize that outcomes can be&#xD;
      improved without raising costs by requiring intensive care unit clinicians to (i) document a&#xD;
      prognostic estimate and (ii) provide a justification if they choose not to offer patients the&#xD;
      option of comfort-oriented care. To test this hypothesis the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      33-month trial at 17 intensive care units in 10 hospitals using the same Cerner EHR within&#xD;
      Atrium Health System.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The PONDER-ICU trial aims to generate large-scale, experimental evidence regarding the&#xD;
      real-world effectiveness of two different electronic health record (EHR) behavioral&#xD;
      interventions in improving a number of patient- and family-centered processes and outcomes of&#xD;
      care among seriously ill hospitalized patients. The interventions are designed to increase&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) physicians' and advanced practitioners' (physician assistants and&#xD;
      nurse practitioners) engagement of critically ill patients and caregivers in discussions&#xD;
      about alternative treatment options, including care focused on comfort. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      the investigators will conduct a 33-month pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial at 17 ICUs within 10 Atrium Health System hospitals. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that outcomes can be improved without raising costs by requiring ICU clinicians&#xD;
      to (i) document a prognostic estimate (Intervention A) and (ii) provide a justification if&#xD;
      they choose not to offer patients the option of comfort-oriented care (Intervention B).&#xD;
      Approximately 4,750 adult patients (1) with chronic life-limiting illness and receiving&#xD;
      continuous mechanical ventilation for ≥48 hours will be enrolled. Participating hospitals&#xD;
      will be randomized into 5 clusters of 2 hospitals each. Each hospital will first contribute a&#xD;
      minimum of 5 months of data collection during usual care in a control phase. Then, using the&#xD;
      step-wedge design, all hospitals will implement the two EHR-based interventions. The order in&#xD;
      which the interventions will be adopted and the timing of adoption at each hospital will both&#xD;
      be determined by random assignment. After 12 months of utilizing Intervention A or&#xD;
      Intervention B, each hospital will adopt and implement the second intervention in combination&#xD;
      with the other. By the end of the trial, all hospitals will have utilized the combined&#xD;
      interventions for at least 4 months. The primary outcome is a composite measure of hospital&#xD;
      length of stay and mortality. Secondary outcomes include an array of clinical outcomes, as&#xD;
      well as palliative care-related process measures.&#xD;
