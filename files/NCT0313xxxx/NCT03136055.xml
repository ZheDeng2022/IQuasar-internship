  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of pembrolizumab-based therapy in previously treated extrapulmonary&#xD;
      poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts of the study. In Part A, subjects are treated with pembrolizumab alone,&#xD;
      and in Part B with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or&#xD;
      irinotecan). Adaptive Simon's two-stage design is used. The overall plan hinges on the&#xD;
      activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient&#xD;
      activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A&#xD;
      and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study&#xD;
      will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a pretreatment tumor biopsy (unless the tumor is inaccessible&#xD;
      and/or a biopsy is not felt to be in the patient's best interest).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis population who demonstrated complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) radiographically according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by investigator. The analysis will include all subjects treated (ITT) who received at least one dose of the study treatment. If the final study consists of both Part A and Part B, the analysis will be done separately for each part.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the duration of the study, which is estimated to be approximately 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment with protocol therapy to the date of death due to any cause. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize OS. Median OS and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for Part A and B (if available) separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the duration of the study, which is estimated to be approximately 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response is defined as the time from the date of first response (CR or PR) until the date of disease progression or death. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize DOR. Median DOR and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained for Part A and B (if available) separately. Only patients who have a demonstrated response will be used in final analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Over the duration of the study, which is estimated to be approximately 32 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment with protocol therapy to the date of documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by The immune-related response criteria (irRC) for the immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) and RECIST v1.1 for PFS. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize progression free survival; median irPFS and PFS will be estimated with 95% confidence interval for Part A and B (if available) separately.</description>
