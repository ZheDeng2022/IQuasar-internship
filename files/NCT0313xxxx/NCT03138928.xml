      Purpose: To report the follow-up data for patients who had XEN45 gel stent implantation, a&#xD;
      new method of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Fifteen eyes of fifteen patients who had XEN45 gel stent implantation&#xD;
      surgery were investigated in the study. All the patients were examined preoperatively and at&#xD;
      the following postoperative time points: 1 day; 1 and 2 weeks; and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. Combined surgical&#xD;
      procedures (XEN 45 + phacoemulsification + intraocular lens) were performed in the cases that&#xD;
      had cataracts in addition to glaucoma.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that results in damage to the optic nerve and permanent&#xD;
      visual loss; more than 60 million people around the world are affected by glaucoma. Increased&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for the development of optic&#xD;
      nerve damage and changes in the visual field. Therefore, the most effective treatment&#xD;
      modality is the reduction of IOP, in order to prevent glaucoma progression and optic nerve&#xD;
      atrophy. Trabeculectomy and episcleral aqueous drainage implants are currently the most&#xD;
      widely used surgical methods for reducing IOP and treating glaucoma. Unfortunately, these&#xD;
      procedures have potentially destructive intraoperative and postoperative complications, such&#xD;
      as hypotony, choroidal effusion, blebitis, and endophthalmitis. Therefore, there is a trend&#xD;
      of developing new surgical procedures to avoid the complications arising from conventional&#xD;
      surgical procedures. These new surgical methods, called &quot;minimally invasive glaucoma surgery&quot;&#xD;
      (MIGS), have some advantages over the conventional glaucoma surgical procedures, such as ab&#xD;
      interno applicability, the elimination of external intervention requirements, and the ease of&#xD;
      performance alongside cataract surgery. These advantages allow MIGS methods to be safer and&#xD;
      less invasive than other surgical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The XEN gel stent (Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) is a recently developed, permanent, ab interno&#xD;
      collagen implant that reduces IOP by draining aqueous fluid from the anterior chamber into&#xD;
      the subconjunctival space. The stent is a hydrophilic tube that is 6 mm long and composed of&#xD;
      porcine gelatin crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. There are three sizes of this stent: 45 μm,&#xD;
      63 μm, and 140 μm, all with different inner diameters. The XEN45 gel stent is CE-marked in&#xD;
      the European Union, and it is indicated for the treatment of refractory glaucoma that has&#xD;
      proven resistant to previous surgical treatment and for patients with primary open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma (POAG), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or pigmentary glaucoma that cannot be controlled&#xD;
      with the maximum tolerated medical therapy. It is also licensed for use in Canada,&#xD;
      Switzerland, and Turkey. The XEN45 gel stent was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA). Because it is a new device, there are still unknown aspects of its&#xD;
      efficacy and safety and of the proper surgical technique for its use. This study aimed to&#xD;
      report the follow-up data after XEN45 gel stent implantation surgery in patients with&#xD;
      different types of glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a retrospective, consecutive case series study. Patients who had an XEN45 gel stent&#xD;
      implantation surgery between January 2015 and March 2016 were enrolled in the study. Patients&#xD;
      were included whose refractory glaucoma was resistant to previous surgical treatment.&#xD;
      Patients were also included who had POAG, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or pigmentary glaucoma,&#xD;
      with uncontrolled IOP and progressive visual field damage despite using the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of topical antiglaucomatous medications. Patients who had previous glaucoma surgery were&#xD;
      included as well. The exclusion criteria included primary closed-angle glaucoma, a history of&#xD;
      uveitis, and the presence of corneal disease. Patients who did not attend follow-up visits&#xD;
      were also excluded. All patients were informed about the treatment and the potential&#xD;
      complications. Informed patient consents were obtained preoperatively. The procedures of the&#xD;
      study were approved by the institutional review board of the hospital and adhered to the&#xD;
      tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics&#xD;
      committee (approval code: TUTF-BAEK 2016/213).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the XEN45 implantation, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and gonioscopic examination were&#xD;
      performed. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (AT 900, Haag&#xD;
      Strait, Bern, Germany). A detailed fundus examination was done using a 78-dioptre non-contact&#xD;
      lens after pupil dilatation by 1% tropicamide gutt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions by the same surgeon&#xD;
      (OK). Irrigation of the eyelashes, eyelids, and periorbicular tissues was performed with&#xD;
      antiseptic 10% povidone iodine. While using an eye speculum, 5% povidone iodine was flushed&#xD;
      onto the conjunctiva and fornix for two minutes; conjunctival irrigation was then completed&#xD;
      with saline. The surgery was performed under peribulbar anaesthesia with 5 mL prilocaine and&#xD;
      5 mL bupivacaine. After peribulbar anaesthesia, the superonasal quadrant of the conjunctiva&#xD;
      was marked by blue surgical dye 3 mm posterior to the limbus. Clear corneal incisions (main&#xD;
      and side-port) were created in the inferotemporal and superotemporal quadrants; a highly&#xD;
      cohesive viscoelastic was used to stabilise the anterior chamber during surgery. A 27-gauge&#xD;
      pre-loaded injector was placed into the eye through the main clear corneal incision at the&#xD;
      inferotemporal quadrant. The needle was directed toward the superonasal quadrant (Figure 3).&#xD;
      One hand was used to manipulate the injector, and the other hand was used to fix and rotate&#xD;
      the eye. The needle was pushed into the sclera and carried forward into the subconjunctival&#xD;
      space. The surgery was performed under gonioscopic control. A 6-mm-long implant was created&#xD;
      to be positioned 2 mm into the subconjunctival space, 3 mm into the sclera, and 1 mm into the&#xD;
      anterior chamber. Therefore, visualization of the tip of the needle exiting from the sclera&#xD;
      indicated that an optimal 3-mm intrascleral tunnel had been formed. The XEN45 implant was&#xD;
      deployed by rotating a dial on the inserter. Once bleb formation was seen, the needle was&#xD;
      withdrawn. The viscoelastic material was aspirated, and then 0.1 ml of 1% cefuroxime was&#xD;
      injected into the anterior chamber. Finally, the clear corneal incisions were hydrated with a&#xD;
      balanced salt solution. Mitomycin C was not injected into the conjunctiva at any stage of the&#xD;
      surgery. Topical steroid and antibiotic treatments were applied after the surgery. A topical&#xD;
      steroid (prednisolone acetate 1%) was applied six or more times daily to control&#xD;
      postoperative intraocular inflammation. The topical steroid treatment was stopped after the&#xD;
      first month postoperative. Ocular massage for one minute four times daily was recommended&#xD;
      during the postoperative period. Needling was not performed at any of the postoperative&#xD;
      visits. Topical antiglaucomatous medications were added as needed according to the&#xD;
      postoperative IOP levels. Follow-up visits were planned for 1 day, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2,&#xD;
      3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined surgery (XEN45 + phacoemulsification + intraocular lens) was performed in the cases&#xD;
      that had cataracts in addition to glaucoma. In combined surgery, the XEN45 implantation was&#xD;
      performed after the phacoemulsification. After the intraocular lens implantation in the&#xD;
      capsular sac, the anterior chamber was filled with a highly cohesive viscoelastic material.&#xD;
      Then, the same procedures as were described previously were carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data were compiled into a computer file for statistical analysis, and Statistical&#xD;
      Package for Social Sciences for Windows 17.0 was used to perform the Wilcoxon signed ranks&#xD;
      test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
