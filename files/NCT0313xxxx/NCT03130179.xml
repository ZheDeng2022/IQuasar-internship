  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to verify the same effectiveness and safety profile for the test&#xD;
      product, Nicorette Strongmint lozenge, as for an already approved product, NiQuitin® Minimint&#xD;
      lozenge (reference product), in a standardized mode. This verification is done in a so-called&#xD;
      bioequivalence study, which means that the same amount of the same active substance&#xD;
      (nicotine), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration, and meeting the&#xD;
      same or comparable standards is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study visits, blood samples will be drawn to measure the level of the substance in&#xD;
      the blood to verify that the two products are comparable. Tolerability of the treatments will&#xD;
      be evaluated based on reported and observed adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, two-period crossover, randomized, fasting, open-label, bioequivalence&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      244 male and female volunteers with a smoking history of minimum 3 months and aged between 18&#xD;
      and 45 years, inclusive, and motivated to quit will be included. The treatment administration&#xD;
      order will be randomized with an equal number of subjects in each treatment sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single doses of 4 mg Nicorette Strongmint Lozenge (i.e. test product) and 4 mg NiQuitin®&#xD;
      Minimint Lozenge (i.e. reference product) will be administered in a standardized mode, on two&#xD;
      separate treatment visits. A washout period of minimum 48 hours will separate the treatment&#xD;
      administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An abstinence period of 12 hours including an overnight stay at the clinic is required at&#xD;
      both treatment occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be drawn pre-dose (i.e. within 5 minutes before drug&#xD;
      administration) and at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes, as well as 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after start of drug administration. Thus, 17 samples will be collected&#xD;
      per treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur.&#xD;
