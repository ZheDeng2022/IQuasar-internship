      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL) score of adding oral Oligo Fucoidan to platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy in comparison with placebo in subjects with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) of adding&#xD;
      oral Oligo Fucoidan to platinum-based chemotherapy in comparison with placebo in subjects&#xD;
      with NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study to evaluate the QoL score of&#xD;
      Oligo Fucoidan plus platinum-based chemotherapy versus placebo plus platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy in subjects with NSCLC. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      4.4 g BID of Oligo Fucoidan or placebo BID. Subject randomization will be stratified by NSCLC&#xD;
      disease stage (stage III and stage IV) and platinum-based drug (cisplatin and carboplatin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-part study. The study treatment will be planned as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Part I (Platinum-based Treatment Phase): Oligo Fucoidan/placebo in combination with 4~6&#xD;
           cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part II (Extension Phase): Continuous Oligo Fucoidan/placebo treatment after subject&#xD;
           completed platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study treatment duration of investigational product from Part I to Part II will be&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing of oral Oligo Fucoidan/placebo will begin on Study Day -2, 2 days prior to the start&#xD;
      of the platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, and will continue twice a day (BID) through the&#xD;
      following 6-months treatment period, which includes platinum-based treatment phase and&#xD;
      extension phase, if there's no treatment interruption. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      platinum-based IV infusion starting on Day 1 of each cycle, 3 weeks per cycle. Subjects will&#xD;
      continue to receive Oligo Fucoidan/placebo for 6 months until develop of treatment toxicity&#xD;
      which in the Investigator's opinion prohibits for further therapy, or until radiographic&#xD;
      progression of disease. Subjects who experience toxicities due to chemotherapy may require a&#xD;
      delay in the dosing schedule or a dose modification. Should a subject not receive&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy on a scheduled cycle, a rescheduled cycle will be designated when&#xD;
      chemotherapy is reintroduced, but no more than 2 weeks delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit for subjects who have completed platinum-based treatment phase will be considered&#xD;
      as the End of Part I Visit (end of platinum-based treatment phase). The visit for subjects&#xD;
      who have completed 6-months treatment period (Part I &amp; Part II) will be considered as the End&#xD;
      of Treatment (EOT) Visit. It is preferable that EOT Visit procedures will be conducted for&#xD;
      subjects prior to the initiation of another anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic tumor assessments will be conducted at screening period, Cycle 4, End of&#xD;
      Platinum-based Treatment Phase, and EOT. Radiographic information will be collected according&#xD;
      to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicities will be graded at each study visit according to the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life assessment as measured by the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) as well as health-related&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire designed by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI),&#xD;
      NHRI QLQ-TCM, based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) perspective. Both of them will be&#xD;
      performed at Study Day -2, Day 8 of Cycle 1, Day 1 of Cycle 3 &amp; Cycle 5, and End of&#xD;
      Platinum-based Treatment Phase.&#xD;
