  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skeletal system is one of the most common sites for metastatic spread of many&#xD;
      malignancies. Metastatic bone disease (MBD) can be associated with a significant reduction in&#xD;
      quality of life due to debilitating pain and pathologic fractures. Multiple providers are&#xD;
      involved in treating patients with MBD which can result in fragmented and delayed delivery of&#xD;
      care. This fragmentation also leads to poor outcomes and patient experience. This project&#xD;
      will assess whether it is feasible to integrate a multidisciplinary Rapid Access Metastatic&#xD;
      Bone Disease Program (RAMP) at the Investigator's institution to improve the delivery of care&#xD;
      to patients presenting with pelvic and lower extremity MBD. The goals of RAMP are: 1) Improve&#xD;
      outcome and quality of care provided to MBD patients. 2) Improve patients experience through&#xD;
      the participant's treatment journey. 3) Avert extra health care costs caused by unplanned&#xD;
      admissions through ER and decrease redundancies due to unnecessary multiple clinic visits and&#xD;
      double-ordering of diagnostic tests. This project will be designed to optimize the use of&#xD;
      existing clinic resources more efficiently. Cancer patients and their loved ones will be&#xD;
      actively engaged in the design of this project to better achieve its goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 140,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed annually in Canada, with nearly half of&#xD;
      which metastasize to bone. The skeletal system is one of the most common sites for metastatic&#xD;
      spread of many visceral malignancies, especially cancers originating from breast, prostate,&#xD;
      lung, thyroid and kidney. Hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma,&#xD;
      also primarily manifest with multiple aggressive lytic lesions in the bone. A Skeletal&#xD;
      Related Event (SRE) is the term given when a metastatic lesion arises in bone. With advances&#xD;
      in effective systemic treatment and supportive care, the duration of survival of patients&#xD;
      with bone metastases has improved substantially. This improvement in survival can be&#xD;
      accompanied by significant morbidity and reduction in quality of life secondary to pain,&#xD;
      pathologic fracture, and spinal cord compression from SREs. Pain and impaired mobility occur&#xD;
      in approximately 65%-75% of patients with bone metastases. SREs are also associated with high&#xD;
      economic burden secondary to increased costs of treatment and high rates of hospitalizations.&#xD;
      It is estimated that a single episode of SRE can cost the medical system 36,462 USD. The&#xD;
      current literature reflects significant diversity in the approach of diagnosing and treating&#xD;
      MBD. Therefore, numerous studies have advocated the need for a multidisciplinary clinic to&#xD;
      co-ordinate the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients with MBD patients. This&#xD;
      strategy has also been proposed to improve the delivery of early and multimodal palliative&#xD;
      management for patients in a cost effective approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives: The aims of this project are: 1) Assess feasibility of establishing and&#xD;
      integrating a multidisciplinary Rapid Access Metastatic Bone Disease Program (RAMP) at the&#xD;
      Investigator's institution to improve the delivery of care to patients presenting with pelvic&#xD;
      and lower extremity MBD. 2) Centralize referrals and streamline clinical care pathways for&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with MBD to pelvis and lower extremity. 3) Assess improvement in outcome&#xD;
      and patient experience. The objectives of this project are: 1) Establish a core&#xD;
      multidisciplinary RAMP team to develop a patient-centered clinical care pathway for diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment. 2) Establish a standardized and rapid referral process for RAMP. 3) Triage&#xD;
      consults and coordinate their integration into pre-existing weekly &quot;musculoskeletal oncology&quot;&#xD;
      clinic at the cancer center. 4) Develop a centralized registry for patients presenting to&#xD;
      RAMP to assess provider performance and evaluate the success of established clinical care&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
