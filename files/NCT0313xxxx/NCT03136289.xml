      The aim of this study was to examine the association between family consumer behaviors&#xD;
      (healthy food availability and supermarket spending) and adolescent prediabetes and diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      NHANES is a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      and Prevention (CDC), a detailed description of which is available elsewhere. The NHANES&#xD;
      administers annual face-to-face health surveys in a nationally representative sample of&#xD;
      civilian, non-institutionalized households in the US. In addition to core questions&#xD;
      documenting household demographic and health characteristics, survey instruments collect&#xD;
      information on current health and disease status, including several questionnaires on health&#xD;
      quality indicators and lifestyle practices. Besides survey instruments, NHANES collects&#xD;
      information on select clinical examinations and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include NHANES subjects from 2007-2010 who were 12-19 years old and from&#xD;
      households where an eligible person had administered the consumer behavior questionnaire&#xD;
      (CBQ). The CBQ was developed in partnership with the Economic Research Service of the US&#xD;
      Department of Agriculture and has been a part of NHANES from 2007-2010. A total of 2,520&#xD;
      children and adolescents met the eligibility criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food Availability and Expenditure The primary variables of interest for the study included&#xD;
      household healthy food availability and supermarket spending on food that was assessed in the&#xD;
      CBQ. Availability will be examined for five food items in the household including fruits,&#xD;
      dark green vegetables, fat-free/low fat milk, salty snacks, and soft drinks. The responses&#xD;
      for each item were ordinal, ranging from always, most of the time, sometimes, rarely, to&#xD;
      never. Dark green vegetables included fresh dried, canned and frozen vegetables, and&#xD;
      interviewers were instructed to exclude lettuce. Salty snacks included chips and crackers,&#xD;
      but not nuts. The types of milk considered low-fat were skim or 0% and 1%. Soft drinks&#xD;
      included soda, fruit-flavored drink and fruit punch; while 100% juice or sports drinks were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composite variable that incorporated answers to all the five food items will be created for&#xD;
      food availability. First, a decreasing score ranging from 5 to 1 was assigned from &quot;always&quot;&#xD;
      to &quot;never&quot; responses for the healthy food items including fruits, dark green vegetables, and&#xD;
      fat-free/low fat milk; whereas an increasing score ranging from 1 to 5 was assigned for&#xD;
      &quot;always&quot; to &quot;never&quot; response for unhealthy food items including salty snacks and soft drinks.&#xD;
      A cumulative score will be calculated for each participant that ranged from 5 to 25, where a&#xD;
      higher value indicated higher availability of healthy food(s) in the household. A cumulative&#xD;
      score will only be calculated for participants with a non-missing response on all five&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food spending will be examined by the amount of money (in US Dollars) the household spent in&#xD;
      the past 30 days on supermarket store purchases, non-food items, food at other stores, eating&#xD;
      out and carryout/delivered foods. Non-food spending was asked as a part of supermarket store&#xD;
      spending and it included money used towards cleaning and paper supplies, pet food, alcoholic&#xD;
      beverages and cigarettes. This will be first subtracted from the total supermarket spending&#xD;
      to give supermarket spending on food items alone. It will then be divided by the total food&#xD;
      spending of the household (sum of the above food spending questions) to also calculate the&#xD;
      proportion of spending on supermarket store food items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediabetes and Diabetes The primary outcome of interest will be adolescent prediabetes and&#xD;
      diabetes. Pre-diabetics will be included with diabetics to determine the impact of family&#xD;
      consumers on a wider range of glycemic status. Additionally, they are the most amenable to&#xD;
      dietary and lifestyle changes in preventing further progression to overt diabetes. These will&#xD;
      be computed by the individual's hemoglobin A1c (A1c) status. A1c values are relatively stable&#xD;
      after collection15 and reflect 3 months of glycemic control. It has been shown to have less&#xD;
      day-to-day as well as inter-subject and intra-subject variability16,17. The HbA1c&#xD;
      concentration is expressed directly as %HbA1c. A participant was considered pre-diabetic or&#xD;
      diabetic if he/she had an A1c â‰¥ 5.7 % (39 mmol/mol)18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Variables Covariates were selected as those designated most important in the&#xD;
      association between adolescent obesity and consumer behaviors in existing literature. These&#xD;
      included socio-demographic characteristics including age, gender, race, parental educational&#xD;
      attainment and income levels, and household size. Physical activity, which was defined as&#xD;
      participation in vigorous activity such as sports, fitness and recreational activities that&#xD;
      increased the heart rate, was also examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The prevalence (%) with standard error (SE) of prediabetes and diabetes&#xD;
      will be estimated across different levels of study covariates. First, the distribution of&#xD;
      responses to the five food availability questions as well as the cumulative healthy food&#xD;
      availability score will be examined for the study population. The cumulative score will be&#xD;
      dichotomized on the median value of 14.96 and divided into high and low availability of&#xD;
      healthy food. Next, a chi square test will be used to look at the relationship between&#xD;
      healthy food availability and adolescent prediabetes and diabetes in the population. When&#xD;
      examining the monthly household supermarket spending in USD, a log transformation will be&#xD;
      used due to a large degree of positive skew. The proportion of supermarket spending will be&#xD;
      dichotomized at the median value of 0.67 to divide the study population into high versus low&#xD;
      supermarket food spending. The prevalence (%) with SE of high healthy food availability and&#xD;
      geometric mean USD with 95% confidence interval (CI) of monthly household supermarket food&#xD;
      spending will be summarized across various socio-demographic and physical activity levels of&#xD;
      the study population. A chi-square test will be used to demonstrate significant differences&#xD;
      in the prevalence of high healthy food availability and high supermarket spending proportion&#xD;
      for each demographic characteristic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of variance will be carried out to examine the relationship between healthy food&#xD;
      availability (from the cumulative score) and supermarket spending. Subsequent correlation&#xD;
      analyses were used to examine the inter-relationships between several variables in the&#xD;
      consumer behavior questionnaire (data not shown).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unadjusted and adjusted associations between adolescent prediabetes and diabetes will be&#xD;
      first examined with high healthy food availability (versus low availability) and then with&#xD;
      log supermarket food expenditure in USD, using separate logistic regression models. Three&#xD;
      multivariate models were established for each association: where the first was adjusted for&#xD;
      age and gender, the second also adjusted for income and race, and the third further adjusted&#xD;
      for education, physical activity and household size. The fully adjusted models will finally&#xD;
      be stratified by gender to check for effect modification. The above associations were&#xD;
      estimated using prevalence odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be conducted with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,&#xD;
      North Carolina), and the statistical significance level was 0.05, unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
      Since NHANES is a complex probability sample, stratification and clustering of the design as&#xD;
      well as sampling weights were incorporated into the analysis for proper estimation of&#xD;
      nationally representative effect size and SE.&#xD;
