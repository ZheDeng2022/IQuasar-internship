      Short stature is defined as height below 3rd centile or less than two standard deviations&#xD;
      below the median height for that age and sex according to the population standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 3% children in any population will be short, amongst which half will be&#xD;
      physiological (familial or constitutional) and half will be pathological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that approximately 60%-80% of all short children at or below 2standerd&#xD;
      deviation fit the definition of idiopathic short stature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth and development of human require an adequate supply of many different nutritional&#xD;
      factors. Nutritional deficiencies causing short stature include: those associated with&#xD;
      stunting as: protein and zinc, nutrient associated with rickts as :vitamin D, and those with&#xD;
      bone abnormalities as: cupper,zin,and vitamin c Insufficient nutrition tends to lead to short&#xD;
      stature with a delayed pattern of growth. Under-nutrition can be isolated (eg, caused by&#xD;
      inadequate food supply or self-imposed restriction, such as fear of obesity), or it may be a&#xD;
      component of an underlying systemic disease that interferes with food intake or absorption,&#xD;
      or increases energy needs. The hallmark of under-nutrition is low weight-for-height .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trace elements are dietary mineral that are present in very minute quantities (less than&#xD;
      0.01%),they divided into three groups (WHO classification): Essential elements such as iodine&#xD;
      and zinc ,Probably essential elements such as manganese and silicon , Potentially toxic&#xD;
      elements such as fluoride,lead,cadmium, mercury, &amp; Lithium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trace elements play significant functions as growth,oregulation of gene expression,&#xD;
      immunity,the endocrine system, brain development, and the cell protection system. An adequate&#xD;
      micronutrient intake is crucial for health, particularly in infants, children and adolescents&#xD;
      ,deficiency in micronutrients can affect growth and development, particularly during periods&#xD;
      of rapid growth.&#xD;
