  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP) has collaborated with doctors from&#xD;
      around the world to build the first International ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with&#xD;
      Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation) REDCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture) Registry. This registry is an international collaboration with&#xD;
      ROHHAD patients and their physicians recruited from around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this IRB-approved research study is to gain a better understanding of the&#xD;
      various health problems ROHHAD patients face with advancing age, and how these relate to each&#xD;
      patient's specific medical course. With a better understanding of specific ROHHAD and&#xD;
      associated clinical manifestations, we will be able to better anticipate healthcare needs and&#xD;
      to provide more accurate guidelines to healthcare providers world-wide in caring for patients&#xD;
      with ROHHAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to obtain detailed phenotypic information (information about health and&#xD;
      well-being) on patients with ROHHAD. Participation would require filling out a confidential&#xD;
      survey that asks questions regarding health and past medical history. Involvement in the&#xD;
      project is completely voluntary and there is no compensation for taking part. However, this&#xD;
      project will help us learn more about this devastating disease, with the goal of advancing&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROHHAD is a rare, devastating disorder in which affected children demonstrate abnormalities&#xD;
      of respiratory control, hypothalamic/endocrine function, and autonomic nervous system (ANS)&#xD;
      dysregulation (ANSD). Affected children are seemingly normal until development of dramatic&#xD;
      and rapid weight gain which occurs over a 6-month period between 1.5 and 10 years of age -&#xD;
      heralding disease onset. The ROHHAD phenotype appears to evolve with advancing age and with&#xD;
      variable timing of successive features. This study aims to develop a patient registry for&#xD;
      ROHHAD, which will provide crucial insight into disease development, improving outcome in&#xD;
      these children through improving early recognition of the disorder, understanding the&#xD;
      phenotypic spectrum, and evolution of clinical course. Data will be stored in REDCap&#xD;
      (Research Electronic Data Capture) system a secure web application designed exclusively to&#xD;
      support data capture for research studies in a secure manner. The REDCap server is hosted&#xD;
      securely at Northwestern University, behind a firewall, with virus protection, and using&#xD;
      Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication to encrypt communication between a user and the&#xD;
      server. Protected Health Information (PHI) will be labeled as such in the database and access&#xD;
      to it will be restricted to the Principal Investigator (PI) and key personnel participating&#xD;
      in the consent process and follow up contact of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the International ROHHAD REDCap Registry will be identified and recruited&#xD;
      from CAMP's registry of new, current, and past ROHHAD referrals, including ROHHAD patients&#xD;
      referred for testing and/or consultation. Additionally, patients may also be recruited via&#xD;
      the internet using emails, Facebook pages, and mailing lists for family groups. Anyone&#xD;
      interested will be offered inclusion into the International ROHHAD Registry. Participants&#xD;
      will be able to participate remotely, from their homes or locations where they have internet,&#xD;
      phone, and computer access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified data collected through the REDCap registry will be de-identified and analyzed.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this study will be offered participation in the NIH GRDR. This is an&#xD;
      optional part of the study, and is not required for inclusion. The Global Rare Disease&#xD;
      Registry (GRDR) is established by the NIH Office of Rare Disease Research. The goal of the&#xD;
      GRDR is to establish a data repository of de-identified patient data, aggregated in a&#xD;
      standardized manner, using Common Data Elements (CDEs) and standardized terminology.&#xD;
      De-identification of patient's data will utilize the Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) system.&#xD;
      Lurie Children's Hospital will retain ownership of all data shared with the GRDR. The&#xD;
      de-identified data in the GRDR will be available to all investigators to enable analyses&#xD;
      across many rare diseases and to facilitate various biomedical studies, including clinical&#xD;
      trials, in pursuit of developing drugs and therapeutics to improve the healthcare and the&#xD;
      quality of life for the many millions of people who are diagnosed with rare diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient agreeing to be part of the GRDR will have their data de-identified and this&#xD;
      de-identified data exported and shared with the GRDR. These participants are also given the&#xD;
      option to be contacted for participation in clinical trials. If this option is chosen, any&#xD;
      researcher accessing de-identified information through the GRDR and planning to conduct a&#xD;
      clinical trial will be allowed to contact the CAMP project coordinator to ask that patients&#xD;
      fitting the profile of needed participants be contacted and offered inclusion. No&#xD;
      de-identified information will be shared with researchers outside of CAMP, rather the CAMP&#xD;
      project coordinator will contact identified patients fitting participation criteria to share&#xD;
      contact information and details for the clinical trial. Interested patients will then be&#xD;
      given to the option to contact researchers conducting clinical trials at their discretion.&#xD;
