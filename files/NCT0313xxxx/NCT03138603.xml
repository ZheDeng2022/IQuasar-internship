    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test if a commonly used, FDA-approved medication,&#xD;
      called metoprolol, given during and after surgery, reduces the possibility of heart related&#xD;
      complications in patients with CAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be beta-blocker naïve for at least 30 days prior to surgery and be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive metoprolol tartrate or placebo. Patients will receive up to 3 IV&#xD;
      doses of study drug (placebo or IV metoprolol tartrate 5mg) prior to extubation, and&#xD;
      subsequently an oral dose (placebo or 25mg metoprolol tartrate) in the PACU, and then oral&#xD;
      dosing at approx. every 8 hours thereafter through postop day 3 (72 hrs). From arrival in the&#xD;
      preop holding area through up to 72 hours postop or end of study treatment (whichever occurs&#xD;
      first), patients will be continuously monitored with Holter ECG, a mobile hemodynamic monitor&#xD;
      (VisiMobile), daily follow-up visits to include 12-lead ECG, and blood collections for serial&#xD;
      cardiac biomarkers for high-sensitivity troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the previously-mentioned suite of wireless monitors, we propose to apply two&#xD;
      physiologic monitors that focus on the patient's autonomic state. These two measurements are&#xD;
      non-invasive and potentially will enable us to better characterize the patient's autonomic&#xD;
      response at critical timepoints. Additional benefits of these monitors include their possible&#xD;
      correlation with pain and stress, and their potential as key elements in future Mobile Health&#xD;
      (mHealth)-based studies and therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first of the enhanced monitors uses an off-the-shelf wristband fitness tracker (e.g.,&#xD;
      Fitbit) for collection of heart rate, and from these data, derives the patient's heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV). HRV is a dynamic measure of the number and type of distinct frequencies&#xD;
      that exist within the subject's overall heart beat pattern, and can be related to both&#xD;
      cardiovagal tone and numerous affective states. There is some evidence that the acute&#xD;
      response to pain correlates with HRV. Additionally, HRV has been found to have decreased&#xD;
      high-frequency components in patients with chronic pain. Our HRV collection and analysis&#xD;
      would use the technology underlying the Mindset app, (but not the app itself) to stream the&#xD;
      heart rate data to a secured tablet and perform the heart rate variability analysis., The&#xD;
      Mindset app, which itself will not be used by the patient is being utilized in a current&#xD;
      IRB-approved study as a potential sensor-assisted e-therapy for PTSD (P.I. Dr. Rumi Price,&#xD;
      Ph.D.). This app also allows for the real-time, tablet-based collection of subjective data&#xD;
      (e.g., pain and anxiety scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second of the monitors uses an ultra-thin, ultra-compliant non-invasive sensor to&#xD;
      intermittently measure changes in temperature and blood flow on skin's surface. This highly&#xD;
      sensitive device can detect subtle changes in skin blood flow, including those that occur as&#xD;
      part of the autonomic response to stressful conditions. The thermal sensors, referred to as&#xD;
      epidermal transient plane source (ETPS) sensors, utilize the well-established transient plane&#xD;
      source method toward the identification of the thermal characteristics of skin. The ETPS&#xD;
      sensor capabilities have been thoroughly studied, and the device concepts have been employed&#xD;
      successfully in clinical studies related to blood flow[8], dermatological health[9], thermal&#xD;
      transport properties of skin, and wounds. The measures that the ETPS sensors--cutaneous blood&#xD;
      flow and temperature-will be analyzed along with HRV responses to identify potential&#xD;
      correlations between autonomic tone and the subject's responses to different phases of&#xD;
      post-operative recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with the additional history questions asked of the subject, the subject may&#xD;
      also be asked about the presence or absence of previous chronic pain and/or anxiety. At&#xD;
      several time points along the course of recovery, the subject may be asked to provide&#xD;
      subjective information on his/her pain and anxiety. Data on medication administration (type&#xD;
      of medication, dose amount, and time of administration) may also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up at approximately 30 days and 1 year after surgery.&#xD;
