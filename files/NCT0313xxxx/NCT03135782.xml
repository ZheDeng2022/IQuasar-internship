    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well provider training works in increasing patient&#xD;
      tobacco cessation counseling and referrals for patients with cancer undergoing radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Health care provider training in motivational interviewing techniques and utilizing&#xD;
      tobacco cessation resources may help doctors understand how health care providers can&#xD;
      effectively increase their confidence in talking to patients about tobacco cessation&#xD;
      counseling.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if training providers on tobacco cessation resources increases the frequency&#xD;
      of counseling and referrals at initial and follow-up consultations for cancer patients who&#xD;
      use tobacco and are scheduled to receive radiation at Oregon Health and Science University&#xD;
      (OHSU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Increase provider frequency of tobacco use quantification and type. II. Increase frequency&#xD;
      of provider assessment of tobacco cessation readiness in current users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Increase frequency and types of tobacco cessation resources and medicines offered and&#xD;
      utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Increase frequency and type of follow-up planned if referred to cessation resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL CHART REVIEW: Medical charts from patients with diagnoses of head and neck cancer,&#xD;
      lung cancer, prostate cancer, or breast cancer are reviewed at months 1-12 to determine the&#xD;
      frequency of tobacco assessments and documentation of discussions with patients regarding&#xD;
      tobacco use and utilization of cessation resources as before and after the proposed training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROVIDER TRAINING: Providers undergo training to use patient coaching such as the 5A's (Ask,&#xD;
      Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange), to conduct regular tobacco intake assessment using&#xD;
      motivational interviewing techniques. Providers also undergo training to use public/community&#xD;
      tobacco cessation resources for patients ready to quit within six weeks, and have access to&#xD;
      pharmacy residents for ad-hoc prescribing questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT COACHING: Patients attend 4 phone or in-person motivational interviewing coaching&#xD;
      sessions over 30-45 minutes for 6-8 weeks or longer as needed.&#xD;
