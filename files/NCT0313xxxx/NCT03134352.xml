    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center phase IIA study to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Fugan ointment versus placebo applied to&#xD;
      involved skin of subjects with mild to moderate subacute eczema.&#xD;

      In this study, patients will be recruited and randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 into Fugan bid&#xD;
      group (Fugan AM + Fugan PM), Fugan qd group (Fugan AM + Placebo PM), and placebo group&#xD;
      (Placebo AM + Placebo PM). Randomization will be stratified by disease severity (mild IGA=2&#xD;
      vs. moderate IGA=3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be given 3-week treatment and followed up for two weeks after the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period is set as 1 week. Subjects will be given 3-week treatment and followed up&#xD;
      for two weeks after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 310 subjects will be randomized to achieve 250 evaluable subjects completing&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
