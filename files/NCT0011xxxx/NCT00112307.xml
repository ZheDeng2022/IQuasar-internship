      The primary goal of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of using magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR) imaging guidance in the Magnetic Resonance Therapy (MRT) unit at the Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital during the implantation of brachytherapy applicators in patients with gynecologic&#xD;
      malignancies. Patients with gynecologic malignancies requiring brachytherapy are currently&#xD;
      treated under either fluoroscopic or CT visualization of the brachytherapy applicator.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging has been shown in many studies to provide superior visualization&#xD;
      of the cervix, vagina and uterus compared to CT. However no prior study has examined the&#xD;
      feasibility of using real-time magnetic resonance imaging to assist in the guidance of&#xD;
      gynecologic brachytherapy applicators&#xD;

      The primary endpoint involves the ability of the MRT guided procedure to protect bladder and&#xD;
      rectal tissues from inadvertent insertion of the interstitial needles used to deliver&#xD;
      brachytherapy. MR images obtained on the MRT unit should provide clear delineation of the&#xD;
      bladder and rectum and allow for greater accuracy and avoidance of these normal tissues upon&#xD;
      interstitial needle insertion. CT images will be obtained following the insertion of needles&#xD;
      using the MRT unit. The procedure will be considered a failure if CT imaging identifies the&#xD;
      insertion of needles into the bladder or rectum that was not detected using MR. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include the ability of MR imaging to accurately reconstruct dosimetric plans and to&#xD;
      construct dose volume histograms after the implantation of interstitial needles as well as&#xD;
      the ability of MR imaging to accurately determine tumor, bladder and rectal volumes.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will also include the assessment of acute skin, genitourinary and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities as well as an assessment of tumor progression or recurrence&#xD;
      during a 180 day follow-up period.&#xD;
