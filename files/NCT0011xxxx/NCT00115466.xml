    <textblock>
      This comparative, multicentre, randomised clinical trial is designed with two parallel groups&#xD;
      that will follow a treatment either with an autologous implant of ASCs (Adipose Derived Stem&#xD;
      Cells) and fibrin glue (tissue adhesive material) or with fibrin glue alone for the&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment of complex perianal fistula.&#xD;

      Comparative, multicentre, randomised clinical trial, designed with two parallel groups that&#xD;
      will follow a treatment either with an autologous implant of ASCs (Adipose Derived Stem&#xD;
      Cells) and fibrin glue (tissue adhesive material) or with fibrin glue alone for the&#xD;
      NON-SURGICAL treatment of complex perianal fistula. The closure/healing of the fistula will&#xD;
      be evaluated periodically, and it will be considered completely closed if there is no&#xD;
      suppuration from the external orifice and re-epithelialisation can be observed at 8 weeks&#xD;
      after the administration of the randomised therapy.&#xD;

             that fulfil some of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No palpation of the fistula tract beneath the perianal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A tract that is parallel to the rectum on exploration with a stylet.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Associated faecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Risk factors of anal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one previous operation for a fistulous disorder.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients that have already been subjected to a colonoscopy within a period of up to 6&#xD;
             months prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that are extremely thin who should not be subjected to liposuction.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other medical condition that in the judgement of the investigator could interfere&#xD;
             with their optimal participation in the study or produce a significant risk to the&#xD;
             patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have participated in another study in the 30 days prior to this one or&#xD;
             that have planned to participate simultaneously in another study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric disorder or other factors that in the judgement of the investigator could&#xD;
