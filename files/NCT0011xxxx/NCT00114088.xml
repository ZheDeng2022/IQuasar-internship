      The Surgical Treatments Outcomes Project for Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (STOP-DUB) is a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial that assessed the efficacy and effectiveness of&#xD;
      hysterectomy versus endometrial ablation (EA) for dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) in&#xD;
      women for whom medical management has not provided relief. Institutional review&#xD;
      board-approved study sites included the coordinating center, chair's office, the American&#xD;
      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and 33 clinical centers in the United States and&#xD;
      Canada. STOP-DUB enrolled (1) 237 eligible patients for whom medical treatment had not been&#xD;
      successful and who were randomized to either hysterectomy or EA; and (2) an observational&#xD;
      cohort of 139 patients who were &quot;provisionally ineligible&quot; or who were eligible but did not&#xD;
      wish to be randomized. Enrollment began November 25, 1997 and ended June 30, 2001. Randomized&#xD;
      women were followed using telephone interviews at least 2 years and observational women were&#xD;
      followed a maximum of 6 months. We also collected information on return clinical center&#xD;
      visits and hospital bills from the sites directly. The primary outcome addressed by the&#xD;
      randomized trial is the impact of surgery on bleeding, pain, fatigue, and the major problem&#xD;
      (symptom) that led the woman to seek treatment for her condition, measured 1 year following&#xD;
      surgery. Additional outcomes included the impact of surgery at time points after 1 year;&#xD;
      changes in quality of life, activity limitation, sexual functioning, and urinary&#xD;
      incontinence; surgical complications; additional surgery; and resource utilization. The costs&#xD;
      and the relative cost-effectiveness of the two surgeries will be calculated. The main&#xD;
      scientific objective for the observational study was to examine changes over time in terms of&#xD;
      treatment selected, DUB-related symptoms, and quality of life. Enrolled women signed an&#xD;
      informed consent to participate.&#xD;
