  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ribavirin should be avoided during pregnancy and during the 6 months before pregnancy in both&#xD;
      the female and the male sexual partner. If a pregnancy occurs and is reported to the&#xD;
      Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry, the Registry will follow the pregnant woman throughout&#xD;
      pregnancy. The Registry will also follow the infant until 1 year of age. The goal of the&#xD;
      Registry is to learn more about the effects of ribavirin on pregnancy and the risk for birth&#xD;
      defects. Pregnant women exposed to ribavirin, either by taking ribavirin (during pregnancy or&#xD;
      6 months before pregnancy) or through a male sexual partner (who took ribavirin during the&#xD;
      female partner's pregnancy or during the 6 months before pregnancy), are encouraged to&#xD;
      contact the Registry.&#xD;

      Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog with antiviral activity, is used in combination with&#xD;
      interferons or pegylated interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV).&#xD;
      Extensive clinical studies have demonstrated that combination therapy with ribavirin and&#xD;
      interferons or pegylated interferons are efficacious treatments for HCV. However, ribavirin&#xD;
      has been assigned a FDA Pregnancy Category X classification, indicating that it should not be&#xD;
      used in women who are pregnant or in men whose partners may become pregnant. Because the&#xD;
      incidence of HCV is highest in the group with the highest reproductive potential, the 25 - 45&#xD;
      year age group, (CDC, 2001) it is likely that inadvertent pregnancy exposures will occur and&#xD;
      should be monitored. The primary objectives of this Registry are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between ribavirin and birth defects occurring in offspring&#xD;
           of female patients exposed to ribavirin during pregnancy or within six months after&#xD;
           therapy has stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the association between ribavirin and birth defects occurring in offspring&#xD;
           of females exposed to ribavirin during pregnancy or within six months after therapy has&#xD;
           stopped, through their male sexual partners taking ribavirin.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Female patients who become pregnant on ribavirin therapy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients who start ribavirin therapy while pregnant, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients who become pregnant post-ribavirin therapy (defined as the six&#xD;
                  month time period after therapy has stopped) or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females who become pregnant while their male sexual partner is on ribavirin&#xD;
                  therapy or&#xD;
&#xD;
