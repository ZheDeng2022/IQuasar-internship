      This study was a randomized, community-based trial testing whether dosing newborn infants in&#xD;
      the first few days after delivery with a large dose of vitamin A could reduce early infant&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality and improve growth. Pregnant women in 2 districts of Tamil Nadu State in&#xD;
      southern India were identified and recruited for participation. When the child was born,&#xD;
      study staff were notified and traveled to the house to collect information and provide the&#xD;
      vitamin A or placebo dose. Children were visited every two weeks until they were 6 months of&#xD;
      age to collect information about vital status and morbidity. All children were discharged&#xD;
      from the study at 6 months after growth was assessed and they received a 100,000 IU dose of&#xD;
      vitamin A.&#xD;

      I. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of studies over the past 15 years have demonstrated that clinical vitamin A&#xD;
      deficiency is associated with increased mortality in pre-school aged children (1,2) and that&#xD;
      supplementation of populations with endemic sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency can&#xD;
      significantly reduce total mortality (3-8). A recent meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials&#xD;
      showed that vitamin A supplementation of children 6 months through 5 years of age reduced&#xD;
      mortality by an average of 23% (9). While the average impact was 23%, there was significant&#xD;
      variation in the results of these studies. The impact was as high as 54% among children in an&#xD;
      underprivileged area of Tamil Nadu supplemented with small weekly doses of vitamin A (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the story of the impact of vitamin A supplementation in children 6 months and older is&#xD;
      clear, such is not the case for younger infants. Traditionally, it has been thought that the&#xD;
      full-time breast feeding practices associated with early infancy protected the infant from&#xD;
      becoming vitamin A deficient. It was not until the onset of weaning or the misuse of&#xD;
      bottle-feeding that clinical signs of xerophthalmia appeared (1). Recent evidence from a&#xD;
      variety of locations suggests that these traditional assumptions about the adequacy of breast&#xD;
      -feeding in assuring adequate vitamin A nutriture are suspect and likely unfounded. It is&#xD;
      well known that infants are born with very low body stores of vitamin A and they depend on&#xD;
      regular breast feeding or other sources to build body stores (13, 14). Therefore, if the&#xD;
      mother's breast milk has a lower than normal concentration of vitamin A, the infant will not&#xD;
      be able to meet daily requirements and increase body reserves. It has become clear that many&#xD;
      women in developing countries have poor vitamin A status themselves and that their breast&#xD;
      milk concentrations may be only half that found among women with adequate vitamin A status&#xD;
      (15). In addition, it has been shown in Indonesia that supplementation of women post-partum&#xD;
      can improve the vitamin A concentration in their blood and breast milk (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is becoming clearer that young infants in developing countries with endemic vitamin&#xD;
      A deficiency are at significant risk of being vitamin A deficient in spite of adequate breast&#xD;
      feeding behaviour, there is little data concerning the impact of supplementing this group&#xD;
      with vitamin A. Two major studies have addressed this issue, both done by the same group at&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins University, with opposite findings. Humphrey et al. have reported, in a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of 2067 infants born in a hospital in Bandung, Indonesia, that&#xD;
      direct supplementation of newborn infants within 24 hours of birth with 50,000 IU of vitamin&#xD;
      A was safe (10) and associated with a 64% reduction in infant mortality (11). In contrast,&#xD;
      West et al. studied over 11,000 infants under six months of age in their large intervention&#xD;
      trial in southern Nepal (17). They found no difference in mortality between those&#xD;
      supplemented with vitamin A versus those given placebo (relative risk =1.11, 95% CI 0.86 -&#xD;
      1.42). However, there were significant and potentially important differences between these&#xD;
      two studies. First, the time of dosing was different. The Indonesian study dosed infants&#xD;
      within 24 hours of birth whereas the Nepal study dosed infants when they were first&#xD;
      identified to the study during their distribution rounds every four months. On average then,&#xD;
      the age at first dosing was 2 months after the highest risk period and exposure to dietary&#xD;
      and other environmental factors. It may be that the time of dosing is critically important&#xD;
      for the development of early immune function or other protective mechanisms. Support for the&#xD;
      Indonesian findings has come from a recently discussed study in Bangladesh where&#xD;
      supplementation of mothers' post-partum was associated with a reduction in infant mortality&#xD;
      (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the apparent controversy in the scientific literature on early infant dosing with&#xD;
      vitamin A and the fact that this remains the highest risk period for mortality during&#xD;
      childhood, more data are urgently needed to resolve this confusion. If the Indonesian&#xD;
      findings can be replicated, the policy implications for developing countries are clear. An&#xD;
      expansion of the &quot;safe delivery&quot; concept to include supplementation of the infant and mother&#xD;
      with vitamin A would enhance nutrition and safe motherhood program impact in an extremely&#xD;
      cost-efficient fashion. As practices in India move increasingly in the direction of attended&#xD;
      childbirth, the opportunity to intervene becomes easier with significant potential for having&#xD;
      a dramatic impact on infant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to improve the health and survival of young children in&#xD;
      India through improvement in vitamin A status. More specifically this project will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation of newborn infants (50,000 IU) on&#xD;
           mortality within the first 6 months of life using a community-based distribution and&#xD;
           outcome assessment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation of newborn infants (50,000) on the&#xD;
           incidence and severity of morbidity within the first 6 months of life. Specific&#xD;
           morbidities of interest include diarrhea and acute respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the efficacy of vitamin A supplementation of newborn infants (50,000 IU) on&#xD;
           growth of infants over the first 6 months of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These specific aims will be accomplished by conducting a community-based, randomized trial of&#xD;
      vitamin A supplementation to newborn infants within 48 hours of birth in underprivileged&#xD;
      rural communities of Tamil Nadu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview: The overall design of this study will be that of a randomized, community-based&#xD;
      clinical trial. The intervention to be tested for impact on infant mortality, morbidity and&#xD;
      growth is supplementation of 50,000 IU of vitamin A to the newborn within 48 hours after&#xD;
      delivery. Outcomes of interest are mortality within the first 6 months of life, the incidence&#xD;
      and severity of diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be population-based such that all live births within a defined population&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Women residing in study villages will be identified by village-based field&#xD;
      staff when they become pregnant. Informed consent will be obtained at that time as well as&#xD;
      baseline data regarding family and household characteristics. In addition, field workers for&#xD;
      the study will ask the woman where she plans to deliver the child, at home, in a maternity&#xD;
      home, or in the hospital. The woman will be assigned a study number and randomized at the&#xD;
      time of enrollment to either the vitamin A or placebo groups. Actual supplementation will&#xD;
      occur at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will attend all deliveries within 24 hours of the birth. At that time, the child&#xD;
      will be dosed with either vitamin A or placebo according to their treatment assignment. Birth&#xD;
      weight will be measured, and details of the delivery will be collected. Following delivery, a&#xD;
      short vital status and morbidity assessment will be conducted every two weeks for the first 6&#xD;
      months of life. If a child death is reported, supervisors will be dispatched to the household&#xD;
      to verify the death and to conduct a verbal autopsy. All children will receive 200,000 IU&#xD;
      oral vitamin A at the time of the 6 month visit and discharged from the study (200,000 IU is&#xD;
      the dose currently provided by the government of Tamil Nadu to children 6 months of age and&#xD;
      older).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will focus on estimation of mortality rates for the vitamin A and placebo&#xD;
      groups. These will be compared using a person-time approach as well as survival analysis&#xD;
      techniques. The two groups will be compared on baseline characteristics and any imbalance&#xD;
      will be controlled using standard adjustment techniques including logistic regression and&#xD;
      proportional hazards models. Results will be reported in the scientific literature, at&#xD;
      national and international meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population chosen for this project will include all villages in two rural blocks in&#xD;
      Tamil Nadu. The two blocks chosen for inclusion in the study are Kariaypatti and Natham.&#xD;
      ASSEFA (Association for Sarva Seva Farm) is a non-governmental organisation involved in&#xD;
      community development, education, and health programs for underprivileged rural communities.&#xD;
      Within the ASSEFA area of a block, the health activities consist of a maternal and child&#xD;
      health program, which runs antenatal clinics and produces and delivers weaning foods to young&#xD;
      children and pregnant women. The engine for this program is the Health Committee in each&#xD;
      village. In most ASSEFA program areas, registration of pregnant women by ASSEFA staff or&#xD;
      volunteers is virtually complete. Non-ASSEFA villages are slightly better off and served&#xD;
      primarily through a variety of government programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: In order to maximise the generalisability of the results of this study, the&#xD;
      criteria for eligibility will be broad and inclusive. All pregnancies that occur within the&#xD;
      geographic boundaries of the participating villages, which result in a live born infant(s),&#xD;
      will be eligible for recruitment. This will include multiple births, those with congenital&#xD;
      anomalies, and those born early or with low birth weight. Provision of informed consent will&#xD;
      be the only eligibility criterion in addition to geographic eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and enrollment: Pregnant women will be identified from a variety of sources, the&#xD;
      ASSEFA Health Committee Members, the antenatal care clinics run on a monthly basis by ASSEFA&#xD;
      or the government in the study areas, and other women's development workers in the area. Once&#xD;
      a pregnant woman is identified, the cluster worker will explain the study and attempt to&#xD;
      enroll the subject. If she agrees, then the cluster worker will proceed with the assignment&#xD;
      of a study ID number and completion of baseline data collection form, including a&#xD;
      determination of where the women plans to deliver her child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those women who are registered, but plan to deliver outside the village, special actions&#xD;
      will be taken. There are three types of these women:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Those who go outside the village to deliver their child and are not reachable by our study&#xD;
      teams (more than 20 kms away from the village). These women will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation in the trial, but these babies will be followed after they return to the&#xD;
      village, only for 6-month mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Those who go outside the village to deliver in another study village. These women will be&#xD;
      transferred to the appropriate Cluster Worker so the treatment doses can be given as per&#xD;
      protocol and the infants will be following in this location until they return to their home&#xD;
      village. At this time, the file will be transferred back to the appropriate Cluster Worker in&#xD;
      the home village.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Those who go outside the village, not to study villages, but who are reachable by&#xD;
      special efforts of our study supervisory staff. Reachable will be defined as being within 20&#xD;
      km of the Block Office. These women will be treated and infants dosed by the supervisor of&#xD;
      the cluster worker. They will not be followed for morbidity, but will be followed for&#xD;
      mortality based on home village family reports until they return to the village. After&#xD;
      returning to the home village, they will continue to be followed for mortality and growth&#xD;
      only (not morbidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fourth special situation are those women who move into one of our study villages&#xD;
      temporarily to deliver from outside the study area. These women will be included and enrolled&#xD;
      as soon as they arrive in our study villages and they will be followed for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality after birth until they return home. After they leave the village, mortality only&#xD;
      will be followed by reports from the family in the study village.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: Randomisation will be conducted at the individual level, stratified by&#xD;
      geographic area and randomized in blocks of size four to insure equal numbers of babies in&#xD;
      each treatment group. Each pregnant woman will be assigned a unique study number at the time&#xD;
      of enrollment. Each set of capsules (two 25,000 IU capsules for the newborn) will be packaged&#xD;
      separately and labelled with the woman's name, address, and ID number to avoid mix-ups at the&#xD;
      time of delivery. Treatment assignment codes will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in a&#xD;
      sealed envelope at a location separate from the study headquarters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition and Measurement of Outcomes: There are one primary and two secondary outcomes that&#xD;
      will be evaluated in this study. The primary outcome is vital status within the first 6&#xD;
      months of life. Deaths will be ascertained during the vital status and morbidity assessments&#xD;
      conducted every two weeks during a home visit. Any child found to have died within the&#xD;
      preceding two weeks will initiate the process of death verification and cause of death&#xD;
      determination. Cause of death determination will identify both immediate and underlying&#xD;
      causes by two independent reviews of the verbal autopsy information by paediatricians. If&#xD;
      there is disagreement regarding the cause of death, a third paediatrician will review the&#xD;
      data and conduct a consensus meeting to arrive at an agreed upon cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include the incidence and severity of diarrhea and acute respiratory&#xD;
      infections over the first six months of life, clinic utilisation for illnesses during the&#xD;
      first six months, and growth over the first six months. Episodes of diarrhea, dysentery,&#xD;
      acute respiratory illness (ARI), and clinic utilisation will be based on a maternal interview&#xD;
      conducted every two weeks. Diarrhea will be defined as 6 or more loose, watery stools in a 24&#xD;
      hour period. Dysentery will be defined as diarrhea with the additional history of blood or&#xD;
      mucus in the stool. The incidence of episodes as well as their duration will be assessed&#xD;
      during the data collection process. Growth will be assessed only at the six-month visit where&#xD;
      weight, length, and mid-upper arm circumference will be assessed using standard protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Requirements: Previous research on the impact of vitamin A supplementation among&#xD;
      young infants in Tamil Nadu and Indonesia suggests that we may expect a mortality reduction&#xD;
      of between 30% and 50%. Because even the lower end of this range of impact would be of&#xD;
      significant importance, sample size calculations have been done using a minimal detectable&#xD;
      reduction of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infant mortality rate (IMR) in Tamil Nadu as a whole is approximately 60/1000 live&#xD;
      births. The population selected for inclusion in this study is poorer economically and has&#xD;
      worse health status than the average for Tamil Nadu. It is likely, therefore, that the infant&#xD;
      mortality rate in this area is higher than the state as a whole. We have estimated it at&#xD;
      70/1000 live births. The study design for this project calls for vital status assessment to&#xD;
      conclude at 6 months of age. Therefore the expected mortality rate in the first six months&#xD;
      will be lower than the total IMR. Mortality rates decline dramatically with age, even in the&#xD;
      first year of life. Reasonable estimates are that 75% of total infant mortality occurs in the&#xD;
      first six months of life. Applying this figure to the estimated IMR of 70/1000 live births&#xD;
      gives a 6-month infant mortality rate (IMR-6) of 52.5/1000 live births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a type I error of 5% (2-sided), 80% power, an IMR-6 of 52.5/1000 in the placebo&#xD;
      group, and a minimum detectable reduction of 30% in the vitamin A group, the sample size&#xD;
      required in each group is approximately 2700 live births. If we assume a 10% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up this brings the number required in each group to approximately 3000, or a total of&#xD;
      6000 live births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crude birth rate in Tamil Nadu is approximately 20/1000 population. In order to enroll&#xD;
      6000 live births in one year, we must ascertain all births in a total population of&#xD;
      approximately 300,000 or a population of 150,000 over a two-year enrollment period. We have&#xD;
      chosen to enroll deliveries for a period of 24 months.&#xD;
