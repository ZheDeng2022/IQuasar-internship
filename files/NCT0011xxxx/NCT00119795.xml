      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults make up the fastest growing segment of our population. It is estimated that by&#xD;
      the year 2030, elderly people will make up 22% of the United States population. A large&#xD;
      portion of older adults suffers from one or more chronic conditions that could be improved by&#xD;
      regular physical activity. Therefore, research in this age group is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cooperative Lifestyle Intervention Program (CLIP) will test the effects of a physical&#xD;
      activity intervention and a weight loss intervention on mobility disability of overweight or&#xD;
      obese men and women who have evidence of cardiovascular disease or the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      The public health relevance of the trial lies in the fact that the interventions will be&#xD;
      delivered in conjunction with four Cooperative Extension Centers in counties surrounding&#xD;
      Winston-Salem, North Carolina. CLIP will be designed as a three arm, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial. The three 18-month treatments will include: (1) a basic health education-based control&#xD;
      condition, (2) a group treatment program for physical activity, and (3) a lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention designed to reduce sedentary behavior and promote weight loss. The primary aim&#xD;
      will be to compare the effects of the three treatment arms on the change in performance on a&#xD;
      400-meter walk test over the course of 18 months. Secondary aims will include changes in&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, adiposity, cardiovascular fitness, physical activity, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. Analyses will also be conducted to determine whether changes&#xD;
      in the primary outcome are mediated by changes in constructs from social cognitive theory.&#xD;
