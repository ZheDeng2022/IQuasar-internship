    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to understand the mechanisms of how antigen presentation affects the&#xD;
      developing immune system and subsequently affects susceptibility to, or protects against,&#xD;
      asthma development. This randomized controlled study will test the effectiveness of daily&#xD;
      supplementation of Lactobacillus GG for the first 6 months of life on the early immunological&#xD;
      development of asthma.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During infancy, environmental factors may affect immune system development and lead to the&#xD;
      development of asthma. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that the absence of endotoxin exposure&#xD;
      leads to an unfavorable Th1/Th2 balance. Thus, a controlled antigen exposure during infancy&#xD;
      may establish a Th1/Th2 balance that blocks the onset of asthma or slows the progression of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacillus is a bacterium commonly found in many foods (e.g., yogurt) in the typical&#xD;
      childhood diet. It is also used as a probiotic supplement to prevent the development of&#xD;
      diarrhea. Due to its safety and availability, Lactobacillus is an ideal bacterium to use as&#xD;
      an antigen exposure to test the hygiene hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the hygiene hypothesis, observational studies suggest that early&#xD;
      Lactobacillus exposure leads to decreased risk of developing atopic dermatitis, which has&#xD;
      been associated with asthma in later years. The investigators are aware of no study that has&#xD;
      examined the effect of Lactobacillus on the development of early markers of asthma in&#xD;
      children at risk for developing the disease. They hypothesize that Lactobacillus can be used&#xD;
      as an antigen exposure to establish a Th1/Th2 balance that blocks the development of early&#xD;
      markers of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hygiene hypothesis suggests that the absence of endotoxin exposure leads to an&#xD;
      unfavorable Th1/Th2 balance. A controlled antigen exposure during infancy may help establish&#xD;
      a Th1/ Th2 balance that blocks the onset or progression of asthma. Lactobacillus is a&#xD;
      bacterium found in many foods in the typical pediatric diet, and is used as a supplement to&#xD;
      prevent diarrhea. Due to the safety, feasibility, and early promising results in preventing&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis, Lactobacillus is an ideal bacterium to use as an exposure to test the&#xD;
      hygiene hypothesis. The investigators hypothesize that such an exposure may block or delay&#xD;
      development of early markers of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a randomized placebo-controlled trial design to measure the effect of a&#xD;
      6-month daily exposure of Lactobacillus, as an infant supplement, on immune system and asthma&#xD;
      development during the first 3 years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will measure the effect of the antigen exposure on the presence and time to&#xD;
      presentation of: (1) early clinical markers for asthma development (frequent wheezing,&#xD;
      wheezing without colds, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis); (2) early immunologic markers for&#xD;
      asthma development (eosinophilia, immunoglobulin E); and (3) development of a T-helper&#xD;
      phenotype (Th-1 vs Th-2). Investigators will characterize the Th phenotype by measuring the&#xD;
      whole blood lymphocyte response to stimulants, focusing on Th1 (IFN-gamma, interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-12) and Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-13), as well as real-time reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with PCR amplification (TaqMan) to quantify RNA&#xD;
      transcripts. Clinical and immunologic markers will be measured up to 3 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence will be assessed using diaries, pill count, and Lactobacillus stool cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use intention-to-treat analysis and will control for the impact of family,&#xD;
      environmental, diet, and demographic factors on outcomes using multivariate regression and&#xD;
      survival analysis techniques. Investigators expect that when compared to controls, subjects&#xD;
      receiving Lactobacillus will have decreased and delayed development of markers for asthma,&#xD;
      and a greater likelihood of developing a Th1 phenotype.&#xD;
