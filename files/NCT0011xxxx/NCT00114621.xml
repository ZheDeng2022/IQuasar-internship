      This study will examine the recombinant, that is, produced by genetic engineering, protective&#xD;
      antigen (rPA) that brings about antibodies to neutralize the anthrax toxin and that could&#xD;
      therefore be predicted to offer protection against anthrax. Today, anthrax is rarely&#xD;
      encountered in the United States, since the introduction of vaccines for cattle in the 1930s.&#xD;
      A human vaccine was licensed in 1970. Vaccination against anthrax has been confined to people&#xD;
      at risk, such as wool sorters and some veterinarians. However, the rising prospects of B.&#xD;
      anthracis being used as a weapon have led to routine administration of the anthrax vaccine to&#xD;
      members of the armed forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults who are in good health may be eligible for this study. The involvement of 300 adults&#xD;
      is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a general physical exam and test for vital signs. There will also be&#xD;
      collection of blood for chemistry and hematology; urinalysis; tests for HIV, hepatitis B and&#xD;
      C, and liver function; and a pregnancy test, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a random basis, patients will receive one of the rPA formulations. Two doses of rPA will&#xD;
      be evaluated, 10 microgram ((Micro)g) and 20 (Micro)g. This evaluation aims to establish the&#xD;
      safety and most desirable level of dosage. Patients will receive one injection of the&#xD;
      vaccine, administered in the left shoulder or left thigh. About 30 minutes later, their&#xD;
      temperature will be taken, and the injection site will be inspected. Rare but severe&#xD;
      reactions could occur if there is extreme sensitivity to a vaccine. However, such an&#xD;
      occurrence is extremely rare following a vaccine, and if there are any dangerous symptoms,&#xD;
      they can be effectively treated by medications available to patients while they are at the&#xD;
      clinic. If there are no significant abnormal results, patients may return home. About 6 hours&#xD;
      later and daily for 7 days, they will take their temperature and examine the injection site.&#xD;
      The vaccine may cause temporary discomfort at the site of injection, and participants may&#xD;
      experience a mild fever for 1 or 2 days after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive diary cards, a digital thermometer, and instructions on taking their&#xD;
      temperature and measuring redness and swelling at the injection site, as well as for&#xD;
      recording aches, muscle pain, or sensitivity to light for 7 days. They will be examined at&#xD;
      the clinic at 72 hours following vaccination and also on the 7th day if they have a fever at&#xD;
      or above 100.4 , if swelling is at or more than 2 inches, or if they request an exam.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, a clinic staff member will call patients and discuss the findings. Then patients&#xD;
      will receive a second and third injection of the same vaccine at 2-month intervals. There&#xD;
      will also be interviews about patients' health at each visit to the clinic, plus monitoring&#xD;
      of the vaccination after 6 hours and for 7 days. One year later, patients will receive a&#xD;
      fourth injection of the same vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct benefit to participants in this study is not guaranteed, although an antibody response&#xD;
      is predicted. The results in this study will help in the development of improved vaccines for&#xD;
      anthrax.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anthrax is rarely encountered in the U.S. since the introduction of attenuated vaccines for&#xD;
      cattle in the 1930's. A vaccine for humans, composed of a cell-free preparation absorbed onto&#xD;
      alum, was licensed in 1970 after successful clinical trials. Vaccination against anthrax in&#xD;
      the U.S. was confined to individuals at risk such as wool sorters and some veterinarians&#xD;
      until the prospects were raised of B. anthracis being used as a weapon after the Iraq war.&#xD;
      Now anthrax vaccine is administered routinely to the armed forces. Interest in improving this&#xD;
      vaccine was stimulated by the use of B. anthracis spores for bioterrorism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active component of the investigational vaccine is called the protective antigen. When B.&#xD;
      anthracis invades the host tissues, the protective antigen activates two other proteins to&#xD;
      form anthrax toxin. The symptoms of anthrax are caused by this toxin. Alone, the protective&#xD;
      antigen has no known toxicity. The gene for this protein has been isolated and changed&#xD;
      specifically to improve its properties as a vaccine-this recombinant protective antigen (rPA)&#xD;
      elicits antibodies that neutralize the anthrax toxin and, thereby, can be predicted to confer&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study of our investigational rPA vaccine in humans. The broad objectives&#xD;
      are to characterize the safety and serum antibody levels of different doses and formulations&#xD;
      of rPA in comparison to the licensed anthrax vaccine, AVA.&#xD;
