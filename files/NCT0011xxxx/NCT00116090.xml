      This study will evaluate whether therapy that suppresses the immune system given to treat&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases of the eye is associated with a greater risk of death and of cancer.&#xD;
      Inflammatory diseases of the eye, including uveitis, scleritis, and mucous membrane&#xD;
      pemphigoid, are major blinding diseases. For some patients, treatment with corticosteroids is&#xD;
      not enough to control the diseases. Researchers expect to gain information about whether&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy is suitable for patients and which substances should be avoided.&#xD;
      Also, the study will evaluate the frequency of short-term complications with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy as well as benefits that the therapy can bring to treatment of eye&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical charts of patients up to age 65 (median age range of 21 to 65) who have had an&#xD;
      inflammatory, noninfectious eye disease may be examined for this study. A database will be&#xD;
      constructed through a chart review of patients seen in the uveitis clinic of the National Eye&#xD;
      Institute since 1977 and three other sites. Patients who are considered exposed to&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies will be compared with two groups: the general U.S. population and&#xD;
      an internal group of patients with the same inflammatory eye diseases who did not receive&#xD;
      immunosuppression. Data regarding about 10,000 to 15,000 patients will be collected. Patients&#xD;
      will not be identified by the chart reviews. The incidence of cancer will be examined as well&#xD;
      as the outcomes of immosuppressive therapy as measured by control of the eye disease, visual&#xD;
      sharpness, changes in the use of corticosteroids, and rates of remission-when disease&#xD;
      symptoms are lessened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also examined will be medical charts of a control group of patients who did not receive&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy for their uveitis. Data on cancer incidence would be more difficult&#xD;
      to obtain, requiring personal contact with patients. In such situations, patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone or mail, and those providing informed consent will be asked about their&#xD;
      medical history, including previous occurrence of cancer and other conditions. For patients&#xD;
      who have died, the researchers will attempt to communicate with the next of kin regarding&#xD;
      this medical information.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocular inflammatory diseases, including uveitis, scleritis, and mucous membrane pemphigoid,&#xD;
      are major blinding eye diseases. For some patients, corticosteroid therapy is insufficient to&#xD;
      control ocular inflammatory disease, such that immunosuppressive therapy is required.&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases has most commonly employed antimetabolite, T-cell&#xD;
      inhibitor, and/or alkylating agent therapies. It has been suggested, based on studies of&#xD;
      patients with severe systemic immunologic or other systemic diseases, that such treatments&#xD;
      may result in an increased risk of cancer and other long-term morbidities. In these studies,&#xD;
      it has been difficult to determine whether the excess risk arose from the underlying systemic&#xD;
      diseases or the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases (SITE) Cohort Study will evaluate&#xD;
      directly whether immunosuppressive therapy for ocular inflammatory diseases is associated&#xD;
      with an excess risk of mortality and of cancer. The study is expected to generate critical&#xD;
      information in deciding whether immunosuppressive therapy is warranted for such patients, and&#xD;
      whether certain immunosuppressive agents should be avoided. In addition, the study will&#xD;
      evaluate the frequency of short-term complications with such therapy, and the ocular benefits&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SITE Study will have a classic retrospective cohort design. A database will be&#xD;
      constructed through a chart review of patients seen here in the Uveitis clinic of the NEI&#xD;
      since 1977 and 3 other sites. Patients exposed to immunosuppressive therapies will be&#xD;
      compared to two groups: 1) an external standard, the general United States population; and 2)&#xD;
      an internal comparison group, patients with the same ocular inflammatory diseases who did not&#xD;
      receive immunosuppression. Approximately 10000-15000 patients will be accrued from four&#xD;
      centers which pioneered the use of immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases, beginning&#xD;
      19-29 years ago. Patients who received immunosuppressive therapy for eye diseases, and&#xD;
      patients with the same ocular inflammatory diagnoses who did not, will be identified by the&#xD;
      chart reviews. Those who subsequently have died will be identified through a search of the&#xD;
      National Death Index and/or the Social Security Death Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to overall mortality, cause-specific mortality will be evaluated, as obtained&#xD;
      from death certificate coding. The data collected here at the NIH will be compared to the&#xD;
      National Death Index separately from the data from the other centers, via a direct query from&#xD;
      our center. Abstracted data without identifiers other than study number and letter codes that&#xD;
      could not be used to identify subjects by anyone outside the LI will be sent to the central&#xD;
      database. The outcomes of mortality, cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence will be&#xD;
      analyzed using a relative incidence approach. Description of the short-term complications of&#xD;
      immunosuppression and of the beneficial effects of immunosuppression on eye diseases also&#xD;
      will be evaluated. This study's chair is John Kempen at the Wilmer Eye Institute of the Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins School of Medicine. We will be a participating center.&#xD;
