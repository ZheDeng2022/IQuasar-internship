      This pilot study will determine the feasibility of enrolling participants from different&#xD;
      populations for a larger study of low back pain (LBP) treatment. In addition, this study will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of data collection instruments and procedures as well as utilize&#xD;
      feedback from participants to refine a future study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Back pain is one of the most common health problems in the United States, afflicting up to&#xD;
      50% of adults each year. Back pain is the leading cause of visits to orthopedic surgeons and&#xD;
      the second leading cause of visits to general practitioners. In the United States, the&#xD;
      estimated annual cost of back pain, including medical costs and lost productivity, is between&#xD;
      $50 and $100 billion. Unfortunately, conventional medical care has been largely ineffective&#xD;
      in treating back pain of most people. An increasing number of people with back pain,&#xD;
      particularly with LBP, are seeking relief from unconventional sources such as chiropractors&#xD;
      and massage therapies. Although complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are&#xD;
      being used to treat LBP, their effectiveness has not been thoroughly examined. Even less is&#xD;
      known about the effectiveness of combining conventional medical care with CAM therapies to&#xD;
      provide &quot;integrative care.&quot; This pilot study will recruit participants from three different&#xD;
      patient populations to determine the effectiveness of integrative care in treating LBP&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 26 weeks and will comprise three participant populations: patients at an&#xD;
      occupational health clinic, primary care patients at a medical clinic, and workers'&#xD;
      compensation patients at the same medical clinic. At study start, participants will be&#xD;
      interviewed about the care they have already received for LBP, any activities limited by&#xD;
      their LBP, their attitudes toward CAM back pain treatments, job satisfaction, social support&#xD;
      in the workplace, and medical history. Participants will also complete a self-report pain&#xD;
      scale and a disability questionnaire. Participants will then be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      receive treatment for their LBP at an Integrative Care Center or continue to receive usual&#xD;
      care provided by their medical or occupational health clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to receive integrative care will be evaluated by both a medical doctor&#xD;
      and a CAM clinician immediately after being interviewed. Following the evaluation, the two&#xD;
      clinicians will meet and develop a treatment plan, which will include conventional medical&#xD;
      care and some form of CAM such as acupuncture, chiropractic, exercise, massage, mind-body&#xD;
      therapy, or nutritional counseling. Treatments will occur either once or twice weekly for the&#xD;
      12-week duration of treatment; clinicians may revise treatment plans during the study. LBP&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed through phone interviews at Weeks 2, 5, 12, and 26.&#xD;
