      To study cardiac and vascular structure and function in a population of adolescents with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to a similar group with obesity alone and a similar&#xD;
      non-obese group.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased dramatically in adolescents. This&#xD;
      appears to be a direct result of the increase in prevalence and severity of obesity in the&#xD;
      pediatric population. In adults with type 2 diabetes, it is well known that the risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) is quite high. This has led to current clinical recommendation&#xD;
      that adults with diabetes be considered equivalent in risk to those adults who already have&#xD;
      existing coronary artery disease. It is not known if adolescents with type 2 diabetes have an&#xD;
      equivalent high level of risk of CVD as the adult population. If they do then it would be&#xD;
      expected that they would develop clinical CVD in their late 20's or 30's. This would have&#xD;
      important clinical implications and would suggest the need for very aggressive management of&#xD;
      CVD risk factors and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cross-sectional evaluation of cardiac and vascular structure and function in a&#xD;
      population of adolescents with type 2 diabetes compared to a group with similar age, sex,&#xD;
      race and BMI with obesity alone and a non obese group with similar age, sex and race. 300&#xD;
      subjects with type 2 diabetes, 300 subjects with obesity and 300 non obese subjects will be&#xD;
      studied. Assessment of CVD development will be accomplished using novel non invasive imaging&#xD;
      methods for subclinical atherosclerosis including echocardiographic measurement of cardiac&#xD;
      structure and function, ultrasound evaluation of carotid intimal medial thickness, and&#xD;
      evaluation of endothelial function by brachial artery reactivity. The primary hypothesis is&#xD;
      that adolescents with type 2 diabetes will have greater abnormality in cardiac and vascular&#xD;
      structure and function compared to controls with obesity. Subjects with obesity alone will&#xD;
      have greater abnormality in cardiac and vascular structure and function compared to controls&#xD;
      who are not obese. Correlates of cardiac and vascular abnormalities including markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, adiponectin, diet and physical activity will also be evaluated.&#xD;
