  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp hair follicles, which occurs primarily&#xD;
      in children. Hair loss, hair breakage, scaling, plus various degrees of erythema, pustules&#xD;
      and pruritus are the primary clinical signs which can be associated with tinea capitis. The&#xD;
      infection is caused by a relatively small group of dermatophytes in the genera Trichophyton&#xD;
      and Microsporum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terbinafine hydrochloride is a synthetic allylamine derivative antifungal agent. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy and safety of terbinafine in children with tinea capitis.&#xD;
