      This study tests to see if TU 025 Keishi Bukuryo Gan reduces the frequency and severity of&#xD;
      hot flashes in post-menopausal American women. This study will also estimate the best dose&#xD;
      amount and determine the common short-term side effects and risks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Menopause is a natural transition in a woman's hormonal state associated with the cessation&#xD;
      of ovulation and menstruation. For approximately 80% of peri-menopausal women, menopause may&#xD;
      be defined by the experience of uncomfortable symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, urinary frequency, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hot flashes are the most common complaint of perimenopausal and postmenopausal Western women.&#xD;
      Approximately 10-20% of postmenopausal women find such symptoms nearly intolerable. Nearly&#xD;
      one-third of postmenopausal women experience disruptive hot flashes for 5 years after natural&#xD;
      menopause and approximately 20% experience hot flashes for 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopause has been understood as an estrogen deficiency state from which women are placed at&#xD;
      great risk for osteoporosis, colon cancer and heart disease. For symptom management, as well&#xD;
      as for disease prevention, the medical response for 20 years has been hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy (HRT). In recent years, as many as 38% of US women between ages 50 and 74 years were&#xD;
      using HRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For menopause hormone therapy, in 2005, counseling patients from an evidence-based&#xD;
      perspective means informing patients of the significantly increased risk of dementia, breast&#xD;
      cancer,endometrial cancer,venous thromboembolism and gallbladder disease. Additionally,&#xD;
      physicians must also state that hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (heart attack or strokes) in women with or without pre-existing heart disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      well-done studies demonstrate that hormone therapy does not enhance health-related quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, there is great interest in non-hormonal alternatives for menopausal hot&#xD;
      flash management. The current standard of care, based on controlled clinical trials in women&#xD;
      with breast cancer, is the use of SSRI anti-depressants such as venlafaxine. However, many&#xD;
      women seek other options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Japan, TJ25 Keishi Bukuryo Gan is a leading non-hormonal prescription agent for management&#xD;
      of menopausal hot flashes. However, no clinical data exists on its effectiveness in American&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot phase II clinical study to estimate the effectiveness of TU-25 Keishi Bukuryo&#xD;
      Gan for reduction of both the severity and the frequency of hot flashes in healthy&#xD;
      postmenopausal American women. This study will also estimate the best dose and determine the&#xD;
      common short-term side effects and risks.&#xD;
