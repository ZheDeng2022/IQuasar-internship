      We aim to compare pain management among three groups of ethnic disparity (ED) patients,&#xD;
      Hispanics, non-Hispanic Blacks, non-Hispanic Whites, and assess whether the observed&#xD;
      association between pain management and race/ethnicity is independent of potentially&#xD;
      important confounding variables (e.g., age, sex, insurance status, education). We also aim to&#xD;
      assess whether the effect of race/ethnicity on adequacy of pain management is explained by&#xD;
      patients' initial pain intensity or by discordance between patient and physician's: a)&#xD;
      race/ethnicity; b) perception of patient's pain. To do this 285 patients with long-bone&#xD;
      fractures will be recruited in the EDs of one municipal and one voluntary hospital serving an&#xD;
      inner-city, disadvantaged population in the Bronx. Data will be collected on pain using&#xD;
      self-reported pain and non-verbal pain expressions at baseline, one hour post-baseline, and&#xD;
      discharge. Data on analgesics administered, patient and physician characteristics will also&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to conduct a chart review of long bone fractures in 2000 and 2001 so that we can&#xD;
      analyze the association between race/ethnicity and pain management using the same design as&#xD;
      published studies. Comparison of the retrospective and prospective studies will strengthen&#xD;
      inferences that can be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Black and Hispanic patients will be less likely to receive opioid&#xD;
      analgesics than white patients.&#xD;

      The study was conducted at two urban academic Emergency Departments associated with&#xD;
      Montefiore Medical Center. Emergency Medicine residents and full-time Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      faculty are present at both sites. One of the sites is a municipal hospital Level 1 Trauma&#xD;
      Center managing approximately 50,000 adult patients per year. The other site is the primary&#xD;
      academic medical center, managing approximately 80,000 adult patients per year, many of them&#xD;
      requiring tertiary care. Both departments serve an urban population that is predominantly&#xD;
      African-American and Hispanic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol Data were obtained from a convenience sample of patients from September, 2003&#xD;
      through November, 2006. Patients were eligible if the provider suspected an isolated&#xD;
      long-bone fracture and long-bone films were obtained. Because it was not possible to&#xD;
      determine which patients would have positive films in advance, all patients with suspected&#xD;
      fractures who met other inclusion criteria were initially considered eligible and enrolled.&#xD;
      Only those with confirmed fractures were included in the final study sample. Patients were&#xD;
      considered to have fractures if the radiology report by an attending radiologist specified an&#xD;
      isolated long-bone fracture defined as a fracture of the humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia,&#xD;
      or fibula (ICD-9 codes: 812, 813, 821, 823, and 824).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection took place from 8:00 am to midnight seven days a week at one institution and&#xD;
      24 hours a day, seven days a week at the other. Data were collected on a standardized data&#xD;
      collection instrument by trained fluently bilingual (Spanish and English) Research&#xD;
      Associates. The Research Associates attended a three-day course in research ethics, and&#xD;
      specific data collection procedures of the study. This was followed by a two-week internship&#xD;
      during which new Research Associates were paired with more experienced Research Associates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Associates approached patients whose triage note indicated an extremity injury,&#xD;
      extremity pain, if the Research Associate observed a physical indication of extremity injury,&#xD;
      or if a provider identified a patient who was potentially eligible for the study. Eligible&#xD;
      patients were asked to sign informed consent. Data were collected from patients at the time&#xD;
      of the physician's examination of the patient (baseline) and at discharge. At discharge the&#xD;
      treating physician was asked to rate the patient's pain when he/she first examined the&#xD;
      patient. If the physician's shift ended before the patient was discharged he/she was asked to&#xD;
      rate the patient's initial pain before leaving the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The names of all medications, dose, route, and time administered were obtained&#xD;
      in real time from the chart and ED staff. Patients were categorized as receiving: 1) no&#xD;
      analgesics; 2) NSAIDS or acetaminophen; or 3) opioids. If both NSAIDS or acetaminophen and&#xD;
      opioids were administered, patients were categorized as having received opioids. Analgesics&#xD;
      given solely for fracture reduction were not used to categorize patients. Opioid analgesics&#xD;
      were transformed into morphine equivalents as follows: 1 mg morphine = 3 mg of oxycodone;&#xD;
      0.15 mg of hydromorphone, and 13 mg of codeine. No other opioid analgesics were used with the&#xD;
      exception of fentanyl, which was only used for fracture reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary predictor variable was self-reported race/ethnicity of the patient. This was&#xD;
      measured by the response to the question: &quot;Do you consider yourself to be: Hispanic/Latino,&#xD;
      White/Caucasian, Black/African-American, multi-racial, or other?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates: Patients' pain and provider assessment of patients' pain are determinants of&#xD;
      treatment and thus have the potential of confounding the relationship between race/ethnicity&#xD;
      and treatment if they vary systematically by race/ethnicity.10 Pain was measured in several&#xD;
      ways: Patients were asked to rate their pain intensity on a validated and reproducible&#xD;
      11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 &quot;no pain&quot;, to 10 &quot;worst imaginable&#xD;
      pain&quot;.18 They were also asked to describe pain categorically as: &quot;no pain&quot;, &quot;mild pain&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;moderate pain&quot;, or &quot;severe pain&quot;. Change in pain was measured by response to the question:&#xD;
      &quot;How does your pain feel now compared to when you entered the Emergency Room?&quot; It was also&#xD;
      measured by the difference between the patient's rating of pain at entry and pain at&#xD;
      discharge. At time of discharge the treating physicians were asked to recall and rate the&#xD;
      patient's initial pain using the same verbal descriptors used by the patients We reasoned&#xD;
      that asking doctors to rate patients' pain before they made treatment decisions might bias&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other clinically plausible confounders of the relationship between pain management and&#xD;
      race/ethnicity include: sex, age, educational level (some high school, high school or General&#xD;
      Equivalency Diploma (GED), some college, Bachelor's degree or higher), insurance status&#xD;
      (self-pay, health maintenance organization (HMO) or private insurance, Medicaid, other&#xD;
      insurance), accompanied to the ED by someone who might act as a patient advocate, mechanism&#xD;
      of injury (fall, sports, motor vehicle, other), fracture reduction in ED, and arrival by&#xD;
      ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics are reported as means with standard deviations, medians with&#xD;
      interquartile ranges (IQR) and percentages. We used chi-square tests to compare discrete&#xD;
      patient characteristic by race/ethnicity. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare&#xD;
      continuous characteristics and the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare medians of non-normally&#xD;
      distributed variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic models were used to test for the presence of an independent (adjusted) association&#xD;
      between race/ethnicity and the treatment of pain. We used forced entry into the model of&#xD;
      initial patient rating of pain intensity, provider rating of patient's pain at baseline,&#xD;
      hospital, sex, age, education, insurance status, whether accompanied to the ED, mechanism of&#xD;
      injury, fracture reduction in ED, and arrival by ambulance. Hosmer Lemeshow's test was used&#xD;
      to assess model fit. We used Zhang and Kai's method for estimating relative risks from the&#xD;
      odds ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: There is no consensus about what constitutes a clinically&#xD;
      significant difference in treatment between racial and ethnic groups. In the absence of such&#xD;
      a consensus we based our estimates of effect size on previous findings.11, 12 We used&#xD;
      estimates of 75%, 50% and 60% respectively for proportion of whites, African-American, and&#xD;
      Hispanics treated with any analgesic, a two-tailed significance level of 0.05, and a power of&#xD;
      80% to calculate a sample size of at least 70 patients with long-bone fractures in each of&#xD;
      the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two individuals independently entered data into the Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS) Data Entry(Chicago, IL). Transcription errors were reconciled by referral to&#xD;
      the original hardcopy of the data collection instrument. We used NQuery 6.0 ( Saugus, MA) for&#xD;
      the sample size calculation, and SPSS version 15.0 (Chicago, IL).&#xD;
