  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving the emergency department and outpatient clinics of the David Grant&#xD;
      United States Air Force (USAF) Medical Center, a tertiary care facility. Patients 18 years of&#xD;
      age or older with acute respiratory symptoms and positive or equivocal chest radiographs from&#xD;
      October 1, 2004 through May 31, 2005 will be included as positive cases. Controls will be&#xD;
      randomly selected from a review of negative chest radiograph reports with a clinical history&#xD;
      of an acute respiratory illness over the same time period. Once patients are appropriately&#xD;
      identified as control or cases, outpatient charts will be reviewed to gather data on six&#xD;
      clinical indicators. Sensitivities and specificities will be calculated for each clinical&#xD;
      indicator, to determine which patients require chest radiographs in the setting of suspected&#xD;
      community acquired pneumonia (CAP)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective study designed to evaluate the efficacy of six clinical indicators&#xD;
      to predict the presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include a convenience sample of David Grant Air Force Medical&#xD;
      Center patients that meet study criteria. Adult patients (18 years of age or older) with&#xD;
      acute respiratory symptoms and positive chest radiographs from October 2004 through April&#xD;
      2005 will be enrolled as positive cases. There will be an equal number of controls with acute&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms but negative radiographs. Controls will be matched by age and date of&#xD;
      radiograph. Patients/Cases with suspected hospital-acquired (positive radiographs within 10&#xD;
      days of hospital discharge) or aspiration pneumonia will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six clinical indicators were selected based on the cumulative results of seminal studies that&#xD;
      included: cough, sputum production, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and findings&#xD;
      on physical examination. Abnormal vital signs were defined as temperature of 100.5 degrees&#xD;
      Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or greater, heart rate greater than or equal to 100 beats per&#xD;
      minute, and respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute. Positive physical&#xD;
      examination findings consisted of the presence of crackles, decreased breath sounds, dullness&#xD;
      to percussion, egophony, or rhonchi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient emergency room physicians will record data regarding the clinical indicators prior&#xD;
      to obtaining chest radiographs; thus, they will be blinded to the radiographic findings. All&#xD;
      chests radiographs will be subsequently interpreted by a board-certified radiologist blinded&#xD;
      to the clinical findings. Positive radiographic findings will be defined as the presence of a&#xD;
      new air space opacities in the setting of acute respiratory symptoms. Patients with equivocal&#xD;
      radiographic findings interpreted as &quot;possible pneumonia&quot; will be considered positive cases.&#xD;
      For each positive case, a single control was randomly selected from a list of eligible&#xD;
      controls with acute respiratory symptoms, negative chest radiographs, and a date of birth&#xD;
      within five years of that of the positive case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once patients are appropriately identified as cases or controls, outpatient charts will be&#xD;
      reviewed to gather data regarding the six clinical indicators will be entered into the study&#xD;
      database for analysis upon completion of the study. The sample size necessary to predict the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with CAP who have all six clinical indicators was calculated as 385,&#xD;
      assuming 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. Sample size estimates assume a random&#xD;
      sample, which is not possible for us to obtain in this study; any conclusion that we draw&#xD;
      will thus e cautiously interpreted. We will conduct this study for a minimum of one year with&#xD;
      the intent to continue until a sample size of at least 385 is obtained. Upon completion of&#xD;
      the study sensitivities and specificities and accompanying 95% confidence intervals for&#xD;
      clinical indicators will be made to determine which combination of indicators best predicts&#xD;
      the presence of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with CAP. Further analysis will be made&#xD;
      within specific age groups (e.g., 18-40, 41-60, older than 60) and amongst those patients&#xD;
      with pre-existing pulmonary disease&#xD;
