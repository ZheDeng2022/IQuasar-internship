  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the psychosocial outcomes of different management strategies for women&#xD;
      with minor atypia (including 'HPV effect') detected on Pap smears: conventional management (a&#xD;
      repeat Pap smear at 6 months) versus Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing, a new method&#xD;
      proposed for the management of minor atypia and the informed choice of either management&#xD;
      supported by a decision aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines women's informed preferences for each of these options and compares the&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes in women who are or are not given the choice of management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV DNA testing offers considerable changes to the management of women with minor atypia and&#xD;
      there is evidence from the USA which suggests that the use of HPV DNA testing as a triage&#xD;
      strategy is effective for women within this group (Solomon et al 2001). The introduction of&#xD;
      HPV DNA testing may bring both benefits and harms to women. These harms and benefits are not&#xD;
      well understood. Examination of the psychosocial outcomes of HPV DNA testing compared to&#xD;
      conventional management and women's preferences for each is needed to guide decisions&#xD;
      concerning HPV DNA testing in cervical screening in Australia and also internationally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women diagnosed with minor atypia following a routine Pap smear will be randomised into one&#xD;
      of the three management arms of the study (a) HPV DNA test, (b) Decision Aid (DA) with choice&#xD;
      of management, or (c) a 6 month repeat Pap smear (conventional management). Women who are&#xD;
      allocated to the HPV DNA arm and the repeat Pap will receive standard information about their&#xD;
      management strategy. Women allocated to the decision aid arm will receive information about&#xD;
      HPV DNA testing and 6 month repeat Pap in a decision aid format as an adjunct to usual&#xD;
      clinical care and asked to indicate their preference for management. Women in this arm will&#xD;
      receive the management strategy of their choice (HPV DNA or repeat Pap). The impact of the&#xD;
      Decision Aid will be assessed and psychosocial impact of each management strategy will be&#xD;
      followed up over the short, medium and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management and Clinical outcomes: Data will be collected on the taking and timing of Pap&#xD;
      smears, HPV testing and colposcopy as well as findings for each of these tests and any&#xD;
      subsequent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial outcomes: Measures will be administered by postal questionnaire at multiple time&#xD;
      points across the study. There will be 3 questionnaires: (1) Baseline questionnaire - for all&#xD;
      participants recruited into the study; (2) Decision-making evaluation - to assess&#xD;
      decision-making in all groups and the impact of the decision aid; (3) Psychosocial impact&#xD;
      questionnaire - brief questionnaire (taking approximately 10 minutes to complete) sent at&#xD;
      multiple time points to assess the psychosocial impact over time (2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life assessment: Participants will be invited to take part in an interview at 1&#xD;
      month and 12 months post testing (HPV testing or repeat Pap smear) to assess quality of life&#xD;
      using standardised validated QOL measures. Interviews will be carried out by an experienced&#xD;
      female researcher. Study participants will be given the option to participate in the&#xD;
      interview and will be under no obligation to take part if they do not wish to.&#xD;
