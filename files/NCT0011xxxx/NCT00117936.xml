        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥25 and ≤75 years, either gender, and any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least a 3 month history of chronic, stable angina and is relieved by rest and/or&#xD;
             nitroglycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documented symptomatic CCS Angina Classification of III to IV despite use of optimal&#xD;
             medical therapy as noted in Inclusion Criterion 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pattern of CHD (coronary pathology) where percutaneous interventional therapy and/or&#xD;
             CABG is not recommended by the treating cardiologist. This decision should have a&#xD;
             documented basis in either complicated vessel physiology and/or lack of suitable&#xD;
             target vessels for both PTCA and CABG, or past history of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. One/two/three vessel disease as evidenced either by an angiographic documentation of&#xD;
             advanced atherosclerotic narrowing of ≥60% of at least one major epicardial coronary&#xD;
             artery (right coronary artery [RCA], left circumflex [LCX], or LAD [or any of their&#xD;
             branches]), or of diffuse type of CHD as evidenced by the appearance on coronary&#xD;
             angiography of multiple stenoses, multiple atherosclerotic plaques, and/or peripheral&#xD;
             occlusion(s) of coronary vessel(s) with and without a history of MIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. demonstrate a radionuclide or angiographically determined left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction (LVEF) ≥30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pre-operative proof of reversible ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No evidence of proliferative retinopathy or significant non-proliferative retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. must be on optimal medical therapy for at least 2 months prior to entering the study,&#xD;
             as documented by a medical history. This will include medical management, and subjects&#xD;
             must enter the study on at least one of the following medications: beta-blockers,&#xD;
             calcium entry blockers, ranolizine, or long-acting nitrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Exercise duration during the qualifying treadmill tests at Visit 1 and Visit 2 is ≥3&#xD;
             and ≤9 minutes on a modified Bruce protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Exercise durations for the qualifying treadmill tests at Visits 1 and 2 must satisfy&#xD;
             at least one of the two following conditions: (a) they differ by less than or equal to&#xD;
             20% of the longer time; (b) they differ by less than or equal to 60 seconds. Subjects&#xD;
             whose ETTs at Visits 1 and 2 do not satisfy at least one of these two conditions are&#xD;
             allowed a third ETT, at the investigator's discretion, from 5 to 7 days after Visit 2.&#xD;
             If a third ETT is done, then when compared with the second ETT it must satisfy at&#xD;
             least one of the two conditions above.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. For a treadmill test result to support inclusion it must terminate in the presence of&#xD;
             angina for either of the following reasons: (a) angina becomes too severe to continue&#xD;
             the test AND there must be a horizontal depression or downsloping ST-segment of at&#xD;
             least 1 mm measured 80 ms from the J point as subsequently established by the&#xD;
             Biomedical Systems central ECG lab, or (b) angina of any grade AND there must be a&#xD;
             horizontal depression or downsloping ST-segment measured 80 ms from the J point of 2&#xD;
             mm during exercise. The qualifying time for the treadmill test will then be the time&#xD;
             to a horizontal depression or downsloping ST-segment of 1 mm compared to the&#xD;
             pre-exercise ST segment as subsequently established by the Biomedical Systems central&#xD;
             ECG lab.&#xD;
&#xD;

         16. Female subjects must be post-menopausal or sterilized, or if she is of childbearing&#xD;
             potential, she is not breast feeding, has no intention to become pregnant during the&#xD;
             course of the study, and is using contraceptive drugs or devices.&#xD;

             a history of BCC are eligible for enrollment, and will be monitored by a qualified&#xD;
             dermatologist every 8 weeks for a period of 6 months for evaluation of their skin&#xD;
