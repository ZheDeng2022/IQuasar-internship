  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary reason for this study is to determine whether the addition of VELCADE&#xD;
      (bortezomib) for injection to standard melphalan/prednisone (MP) therapy improves the time to&#xD;
      disease progression (TTP) in subjects with previously untreated multiple myeloma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not a candidate for HDT/SCT due to: age - subject is 65 years or older or in subjects&#xD;
             less than 65 years of age - presence of important comorbid condition(s) likely to have&#xD;
             a negative impact on tolerability of HDT/SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic multiple myeloma or asymptomatic multiple myeloma with related organ or&#xD;
             tissue damage. Asymptomatic multiple myeloma-related organ or tissue damage can&#xD;
             include presence of asymptomatic lytic bone lesion or plasmacytoma, or presence of&#xD;
             anemia, renal function impairment, or hypercalcemia, as long as the criteria for&#xD;
             pre-treatment clinical laboratory values indicated below are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of measurable disease, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For secretory multiple myeloma, measurable disease is defined as any quantifiable&#xD;
                  serum monoclonal protein value.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For oligosecretory or nonsecretory multiple myeloma, measurable disease is&#xD;
                  defined by the presence of measurable soft tissue or organ (not bone)&#xD;
                  plasmacytomas as determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status score of equal or greater then 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to complete the PRO instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agrees to use an acceptable barrier method for contraception for the duration of the&#xD;
             study (for male subjects); If female subjects are still having menstrual periods and&#xD;
             are not surgically sterile, they must be practicing an effective method of birth&#xD;
             control before entry, and throughout the study, and have a negative serum B-HCG&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have pretreatment clinical laboratory values meeting the criteria as described in the&#xD;
             protocol within 14 days before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) must have signed an informed&#xD;
             consent document indicating that they understand the purpose of and procedures&#xD;
             required for the study and are willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
        participating in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of smoldering multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined&#xD;
             significance (MGUS, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency related to the monoclonal&#xD;
             protein; and (if determined) proportion of plasma cells in the bone marrow of 10% or&#xD;
             less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Waldenstr√∂m's disease or other conditions in which IgM M protein is&#xD;
             present in the absence of a clonal plasma cell infiltration with lytic bone lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or current systemic therapy for multiple myeloma including steroids (with the&#xD;
             exception of emergency use of a short course [maximum of 4 days] of steroids before&#xD;
             randomization or of prior or current use of bisphosphonates)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 30 days before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasmapheresis within 30 days before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 30 days before randomization (kyphoplasty is not considered major&#xD;
             surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction attributable to compounds containing boron or mannitol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain Grade 2 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction, within&#xD;
             6 months of enrollment, uncontrolled angina, clinically significant pericardial&#xD;
             disease, or cardiac amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancy within the past 5 years. Exceptions if treated and not active include&#xD;
             the following: basal cell or nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,&#xD;
             cervical carcinoma in situ or International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics&#xD;
             (FIGO) Stage 1 carcinoma of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent medical condition or disease (e.g., active systemic infection, uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes) that is likely to interfere with study procedures or results, or that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in this&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational drugs within 30 days before randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Employees of the investigator or study center, with direct involvement in the proposed&#xD;
             study or other studies under the direction of that investigator or study center, or&#xD;
             family members of the employees or the investigator.&#xD;
