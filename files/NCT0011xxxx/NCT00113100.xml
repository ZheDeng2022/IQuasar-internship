  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the way by which estrogen improves the appearance&#xD;
      of sun damaged human skin. Accumulating evidence suggests that estrogen, taken by post&#xD;
      menopausal women, may cause skin to look younger as a consequence of reduced wrinkles.&#xD;
      Collagen is the most abundant protein in human skin and gives skin its strength and shape.&#xD;
      Recent data indicate that short-term topical estrogen (17-beta estradiol) treatment increases&#xD;
      collagen production in sun damaged skin. This study will compare the molecular and&#xD;
      microscopic effects from topical 17-beta estradiol (E2) when applied to the skin for a&#xD;
      short-term duration. It is anticipated that the new knowledge from this study will enable&#xD;
      development of new ways to improve the function of aged skin.&#xD;

      The objectives of the study are to determine if topically-applied 17-beta estradiol (E2),&#xD;
      alone or in combination with clobetasol, will produce histological and molecular effects&#xD;
      distinguishable from vehicle in human skin. Specifically, the study will focus on regulation&#xD;
      of collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid production and degradation in human skin, by&#xD;
      steroid hormone receptors that are activated by estrogen or clobetasol. The sites to be&#xD;
      treated will be buttock, hip, forearm, or facial skin. Subjects will receive between one to&#xD;
      twelve vehicle (matching solution without any active ingredients), estrogen, and/or&#xD;
      clobetasol topical applications. Skin biopsies of treated areas will be obtained at baseline&#xD;
      and at subsequent timepoints. The study will last up to two weeks. Endpoints will include&#xD;
      protein and mRNA levels of collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, and other components of skin&#xD;
      connective tissue. In addition, we will perform cDNA microanalysis to determine&#xD;
      estrogen/clobetasol target genes in human skin. The results from our studies will provide new&#xD;
      knowledge regarding the molecular basis of skin aging. This new knowledge will enable&#xD;
      development of new ways to improve the function of aged skin.&#xD;
