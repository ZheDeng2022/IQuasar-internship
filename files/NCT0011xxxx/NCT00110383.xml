      1. Develop a simple school-based intervention using school-based supervised asthma therapy&#xD;
           to increase adherence to asthma medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implement a school-based internet monitoring system within both the school-based&#xD;
           supervised asthma therapy and parent supervised asthma therapy groups to record asthma&#xD;
           symptoms, peak flow meter readings, school absences, and usage of rescue medications at&#xD;
           school.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomly assign 250 children from inner-city school systems to either school-based&#xD;
           supervised asthma therapy or parental supervised asthma therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare children assigned to school-based supervised asthma therapy with children&#xD;
           assigned to parent supervised asthma therapy, in regards to time-averaged proportion&#xD;
           having at least one exacerbation per month, rescue medication use, peak flow meter&#xD;
           readings, asthma symptoms, school absences, and asthma self-management knowledge.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric asthma is a well-documented public health issue in the United States. The impact of&#xD;
      pediatric asthma can be measured by both health care costs and morbidity. Whereas many&#xD;
      factors contribute to the high health care costs of asthma, much of the morbidity can be&#xD;
      directly attributed to lack of adherence to medical treatments. The consequence of&#xD;
      non-adherence for most individuals with ashtma is exacerbations. Greater numbers of&#xD;
      exacerbations lead to increased school absenteeism, greater activity limitations, decreased&#xD;
      quality of life for both parent and child, increased urgent health care use and costs, and&#xD;
      increased parental days missed at work. Therefore, adherence to treatment is essential for&#xD;
      proper asthma management and ultimate reductions in morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma morbidity, as measured by the number of exacerbations, is largely preventable with&#xD;
      patient education and optimal treatment. However, it has been demonstrated that patient&#xD;
      education alone is insufficient to decrease asthma morbidity. Optimal treatment is essential&#xD;
      to control asthma morbidity. Inhaled corticosteroids offer considerable protection against&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations. However, only a minority of asthma patients take their inhaled steroids&#xD;
      as recommended by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines.&#xD;
      Therefore, the Pediatric Asthma Guidelines recommend development and testing of programs&#xD;
      (including school-based programs) to increase adherence with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because morbidity is higher in inner-city, low-income, minority children, this study will&#xD;
      collaborate with several inner-city, low-income, minority school districts to examine the&#xD;
      effects of school-based supervised asthma therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a longitudinal two-group trial of the effectiveness of a school-based&#xD;
      supervised asthma therapy program. Two hundred and fifty children will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of two groups: school-based supervised asthma therapy or parental supervised asthma&#xD;
      therapy. The children will be followed for 16 months.&#xD;
