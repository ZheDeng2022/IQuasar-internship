      Objective(s) of the proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation of the efficiency of 18F deoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography&#xD;
           (FDG-PET) in staging patients eligible for hepatic resection of colorectal liver&#xD;
           metastases in a randomized clinical multicentre setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions of the proposed study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the effects and costs for patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer&#xD;
           indicated for potentially curative hepatic resection, using the conventional diagnostic&#xD;
           strategy with computed tomography (CT) scan in comparison to the experimental diagnostic&#xD;
           strategy incorporating FDG-PET scan (CT + FDG-PET scan), based on a health care&#xD;
           perspective and a time horizon of 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the experimental diagnostic strategy which includes FDG-PET scan in the diagnostic&#xD;
           work-up of patients eligible for potentially curative hepatic resection of colorectal&#xD;
           liver metastases lead to a better disease-free survival at 9 months after hepatic&#xD;
           resection in comparison to the conventional diagnostic strategy using CT scan without&#xD;
           FDG-PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the costs of diagnostic and therapeutic care for the two diagnostic strategies&#xD;
           for patients eligible for potentially curative hepatic resection of colorectal liver&#xD;
           metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the effect of including the FDG-PET scan in the diagnostic work-up of patients&#xD;
           eligible for potentially curative hepatic resection of colorectal liver metastases after&#xD;
           hepatic resection, expressed as disease-free survival at 9 months adjusted for quality&#xD;
           of health (Q-TWIST), in comparison to the use of CT scan only.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized study. In both arms conventional diagnostic tests will be performed.&#xD;
      In arm A (conventional strategy) no FDG-PET scan will be performed. In arm B (experimental&#xD;
      strategy) an FDG-PET scan will be made and the results will be incorporated in decisions for&#xD;
      further clinical management by the referring surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivation study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization in one strategy with and one strategy without FDG-PET scan will allow to truly&#xD;
      estimate the impact of including FDG-PET scan in the diagnostic work-up. More specifically&#xD;
      this study design allows to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The impact of FDG-PET on disease-free survival after hepatic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The amount and costs of diagnostic and (non)-therapeutic procedures of both strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The average number of months of disease-free survival adjusted for quality of health&#xD;
           (Q-TWIST) for the two strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific basis of study proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the added value of FDG-PET in the diagnostic work-up is well established, it is&#xD;
      unclear from current studies, whether more sensitive and meticulous preoperative staging has&#xD;
      an impact on patient outcome. Moreover, prospective comparative economic evaluations on&#xD;
      strategies of diagnostic work-up with and without FDG-PET are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are considered eligible for the trial when they fulfill all of the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One to four colorectal liver metastases on spiral CT, judged potentially resectable by&#xD;
           an experienced liver surgeon from the institution participating in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No evidence of extrahepatic disease as demonstrated by spiral CT scan of chest and&#xD;
           abdomen with oral and intravenous contrast with contiguous reconstruction algorithm. In&#xD;
           case of previous rectal cancer spiral CT should include the pelvic area. CT readings&#xD;
           should be performed by an experienced radiologist from the institution participating in&#xD;
           the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No signs of recurrent or second colorectal carcinoma on barium enema or colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absence of any other previous malignancy other than adequately treated in situ carcinoma&#xD;
           of the cervix or non-melanoma skin cancer (unless there has been a disease-free interval&#xD;
           of at least 10 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Absence of major hepatic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Absence of active infection and diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. WHO performance status 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Age 18-75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: patients will be centrally randomized with random diagnostic strategy&#xD;
           allocation stratifying by institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDG-PET scan; Image acquisition: Imaging should be performed with dedicated PET-scanners&#xD;
           only. Patients will be fasted for at least 6 hours before PET-scanning. Immediately&#xD;
           prior to the procedure, patients will be hydrated with 500 ml of water. Blood glucose&#xD;
           levels will be measured. Thereafter, FDG (370 MBq when using full-ring systems, 220 MBq&#xD;
           when using a half-ring system) and 20 mg of furosemide will be injected intravenously.&#xD;
           Image acquisition will start 60-75 minutes after FDG injection (emission and&#xD;
           transmission images of the area between proximal femora and the base of the skull). The&#xD;
           images will be corrected for attenuation and reconstructed using the ordered-subsets&#xD;
           expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Image interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDG-PET studies will be read on site. The final result of FDG-PET alone will be&#xD;
      communicated to the referring surgeon on a confidence scale as (a) normal or benign disease,&#xD;
      (b) probably no malignancy, (c) malignant/benign unclear (d) definitely malignant disease.&#xD;
      Further evaluation will take place by joint reading of FDG-PET and CT of the chest and&#xD;
      abdomen, the combined reading will again be scored on the same confidence scale to allow&#xD;
      estimation of increased confidence in the co-interpreted procedures. The combination of these&#xD;
      tests will form the basis for the surgeons' decision making. In case of concordant evidence&#xD;
      of extra-hepatic disease the patient is considered to be non-resectable. In case of&#xD;
      discordance between CT and FDG-PET, it is at the referring surgeon's discretion to request&#xD;
      additional diagnostic tests, to reject the option of laparotomy or to attempt surgical&#xD;
      resection of the liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparotomy is performed within 4 weeks after randomization. At laparotomy careful&#xD;
           examination of the abdominal cavity is performed to exclude extra-hepatic disease. In&#xD;
           case of any doubt of extra-hepatic disease samples are taken for frozen sections. When&#xD;
           positive, the operation is terminated. Intra-operative ultrasound should be performed to&#xD;
           detect and localize all metastatic lesions. Lesions within 1 cm of each other are&#xD;
           considered as satellite lesions and are counted as one lesion. In case intra-operative&#xD;
           examination shows more than 4 lesions and complete resection of all lesions is still&#xD;
           possible, resection is allowed within the study proposal. Complete resection of all&#xD;
           metastatic lesions should always be achieved, if possible with a safety margin of &gt; 1cm&#xD;
           of normal parenchyma. The type of liver resection (anatomical, wedge or combination) is&#xD;
           at the surgeon's discretion. In case complete resection of all lesions seems not&#xD;
           possible the operation is terminated. The use of local ablative techniques like&#xD;
           radiofrequency or cryosurgery is not allowed within the study. The post-operative course&#xD;
           and complications are recorded as well as duration of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up should concentrate on the detection of recurrent disease and the registration&#xD;
           of sequela and financial consequences of the medical interventions performed in the&#xD;
           protocol. At 3, 6 and 9 months after surgery, the following follow-up items will be&#xD;
           performed: history, physical examination, plasma CEA-level and CT of the abdomen and&#xD;
           chest. All CT readings during follow-up should be performed by an experienced&#xD;
           radiologist in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of tumor recurrence should be made only by one of the criteria defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective radiological recurrence on radiological CT imaging. That is the appearance of&#xD;
           one or more new lesions on radiological imaging or at least 20% increase of a suspected&#xD;
           lesion on earlier investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Positive cytology or histology (in case of ambiguous radiological imaging). The&#xD;
           documented date of recurrence will be the date of confirmation of the recurrence using&#xD;
           one of the methods of diagnosis. An elevated CEA level, as a solitary finding, will not&#xD;
           be considered as acceptable evidence of colon cancer recurrence. In case of elevation of&#xD;
           serum CEA on two successive time points further examinations must be performed searching&#xD;
           for disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease-free survival 9 months after hepatic resection. Disease free survival defined as&#xD;
           the absence of recurrent disease on conventional diagnostic imaging (CT liver/abdomen,&#xD;
           CT chest). Comment: The study proposal assumes that patients unnecessarily operated in&#xD;
           the conventional arm (patients who would have had a positive PET for extrahepatic&#xD;
           disease and negative CT for extrahepatic disease) will show extrahepatic disease on&#xD;
           conventional CT imaging within 9 months of randomization. This assumption is confirmed&#xD;
           in a preliminary study conducted at our institute (Langenhoff 2001a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total costs of diagnostic procedures and potential therapeutic medical interventions&#xD;
           (hepatic resection, laparotomy) and their sequences in strategy A and B, in a time&#xD;
           horizon of 9 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cost-effectiveness of strategy A and B expressed in costs per month disease-free&#xD;
           survival for patients undergoing hepatic resection.· The number of operations not&#xD;
           resulting in hepatic resection in strategy A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnostic yield of FDG-PET versus CT imaging for evaluating hepatic resectability&#xD;
           and detecting extra-hepatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life of the patient groups analyzed by strategy A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on publications [Fong 1997, Scheele 1991] the following percentages are the expected&#xD;
      disease-free survival after 9 months follow-up: for the group of patients who underwent the&#xD;
      conventional CT strategy the expected disease-free survival rate is 70% and for the group of&#xD;
      patients in the experimental strategy (CT + FDG-PET) the expected disease-free survival rate&#xD;
      is 95%. To detect this difference between the two groups of 25% with a power of 80% and an&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05 (1-sided), 25 patients are required for each group (Cohen 1977). To anticipate&#xD;
      for patients not eligible for laparotomy or hepatic resection 43 patients are needed in each&#xD;
      arm to perform the above mentioned analysis. Dropouts of patients is not anticipated. Patient&#xD;
      accrual for this part of the analyses will be sufficient after 2 years of patient inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, an intention-to treat analysis will be performed and in both arms both the&#xD;
      proportion of resected patients and the 3 year survival will be determined (the latter by&#xD;
      continued follow-up of all recruited - resected and nonresected - patients beyond the formal&#xD;
      conclusion of the present proposal). To detect a difference in resection percentage between&#xD;
      both arms of 15% with a power of 87% (60% in CT+PET group vs 75% in CT-only group, a=0.2,&#xD;
      one-sided) 75 patients are needed in each study arm. The number of 150 recruited patients&#xD;
      (2x75), is a realistic estimate of the number of patients that can be included in a 3 year&#xD;
      period. This means that at the time point of study closure we will be able to detect [A] a&#xD;
      difference in disease free survival of 25% (power 80%, a=0.05) between patients resected in&#xD;
      both study arms and [B] a difference in resection percentage between both arms of 15 % (power&#xD;
      87%, a=0.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the formal closure of the study after 3 years the intention to treat analysis will be&#xD;
      continued. With the number of included patients (2x75) we will be able to detect a difference&#xD;
      in 3 years survival of 20% or less (power 80%, a=0.05, one-sided) between resected patients&#xD;
      of group A and B. Definite conclusions on equal overall survival in arm A and B of the study&#xD;
      will obviously be limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical outcomes: primary tumor (localization, resection date, histology, TNM), CEA&#xD;
           level, number, size and localization metastases, resectability, histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic outcomes: CT (baseline and 3, 6 and 9 months after surgery): number, size and&#xD;
           localization of metastases, extra-hepatic disease, recurrence; FDG-PET (baseline):&#xD;
           number, localization and size of metastases, extra-hepatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: complaints, morbidity, mortality, presence of recurrent disease and site&#xD;
           (CT), CEA, QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costs: see elsewhere. To measure the separate effect of the two diagnostic strategies&#xD;
           and their related treatment regimes (primary outcome) the proportion of respondents who&#xD;
           are still disease-free after hepatic resection (CT diagnosis) 9 month after treatment&#xD;
           will be estimated by applying life-table analysis (Kaplan-Meier). These estimated&#xD;
           proportions will be used in the cost-effectiveness analysis (see section: Economic&#xD;
           evaluation). A similar analysis, however, extended with quality of health outcomes&#xD;
           (utilities: measured by the EQ-5D) will be performed for the 3 distinct clinical states&#xD;
           that can be distinguished: 1) no laparotomy, no cure, 2) laparotomy + hepatic resection,&#xD;
           possible cure, 3) laparotomy + no hepatic resection, no cure. In order to perform this&#xD;
           so-called Q-TWIST analysis the EQ-5D will be measured at baseline and each month during&#xD;
           follow-up. The results of this aggregated analysis will be expressed as the number of&#xD;
           quality-adjusted months survival for the two treatment strategies. Another contribution&#xD;
           of this approach is that all the information can be depicted in one single figure for&#xD;
           each of the two strategies, clearly dividing the impact of the three distinct states and&#xD;
           their occurrence in time.Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be computed in order&#xD;
           to perform a conventional cost-utility analysis for the two diagnostic strategies.&#xD;
           Utilities (EQ-5D) will be based on the mean values for the two groups of patients at the&#xD;
           10 occasions (baseline, month 1-9). Contrary to the above-mentioned Q-TWIST analysis, no&#xD;
           distinct states will be recognized, whereas cost will be incorporated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic assumption for this study is that the experimental diagnostic strategy based on CT&#xD;
      + FDG-PET compared to the conventional diagnostic strategy based on CT leads to a more&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis about operability of liver metastases. Therefore, the economic evaluation&#xD;
      is based on the principles of a cost-effectiveness analysis. Using a differential approach,&#xD;
      patients are followed up for a period of 9 months. In addition, patients suffering from&#xD;
      recurrence of the disease will be followed during this period in order to be able to evaluate&#xD;
      the total costs involved in the care of these patients. Because of the specific patient&#xD;
      population in this study, non-medical costs are expected not to be different between the&#xD;
      patient groups. Therefore, a health care perspective is the basis for the analyses,&#xD;
      indicating that only health care costs are subject to study. A problem with basing cost&#xD;
      estimates on data gathered as part of a clinical trial is the extent to which one is&#xD;
      capturing resource use associated with the trial per se (i.e. costs of doing scientific&#xD;
      research) rather than the costs of providing the diagnostic and therapeutic care [Drummond&#xD;
      1997]. These so called protocol driven costs will be excluded from the cost analyses.&#xD;
      Regarding the cost-effectiveness analysis, for each patient the total costs will be split&#xD;
      into diagnostic and therapeutic costs. Focusing on the effectiveness measure 'proportion of&#xD;
      accurate diagnoses', only the diagnostic costs will be used to calculate the incremental&#xD;
      ratio comparing the FDG-PET strategy versus the conventional strategy. This results in an&#xD;
      estimate of the additional diagnostic costs per extra accurate diagnosis. Concerning the&#xD;
      effectiveness measure 'proportion of patients with disease-free survival', the total costs&#xD;
      until recurrence of the disease or to the end of follow up will be related to the mean time&#xD;
      of disease free survival. This results in an estimate of the additional medical costs per&#xD;
      month of disease free survival. In addition, a cost-utility analysis (CUA) will be carried&#xD;
      out to incorporate the preferences of the participants considering their own health status at&#xD;
      the start of the treatment and after follow-up. Based on these preferences combined with life&#xD;
      expectancy figures, calculation of so-called quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is&#xD;
      applicable. A general measure to express the benefits for the two different treatment&#xD;
      strategies will be calculated by computing the area under the curve of the utility x&#xD;
      measurement moment (from baseline through the assessment at month 9) curve. These QALYs for&#xD;
      the 9-month period can be combined with the costs of each strategy to arrive at the cost per&#xD;
      QALY gained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation/cost analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost analysis exists of two main parts. First, on the patient level, volumes of&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic care will be measured prospectively using standardized Case Report&#xD;
      Forms (CRF). In each participating hospital research nurses will register in the CRF the&#xD;
      number of times a patient visits the out patient department, the number of days in hospital&#xD;
      (normal care and intensive care distinguished), the number and kind of diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      (CT, FDG-PET, ultrasonography, histological examination), the type and number of operations&#xD;
      (intra-operative ultrasonography, endoscopy, resection of liver metastases), the duration of&#xD;
      the specific operations, the number and duration of therapeutic sessions, the amount and kind&#xD;
      of pharmaceutical therapies (e.g. pain killers), days in hospital (normal care and intensive&#xD;
      care distinguished) and so on. This part of the CRF will be designed and pilot tested in the&#xD;
      first months of the study. The second part of the cost analysis consists of determining the&#xD;
      cost prices for each volume parameter to use these for multiplying the volumes registered for&#xD;
      each participating patient. The Dutch guidelines for conducting pharmaco-economic studies&#xD;
      (CVZ, 1999) and the guidelines for cost analyses will be used [Oostenbrink 2000]. Because of&#xD;
      the health care perspective of the study approximations of real integral costs will be used&#xD;
      in the cost analysis. As a basis for the cost price calculations for each participating&#xD;
      hospital a unique cost price, based on standardized calculation methods will be determined.&#xD;
      For the baseline analysis a weighed average (using the number of patients included in the&#xD;
      study by each participating hospital) will be used. Mean, median, range and standard&#xD;
      deviation of the total medical costs per patient will be determined for each of the two&#xD;
      patient groups. Skewness of the distribution will be examined to determine whether parametric&#xD;
      or non-parametric statistical techniques will be used to test a possible statistical&#xD;
      difference between the groups. Analysis will be performed on the basis of intention to treat.&#xD;
      Besides this statistical analysis, the impact of deterministic variables, such as the cost&#xD;
      prices used for the different volume parameters, will be investigated using sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses on the basis of the range of extremes [Briggs 1994]. For definition of the range of&#xD;
      extremes to be used in this sensitivity analysis, the range of the cost prices as calculated&#xD;
      in the participating hospitals and the national guidelines will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic evaluation/patient outcome analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcome analysis will be primarily based on the 'proportion of disease-free patients&#xD;
      after 9 months follow-up' (cost-effectiveness analysis). As a secondary analysis a&#xD;
      cost-utility analysis will be carried out. For this purpose the EQ-5D instrument will be used&#xD;
      to estimate utilities for each patient at the different measurement moments. In addition, a&#xD;
      generic (SF-36) and a disease-specific (EORTC QLQ-C30) descriptive health-related quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaire will be applied.&#xD;
