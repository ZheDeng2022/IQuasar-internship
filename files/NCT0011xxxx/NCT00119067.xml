      Anthrax Clinical Trial Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthrax vaccine (AVA or BioThrax, BioPort Corp. Lansing MI) administered by the&#xD;
           intramuscular (IM) route elicits antibody responses that are not inferior (i.e.,&#xD;
           &quot;non-inferior&quot;) to that achieved by the currently licensed schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BioThrax administered by the IM route and containing fewer numbers of doses elicits&#xD;
           antibody responses that are not inferior (i.e., &quot;non-inferior&quot;) to that achieved by the&#xD;
           currently licensed schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in reactogenicity exist between the IM and subcutaneous (SQ) administration&#xD;
           of BioThrax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally for the final report we will assess whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of adverse events following AVA administration is influenced by selected risk&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 43-month prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison&#xD;
      of immunogenicity and reactogenicity elicited by BioThrax given by different routes of&#xD;
      administration (SQ versus IM) and dosing regimens (as many as 8 doses versus as few as 4&#xD;
      doses). Sterile saline is used as the placebo where doses are dropped in regimens using AVA,&#xD;
      and in the all-placebo study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted among a total of 1564 healthy adult men and women (18 to 61 years of&#xD;
      age) at five sites in the United States. Participants were randomized into one of 6 study&#xD;
      groups with 260 participants per group. One group receives BioThrax given as currently&#xD;
      licensed (SQ with 6 doses followed by annual boosters); another group is given placebo IM&#xD;
      (130 participants) or SQ (130 participants) in the currently licensed dosing regimen. The&#xD;
      four other groups receive BioThrax IM in modified dosing regimens; placebo is given when a&#xD;
      dose of BioThrax is omitted from the licensed dosing regimen. There are a total of 25&#xD;
      required visits for this study, during which all participants receive an injection of vaccine&#xD;
      or placebo (8 injections total), have a blood sample drawn (16 or 17 total), and have an&#xD;
      in-clinic examination for adverse events (22 total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity is assessed by assaying 16 serial blood samples obtained from all participants&#xD;
      and a 17th sample from a subset of participants before vaccination and at other specified&#xD;
      times. Total anti-protective antigen IgG antibody (anti-PA IgG) is quantified using a&#xD;
      standardized and validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the primary study&#xD;
      endpoints are 4-fold rise in antibody titer and antibody concentration relative to the&#xD;
      pre-vaccination titers or assay reactivity threshold. A subset of serum samples is also&#xD;
      assayed in an in vitro toxin neutralization assay (TNA) to measure the functional activity of&#xD;
      anti-BioThrax antibodies. The kinetics of the immune response to BioThrax are examined at 3&#xD;
      time points in the study and blood samples from a subset of participants will be further&#xD;
      tested in correlates of protection and immunogenetics substudies. All adverse events (AEs),&#xD;
      including vaccine reactogenicity, are actively monitored. While all AEs will be ascertained&#xD;
      among study participants, several endpoints will be defined based on the likelihood of their&#xD;
      occurrence and/or their clinical importance. Of primary interest is the occurrence of local&#xD;
      AEs such as warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, erythema, induration,&#xD;
      nodule, and bruise. Systemic AEs such as fever, fatigue, muscle ache, headache, temperature,&#xD;
      and painful axillary adenopathy are also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to provide the basis for consideration of change in route of BioThrax&#xD;
      administration from SQ to IM and reduction in number of vaccine doses required for primary&#xD;
      and booster immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an interim analysis of data collected through each participant's first 7 months of&#xD;
      this study for consideration in changing the route of BioThrax administration from SQ to IM,&#xD;
      and elimination of the 2 week vaccine priming dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the Sponsor will present the entire results of the trial to FDA for&#xD;
      consideration in elimination of additional doses from the licensed BioThrax schedule. At that&#xD;
      time, the Sponsor will also supplement these data with results from parallel non-human&#xD;
      primate challenge studies and additional research on immunologic correlates of protection.&#xD;
