  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NIMH is conducting studies aimed at gaining a better understanding of the areas of the&#xD;
      brain that are involved in different types of mental processes. This study will focus on&#xD;
      brain regions involved in visual perception and attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke or undergone neurosurgery may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates must be 18 years of age or older, They must not have a&#xD;
      history of a psychiatric disorder, including depression, anxiety, psychosis, or neurological&#xD;
      disease other than stroke or the previous neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during four or more visits to the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological examinations and depression rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive testing: Subjects complete written tests, sit at a computer and make decisions&#xD;
           about what they are shown by pressing keys, or answer questions from a test examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral training: Subjects practice performing a cognitive task that involves looking&#xD;
           at and making decisions about visual images that appear on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Subjects undergo MRI scanning while they perform the&#xD;
           task they previously practiced. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a&#xD;
           strong magnetic field. During the procedure, subjects lie still for up to 10 minutes at&#xD;
           a time on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. The entire MRI scanning&#xD;
           session takes about one hour. There are multiple scans which each can take up to 10&#xD;
           minutes. They may be asked to return for one or two additional scanning sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the behavioral training or MRI scanning, special pieces of equipment that monitor eye&#xD;
      movements may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some subjects may be asked to return to NIH for an additional visit to participate in a&#xD;
      magnetoencephalographic scan. This test uses several sensors applied to the scalp to measure&#xD;
      very small changes in magnetic fields. This is another way to measure brain activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Attention is required for most, if not all, perceptual processes. There is a converging body&#xD;
      of evidence from single-cell recording studies in monkeys and neuroimaging, behavioral, and&#xD;
      clinical studies in humans showing that the processing of attended information is enhanced&#xD;
      relative to the processing of unattended information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the source of this attentional modulation? Because neuroimaging studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that multiple cortical regions are recruited during tasks involving selective&#xD;
      attention, it has proven difficult thus far to determine the differential contributions of&#xD;
      each region. A central goal of the proposed research is to characterize the contributions of&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex and test the hypothesis that these regions exert&#xD;
      top-down modulatory influences over visual processing areas. Specifically, we wish to&#xD;
      investigate the interaction between areas involved in attentional control and visual areas&#xD;
      modulated by attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study patients with focal lesions and normal volunteers while they perform&#xD;
      tasks requiring attention. Subjects will participate, first, in a series of behavioral&#xD;
      studies involving selective attention; the relative performance of different patient groups&#xD;
      and neurologically normal volunteers will be compared. Subjects will also be studied while&#xD;
      performing similar tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesize&#xD;
      that selective attention will be heavily impaired by lesions of key prefrontal (e.g.,&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and key parietal (e.g., superior parietal lobule) sites. We&#xD;
      also expect that brain imaging data will show decreased activation in visual regions&#xD;
      ipsilateral to the focal lesions in prefrontal and parietal cortex, thus providing evidence&#xD;
      that prefrontal and parietal cortex are sources of top-down modulation. Although other&#xD;
      research groups have compared the behavior of patients with various focal lesions or have&#xD;
      performed fMRI studies of visual attention in neurologically normal patients, we are unaware&#xD;
      of any concerted effort to perform fMRI in patients with focal lesions in order to&#xD;
      functionally isolate the contributions of individual cortical regions that serve as critical&#xD;
      nodes in the attentional network.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ALL SUBJECTS -&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will be volunteers and be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PATIENTS -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with unilateral or bilateral lesions of prefrontal or parietal cortex will be&#xD;
        selected for participation in the behavioral and brain-imaging studies described within&#xD;
        this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control subjects with unilateral or bilateral lesions of temporal cortex will also be&#xD;
        studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Finally, patients with amygdala lesions will also be studied to test the specific&#xD;
        hypothesis outlined in Experiment 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to obtain a sufficient number of focal lesion patients representative of different&#xD;
        brain regions, patients with different etiologies will be studied, provided the damage is&#xD;
        circumscribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The main etiologies that we will consider are stroke, lobectomy, and tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will restrict groups to include patients with the same etiology, lesion location, and&#xD;
        lesion volume. Lesion location will consider the two hemispheres separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who also have non-amygdala subcortical lesions will be grouped separately from&#xD;
        patients with cortical-only lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Our goal is to not group patients with more focal brain lesions compromising a single&#xD;
        region (e.g., middle frontal gyrus) with patients with more massive damage (e.g., large&#xD;
        extents of superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyrus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Focal lesion patients will not be excluded on the basis of medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NORMAL VOLUNTEERS -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neurologically normal, age-matched volunteers will be recruited from the local community&#xD;
        through normal Clinical Center channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria will be used to exclude patients or healthy volunteers from&#xD;
        participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with language impairments that prevent them from understanding our tasks or&#xD;
             follow instructions will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a WAIS-R Full-Scale IQ of less than 75 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe cognitive dysfunction as assessed by the neuropsychological&#xD;
             tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with moderate or severe depression as assessed by the Beck Depression&#xD;
             Inventory (scores greater than 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot perform control tasks to the same level of performance as the&#xD;
             control subjects will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with contraindication to MRI scanning will be excluded from any testing which&#xD;
             involves the use of MRI. These contraindications include subjects with the following&#xD;
             devices or conditions: a) central nervous system aneurysm clips; b) implanted neural&#xD;
             stimulator; c) implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator; d) cochlear implant; e)&#xD;
             ocular foreign body (e.g., metal shavings); f) insulin pump; g) metal shrapnel or&#xD;
             bullet; h) any implanted device that is incompatible with MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of any neurological or psychiatric disorder not related to the&#xD;
             focal lesion (e.g., epilepsy, schizophrenia, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any previous head injuries not related to the focal lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse or addiction (determined by a&#xD;
             qualified neurologist/psychiatrist).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with conditions that preclude entry into the scanner (e.g., morbid obesity,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, etc.) will not be included in brain imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of child-bearing age will be excluded from brain imaging studies if&#xD;
             they are pregnant or refuse to undergo a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with visual, auditory, motor, or language problems that would prohibit them&#xD;
             from being able to properly perform the visual attention tasks, to understand&#xD;
             instructions, indicate their responses, or to communicate with the experimenter via an&#xD;
             intercom system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone radiation treatment or chemotherapy during a one-year&#xD;
             period prior to the experiment.&#xD;
