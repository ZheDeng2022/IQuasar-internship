  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of atorvastatin (Lipitor) and&#xD;
      rosuvastatin (Crestor), United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs&#xD;
      commonly prescribed by doctors to lower cholesterol, on certain functions of platelets (cells&#xD;
      that cause blood clots), white blood cells (cells that are responsible for inflammation), and&#xD;
      blood flow regulation by arteries. This is important because we are looking at ways to more&#xD;
      effectively prevent atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in blood vessels) and heart disease. Many&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that these drugs are effective at reducing inflammation and&#xD;
      stabilizing plaques. We are interested in better understanding the effects of these medicines&#xD;
      on inflammation (pain and swelling) and the mechanism by which they act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Atorvastatin (40mg) will reduce inflammatory markers and activity more than&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin (10mg) in spite of equal LDL-C reduction.&#xD;

      A double-blind controlled trial with two arms will be conducted at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital (BWH). We will screen subjects with stable atherosclerosis to complete enrollment of&#xD;
      40 subjects in the study (see inclusion and exclusion criteria section below). A central&#xD;
      pharmacist at BWH will randomize the patients to 40mg of atorvastatin (n=20) or 10mg of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin (n=20) for 28 days. If the patient is already on a statin a two-week washout&#xD;
      period will be required prior to trial initiation. Our subjects, clinicians, data collectors,&#xD;
      outcomes assessors and statisticians will be blind with regards to the patient allocation.&#xD;
      There are a total of 3 visits for each patient: a short screening visit, an initial visit for&#xD;
      baseline data (90 min.) and a final visit after 28 days. Our participants will be asked to&#xD;
      take the medication every day at the same time between 9pm and 10pm. Each visit will take&#xD;
      place between 7am and 9am. Patients will be instructed to fast overnight for a minimum of&#xD;
      8hrs. They will also be advised not to make any other changes to their current medications&#xD;
      and lifestyle for 28 days while in the study and to record in a diary any side effects,&#xD;
      missed doses, or changes in concomitant medication.&#xD;
