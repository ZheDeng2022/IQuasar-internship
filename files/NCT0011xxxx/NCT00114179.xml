      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and gemcitabine, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different&#xD;
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and&#xD;
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the&#xD;
      growth of pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may make tumor cells more sensitive to&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Bevacizumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to both chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Giving chemotherapy and bevacizumab before and after radiation therapy may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and&#xD;
      bevacizumab together with radiation therapy followed by gemcitabine and bevacizumab works in&#xD;
      treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare 1-year overall survival of patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer treated with capecitabine, bevacizumab, and radiotherapy followed by maintenance&#xD;
      therapy comprising gemcitabine and bevacizumab to a historical control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the frequency of serious unacceptable adverse events in patients treated with&#xD;
      this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the&#xD;
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo&#xD;
      radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38. Patients also&#xD;
      receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients undergo&#xD;
      reevaluation 3-4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no evidence of disease progression proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients&#xD;
      with a marked response may undergo surgery at the discretion of the attending surgeon and&#xD;
      then proceed to maintenance therapy approximately 4-8 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy: Beginning within 4-7 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy and&#xD;
      bevacizumab, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15 provided that blood counts have returned to&#xD;
      normal. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 82 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.&#xD;
