  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of flavopiridol and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as flavopiridol, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the disease-specific dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      flavopiridol in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the complete and partial response rate in patients with selected non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma (e.g., indolent B-cell, mantle cell, intermediate grade B-cell, and T/NK-cell),&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects or this drug, in terms of organ&#xD;
      specificity, time course, predictability, and reversibility in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine subsets of lymphoid/plasma cell malignancies that are suitable for larger phase&#xD;
      II studies designed to further evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of this drug in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the effect of&#xD;
      this drug on innate immunity (including T-, B-, and NK-cell subsets) and quantitative&#xD;
      immunoglobulin levels in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether acute infusion toxicity (e.g., fever, hypotension, tumor pain, and&#xD;
      dyspnea) observed with other flavopiridol treatment schedules is related to a&#xD;
      cytokine-release syndrome in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether this drug induces response (independent of p53 mutational status) in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a multicenter, phase II, pilot&#xD;
      study. Patients enrolled in the phase II portion of the study are stratified according to&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 4½ hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients receive flavopiridol* as in phase I at the MTD determined in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: The phase II treatment dose and schedule for hairy cell leukemia patients will be&#xD;
      adapted from that developed in previous phase II studies of flavopiridol for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
