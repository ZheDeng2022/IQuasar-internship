      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Escitalopram in the treatment of&#xD;
      obsessive compulsive disorder and to determine the optimal treatment dose.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Purpose: Obsessive compulsive disorder affects approximately 3% of the&#xD;
      population. Treatment options include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),&#xD;
      dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and behavioral therapy. A recent&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that citalopram is effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of OCD. Escitalopram is a new SSRI that may be more effective than other SSRIs for&#xD;
      the treatment of major depression and may have fewer side effects. This study aims to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of escitalopram for the treatment of OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Subject Y-BOCs pre-post treatment. We will also compare the improvement of&#xD;
      subjects across the three different medication levels: 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg.&#xD;
