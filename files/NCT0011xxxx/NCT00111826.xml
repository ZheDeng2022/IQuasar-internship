      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the Celacade™ system in patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SIMPADICO was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled&#xD;
      553 patients with claudication at 50 sites in Canada and the United States. The mean (±SD)&#xD;
      patient age was 67±10 years; 72% were males. The duration of claudication was 6.0±6.1 years&#xD;
      at entry; 91% had a history of smoking and 34% were current smokers; 36.5% had diabetes.&#xD;
      Resting ABI was 0.59+0.14; baseline ICD was 132±104 and ACD 307±209 meters. Results showed&#xD;
      that there was no increase in ACD or ICD at 26 weeks with immune modulation therapy (IMT&#xD;
      using the Celacade™ system, Vasogen Inc.) compared to placebo and no measurable improvement&#xD;
      in quality of life with IMT compared to placebo. However, there was a significant decrease in&#xD;
      CRP (high sensitivity assay) in) in the IMT group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion:&#xD;
      Immune modulation therapy did not improve walking distance in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease but the decrease in CRP suggests a biologic effect of IMT and&#xD;
      will warrant further study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage II) due to peripheral arterial&#xD;
             disease, which has been stable (both clinically and therapeutically) for 3 months&#xD;
             prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) in at least one limb ≤ 0.85. For diabetics with&#xD;
             falsely elevated ABI due to non-compressible tibial arteries, the toe brachial index&#xD;
             (TBI) will be measured and has to be ≤ 0.7 at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An absolute claudication distance (ACD) of≥ 50 meters confirmed on two consecutive&#xD;
             visits at least one week apart. The change in ACD between the two consecutive&#xD;
             assessments (i.e. Visit 0 and 1 or Visit 1 and 2) has to be within ± 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Walking distance must be limited by IC, which will be confirmed by a ≥ 20% decrease in&#xD;
             ABI in the worse claudicating limb immediately following the screening treadmill&#xD;
             tests. The worse claudicating limb (or &quot;index leg&quot;) will be defined either as (1) the&#xD;
             most symptomatic leg or (2) the leg with the lowest resting ABI and documented prior&#xD;
             to the first (pre-screening) treadmill test. Post-exercise and resting ABIs will be&#xD;
             compared within the same leg at each screening treadmill test. This criterion will not&#xD;
             apply to diabetics with non-compressible tibial arteries (i.e. only the resting TBI&#xD;
             will be measured in these patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential not using accepted&#xD;
             contraceptive methods, as assessed by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history or physical examination&#xD;
             at the screening assessment that would interfere with the objectives of the study or&#xD;
             that would, in the investigator's opinion, preclude safe completion of the study.&#xD;
             Abnormal findings could include: hepatitis, HIV infection, AIDS, other immune&#xD;
             deficiency syndromes, serious active infections, gastrointestinal tract bleeding or&#xD;
             any severe or acute concomitant illness or injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) defined as ischemic rest pain, ulcerative lesions or&#xD;
             gangrene [Rutherford-Becker Classification Grade II-III (corresponding to Fontaine&#xD;
             stage III-IV)].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous endovascular or surgical revascularization within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry or anticipated during the first 6 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active inflammatory vascular disease (e.g. Buerger's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major peripheral neuropathies, including severe diabetic neuropathy to the extent that&#xD;
             it may interfere with the evaluation of claudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that limits walking ability, other than claudication (e.g. arthritis,&#xD;
             angina, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy within five years prior to screening. Basal cell carcinoma, provided that&#xD;
             it is neither infiltrating nor sclerosing, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix are&#xD;
             exemptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to sodium citrate, or any &quot;caine&quot; type of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroids, antineoplastics and immunosuppressive drug therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), DNA depleting or&#xD;
             cytotoxic drugs taken within 4 weeks prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking medications indicated for intermittent claudication (i.e.&#xD;
             pentoxifylline or cilostazol). To be eligible, patient must not have taken these&#xD;
             medications for at least 8 weeks prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another study involving an investigational or licensed drug or device&#xD;
             in the 4 weeks preceding enrollment or during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous Celacade™ treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical, social, or geographical factor, which would make it unlikely that&#xD;
             the patient will comply with study procedures (e.g. alcohol abuse, lack of permanent&#xD;
             residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, and a history of&#xD;
             non-compliance).&#xD;
