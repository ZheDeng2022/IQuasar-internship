  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with either&#xD;
      cetuximab or bortezomib works as first-line therapy in treating patients with stage III or&#xD;
      stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to&#xD;
      them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bortezomib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      docetaxel together with either cetuximab or bortezomib may be effective as first-line therapy&#xD;
      in treating non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time between study entry&#xD;
      and disease progression or death, for each of the two combination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate of each regimen. II. To evaluate the overall&#xD;
      survival distributions associated with each regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the toxicities of each regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cetuximab IV&#xD;
      over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable&#xD;
      disease after 4 courses receive cetuximab alone as above in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1,&#xD;
      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable disease after 4&#xD;
      courses receive bortezomib alone as above in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months&#xD;
      for 2 years, and then every 4 months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients (31 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 6-11 months.&#xD;
