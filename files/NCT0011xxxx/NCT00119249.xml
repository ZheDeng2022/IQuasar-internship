  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. This phase II trial is studying how well&#xD;
      sorafenib works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the efficacy of sorafenib, in terms of anti-tumor effects and proportion of&#xD;
      clinical responses, in patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III or stage IV&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate the efficacy of this drug with the presence of mutant or wild-type BRAF gene in&#xD;
      tumors of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate serum&#xD;
      cryptic collagen epitopes with the extent of tumor burden, invasion, and metastasis in&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the potential of serum cryptic collagen epitopes to serve as a surrogate marker&#xD;
      for monitoring the course of disease in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of BRAF&#xD;
      gene mutation in tumor sample (yes vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-74 patients (13-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 5.2-18.5 months.&#xD;
