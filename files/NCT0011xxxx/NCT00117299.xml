      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor,&#xD;
      PTK787/ZK222584, in the treatment of GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) that is resistant&#xD;
      to imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). The study participants are required to have histologically&#xD;
      confirmed GIST with prior imatinib treatment for metastatic GIST. is administered orally 1250&#xD;
      mg/day. Six patients will first enter the study. If clinical benefit is obtained in &gt;1 of 6&#xD;
      patients, 9 and 30 additional patients will be entered into the protocol in two stages (a&#xD;
      maximum of 45 patients will be entered). Patients who benefit from the study treatment will&#xD;
      be treated with PTK787/ZK222584 until treatment failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study of PTK787/ZK222584 designed to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of PTK787/ZK222584 in the treatment of imatinib-resistant GIST. The PTK787/ZK222584&#xD;
      dose used is 1250 mg daily. Six patients will first enter the study using a two-stage&#xD;
      approach. If clinical benefit is obtained in &gt;1 of 6 patients, 9 and 30 additional patients&#xD;
      will be entered into the protocol (a maximum total number of 45 patients will be entered).&#xD;
      Clinical benefit is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following 3 measures: 1)&#xD;
      objective response to PTK787 (a confirmed or unconfirmed partial response [PR] or a complete&#xD;
      response [CR]); 2) metabolic response defined as &gt;50% decrease in the standardized uptake&#xD;
      value (SUV) of FDG uptake in &gt;1 FDG-avid lesions in one or more of the patients; or 3)&#xD;
      stabilized disease for 3 months or longer accompanied by symptomatic or performance status&#xD;
      improvement. Medical history, current medical conditions, weight, height, and an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram are recorded prior to the study entry. Other baseline examinations include&#xD;
      a chest X-ray, hematologic tests, a coagulation panel, serum chemistries, urine analysis, a&#xD;
      serum pregnancy test and a radiological assessment of the tumor. Tumor response is monitored&#xD;
      with imaging at 4- to 8-week intervals. Hematological tests and serum chemistries are&#xD;
      evaluated at 1- to 4-week intervals, and adverse events are collected continuously. Research&#xD;
      blood tests are collected at the times of tumor evaluations. Dose adjustments are carried out&#xD;
      as per the protocol. Patients who benefit from the study treatment will be treated with&#xD;
      PTK787/ZK222584 until treatment failure.&#xD;
