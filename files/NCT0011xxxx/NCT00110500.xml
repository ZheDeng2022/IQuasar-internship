        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus Type I or II for at least 12 months&#xD;
             prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received a diagnosis of mild to moderate sensori-motor diabetic neuropathy from a&#xD;
             neurologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system) or&#xD;
             endocrinologist (a doctor who specializes in diabetes). This type of neuropathy is a&#xD;
             loss of sensation and muscle function that occurs in the legs and hands in a stocking&#xD;
             and glove distribution. Subjects with diabetic neuropathy that results in loss of&#xD;
             sensation or muscle function in only one nerve and results in loss of nerve function&#xD;
             of the blood vessels and causes low blood pressure, will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be an adult male or female between the ages of 18 and 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able and willing to read and sign a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing to participate in the study as an outpatient and make the required visits&#xD;
             to the study center during the treatment and after the treatment periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet and follow the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have abnormal signs of sensori-motor diabetic neuropathy based on a rating scale that&#xD;
             is based on questions and a physical exam called the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower&#xD;
             Limb (NIS-LL) clinical scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have abnormal results on specialized nerve testing in the legs. The study doctor or&#xD;
             study staff will do this specialized nerve testing with a Nerve Conduction Test and&#xD;
             Quantitative Sensory Testing, both of which you will read about below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable sural nerve responses in both legs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an HgbA1C level that is 10% or lower, with stable blood sugar control for at&#xD;
             least 3 months. The study doctor will check this.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an eye exam by an eye doctor to rule out the presence of abnormal growth of blood&#xD;
             vessels or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (eye complications of diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a normal, complete blood count. The study doctor will check this.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a normal urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, be: (a) postmenopausal or (b) surgically sterile or (c) use two forms of&#xD;
             birth control and have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days of receiving the study&#xD;
             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If male and able to make a female pregnant, use an accepted form of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had up-to-date screening tests for cancer as recommended by the American Cancer&#xD;
             Society. These tests include a PSA blood test for prostate cancer (for males over age&#xD;
             45), a pap smear for cervical cancer (for females), a mammogram (for females over age&#xD;
             40), and a flexible sigmoidoscopy for colon cancer (if over age 50). To be in this&#xD;
             study, you must have written proof of normal test results within the last 12 months.&#xD;
             If these screening tests show you have cancer, you will not be able to be in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a normal chest X-ray without evidence of heart enlargement or congestive heart&#xD;
             failure.&#xD;

             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have chronic foot or leg ulcers for &gt;1 month, gangrene in the lower extremity, or any&#xD;
             previous amputation of the lower extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have symptoms of intermittent claudication (or leg pain during exercise associated&#xD;
             with peripheral artery disease) and/or an ankle brachial index (or a calculation of&#xD;
             the difference between arm and leg blood pressures) of less than &lt; 0.75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of cancer within the past 10 years (except curable non-melanoma cancer&#xD;
             of the skin, superficial bladder cancer in complete remission, or any other cancer&#xD;
             that has been in complete remission for at least 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a condition that increases your risk of bleeding (for example, hemophilia or a&#xD;

             intestines, rectum) within the last 12 months. If you have ever had bleeding from the&#xD;
             large intestine or rectum, you will need to have had a negative colonoscopy after that&#xD;
             episode and within the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other condition that, in the opinion of the study doctor, might cause&#xD;
             problems during the study (for example, affect your health or study test results).&#xD;
&#xD;

             administered directly into a vein. If you had an infection in the past, you must not&#xD;
             be receiving treatment for that infection within 2 weeks of receiving the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have abnormal kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Require any drug that depresses your immune system (such as methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine) when you receive the study drug and for 30 days&#xD;
             afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known disorder that affects your immune system (such as HIV/AIDS, HBV, HCV,&#xD;
             sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or autoimmune disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be using oral, injectable, or intravenous (directly into the vein) corticosteroids&#xD;
