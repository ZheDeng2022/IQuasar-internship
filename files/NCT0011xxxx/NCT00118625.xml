      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities&#xD;
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats&#xD;
      the underlying allergic disease. Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal&#xD;
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to tree pollen (hay fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerability and immunogenicity of Tree MATA (allergen modified with glutaraldehyde and&#xD;
      adsorbed to tyrosine) with and without MPL adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A, extracted from a&#xD;
      bacterial cell surface) is being investigated in this double-blind, randomized Phase IIa&#xD;
      study in volunteers allergic to birch and hazel and alder pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will assess residual allergenicity of the modified birch and hazel&#xD;
      and alder pollen in the product Tree MATA MPL using skin prick testing in volunteers allergic&#xD;
      to birch and hazel and alder pollen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is a nasal inflammatory disorder initiated by an immunoglobulin-E (IgE)&#xD;
      mediated hypersensitivity to allergens. When a patient is exposed to an allergen to which he&#xD;
      or she is sensitive, the allergen cross-links with the IgE antibody, which is bound to the&#xD;
      surface of tissue mast cells. This cross-linking then triggers the release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      substances, such as histamine and eicosanoids, and is known as the early response. In a skin&#xD;
      prick test, this reaction produces a wheal-and-flare response. Normally, systemic exposure to&#xD;
      an allergen also leads to the more prolonged late reaction, in which eosinophils, basophils,&#xD;
      and activated T cells are recruited to the site of exposure. The recruited T cells also&#xD;
      secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5, typically associated&#xD;
      with helper T cells type 2 (TH2), which further propagate the inflammatory cascade.&#xD;
      Typically, the early response occurs within 15 to 30 minutes (but as quickly as a few&#xD;
      seconds) and usually resolves within 1 to 3 hours, and the late response occurs within 6 to&#xD;
      12 hours and resolves in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic vaccination (AV), also referred to as immunotherapy or allergen-specific&#xD;
      immunotherapy (SIT), is a curative approach that is available for allergic diseases, which&#xD;
      directly treats the underlying disease. AV is the practice of administering gradually&#xD;
      increasing quantities of an allergen extract to an allergic patient to ameliorate the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the subsequent exposure to the causative allergen. AV is believed to&#xD;
      exert its beneficial effects on the immune system, at least in part, by modifying the&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte response to subsequent natural allergen exposure. AV has been shown to inhibit&#xD;
      both early and late responses to allergen exposure. AV acts on T cells to modify peripheral&#xD;
      and mucosal TH2 responses to an allergen in favor of helper T cell type 1 (TH1) responses.&#xD;
      One of the hallmarks of successful AV is the redressing of a &quot;healthy&quot; TH1/TH2-balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although efficacious, immunotherapy is generally considered a long-term disease modifying&#xD;
      measure that requires months to years of treatment, entails multiple injection regimens and&#xD;
      involves some risk for adverse immune reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergy Therapeutics (AT) has developed formulations over the years to increase both the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of such treatment. In particular, the allergen extract has been&#xD;
      chemically modified with glutaraldehyde and formulated with L-tyrosine to act as a depot&#xD;
      adjuvant and provide a slow release of the allergens or modified allergens. This increases&#xD;
      the safety profile and enhances the efficacy-associated immunological changes. Efficacy could&#xD;
      be further improved by adding the immunological adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tree MATA MPL is designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only three&#xD;
      escalating dose injections, in contrast to the longer schedules currently in use. It is&#xD;
      designed to have all of the current advantages of an allergy vaccine, which can modify the&#xD;
      underlying disease process, as opposed to pharmacological control, which treats only the&#xD;
      symptoms. The vaccine will also be safer to use than a formulation containing a similar mass&#xD;
      of unmodified allergen extract due to the propensity of the unmodified allergen extract to&#xD;
      cause severe local allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, because of its reduced reactivity with&#xD;
      IgE antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tolerability and immunogenicity of Tree MATA with and without MPL adjuvant is being&#xD;
      investigated in this double-blind, randomized Phase IIa study in volunteers allergic to birch&#xD;
      and hazel and alder pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will assess residual allergenicity of the modified birch and hazel&#xD;
      and alder pollen in the product Tree MATA MPL using skin prick testing in volunteers allergic&#xD;
      to birch and hazel and alder pollen.&#xD;
