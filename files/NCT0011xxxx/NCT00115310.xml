      This study is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, controlled multi-center evaluation of the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of NGX-4010 for the treatment of PHN. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will have moderate to severe pain from PHN, with average NPRS scores during screening of 3 to&#xD;
      9 (inclusive). Painful areas of up to 1000 square centimeters will be treated during a single&#xD;
      treatment administration in this study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive active&#xD;
      NGX-4010 patches or low-concentration control patches that are identical in appearance,&#xD;
      according to a 1:1 allocation scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be on stable chronic oral pain medication regimens, but currently will not be&#xD;
      using any topical pain medications on the affected areas. NPRS scores for the average pain in&#xD;
      the past 24 hours will be recorded daily in the evening, beginning on the day of the&#xD;
      Screening Visit (usually on Day -14). Subjects will continue to record NPRS scores in a&#xD;
      take-home diary from the evening on the day of treatment through the evening before the&#xD;
      Termination Visit at Week 12. Subjects will return for interim follow-up visits at Weeks 4&#xD;
      and 8 following study treatment.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of PHN, with at least 6 months of pain since shingles vesicle crusting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average NPRS scores for PHN-associated pain during screening period of 3 to 9&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 21&#xD;
             days prior to Study Patch Application Visit (Day 0) and willing to maintain&#xD;
             medications at same stable dose(s) and schedule throughout study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test, within 7 days of Study Patch Application&#xD;
             Visit&#xD;

          -  All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain&#xD;
             from participating in a conception process during the study (or, in the event of early&#xD;
             termination from the study, for 30 days following experimental drug exposure)&#xD;
