    <textblock>
      The purposes of this pilot project are to (a) determine changes in calf muscle blood flow and&#xD;
      energy supply resulting from calf muscle exercise, and (b) to determine changes in these&#xD;
      variables resulting from exercise training (walking and calf muscle exercise). This is a&#xD;
      pilot study to prepare for a larger project in the future. Exercise and exercise training&#xD;
      should increase blood flow and energy supply to the calf muscles.&#xD;

      Specific Objectives: 1.Develop an appropriate graded calf exercise test protocol for&#xD;
      evaluating perfusion and metabolism during exercise in subjects with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD), 2.compare perfusion in gastroc-soleus and tibialis anterior muscles during&#xD;
      exercise and recovery from exercise, and to compare metabolism in those muscles during&#xD;
      exercise, 3.compare the perfusion during exercise and recovery between groups with and&#xD;
      without PAD, and to compare metabolism during exercise between groups with and without PAD,&#xD;
      4.estimate sample sizes and effect sizes for a future clinical trial to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of walking and calf muscle exercise training for improving calf muscle perfusion and&#xD;
      metabolism. 5.determine the sensitivity and specificity of the PET exercise test in&#xD;
      classifying subjects into groups with or without PAD, and 6. determine the test-retest&#xD;
      reliability coefficients of perfusion and metabolic measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of subjects will participate in this study. Group I (n=25 subjects with PAD) will&#xD;
      undergo two sets of assessments. Each assessment will consist of completing three&#xD;
      questionnaires, two exercise tests, and one PET scan session. Additionally, they will receive&#xD;
      one MRI of the legs. Then they will participate in a three-month exercise training&#xD;
      intervention consisting of treadmill walking and calf muscle exercise. Finally, they will&#xD;
      repeat one set of assessments (listed above with MRI). Group II (n=25 healthy control&#xD;
      subjects) will undergo two sets of assessments. Each assessment will consist of three&#xD;
      questionnaires, two submaximal exercise tests, one MRI, and one PET scan session (no exercise&#xD;
      tests). Additionally they will receive only one MRI. They will not participate in an exercise&#xD;
      training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design The project is a pilot study that is both cross-sectional and&#xD;
      longitudinal in nature. The initial baseline measurement sessions will allow comparisons of&#xD;
      acute perfusion and metabolic physiologic responses between two groups of subjects (with and&#xD;
      without PAD). Duplicate testing for each subject will allow assessment of the test-retest&#xD;
      reliability of the measurements. The PAD subjects' perfusion and metabolic responses will be&#xD;
      assessed again after three months of exercise training (walking and calf muscle exercise).&#xD;
      While not a definitive clinical trial of the exercise training intervention, the results&#xD;
      should provide estimates of sample and effect sizes to design a more definitive future&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Recruitment and Sampling: Fifty different subjects (N=50) will participate in the&#xD;
      project, reflecting the available veteran patient population. The sample will include&#xD;
      primarily men, of any age and ethnicity. Twenty-five subjects will have PAD and will be&#xD;
      identified and recruited via convenience sampling primarily from the Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation (PM&amp;R) Outpatient Clinic, Diabetes Clinic, and Peripheral Vascular Clinic at&#xD;
      the VA West Los Angeles Healthcare Center (VAWLAHC). Other participants may be recruited from&#xD;
      other VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System locations, specifically the Los Angeles&#xD;
      Ambulatory Care Center and the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center. Twenty-five &quot;normal&quot; healthy&#xD;
      control subjects will be recruited via convenience sampling from well veterans and the&#xD;
      general community; the two groups will be matched on gender and age. We plan to enroll 25&#xD;
      subjects with PAD for the three-month exercise training intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Consent: Research staff will recruit and interview prospective subjects.&#xD;
      Prospective subjects who meet all initial inclusion and exclusion criteria will be requested&#xD;
      to review and sign the IRB-approved informed consent form and will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      project. A physician will physically examine prospective subjects and provide medical&#xD;
      clearance prior to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments and Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening and consent, the assessment process will progress in four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires to evaluate walking impairment, physical activity, and general health.&#xD;
           The information will be used to better characterize the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise tolerance testing to demonstrate claudication symptoms in PAD subjects during&#xD;
           both treadmill walking and calf muscle exercise and to assess functional changes&#xD;
           resulting from training. The control subjects will also perform the exercise tests, but&#xD;
           these tests will be submaximal and without pain. The data will be used for comparison to&#xD;
           the data from PAD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the legs to measure popliteal artery diameter and&#xD;
           document locations of individual muscles and muscle groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PET-exercise testing to measure muscle perfusion and glucose metabolism during calf&#xD;
           muscle exercise and recovery.&#xD;
