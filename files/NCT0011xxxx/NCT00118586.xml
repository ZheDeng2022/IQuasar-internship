      This study will look for abnormalities in a brain of persons affected with spasmodic&#xD;
      dysphonia, a form of movement disorder that involves involuntary &quot;spasms&quot; of the muscles in&#xD;
      the vocal folds causing breaks of speech and affecting voice quality. The causes of this&#xD;
      disorder are not known. The study will compare results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in&#xD;
      people with spasmodic dysphonia and in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with adductor or abductor spasmodic dysphonia and healthy volunteers may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and a&#xD;
      test called nasolaryngoscopy. For this test, the inside of the subject's nose is sprayed with&#xD;
      a decongestant, and a small, flexible tube called a nasolaryngoscope is passed through the&#xD;
      nose to the back of the throat to allow examination of the larynx (voice box). During this&#xD;
      procedure, the subject is asked to perform tasks such as talking, singing, whistling, and&#xD;
      saying prolonged vowels. The nasolaryngoscope is connected to a camera to record the&#xD;
      movements of the vocal folds during these tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants then undergo MRI of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and&#xD;
      radio waves instead of x-rays to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For this test, the&#xD;
      subject lies on a table that slides into the MRI scanner, a narrow metal cylinder, wearing&#xD;
      ear plugs to muffle loud knocking sound that occurs during the scan. During MRI anatomical&#xD;
      images of the brain are obtained. Subject may be asked to participate in up to two scanning&#xD;
      sessions. Each session takes about 1-1/2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be asked to volunteer for a brain donation program which is optional.&#xD;
      Information gained from donated tissue may lead to better treatments and potential cures for&#xD;
      spasmodic dysphonia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is a focal dystonia affecting the neural control of the laryngeal&#xD;
      musculature for speech production. Although the clinical symptoms of SD have been described,&#xD;
      the underlying pathological mechanisms remain unknown. Treatment strategies are of short&#xD;
      benefit and expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is considered a behavioral voice disorder because many cases&#xD;
      benefit from behavioral therapy. The etiology of this vocal misuse disorder remains unknown&#xD;
      but is not considered neurological and is thought to differ from SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vocal tremor (VT) is a form of benign essential tremor. In less severely affected persons,&#xD;
      vocal tremor is action-induced and occurs during vocalization only. In more severe cases, the&#xD;
      tremor can be present also during exhalation and whispering and affect other structures, such&#xD;
      as the velum and pharynx. This is also considered a neurological disorder but may differ in&#xD;
      character from SD. Both these disorders can co-occur with SD but can also occur&#xD;
      independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomical characteristics of pre- and postmortem brains in patients with SD, MTD and VT&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers will be investigated using imaging and neurohistological techniques to&#xD;
      provide insight into the pathogenesis of SD. Identification of the neuropathological basis of&#xD;
      SD and how it differs from other voice disorders would enhance our understanding of the&#xD;
      neurological basis of SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective in this study is to investigate anatomical and morphological characteristics of&#xD;
      premortem and postmortem brains from persons with SD, and determine how it differs from other&#xD;
      voice disorders such as MTD and VT using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI), and neurohistological techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to examine persons referred with a diagnosis of SD, MTD, and VT to confirm whether&#xD;
      they have symptoms of the disorder and to identify research volunteers who are without&#xD;
      neurological, psychiatric, or head and neck disorders. The research volunteers could be&#xD;
      spouses of persons with SD, MTD, and VT without a familial relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history study. In the premortem part of the study persons with SD, MTD, and&#xD;
      VT and research volunteers will be screened for eligibility for the study. Brain MRI using a&#xD;
      3T scanner will be performed for volumetric reconstruction of gray matter on the first 60&#xD;
      participants in both the patient and research volunteer groups. In addition, high-resolution&#xD;
      MRI using 7T scanner will be obtained to identify focal structural differences on individual&#xD;
      basis in the same 20 SD patients compared to 20 controls. DTI will be conducted for&#xD;
      visualization of white matter tracts in 25 subjects per group. The remaining subjects will&#xD;
      only undergo the screening and anatomical MRI scans prior to brain donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postmortem phase, the study will employ MRI of the postmortem brain specimens for&#xD;
      diagnostic purposes. Brain and laryngeal tissue will be processed histologically to quantify&#xD;
      morphological abnormalities between the two groups. Because it is estimated that about 48% of&#xD;
      subjects who participate in the main MRI study will also grant consent for brain/larynx&#xD;
      donation, maximum of additional 30 subjects per group are to be recruited for the study. Many&#xD;
      of the previous patients who have participated in Laryngeal and Speech Section protocols in&#xD;
      the past will be contacted to determine if they would be interested in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Premortem imaging techniques will determine if there are differences in the brain&#xD;
           anatomy of patients with SD compared to MTD, VT and to research volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Volumetric reconstruction of gray matter regions involved in voice production;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Visualization of the white matter tracts between brain regions of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postmortem MRI will identify discrepancies between premortem and postmortem brains of&#xD;
           the same persons with SD in comparisons to MTD, VT and to research volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Microscopic examination of brain sections will determine whether abnormalities can be&#xD;
           found in the cortical and subcortical regions involved in voice production in persons&#xD;
           with SD that differ from patients with MTD and VT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Microscopic examination of the larynx will determine distribution of motor and sensory&#xD;
           nerve endings in persons with SD and in patients with MTD and VT and controls.&#xD;
