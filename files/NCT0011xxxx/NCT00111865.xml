      Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to determine the effect of aerobic&#xD;
      exercise training (AET) on change in quality of life (QoL) in lymphoma survivors receiving&#xD;
      and not receiving chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are to determine the effects of AET on&#xD;
      changes in psychosocial outcomes, cardiopulmonary fitness, body composition, and treatment&#xD;
      completion rates.&#xD;

      Design and Setting: The study is a randomized controlled trial. It will be conducted at the&#xD;
      University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants will be 120 lymphoma survivors diagnosed with either non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL) or Hodgkin's disease (HD) and receiving or not receiving at least 8 weeks of&#xD;
      chemotherapy at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta. Participants will be&#xD;
      stratified by disease type (indolent NHL versus aggressive NHL versus HD) and planned&#xD;
      chemotherapy protocol (no chemotherapy versus &lt; 16 weeks versus &gt; 16 weeks), and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either a 12 week exercise program or usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Participants will be recruited from the Cross Cancer Institute. The eligibility&#xD;
      criteria include medical, demographic, and logistic criterion, and are focused on internal&#xD;
      validity as well as external validity. Eligibility criteria for the study are: (1)&#xD;
      histologically confirmed lymphoma cancer, (2) 18 years of age or older, (3) not receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy or scheduled to receive at least 2 cycles (8 weeks) of chemotherapy, excluding&#xD;
      high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, (4) approval of the treating oncologist,&#xD;
      (5) able to understand and provide written informed consent in English, (6) no uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension, (7) no uncontrolled cardiac illness, (8) no active psychiatric condition, and&#xD;
      (9) no contraindications to exercise as determined by a maximal fitness test conducted by a&#xD;
      certified fitness consultant (CFC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: We have recruited 122 participants to the trial. The study is now closed to&#xD;
      accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place at the treatment or follow-up consultation with the medical or&#xD;
      radiation oncologist. Interested survivors will receive an information package from the&#xD;
      oncologist and a follow-up telephone call from the project director who will explain the&#xD;
      study further and answer any questions. All individuals who are interested in participating&#xD;
      in the study will: (a) be asked to provide informed consent, (b) complete a self administered&#xD;
      questionnaire, and (c) be scheduled for a maximal physical fitness test, a dual-x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan, and a blood draw. The physical fitness test will determine final&#xD;
      eligibility for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The exercise group will perform supervised stationary cycle ergometer exercise&#xD;
      3 days/week for 12 weeks and be progressed from 15 to 45 minutes and 60% to 80% of their VO2&#xD;
      reserve over the course of the intervention. The usual care group will be asked not to begin&#xD;
      a structured exercise training program during the next 12 weeks and will receive the exercise&#xD;
      for 4 weeks following the postintervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points: The primary end point is change in the Trial Outcome Index of QoL between&#xD;
      baseline and postintervention. QoL will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer&#xD;
      Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) scale (Trial Outcome Index: Physical Well-being, Functional&#xD;
      Well-being and Anemia Subscales). Secondary end points are changes in psychosocial outcomes,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness, body composition, and treatment completion rates. Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      fitness will be assessed by a graded exercise test using gas exchange analysis. Body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed by body mass index and a DEXA scan. Treatment completion rates&#xD;
      will be assessed as the number of chemotherapy cycles received divided by the number planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Sample size calculation is based on the primary end point. A clinically&#xD;
      important difference (CID) in the TOI of the FACT-An is 6.0 points. Sixty participants in&#xD;
      each group will allow us to detect a 10.0 point difference in between group changes with a&#xD;
      power of .80 and a two-tailed a of .05 (standard deviation = 18.0 points).&#xD;
