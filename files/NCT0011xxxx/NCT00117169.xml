  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis for this study is that the diagnostic approach of pulmonary embolism (PE)&#xD;
      by evaluation of clinical probability, D-dimer test dosage and multi-detector helical&#xD;
      computed tomography (hCT) is as safe as the classical &quot;approach&quot; using clinical probability,&#xD;
      D-dimer test, lower limb compression ultrasonography and multi-detector helical computed&#xD;
      tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second hypothesis involves evaluating the role of searching distal, i.e. infrapopliteal,&#xD;
      deep venous thromboses (DVTs) in the diagnostic approach of pulmonary embolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suspected pulmonary embolism [PE] is a frequent clinical problem and remains a diagnostic&#xD;
      challenge. The diagnostic approach of PE relies on sequential diagnostic tests, such as&#xD;
      plasma D-dimer measurement, lower limb compression ultrasonography, ventilation-perfusion&#xD;
      lung scan or helical computed tomography [hCT] and pulmonary angiography. In addition, the&#xD;
      diagnostic workup is usually stratified according to the clinical probability of pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-generation hCTs were based on a single-detector technique and had a limited 70%&#xD;
      sensitivity. Moreover, in two recent outcome studies, a proximal deep venous thrombosis&#xD;
      diagnosed by lower limb compression ultrasonography was found in 15% of patients with a&#xD;
      normal single-detector hCT. However, in management studies, the association of a normal lower&#xD;
      limb compression ultrasonography and a normal single-detector hCT has been proved safe to&#xD;
      rule out PE in patients with a non-high clinical probability, with a less than 2% rate of&#xD;
      thromboembolic events during a 3-month follow-up in patients left untreated based on that&#xD;
      combination. Hence, lower limb compression ultrasonography must be combined with a&#xD;
      single-detector CT to safely rule out pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, the multi-detector hCT has become widely available. These new scanners allow&#xD;
      one to improve image definition and to diminish slice thickness without increasing&#xD;
      acquisition time and, hence, to better visualize the segmental and sub-segmental pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries. In a recent study [CTEPm], the investigators evaluated the performances of a&#xD;
      multi-detector hCT. The rate of false negative results, assessed by the rate of patients with&#xD;
      proximal DVT on ultrasonography and a negative hCT, was much lower using the multi-detector&#xD;
      CT [0.9%, 95% confidence interval: 0.3-3.3%] than with the single-detector technique [15%].&#xD;
      This raises the possibility that hCT might be used as a single test to rule out PE in&#xD;
      patients with an elevated D-dimer level. Indeed, ELISA plasma D-dimer measurement in patients&#xD;
      with a non-high clinical probability of PE remains a logical first step since it safely rules&#xD;
      out PE in approximately 30% of patients. Such a strategy should now be validated in a&#xD;
      prospective randomised outcome study to compare its safety and cost-effectiveness with that&#xD;
      of a previously validated strategy combining D-dimer, lower limb compression ultrasonography&#xD;
      and hCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators plan to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two&#xD;
      distinct diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism in emergency center patents&#xD;
      in a non-inferiority trial. The strategies are: 1) an algorithm based on clinical assessment,&#xD;
      D-dimer and multi-detector hCT (DD-hCT); and 2) a previously validated strategy that includes&#xD;
      lower limb compression (DD-US-hCT). The main outcome will be the rate of thromboembolic&#xD;
      events during a formal 3-month follow-up in patients not anticoagulated on the basis of a PE&#xD;
      ruled out by the diagnostic criteria in each study arm. A secondary outcome will be the costs&#xD;
      of diagnosis in each study arm, including the costs of suspected and/or confirmed&#xD;
      thromboembolic events during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators aim to prospectively and pragmatically validate the revised&#xD;
      Geneva score for assessing the clinical probability of PE by using it in the sequential&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up for PE. Classification performances of this score will be assessed by&#xD;
      checking its capacity to discriminate between patients having a low, intermediate, or high&#xD;
      probability of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in a nested study, the investigators aim to compare the clinical usefulness of a&#xD;
      complete lower limb compression ultrasonography versus a classical &quot;4-points ultrasonography&quot;&#xD;
      (ultrasonography of the proximal veins) in the patients from the ultrasound arm of the study&#xD;
      (DD-US-hCT). Indeed, preliminary data indicate that complete ultrasound detects a DVT in a&#xD;
      higher proportion of patients with PE than proximal ultrasound (US) and, hence, has the&#xD;
      potential for further limiting the requirement for chest imaging in patients with suspected&#xD;
      PE. Because finding a distal DVT is of uncertain clinical significance, such a finding will&#xD;
      not be reported to the clinicians in charge of the patient and those patients will undergo a&#xD;
      helical CT and be treated (or not) according to the CT result. Outcome measurements will be&#xD;
      the number of patients in whom hCT could have been avoided by ruling in the diagnosis of PE&#xD;
      in the presence of a distal DVT (proportion of patients with both distal DVT on&#xD;
      ultrasonography and pulmonary embolism on multi-detector hCT) and the number of patients who&#xD;
      would have been unduly anticoagulated if considering the presence of a distal DVT in the&#xD;
      complete compression ultrasonography (proportion of patients with distal DVT on&#xD;
      ultrasonography, but without pulmonary embolism on multi-detector hCT, and without a&#xD;
      thromboembolic event during the 3 month follow-up).&#xD;
