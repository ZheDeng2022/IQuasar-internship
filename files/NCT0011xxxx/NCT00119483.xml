  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male hypogonadism is a clinical situation characterized by a low serum testosterone level in&#xD;
      combination with a diversity of symptoms and signs such as reduced libido and vitality,&#xD;
      decreased muscle mass, increased fat mass and depression. Similar symptoms in combination&#xD;
      with subnormal testosterone levels are seen in some elderly men. Low testosterone levels are&#xD;
      associated with known cardiovascular risk factors, and men with diabetes and stroke have&#xD;
      lower testosterone levels than healthy men. Even though several publications have suggested&#xD;
      that testosterone treatment in hypogonadal men may have beneficial effects, it is still&#xD;
      uncertain if testosterone substitution in the aging man is indicated. Despite this&#xD;
      uncertainty the sale of testosterone has increased enormously the last few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that older men with subnormal testosterone levels have a varying degree of&#xD;
      dysfunction/symptoms both physically and mentally, and that these dysfunction/symptoms can be&#xD;
      improved with testosterone treatment.&#xD;

      Older men and testosterone (Short version of the study protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort study &quot;How is life as an elderly man when serum testosterone is subnormal?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether subnormal testosterone levels in elderly men (60-80 years old) is&#xD;
      associated with clinical symptoms and/or disease, the investigators will ask men with normal&#xD;
      testosterone (&gt;11.3 nmol/l) and men with subnormal testosterone levels (&lt;11.3 nmol/l) who&#xD;
      participated in the last Tromsø study 2001 to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Blood pressure, clinical examination including prostate examination, blood samples&#xD;
      (testosterone, SHBG, LH, FSH, albumin and PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aproximately 350 men had subnormal testosterone levels in the last Tromsø study and the&#xD;
      researchers will try to include up to 200 men who still have subnormal testosterone levels&#xD;
      and up to 200 age matched men who still have normal testosterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms: Aging Male Symptom Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength and function: The researchers will investigate muscle strength, peak torque&#xD;
      with isokinetic dynamometry in the knee joint and muscle function (gait, balance and&#xD;
      movement); Grip Strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive function level: WAIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Memory: Wechslers Memory Scale Revised (WMS-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trail making A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attention and concentration: Knox cube&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive flexibility: Word fluency test and Stroop test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life: GHQ - 30 with Likert score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression: Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA (Lunar Prodigy): *Whole body, body composition; *Lumbar spine and hip, bone mineral&#xD;
           density&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the abdomen to distinguish intra vs. subcutaneous fat deposits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile /per oral fat load. (80 men will take part in this investigation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of the androgen receptor, especially the CAG and GGN polymorphism of the&#xD;
           androgen receptor has been associated with glucose and fat metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroendocrine regulation: LH, FSH, SHBG, estradiol, testosterone, cortisol, ACTH,&#xD;
           IGF-1, IGFBP-3, TSH, FT4, prolactin and leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions study &quot;Should subnormal testosterone levels be treated?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether older men with subnormal testosterone levels would benefit from&#xD;
      physiological testosterone supplementation, the men with subnormal testosterone levels&#xD;
      participating in the cohort study (approximately 150-200 men) will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      a one year intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blind randomized (1:1) 1-year study. First injection at inclusion, second after 6&#xD;
      weeks, the third injection after 16 weeks, the fourth at 28 weeks and the last at 40 weeks.&#xD;
      Active treatment is Nebido, 1000 mg testosteron undecanoate, a 4 ml intramuscular depot&#xD;
      injection. Schering AS will supply the study with both Nebido and placebo (containing &quot;castor&#xD;
      oil&quot; and &quot;benzyl benzoate&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be recorded in the participants CRF. Serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      reported according to regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-described procedures for the cohort study will also be performed in the&#xD;
      intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testosterone levels, hematocrit, creatinine, ALAT and PSA will be controlled at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Object variables for both the cohort and intervention study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosexual quality of life; Muscle strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle function; Body composition; Intraabdominal vs. subcutaneous fat distribution; CAG and&#xD;
      GGN polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene; Bone mineral density; Per oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test; Lipid profile/fat tolerance test; Neuropsychological test; Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      regulation Sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at the Clinical research ward at the University Hospital of North&#xD;
      Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between the groups will be assessed with non-parametrical tests (Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U-test) or ANOVA with a significant level p&lt;0.05. In the intervention study delta-values will&#xD;
      be used to assess changes during treatment and differences between the study groups. SPSS&#xD;
      will be used as statistical program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of patients to the cohort study should be completed during 2006 and the&#xD;
      intervention study should be completed during 2007.&#xD;
