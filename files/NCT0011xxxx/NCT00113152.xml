      This study will explore what may cause people with sickle cell anemia to have heart problems&#xD;
      and an increased risk of sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG), echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Holter monitoring: The patient wears a small, battery-operated device to record heart&#xD;
           rate and rhythm over 24 to 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QRST surface mapping: An EKG using 64 electrodes is done at rest and during exercise to&#xD;
           provide a detailed look at the heart and its conduction system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-rays are taken to examine the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bicycle exercise echocardiography test: Blood pressure, pulse, heart rhythm and oxygen&#xD;
           use are monitored while the patient exercises on a stationary bicycle. Ultrasound&#xD;
           pictures are also obtained during the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram: A heart ultrasound is done to check how well the heart is pumping blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary artery catheterization: A catheter (plastic tube) is inserted into a vein and&#xD;
           advanced to the chambers of the heart, through the heart valve and into the lung artery.&#xD;
           The pressures in the heart and lung blood vessels are measured while the patient is&#xD;
           resting and during exercise, with the bed tilted up and down, and after giving 500 mls&#xD;
           of fluid into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests are done to measure a hormone called brain natriuretic peptide, which can&#xD;
           increase with the development of heart failure, and nitrite, a substance that can affect&#xD;
           blood vessel dilation. Some blood is stored to test for inflammatory markers and for&#xD;
           possible future gene and protein analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI): The patient lies in a donut-shaped magnet&#xD;
           while pictures of the heart are obtained using a magnetic field and radio waves.&#xD;
           Earplugs are worn to muffle the loud sounds that occur with electrical switching of the&#xD;
           magnetic fields. A contrast agent called gadolinium may be injected to enhance the&#xD;
           quality of the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Invasive electrocardiographic (reveal) monitoring: This procedure permits study of the&#xD;
           heart rhythms over a long time period. A small device is placed just under the skin on&#xD;
           the left side of the chest. It can be left in for up to 14 months to monitor the&#xD;
           heartbeat continuously during this time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder primarily affecting groups with origins in&#xD;
      endemic malarial areas, especially those of African descent. SCA results from one of two&#xD;
      single amino-acid substitutions in beta-hemoglobin (Hb-S and Hb-C) that increases the&#xD;
      propensity for hemoglobin to polymerize, thus distorting, sickling and hemolyzing red cells.&#xD;
      Individuals homozygous for Hb-S (or double heterozygote Hb-S and Hb-C) develop sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia (SCA), while heterozygotes have sickle cell trait. SCA is characterized by chronic&#xD;
      anemia and crises of red cell sickling and ischemia that are often painful and affect several&#xD;
      organs and tissue types. SCA confers considerable disability, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual mortality from SCA has been estimated at approximately 3%. As a significant number of&#xD;
      these deaths are sudden, a cardiac cause has been suspected. However, no cardiac mechanism of&#xD;
      sudden death (SD) has been clearly identified. Recently, it has been demonstrated that SCA&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary hypertension (PAH) have a higher incidence of SD than those with&#xD;
      normal pulmonary pressures. In many patients, PAH occurs in association with elevated&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial wedge pressures and normal pulmonary arterial resistance, suggesting that&#xD;
      the PAH develops as the result of left ventricular (LV) abnormalities. Furthermore, in other&#xD;
      conditions in which PAH develops, SD occurs only at pressures considerably higher than those&#xD;
      observed in SCA. These factors suggest that PAH in SCA is a surrogate marker for, rather than&#xD;
      the cause of SD. Rather, an SCA cardiomyopathic process may provide a unifying mechanism that&#xD;
      associates moderate degrees of PAH and high risk of SD from cardiac causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to describe the extent of cardiac involvement in SCA. Specifically, we will (1)&#xD;
      describe the LV volume-pressure relations in SCA patients with and without pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension in order to determine how elevated pulmonary pressures are related to dynamic&#xD;
      filling properties of the LV; and (2) determine whether cardiac arrhythmias are common in SCA&#xD;
      patients with PAH and if they contribute to SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of SD in SCA may allow the development&#xD;
      and testing of therapies for the primary prevention of SD.&#xD;
