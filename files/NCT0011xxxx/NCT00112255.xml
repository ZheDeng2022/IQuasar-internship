    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of partner notification by general&#xD;
      practice nurses with referral to a specialist clinic for people with genital chlamydia&#xD;
      diagnosed in a community setting. We hypothesised that referral to a specialist would be more&#xD;
      effective in ensuring treatment of the sexual partners of infected people than the simpler&#xD;
      nurse-led strategy.&#xD;

      Partner notification (contact tracing) is essential to the control of sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections. Reports of new chlamydia infections have increased by 66% in the past five years.&#xD;
      A National Chlamydia Screening Programme in England, and increasing primary care provision of&#xD;
      sexual health care are part of the United Kingdom Government's strategy for tackling&#xD;
      increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections. New strategies for managing chlamydia in&#xD;
      non-specialist settings are urgently required: genitourinary medicine clinics are failing to&#xD;
      cope with their increasing workload; and 45% of cases detected in the chlamydia screening&#xD;
      pilot studies were diagnosed in general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partner notification involves informing the sexual partners of someone with a sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infection of the possibility of exposure, offering them diagnosis and treatment,&#xD;
      and providing advice about preventing future infection. In the United Kingdom, this is&#xD;
      usually done by specialist sexual health advisers in departments of genitourinary medicine.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of partner notification in non-specialist settings in developed countries&#xD;
      is not known. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      practice nurse-led partner notification with referral to a genitourinary clinic for partner&#xD;
      notification conducted by a specialist health adviser, and to compare the resources used by&#xD;
      each strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: Partner notification at the time of receiving diagnosis and treatment by general&#xD;
      practice nurses who received a one-day training course and ongoing support by telephone calls&#xD;
      or visits from a specialist adviser in sexual health, compared with referral to a&#xD;
      genitourinary medicine clinic for partner notification by a specialist adviser in sexual&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
