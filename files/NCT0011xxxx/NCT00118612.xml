  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), the administration of gradually increasing quantities&#xD;
      of an allergen extract to an allergic patient, is a curative approach which directly treats&#xD;
      the underlying allergic disease. Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal&#xD;
      specific immunotherapy for patients with an allergy to tree pollen (hay fever).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this double-blind Phase IIb study is to assess the tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of different doses of Tree MATA MPL in volunteers allergic to birch, hazel and&#xD;
      alder pollen.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tree MATAMPL (tyrosine adsorbed tree pollen allergoid with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL®)) has&#xD;
      been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with proven type I&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to cross-reacting tree pollens that cause rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis&#xD;
      with or without mild to moderate asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of different doses of Tree MATA MPL in volunteers allergic to birch, hazel and&#xD;
      alder pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty eight (68) volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three active treatments or&#xD;
      placebo to receive up to 4 subcutaneous injections of either increasing doses of Tree MATAMPL&#xD;
      or Placebo over 7 day (+1 day) interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study from screening (Visit 1) to end of study (Visit 6, Post-Treatment&#xD;
      Visit) was approximately 50 days.&#xD;
