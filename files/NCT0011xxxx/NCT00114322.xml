  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent fall/winter major depression (known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)) is a&#xD;
      prevalent and disruptive disorder whose pathophysiological basis is unknown, but several&#xD;
      hypotheses attribute a causal role to the circadian timing system. Bright white light&#xD;
      exposure via the retina has been shown to reverse the symptoms of SAD. Recent physiological&#xD;
      studies demonstrated the existence of retinal ganglion cells capable of transducing light&#xD;
      input to the retinohypothalamic tract, the primary circadian afferent in humans. This&#xD;
      retinohypothalamic system appears to be maximally sensitive to light in the 446-477nm&#xD;
      (violet/blue) range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using light-emitting diode (LED) technology, light of narrow bandwidths now can be delivered&#xD;
      from a safe, relatively inexpensive device. We propose to contrast in SAD patients the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of 468 nm LED light from a portable 11cm x 6cm&#xD;
      commercially-available device (GoLITEÔ) to a broader 400-700 nm wavelength LED-generated&#xD;
      light housed in an identical device. The broad wavelength (white) light from our LED device&#xD;
      is similar to that from cool-white fluorescent 10,000 lux devices currently the standard for&#xD;
      treatment of SAD (see e.g., Lam &amp; Levitt, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four depressed SAD outpatients will be randomized to a 3-week trial of light therapy&#xD;
      using either the narrow 468 nm LED source or the broader 400-700 nm LED source, each housed&#xD;
      in a GoLITEÔ device. Subjects will be given devices and written instruction for administering&#xD;
      daily treatments at home, 45min every (q) a.m. The devices will be described to subjects in&#xD;
      terms of wavelength but not specifically described as &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;white.&quot; Weekly depression&#xD;
      ratings and assessments of adverse effects will be obtained by a trained rater blind to the&#xD;
      treatment condition. Depressive symptoms will be rated weekly by the same trained clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-- Depressed SAD patients will demonstrate greater antidepressant therapeutic benefit&#xD;
           from the narrow-wavelength (blue) source than from the broad-wavelength (white) source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H2-- Depressed SAD patients will manifest fewer adverse effects during treatment with&#xD;
           the narrow-wavelength (blue) source than with the broad-wavelength (white) source.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discovery in the late 1970s that bright light affects neuroendocrine rhythms such as&#xD;
      melatonin secretion, and can reset the circadian pacemaker in humans, paved the way for the&#xD;
      discovery that seasonally recurrent fall/winter depressions--christened Seasonal Affective&#xD;
      Disorder (SAD)--can be treated with bright light exposure (Lewy et al., 1980; Rosenthal et&#xD;
      al., 1985). It was reasoned that seasonal rhythms of mood in humans, like other seasonal&#xD;
      physiological cycles in mammals, could be regulated by the biological &quot;clock.&quot; A series of&#xD;
      studies has demonstrated that bright light exposure does produce therapeutic effects in SAD&#xD;
      patients beyond the level achieved by placebos (Eastman et al., 1998; Lewy et al., 1998;&#xD;
      Terman et al., 1998) and that retinal exposure is required for efficacious treatment (Wehr et&#xD;
      al., 1987; Koorengevel, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to construct an action spectrum for suppression of melatonin secretion and for&#xD;
      resetting the circadian pacemaker suggest that 446-477 nm wavelengths are most potent&#xD;
      (Brainard et al., 2001; Lockley et al., 2003), which is inconsistent with rod or cone&#xD;
      mediation of the responses (Brainard, 2004). Discovery that a melanopsin-containing system of&#xD;
      retinal ganglion cells serves as a primary afferent to the hypothalamic circadian pacemaker&#xD;
      (Provencio et al., 2000; Gooley et al, 2001; Hattar et al, 2002) suggests a possible basis&#xD;
      for the potency of violet/blue light on these neuroendocrine circadian endpoints and raises&#xD;
      the possibility that light of this wavelength also might be uniquely potent for treatment of&#xD;
      SAD (Brainard, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates of SAD prevalence range from 0.4 - 9.7% of the general population in the United&#xD;
      States, depending on the survey methods and precise criteria used (Rosen et al., 1990; Blazer&#xD;
      et al., 1998). In addition to those with recurrent episodes of frank Major Depression,&#xD;
      patients with less severe &quot;sub-syndromal&quot; winter depression and those with annual&#xD;
      exacerbation of a year-round mood disorder also have been shown to benefit from light&#xD;
      treatment in fall/winter months (Kasper et al., 1989). Since the 1990s, cool-white&#xD;
      fluorescent sources capable of yielding 10,000 lux polychromatic white light have been the&#xD;
      treatment standard (Lewy et al., 1998; Terman et al., 1998; Desan et al., 2001; also see&#xD;
      e.g., Lam &amp; Levitt, 1999). Although well-tolerated, some transient adverse effects of the&#xD;
      10,000 lux white light have been reported, such as agitation or feeling &quot;wired,&quot; insomnia,&#xD;
      headache, eye or vision problems, nausea, sedation, and chest tightness (Labbate et al.,&#xD;
      1994; Kogan et al., 1998; Terman &amp; Terman, 1999). The more common of these&#xD;
      complaints--headache, eye or vision problems, and insomnia--remit rapidly after&#xD;
      discontinuation of light exposure (Oren et al., 1991), however, narrower bandwidth light if&#xD;
      more potent in antidepressant effectiveness might be administered at lower intensities and&#xD;
      thereby further reduce adverse effects and increase tolerability of the treatment (Brainard,&#xD;
      2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A between-subjects double-blind comparison of 3-weeks treatment using narrow-band LED panels&#xD;
      at blue (468 nm at 500 mW/cm2) vs red (700 nm at 15 mW/cm2) wavelengths in 24 SAD patients&#xD;
      demonstrated both greater reductions in depressive symptoms and also remission rates (54.5%&#xD;
      vs 30.8%) in favor of the blue light source (Byrne et al., 2004). Comparisons of this narrow&#xD;
      bandwidth blue LED light with white light would be of even greater clinical interest since&#xD;
      white fluorescent sources currently are the industry standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the irradiance levels emitted by commonly utilized light therapy devices, dermatologic&#xD;
      safety concerns are minimal. Similarly, thermal damage to cornea, lens or retina requires&#xD;
      milliwatt-to-watt exposure, far in excess of that emitted from the therapeutic devices.&#xD;
      Ocular safety for 10,000 lux white fluorescent sources has been assessed and comprehensive&#xD;
      ophthalmologic examinations of individuals with healthy eyes who used white-light therapy&#xD;
      daily during fall/winter months for up to 5 years did not reveal adverse effects (Gallin et&#xD;
      al., 1995; Gorman et al., 1993). Shorter wavelengths of light are of greater concern due to&#xD;
      photo-keratitis of the cornea and cataract of the lens from 180-400nm ultraviolet light, and&#xD;
      photochemical injury to the retina at 310-550 nm with a peak near 440 nm (Sliney, 2004). The&#xD;
      blue-light LED source to be utilized in the present research (Go-LITE™) was determined to&#xD;
      have an averaged radiance well below the 10-mW/cm2*sr safety limit for continuous viewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit adults, age 18-64 years, who meet diagnostic criteria for seasonal affective&#xD;
      disorder by means of public service announcements in the community. The approved announcement&#xD;
      will be released via the Partners weekly research announcement system, may be disseminated to&#xD;
      press outlets, and will be used on the voice mail menu of Dr. Anderson's SAD clinical&#xD;
      services at BWH. An informational webpage linked to the BWH website&#xD;
      (http://www.brighamandwomens.org/psychiatry/Research/sadresearch.asp) will provide more&#xD;
      detailed information and a mechanism for prospective subjects to request further information.&#xD;
      Interested individuals will be directed to a research assistant at the BWH Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Center who will answer questions regarding the study and will conduct a telephone screening&#xD;
      to assess eligibility. Those subjects found eligible and interested will be referred by the&#xD;
      research assistant for a psychological screening interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be enrolled by his or her written informed consent obtained by members of&#xD;
      the study staff. Following an initial telephone screening, each prospective subject will&#xD;
      undergo an in-depth psychological evaluation at BWH by the principal investigator, Janis L.&#xD;
      Anderson, PhD., or at McLean Hospital by Carol Glod, RN, Ph.D. Prior to the psychological&#xD;
      screening, Dr. Anderson or Dr. Glod will review the Screening Consent Form with the subject.&#xD;
      Dr. Anderson is an experienced clinical psychologist and Dr. Glod is an experienced doctor of&#xD;
      nursing; each is trained to consider both cognitive and emotional factors that affect the&#xD;
      ability to consent. If written informed consent is obtained on the Screening Consent Form&#xD;
      then the psychological evaluation will take place. In that evaluation meeting, Dr. Anderson&#xD;
      or Dr. Glod also will present the subject with a copy of the Study Consent Form to review and&#xD;
      take home. Subjects will be encouraged to inform their medical providers and therapists about&#xD;
      their interest in participating in the study. The meetings with Dr. Anderson or Dr. Glod will&#xD;
      be scheduled in advance; nothing in the circumstances of this protocol would require a hasty&#xD;
      decision on the part of the potential subject. Subsequent to the psychological screening for&#xD;
      prospective subjects who meet diagnostic criteria, a medical examination will be performed by&#xD;
      a doctor of Ophthalmology. If the subject is found to meet all inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      study, doctor of Ophthalmology, a licensed physician, will review the Study Consent Form and&#xD;
      obtain written informed consent for the study procedures themselves. Upon each outpatient&#xD;
      visit for the study procedures, the subject's mental status will be reassessed. However, due&#xD;
      to the nature of SAD symptoms and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the present study, we&#xD;
      do not anticipate enrolling subjects whose ability to consent would be transitory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A between-subjects double-blind trial will compare daily outpatient treatment using a narrow&#xD;
      (468 nm, 27 nm half-peak bandwidth) LED light source (GoLITE™) to a broad 400-700 nm&#xD;
      wavelength LED-generated light housed in an identical device in 24 seasonally-depressed&#xD;
      adults. Dependent variables will be severity of depression and extent of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures will not begin in the Autumn/Winter until the subject has a depression&#xD;
      rating of at least 20 on the SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorders Version; Williams et al., 1988). The SIGH-SAD is a&#xD;
      structured clinical interview for rating not only the traditional Hamilton Depression Rating&#xD;
      Scale items but also the &quot;atypical&quot; vegetative symptoms characteristic of SAD. The validity&#xD;
      of and reliability of the SIGH-SAD is well-established, and it is the preferred instrument&#xD;
      for assessing symptom severity in SAD studies (e.g., see Lam &amp; Levitt, 1999). A companion&#xD;
      instrument, the Hypomania Interview Guide for Seasonal Affective Disorder (HIGH-SAD) also&#xD;
      will be administered. A rater, who will be blind to the treatment condition of the subjects,&#xD;
      will administer the SIGH-SAD and HIGH-SAD prior to and for each week during the 3-wk trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will begin treatment when post-treatment SIGH-SAD depression score ≥ 20. Dr.&#xD;
      Anderson or Dr. Glod will meet with each subject to provide the light device and instruction&#xD;
      for its outpatient use as detailed below. The subject will be asked to sign a written&#xD;
      agreement for return of the light device. Subjects will use the light device and return&#xD;
      weekly for symptom ratings; each will be seen by Dr. Anderson or Dr. Glod as well. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the 3-wk trial, Dr. Anderson or Dr. Glod will meet with the subject to discuss&#xD;
      their response to light treatment and the indications for continuing light treatment through&#xD;
      the end of that winter. Subjects will be offered the opportunity to keep the same device or&#xD;
      try the other device until the end of the fall/winter season and will be followed monthly if&#xD;
      they choose to do so. Alternative treatment modalities also will be discussed and referrals&#xD;
      for follow-up care provided as indicated. All forms of SAD treatment will cease by June 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAD is diagnosed on the basis of history and a definitive diagnosis is difficult to make in&#xD;
      adolescents. In addition, their symptom profile differs from that seen in adults which would&#xD;
      make assessment using any single measure difficult and would require a substantially larger&#xD;
      sample size. Therefore in this preliminary investigation we propose to recruit individuals&#xD;
      between the ages of 18-64. Because the safety of light treatment in pregnancy has not been&#xD;
      established, and because mood effects of pregnancy and recent delivery would complicate&#xD;
      assessment of treatment response in this 3-wk trial, only nonpregnant, non-lactating women&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will be by public means and no one will be excluded on the basis of race, gender,&#xD;
      ethnic background, or other demographic factors. Dr. Anderson is responsible for outpatient&#xD;
      monitoring of light treatment and is only fluent in English. Therefore, if potential subjects&#xD;
      do not understand English it will be necessary to have available a bilingual physician in the&#xD;
      community who would be able to work with Dr. Anderson in providing outpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disclosure of Information Outside Partners:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying information will be recorded only on screening contact sheets (which will be&#xD;
      maintained under secure conditions in the Clinical Trials Center and later stored in locking&#xD;
      file cabinets in a locked research room at 221 Longwood Ave. under the control of Dr.&#xD;
      Anderson), on the signed consent forms (stored in locking file cabinets in a locked research&#xD;
      room at 221 Longwood Ave. under the control of Dr. Anderson or at McLean Hospital under the&#xD;
      control of Dr. Glod), and in emails sent within the Partners system to staff members who&#xD;
      schedule the appointments, obtain laboratory specimen; or conduct symptom ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in computer files with code number for the subjects; no identifiers&#xD;
      other than the code number will be kept in the data files nor will they be used in any&#xD;
      reports or publications concerning this research. The key for the code will be kept in&#xD;
      locking file cabinets in a locked research room at 221 Longwood Ave. under the control of Dr.&#xD;
      Anderson or at McLean Hospital under the control of Dr. Glod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any records that may be of use to other treatment providers for purposes of continuity of&#xD;
      care, whether at Partners institutions or elsewhere, will be released upon written&#xD;
      authorization of the subject or their legal representative in accordance with current&#xD;
      applicable laws and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with seasonal affective disorder may experience relief from symptoms with light&#xD;
      therapy during this study. If the treatment is effective, they may continue it with equipment&#xD;
      from and supervision by Dr. Anderson or Dr. Glod through the end of the winter season. If the&#xD;
      treatment is not effective, referrals for additional treatment will be made. However, relief&#xD;
      from depression is in no way guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood drawing. There may be some discomfort or bruising on initial insertion into a&#xD;
           vein. There is a rare possibility of developing a small blood clot, inflammation, or&#xD;
           local infection. Fainting may rarely occur in individuals very uncomfortable with blood&#xD;
           drawing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Light treatment. Safety of equipment. Light therapy with bright fluorescent light has&#xD;
           been tested in many individuals and serious irreversible adverse effects have not been&#xD;
           reported. The most common side effect of light therapy is irritability or agitation that&#xD;
           remits after termination of the light or decrease of the daily duration of exposure.&#xD;
           Participants will be carefully monitored for such side effects and light therapy&#xD;
           exposure will be decreased or eliminated if these adverse effects occur. Although light&#xD;
           treatment has been tested in pregnant women in a small number of studies, the safety of&#xD;
           light treatment in pregnant women has not been conclusively established. Female subjects&#xD;
           will be told that participation in this study may be hazardous to an embryo or fetus and&#xD;
           therefore that it is essential that adequate birth control be used while participating.&#xD;
           If they should become pregnant while in the study, they should notify the investigators&#xD;
           immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINIMIZATION OF RISKS AND SAFETY MONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to begin daily 45-min sessions of exposure to the light each&#xD;
      morning shortly after they awaken (provided it is after 6 a.m.). Written instructions will be&#xD;
      given, potential adverse effects will be discussed, and subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      telephone the supervising clinician (either Dr. Anderson or Dr. Glod) with any questions or&#xD;
      should any adverse effects occur. A telephone appointment will be scheduled for 2-3 days&#xD;
      after the first use of the light device. Patients who complain of feelings of jitteriness&#xD;
      after using the light device will be advised to reduce their duration of daily exposure to 30&#xD;
      min per day. Patients who complain of headache after using the light device each day for 2-3&#xD;
      days will be advised to return for a visit to review the procedures they are using. An&#xD;
      appointment will be scheduled for 7 days after the first use of the light device. Any patient&#xD;
      who continues to complain of headache after the first week of light exposure will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. Patients who complain of feelings of jitteriness after using the&#xD;
      light device 20 min per day will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An appointment will be scheduled for 14 days and 21 days after the first use of the light&#xD;
      device. In general, the criteria for withdrawing patients from the study are based on Axis V&#xD;
      of the DSM-IV, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). No patient with a GAF less than 50&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study, and any patient whose GAF decreases to less than 50 during&#xD;
      the course of the study will be withdrawn. This specifically includes, but is not limited to,&#xD;
      any patient reporting suicidal ideation, symptoms of psychosis, or symptoms of mania at any&#xD;
      point during the study will be withdrawn from the study and evaluated immediately by Dr.&#xD;
      Anderson or Dr. Glod for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events will be reported promptly to the Human Research Committee.&#xD;
