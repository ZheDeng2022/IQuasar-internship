  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Case management is one of the key strategies for malaria control in most endemic countries.&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria is becoming resistant to commonly used and cheap antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs such as chloroquine, amodiaquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Thus the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of new anti-malarial drugs need to be tested in sites with well-characterised&#xD;
      malariometric indices in order to make appropriate treatment policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artemisinin-based combination chemotherapies have been documented to consistently produce&#xD;
      faster relief of clinical symptoms and parasite clearance in uncomplicated falciparum malaria&#xD;
      than any other currently used antimalarial drugs. So far, artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine (AR-LM) are the only two registered fixed-dose artemisinin&#xD;
      combination chemotherapies produced at industrial scale, with good manufacturing practices&#xD;
      and already used in Africa. Several African countries, including Ghana, are therefore&#xD;
      introducing either AS-AQ or AR-LM as first-line antimalarials or evaluating the case for such&#xD;
      a change. Clearly, a direct comparison of both the safety and efficacy profiles of the two&#xD;
      combinations under different epidemiological conditions is urgently needed to guide informed&#xD;
      decisions on the most appropriate antimalarial first-line treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine combination&#xD;
      therapy, artemether-lumefantrine, and artesunate-lapdap in an open-labelled, randomised,&#xD;
      non-inferiority drug trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will inform future decisions on first- and second-line treatments for&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria with respect to efficacy and safety in Ghana.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A study funded by the GMP-LSHTM in the Kintampo district of Ghana is currently assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy of SP as part of a comprehensive process of characterising the site into the&#xD;
      patterns of seasonal dynamics of P. falciparum transmission, infection, and morbidity. The&#xD;
      initial results from this study have demonstrated a high parasitological failure rate(18%) on&#xD;
      day 14 of treatment, an indication that SP is no longer suitable for use in Ghana. Artesunate&#xD;
      combination therapies (ACTs) have been found to be efficacious and safe, producing rapid&#xD;
      clearance of parasites and malaria symptoms; they are very well tolerated. Lapdap is a newly&#xD;
      registered, relatively cheap antimalarial with short half-life and has been found to be&#xD;
      highly efficacious in strict trial conditions for treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum&#xD;
      infections in endemic sites in Africa. Despite the rapid clearance of lapdap, children&#xD;
      treated with this drug did not have higher incidence of malaria episodes than those treated&#xD;
      with SP though haematological adverse effects have been documented to be more common with&#xD;
      lapdap than with SP. At present, the fixed-dose combination regimens of&#xD;
      artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AR-LM) are the only two&#xD;
      registered artemisinin combination chemotherapies produced at industrial scale, with good&#xD;
      manufacturing practices and already used in Africa. Several African countries are introducing&#xD;
      either AS-AQ or AR-LM as first-line antimalarials or evaluating the case for such a change.&#xD;
      Ghana, has just changed its antimalarial drug policy to artesunate-amodiaquine combination&#xD;
      therapy (AS-AQ) as first line drug. The selection of this new ACT has been driven partly by&#xD;
      cost of treatment, but a critical look at the safety and efficacy of ACTs in Ghana has yet to&#xD;
      be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine combination&#xD;
      therapy (AS-AQ), Artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem), and Artesunate-lapdap) in a drug&#xD;
      non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine, versus&#xD;
      artesunate-lapdap in the treatment of children aged 6 months to ten years, infected with&#xD;
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria, at the paediatric outpatient clinic in the Kintampo&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety of artesunate-amodiaquine versus artemether-lumefantrine, versus&#xD;
      artesunate-lapdap in the treatment of children 6 months to ten years with uncomplicated&#xD;
      falciparum malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: This study is being conducted in Kintampo district in the middle belt of Ghana&#xD;
      where the investigators in the Kintampo Health Research Centre are located. Kintampo Health&#xD;
      Research Centre (KHRC), one of three research centres under the Health Research Unit (HRU) of&#xD;
      the Ghana Health Service, Ghana, lies within the forest-savannah, transitional ecological&#xD;
      zone in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised, open-labelled, non-inferiority drug trial. At the Kintampo district&#xD;
      hospital, 510 paediatric outpatients (refer sample size calculation) with uncomplicated P.&#xD;
      falciparum malaria and aged between 6 months and 10 years will be recruited and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the three study arms: (i) Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AS-AQ), (ii)&#xD;
      Artemether-Lumefantrine (AR-LM), or (iii) Artesunate-lapdap (AS-LP). The classification of&#xD;
      clinical and parasitological responses will follow the relevant WHO protocol for areas of&#xD;
      intense transmission. Follow-up, however, will be extended beyond day 14 up to day 28 to&#xD;
      increase the sensitivity of the in vivo test. PCR-based genotyping comparing pairs of&#xD;
      parasite isolates from day 0 and day of asexual parasite reappearance will be used to&#xD;
      distinguish between recrudescence and re-infection.&#xD;
