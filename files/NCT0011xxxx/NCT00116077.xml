    <textblock>
      This study seeks to increase the understanding of dopamine receptor function in the brain&#xD;
      during major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, as well as genetic changes that may&#xD;
      be behind changes in those receptors' actions. Dopamine is a natural messenger in the brain,&#xD;
      involved in reward, motivation, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers aged 18 to 55 who have primary major depressive disorder and those who have&#xD;
      bipolar depression (20 in each group), who are not HIV positive and do not have AIDS, and who&#xD;
      are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone interview will be held, for patients to answer standardized questions about&#xD;
      psychiatric or medical symptoms they may have experienced during their lifetime. Those&#xD;
      eligible for the study will undergo interviews and laboratory tests. A psychiatric interview&#xD;
      and clinical assessment will collect various data. Patients will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures and tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A brief neurological examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A one-minute electrocardiogram to measure electrical activity of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests measuring several substances in the blood and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be done to create an image of the volunteer's&#xD;
      brain structure. The technique of MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
      images of body organs and tissues. During the MRI scan, volunteers will lie still on a table&#xD;
      that will slide into the scanner for 30 minutes and in some cases up to but no more than 90&#xD;
      minutes. Volunteers will be asked to lie as still as possible during the procedure. Then a&#xD;
      PET system will create two images of brain blood flow-one of brain dopamine 1 receptor and&#xD;
      one of dopamine 2/3 receptor binding. Volunteers will be given a radiotracer, a tiny amount&#xD;
      of a drug that can be detected by a special camera in the PET scanner. A tiny flexible tube&#xD;
      will be placed in the vein of one arm during each PET scan but during the MRI scan.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to lie still on the PET scanner table. A mask with large holes for&#xD;
      eyes, ears, and mouth will be placed over the head, to keep the head from moving. After&#xD;
      radiotracer injections are given, the PET scanner will create brain images. There may be two&#xD;
      PET scanning sessions, each requiring about 3 hours of scanning. During only one of these&#xD;
      there will be breaks. At the end of the scanning session, volunteers will be asked to drink&#xD;
      several glasses of water and urinate immediately, to reduce radiation exposure to the bladder&#xD;
      wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic screening will help to enhance researchers' understanding of the role of dopamine&#xD;
      receptors in depression. A small blood sample, about 2 tablespoons, will be collected, to&#xD;
      isolate DNA from blood cells. Some of the blood samples or DNA may be stored for future&#xD;
      studies, but those samples will remain coded, so participants will not be identified. This&#xD;
      study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, the results may provide&#xD;
      knowledge to help people in the future. This study does involve compensation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area into&#xD;
      the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) play major roles in the neural&#xD;
      processing underlying motivated behavior. Hypofunction of this system is hypothesized to&#xD;
      underlie the anhedonia, psychomotor slowing and amotivation that characterize major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD; (Fibiger, 1991; Swerdlow and Koob, 1987). A variety of indirect&#xD;
      evidence supports this hypothesis (Wilner, 1995) as: 1) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      concentrations of the DA metabolite, homovanillic acid, are reduced in nondelusional,&#xD;
      depressives. 2) Dextroamphetamine (AMPH) improves mood in depressed patients, and direct DA&#xD;
      receptor agonists (e.g. pramapaxil) and DA reuptake inhibitors (e.g. nomiphensine) exert&#xD;
      antidepressant effects. 3) Many somatic antidepressant therapies enhance D(2/3) receptor&#xD;
      sensitivity in limbic structures and/or increase interstitial DA concentrations in the mPFC&#xD;
      and accumbens in rats. 4) Conditions in which DA is depleted increase the risk for developing&#xD;
      major depression, and DA receptor antagonist administration produces dysphoria, avolition and&#xD;
      fatigue in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more direct assessments of DA receptor pharmacology, Suhara et al. (1992) reported an&#xD;
      abnormal decrease in D1 receptor binding using [(11)C]SCH 23390 in the frontal cortex of&#xD;
      bipolar subjects. However, [(11)C]SCH 23390 has some affinity for 5-HT(2) receptors in the&#xD;
      frontal cortex (De Keyser et al.,1988) so the specificity of this result remains unclear. In&#xD;
      contrast, [(11)C]NNC 112 is selective for D1 receptors and shows sufficient receptor&#xD;
      selectivity to access D(1) receptor binding in the frontal cortex in mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of D(2) receptors using [(11)C]raclopride, [11C]NMSP and [(123)I]IBZM have&#xD;
      been limited by the lack of sensitivity of those radioligands to receptors outside the&#xD;
      striatum. Striatal D(2) receptor binding has been reported to be abnormally increased in&#xD;
      psychotic bipolar subjects relative to both controls and non-psychotic bipolar subjects using&#xD;
      [(11)C]NMSP (Pearlson et al., 1995) and unaltered in subjects with Major Depressive Disorder&#xD;
      (MDD) compared to controls in two studies using [(123)I]IBZM (Klimke et al., 1999; Parsey et&#xD;
      al., 2001). An increased basal ganglia-to-cerebellum ratio of D(2) receptor binding using&#xD;
      [(123)I]IBZM has been reported in depressed MDD subjects compared to controls (D'Hanenen and&#xD;
      Bossuyt, 1994; Ebert et al., 1996). SPECT imaging studies show that [(123)I]IBZM binding to&#xD;
      striatal D(2/3) receptors is abnormally elevated in MDD. Although these studies were&#xD;
      confounded by medication effects and small subject samples, because [(123)I]IBZM binding is&#xD;
      sensitive to competition from endogenous DA, this abnormality could reflect reduced&#xD;
      intrasynaptic DA levels in the striatum of MDD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will address the limitations of the previous studies by characterizing D1&#xD;
      and D2 receptor binding in depression in extrastriatal, as well as striatal regions. PET&#xD;
      measures of [11C]NNC 112 and [(18)F]fallypride binding to assess D(1) and D(2/3) receptor&#xD;
      binding potential (BP), respectively, in unmedicated depressed subjects (part A). The&#xD;
      11C-Raclopride Bolus plus constant infusion (B/I) PET scan will assess D(2) receptor binding&#xD;
      in vivo in the striatum while the subjects perform a monetary reward task, specifically&#xD;
      designed to induce changes in the striatal dopaminergic transmission (part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of high resolution 3D PET and MRI-based region-of-interest analysis will&#xD;
      permit specific assessment of abnormalities of the D(2/3) receptor system in currently&#xD;
      depressed individuals with MDD and BD and of correlations with clinical ratings in ventral&#xD;
      and dorsal striatum as well as in extrastriatal areas such as the amygdala, anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and orbital cortex. Possible relationships of&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the genes coding for elements of the dopaminergic system as well as the&#xD;
      dopamine receptors being studied in MDD or BD with the level of binding detected will be&#xD;
      investigated collecting preliminary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess D(1) receptor binding in BD subjects and performance on working memory and&#xD;
           attention based tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1a. D(1) receptor binding will be decreased in the frontal cortex and&#xD;
           unaltered in the striatum of BD subjects compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1b. Working memory and attention task performance impairments will correlate&#xD;
           with changes in binding levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate striatal and extrastriatal D(2/3) receptor binding, severity of depression,&#xD;
           psychomotor retardation and anhedonia in depressed subjects with BD or MDD compared to&#xD;
           healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a. Baseline [(18)F]fallypride binding in the ventral striatum, amygdala, medial&#xD;
      thalamus, orbital cortex and subgenual PFC will be increased in depressives relative to&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b. The ventral striatal D(2/3) receptor binding will correlate positively with&#xD;
      ratings of anhedonia and depressed mood, and negatively with psychomotor performance speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c. Baseline [(11)C] raclopride binding in the ventral striatum will be increased&#xD;
      in depressed patients and this increase will correlate negatively with the subjective&#xD;
      evaluation of rewarding stimuli and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2d. The monetary reward task will induce a reduction of [(11)C] raclopride&#xD;
      striatal binding, which will be larger in controls than in depressed patients and correlate&#xD;
      negatively with anhedonia scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims: A. To explore differences in D(1) and D(2/3) receptor binding between MDD and&#xD;
      BD subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To investigate whether polymorphisms for the D(1) or the D(2/3) receptor gene may be&#xD;
      associated with differences in receptor BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To assess the relationship between [11C]NNC binding to D(1) receptors and performance on&#xD;
      working memory and attention based tasks from the CANTAB (Cambridge Cognition, UK), including&#xD;
      the Rapid Visual Information Processing test (RVIP) the Spatial Working Memory test (SWM) and&#xD;
      the Pattern Recognition Memory test (PRM).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be established using both&#xD;
        unstructured psychiatric interview with a psychiatrist and the Structured Clinical&#xD;
        Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; (Williams et al., 1992). Family history of mental illness will&#xD;
        be obtained using the Family Interview of Genetic Studies (Maxwell, 1982).&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD Depressed Sample: Forty-six subjects (ages 18-55) male and female will be selected,&#xD;
        with primary MDD currently depressed as defined by DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bipolar Depressed Sample: Forty subjects (ages 18-55) male and female will be selected who&#xD;
        meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I or II disorder and are currently depressed, with HDRS&#xD;
        score in the moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than 18). Subjects may be&#xD;
        inpatients or outpatients. Because effective treatment will not be discontinued for the&#xD;
        purposes of this protocol, subjects will be identified who have never been treated or who&#xD;
        have discontinued medication due to lack of efficacy, noncompliance, physician order or&#xD;
        other reasons prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy, Control Sample: Forty-six subjects (ages 18-55) male and female who have not met&#xD;
        criteria for any major psychiatric disorder will be selected. From this large sample a&#xD;
        control subject will be matched to each depressed subject for age, gender, handedness and&#xD;
        stage of menstrual cycle. The control subjects will have no known first degree relatives&#xD;
        with mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have taken antidepressant or other medications likely to alter monoamine&#xD;
        neurochemistry or cerebrovascular function for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine and&#xD;
        for any drug with known anticholinergic effects) prior to scanning. Because effective&#xD;
        medications will not be discontinued for the purposes of this study, subjects will be&#xD;
        identified who have never been treated or who have discontinued medication due to lack of&#xD;
        efficacy, noncompliance, physician order or other reasons prior to study entry. Subjects&#xD;
        will be excluded if they: a) have had serious suicidal ideation or behavior in the previous&#xD;
        two months, or b) psychosis, or c) medical or neurological illnesses (i.e. seizure&#xD;
        disorder, a coma in past) likely to affect physiology or anatomy, d) a history of drug or&#xD;
        alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or drug dependence (DSM IV&#xD;
        criteria), e) are HIV positive or have AIDS, f)current pregnancy (documented by history and&#xD;
        pregnancy testing prior to scanning), g) current breast feeding, h) general MRI exclusion&#xD;
        criteria which include the subject having a pacemaker or significant claustrophobia.&#xD;
