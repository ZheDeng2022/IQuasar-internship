      This study will determine in stroke patients whether stimulation of the injured side of the&#xD;
      brain combined with stimulation of the weak hand can temporarily improve motor function of&#xD;
      the paralyzed hand. It will also examine whether stimulation of the healthy side of the brain&#xD;
      combined with stimulation of the weak hand can temporarily improve motor function in the&#xD;
      paralyzed hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult volunteers and adults who have had a stroke more than 3 months before entering&#xD;
      the study may be eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with a physical and&#xD;
      neurological examination. Stroke patients also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a test&#xD;
      that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants perform several tasks (described below) in a practice session and then during&#xD;
      five more sessions on separate days. They perform the tasks before and after undergoing&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) plus electrical stimulation (ES), and during a&#xD;
      procedure that involves sham stimulation. For tDCS, small rubber electrodes are soaked with&#xD;
      water and taped to the subject's head, one above the eye and the other on the back of the&#xD;
      head. The current passes between the two electrodes. For ES, two pairs of electrodes are&#xD;
      attached to the subject's wrist with a paste. A very short pulse of current is passed between&#xD;
      the electrodes, creating an electrical field that stimulates the brain. For the sham&#xD;
      stimulation, the electrodes are similarly placed, but there is no stimulation. The tasks are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jebsen-Taylor test: Subjects write, lift small common objects like paper clips, and&#xD;
           perform activities like turning pages, stacking checkers or lifting large objects. They&#xD;
           do these tasks as fast as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pinch force: Subjects press a wedged instrument between their thumb and index finger as&#xD;
           hard as they can. There are several trials every 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speed tapping: Subjects press a key on a keyboard as quickly as possible for 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Simple reaction time task: Subjects perform a quick wrist movement as quickly as&#xD;
           possible in response to a &quot;go&quot; signal presented on a computer monitor. Muscle activity&#xD;
           in the forearm is recorded using electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor sequence learning/Learning a finger movement sequence: Subjects practice a finger&#xD;
           movement exercise on a keyboard by pressing keys that correspond to a number displayed&#xD;
           on a video screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analog scales: Subjects complete three questionnaires about their attention,&#xD;
           fatigue, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory monitoring: Subjects are blindfolded and asked to judge the difference in&#xD;
           various sensations, such as the feel of plastic domes with gratings, vibration, or a&#xD;
           plastic hair applied to their fingertip.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scoring MRC scale: The muscle strength of the subject's hands is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fugl-Meyer scale: The subject's ability to move his or her limbs is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini-mental state examination: The subject's mental ability is measured briefly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handedness questionnaire: The subject's dominant hand is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG)&#xD;
      before, during and after these activities. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief&#xD;
      electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the&#xD;
      brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small electrodes taped to the skin&#xD;
      of the arms or legs. EMG measures the electrical activity of the muscles. For this test,&#xD;
      small electrodes are taped to the skin over the muscle.&#xD;

      There is no universally accepted strategy to promote recovery of motor function after chronic&#xD;
      stroke, the main cause of long-term disability among adults. It is desirable to develop&#xD;
      strategies to improve motor function in stroke patients. Recently a study in stroke patients&#xD;
      demonstrated that transcranial direct current cortical stimulation (tDCS) in association with&#xD;
      motor training leads to improvements of performance and motor learning. Similarly,&#xD;
      somatosensory stimulation (peripheral nerve stimulation, PNS) of the paretic hand in stroke&#xD;
      patients results in improvement of performance and motor learning (Celnik, unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to apply tDCS to the motor cortex of the affected hemisphere&#xD;
      (tDCS affected) in combination with PNS of the paretic hand of patients with chronic stroke,&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis that combined tDCS affected with PNS will lead to more prominent&#xD;
      improvement in motor performance of functional relevant tasks in the paretic hand relative to&#xD;
      either intervention alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that the unaffected hemisphere exerts&#xD;
      abnormally high inhibitory influence over the affected hemisphere. This abnormality might&#xD;
      adversely influence motor recovery. Therefore a further purpose of the study is to apply tDCS&#xD;
      to the unaffected hemisphere (tDCS unaffected) to test the hypothesis that down regulation of&#xD;
      activity in the intact hemisphere, in combination with PNS of the affected hemisphere, will&#xD;
      elicit more prominent improvement in functional relevant tasks than either intervention&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study patients with chronic strokes and healthy age, gender and hand dominance&#xD;
      matched volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis each subject will participate in 13 sessions in a double blind design.&#xD;
      The order that patients and controls will receive the interventions will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be the total time to complete functional relevant tasks of the&#xD;
      hand, Jebsen-Tailor-Test (JTT). Secondary outcomes are tapping speed with one finger; simple&#xD;
      reaction times (SRT); pinch force; and number of correct keyboard piano sequences played in&#xD;
      30sec with the paretic hand. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the proposed&#xD;
      behavioral gains, we will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to identify&#xD;
      corticomotor excitability changes.&#xD;

&#xD;
        We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions at least 6&#xD;

        (below MRC grade 2), which subsequently recovered to the point that they have a residual&#xD;
        motor deficit but can perform the required tasks. Assessment of the initial functional&#xD;
        state will be taken either from patient report or medical records. As a control group, we&#xD;
        will include age- and gender matched healthy volunteers with matched non-dominant/dominant&#xD;
        hand (to the affected hand of the stroke patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
