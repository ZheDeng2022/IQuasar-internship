  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection in&#xD;
      African children and nonimmune travellers despite availability of quinine, the current drug&#xD;
      of choice. Several reports have suggested that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major&#xD;
      cause of death among children with cerebral malaria. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic,&#xD;
      effectively lowers ICP and is used to treat post traumatic raised ICP. There have been some&#xD;
      case reports of reduction in mortality and morbidity in African children with cerebral&#xD;
      malaria following administration of mannitol, but as these were not randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials it is difficult to evaluate their significance. This study seeks to establish whether&#xD;
      a single dose of intravenous mannitol given to children with cerebral malaria will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the coma recovery time.&#xD;

      Cerebral malaria is a life-threatening complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection&#xD;
      accounting for significant morbidity and mortality in African children despite availability&#xD;
      of quinine, the current drug of choice. The case fatality ranges from 5 to 40% with almost&#xD;
      10% of survivors experiencing neurological sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several reports have suggested that raised intracranial pressure (ICP) may be a feature of&#xD;
      cerebral malaria. There is evidence of brain swelling on computer tomography, magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and at necropsy. It has been postulated that raised intracranial pressure&#xD;
      can cause death by transtentorial herniation or by compromising cerebral blood flow. In fact,&#xD;
      most children who died of cerebral malaria in a Kenyan study, had clinical signs compatible&#xD;
      with transtentorial herniation and all those who had severe ICP (maximum ICP &gt; 40mmHg) either&#xD;
      died or survived with neurological sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, effectively lowers ICP and is used to treat post traumatic&#xD;
      raised intracranial pressure. There have been some case reports of reduction in mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity in African children with cerebral malaria following administration of mannitol, but&#xD;
      as these were not randomized controlled trials it is difficult to evaluate their&#xD;
      significance. Currently the WHO contends that there is insufficient evidence for using&#xD;
      mannitol as adjunct therapy for cerebral malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent Cochrane review found no randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trial to support&#xD;
      or refute the use of mannitol as adjunct therapy for cerebral malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A single dose of intravenous mannitol (1g/kg) given to children with cerebral&#xD;
      malaria will reduce mean coma recovery time from 22.5 to 13.1 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We calculated a sample size of 78 patients in each group for 90% power and 95% confidence. In&#xD;
      the calculation, we assumed that the children receiving intravenous mannitol would have a&#xD;
      mean coma recovery time of 13.1 (SD 18.5) hours and those receiving placebo would have a mean&#xD;
      coma recovery time of 22.5 (SD 18.5) hours (42.3% effect size), according to a recent study&#xD;
      by Aceng, Byarugaba and Tumwine in the same hospital.&#xD;
