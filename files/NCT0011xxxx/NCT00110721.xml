  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multi-center study of GM-CT-01 which has been shown to increase the&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly&#xD;
      used in cancer patients. In this Phase II study, patients with colon cancer which has spread,&#xD;
      despite treatment with approved therapies, will receive GM-CT-01 plus 5-FU in monthly cycles&#xD;
      for at least 2 cycles or until their disease progresses.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that GM-CT-01 in different doses plus 5-FU was well&#xD;
      tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved&#xD;
      treatments. The main reason for doing this Phase II study in advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients is to verify the safety observations in the early Phase I study and further evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of these drugs' combination to stabilize tumors, preventing further growth and&#xD;
      potentially shrink tumors.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a histologically-proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has documentation of locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer not amenable to&#xD;
             curative surgery or radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects are those whose unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic&#xD;
             colorectal cancer has progressed during or after receiving treatment with at least&#xD;
             two, but not more than three, lines of therapy that collectively must have included at&#xD;
             a minimum all of the following agents: 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, irinotecan, and&#xD;
             oxaliplatin (unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is not able to&#xD;
             receive irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin due to medical contraindications, in which case&#xD;
             irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin are not required to have been included in the prior&#xD;
             lines of therapy). Adjuvant chemotherapy following definitive management of the&#xD;
             primary lesion in the colon or rectum is allowed and will not be counted as a line of&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;

             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The same diagnostic imaging method must be used throughout the study to evaluate the&#xD;
