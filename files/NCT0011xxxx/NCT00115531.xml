      The purpose of this study is to compare a new higher-dose influenza virus vaccine to the&#xD;
      standard dose vaccine in elderly adults who can walk. Current influenza vaccines protect&#xD;
      elderly against viral influenza but not as well as desired. It is expected that the higher&#xD;
      doses vaccine can be given with little reaction, but this needs to be tested. Up to 410&#xD;
      people ages 65 years and older will be recruited from the community and from existing&#xD;
      volunteer populations. Participants will receive either the high or standard dose injected in&#xD;
      the muscle, remain in the clinic for 20 minutes afterward, and maintain a daily memory aid&#xD;
      for 7 days. The memory aid will be reviewed by telephone 8-12 days after the injection and&#xD;
      return to the clinic or contacted by telephone 6 months after the injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a common respiratory infection caused by several related viruses. Epidemics of&#xD;
      influenza occur each winter and are responsible for an average of about 36,000 deaths each&#xD;
      year in the United States. Most of these deaths occur among elderly persons and among people&#xD;
      of all ages who suffer from chronic diseases, particularly of the lungs and the heart.&#xD;
      Current influenza virus vaccines protect elderly persons against influenza, but not as well&#xD;
      as desired. One consideration for trying to increase protection is to increase the vaccine&#xD;
      dose, but there is some concern that increasing the dose may increase reactions to the&#xD;
      vaccine (such as sore arm, aches, or fever). One of the vaccine manufacturers has prepared an&#xD;
      experimental influenza virus vaccine with a dose that is higher than the currently used dose.&#xD;
      A previous study with the same high dose of the vaccine showed that it was well tolerated&#xD;
      with only increased reactions at the injection site compared to the usual vaccine. Since the&#xD;
      study, the high-dose vaccine has also been made without preservative (thimerosal) and&#xD;
      gelatin, which are in the standard vaccine. It is expected that this vaccine can be given&#xD;
      with little reaction, but this needs to be determined. It also needs to be shown whether such&#xD;
      a vaccine stimulates higher levels of infection-fighting proteins (or antibodies) in the&#xD;
      blood than standard doses of influenza vaccine. The purpose of this research is to compare&#xD;
      reactions and antibody responses following standard flu vaccine to those following the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine. Up to 410 people ages 65 years and older will be recruited from the&#xD;
      community and from existing volunteer populations. Participants will receive either the high&#xD;
      or standard dose injected in the muscle, remain in the clinic for 20 minutes afterward, and&#xD;
      maintain a daily memory aid for 7 days. The memory aid will be reviewed by telephone 8-12&#xD;
      days after the injection and return to the clinic or contacted by telephone 6 months after&#xD;
      the injection. This study is linked to DMID protocol 05-0028.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for study&#xD;
        participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
