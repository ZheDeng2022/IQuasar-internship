      The study's primary objective is to determine whether the PRSS improves the optimal timing of&#xD;
      photocoagulation in diabetic patients in VA. Secondary objectives include assessing if the&#xD;
      program: (1) leads to improved compliance with retinopathy screening and surveillance visits;&#xD;
      (2) improves patient and provider satisfaction with VA diabetic eye care; (3) reduces eye&#xD;
      care visit rates among diabetics receiving eye care at VA; (4) decreases health care resource&#xD;
      utilization; and (5) improves the cost-effectiveness of eye care for patients with diabetes&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a common cause of blindness and much of this blindness is preventable by early&#xD;
      detection and treatment. Although VA and HEDIS quality criteria now allow some individuals&#xD;
      with diabetes to have biannual examinations, current diabetes eye care policies continue to&#xD;
      emphasize routine, annual eye exams for most diabetes patients. Strong evidence suggests that&#xD;
      the current �one-size fits all� method wastes resources while ignoring an opportunity to&#xD;
      substantially improve outcomes for high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research shows that patients referred for screening examinations (i.e., those without&#xD;
      retinopathy) require different follow-up then those referred for surveillance examinations&#xD;
      (i.e., those with retinopathy). Using a more targeted, risk-based criteria for scheduling eye&#xD;
      examinations together with system level interventions designed to assure their application&#xD;
      may lead to improved healthcare outcomes. Although, the efficacy of such approaches have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in other systems and organizational research, it has not yet been demonstrated&#xD;
      for diabetes eye care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to conduct and evaluate a prototype translational research project&#xD;
      examining the impact of the Proactive Diabetes Eye Care Program, a coordinated and targeted&#xD;
      system-level intervention, on: 1) the optimal timing of photocoagulation; 2) the optimal&#xD;
      timing of eye care visits; 3) patient and provider satisfaction; 4) health care resource use;&#xD;
      and 5) the overall cost-effectiveness of a targeted eye care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary intervention will involve the use of an innovative �Progressive Reminder and&#xD;
      Scheduling System� in which intensity of the reminders is based on the patient�s degree of&#xD;
      risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy or macular edema. At the intervention&#xD;
      sites, there will be separate clinics for screening (those whose last examination was normal)&#xD;
      and surveillance (those with known retinopathy). This two-year prototype translational&#xD;
      project will have a quasi-experimental design. Six facilities will be recruited: three will&#xD;
      receive the intervention without the system design components. The control and intervention&#xD;
      sites will be matched for comparability to baseline screening rates and similar patient&#xD;
      populations. The intervention will be evaluated using historical controls (pre-post analyses)&#xD;
      and by comparison to control sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from three sources. We will use the VISTA database to determine&#xD;
      resource use, patients demographics, co-morbidities and medications. Trained medical&#xD;
      personnel will conduct chart reviews on a random sample of patients undergoing&#xD;
      photocoagulation to determine whether it was sub-optimally timed (i.e., the patient already&#xD;
      had a major retinal hemorrhage or advanced macular edema at the time of the procedure). A&#xD;
      random sample of patients will be surveyed, at baseline and after 12 months, about non-VA eye&#xD;
      care services they received and their attitudes and satisfaction toward eye care. We will&#xD;
      also survey health care providers regarding diabetic eye care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this program will serve as a model for disseminating diabetes eye care best&#xD;
      practices throughout the VA system and could provide further information about the best&#xD;
      approaches to managing other diseases in which patients may benefit from risk stratification&#xD;
      rather than being treated according to a single standard.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The population for the project will be all diabetic patients treated at the three VAMCs&#xD;
        selected as intervention sites. Therefore, patient recruitment is not required for&#xD;
        participation in the initial implementation activities nor in assessing compliance with&#xD;
        recommendation for eye examination and treatment. Although the scheduling system will be&#xD;
        redesigned and the clinical guidelines will be used to inform eye care clinical&#xD;
        decision-making, the final decision about whom should receive diabetes eye care and at what&#xD;
        interval will continue to be left to the best clinical judgment of the health care&#xD;
        professionals and their patients at each study site. Nothing in this study will preclude a&#xD;
        patient and their physician from seeking eye care more frequently or less frequently than&#xD;
        recommended by the guidelines. In one regard, this study could be thought of as a study of&#xD;
        usual care under two different management and organizational systems without any direct&#xD;
        patient-level intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For data analysis purposes, there will be two sets of inclusion criteria ? EPRP visit&#xD;
        criteria and diabetes identification criteria. To be included in the primary data analyses&#xD;
        a patient must meet the criteria of the Office of Quality &amp; Performances quality monitoring&#xD;
        program. This criteria includes at least one outpatient visit during the current fiscal&#xD;
        year and at least one outpatient visit in the fiscal year prior to the current year (see&#xD;
        http://vaww.oqp.med.va.gov/oqp_services/performance_measurement/tech_man.asp). The previous&#xD;
        and current qualifying visits must be in any one of 8 clinics (Primary Care (301), General&#xD;
        Medicine (323), Cardiology (303), Endocrinology/Metabolism (305), Diabetes (306),&#xD;
        Hypertension (309), Pulmonary/Chest (312), or Women's Health (322)) per the West Virginia's&#xD;
        Peer Review Organization's External Peer Review Program (EPRP) selection criteria. Eligible&#xD;
        patients would be excluded if they had a life expectancy of 6 months or less (e.g.,&#xD;
        diagnosis of pancreatic cancer or in hospice). For epidemiological comparability, separate&#xD;
        cohorts will be constructed for evaluating eye care at the beginning of the study period&#xD;
        (for the pre-intervention analyses) and at end of the study period (for the&#xD;
        post-intervention analyses). We will identify diabetics (for analytic purposes) by&#xD;
        requiring them to meet one of the following criteria in the previous year: 1) one or more&#xD;
        prescriptions filled for hypoglycemic medications or self-monitoring blood glucose supplies&#xD;
        (as determined by VISTA records), 2) having a diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9 250.x) recorded&#xD;
        in at least 2 separate outpatient encounters, or 3) having a diagnosis of diabetes recorded&#xD;
        for one or more inpatient stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        None if patient meets inclusion criteria&#xD;
