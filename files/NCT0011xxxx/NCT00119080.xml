      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new meningococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      (MCV4) can reduce asymptomatic carriage of meningococcal bacteria, and thus decrease the&#xD;
      transmission of these bacteria in the population.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new meningococcal conjugate vaccine&#xD;
      (MCV4) can reduce asymptomatic carriage of meningococcal bacteria, and thus decrease the&#xD;
      transmission of these bacteria in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States. A new&#xD;
      tetravalent (A, C, Y, W-135) meningococcal conjugate vaccine ([MCV4], MenactraTM manufactured&#xD;
      by Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January&#xD;
      2005. This vaccine is recommended by ACIP for routine vaccination of young adolescents at the&#xD;
      pre-adolescent visit (11-12 years old), adolescents at high school entry (15 years old), and&#xD;
      college freshmen living in dormitories. Prevention of asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage of&#xD;
      meningococci is important to interrupt person-to-person transmission and to induce herd&#xD;
      immunity, when lower transmission results in lower disease rates among those people who are&#xD;
      not vaccinated. No studies have yet been done to evaluate the impact of this new vaccine on&#xD;
      carriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized study designed to evaluate the effect of MCV4 on meningococcal carriage.&#xD;
      Several high schools will be randomized into the intervention and control groups. Students in&#xD;
      intervention group will receive MCV4 at the beginning of the study, students in the control&#xD;
      group will be offered MCV4 after the study completion. Three specimens of throat secretions&#xD;
      (similar to swabs for Strep throat) will be collected from the students enrolled in the&#xD;
      study: before vaccination of intervention group students (at the start of the school year), 8&#xD;
      weeks post-vaccination, and 9 months post-vaccination (at the end of the school year).&#xD;
      Questionnaire administered at the time of swabbing will assess potential risk factors for&#xD;
      meningococcal carriage. Meningococcal bacteria isolated from the throat specimens will be&#xD;
      serogrouped and molecularly typed. Approximately 2,000 students in each group will be needed&#xD;
      for the study. Anticipating 35% refusal rate and 25% loss to follow-up, approximately 4,200&#xD;
      high school students will need to be approached in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will answer an important question whether those who are vaccinated are protected&#xD;
      not only from disease, but also from being asymptomatic carriers of meningococci. If so,&#xD;
      those who are vaccinated will not be able to carry and transmit bacteria to unvaccinated&#xD;
      individuals. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines may become available in the near future to&#xD;
      other age groups, including infants and children. Determining the efficacy of MCV4 against&#xD;
      meningococcal carriage will be important for policy decisions regarding vaccination with this&#xD;
      and future conjugate vaccines in different age groups.&#xD;
