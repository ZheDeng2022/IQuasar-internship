    <textblock>
      Tardive dyskinesia is a common complication of conventional antipsychotic treatment in&#xD;
      subjects with schizophrenia. This study investigates whether the addition of the omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acid, ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to usual treatment improves movement disorder&#xD;
      in 84 schizophrenia subjects with established tardive dyskinesia. The initial double-blinded,&#xD;
      randomised trial duration is 12 weeks, followed by further 46 weeks of open-label treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major limitations of conventional antipsychotics is their high propensity to cause&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Tardive dyskinesia (TD) in particular causes problems, insofar&#xD;
      as it is common, and resistant to treatment. TD is under-recognised in clinical settings.&#xD;
      However, prevalence studies indicate that 5% of patients treated with conventional&#xD;
      antipsychotics develop TD each year for the first eight years with an average reported&#xD;
      prevalence rate in the region between 17 and 23%. Although in the majority of cases the&#xD;
      disorder is mild and not distressing, TD contributes to social and vocational impairment, as&#xD;
      well as to the further stigmatization of the illness. A minority develop severe symptoms,&#xD;
      which are extremely distressing and disabling, and may even be life-threatening. Treatment of&#xD;
      TD is difficult. Dose-reduction or discontinuation of antipsychotic medication may&#xD;
      paradoxically result in exacerbation of the TD symptoms, and also run the risk of&#xD;
      precipitating a psychotic relapse. With the exception of clozapine and possibly botulinum&#xD;
      toxin (for tardive dystonia), vitamin E7 and vitamin B6, little evidence exists to indicate&#xD;
      efficacy for any treatment modality for TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel antipsychotics have had a huge impact upon the treatment of schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      major advantage of these agents over their predecessors is their reduced risk of inducing EPS&#xD;
      (and probably TD). However, high acquisition costs have limited their availability worldwide&#xD;
      and many patients will continue to be exposed to conventional antipsychotics for the&#xD;
      foreseeable future. Development of an effective and affordable treatment for TD would&#xD;
      therefore be of great benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible candidate for an effective and affordable treatment for TD is eicosapentaenoic&#xD;
      acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid obtained from marine and plant sources. In&#xD;
      addition to the evidence suggesting that EPA may improve the symptoms of schizophrenia when&#xD;
      combined with standard antipsychotic treatment, there is also reason to believe that EPA may&#xD;
      have a role in the treatment of TD. An open study in 20 hospitalised subjects with chronic&#xD;
      schizophrenia reported a significant inverse correlation between dietary EPA and severity of&#xD;
      TD. Treatment of these subjects with a standard EPA-rich marine oil for 6 weeks resulted in&#xD;
      significant improvement in TD. We recently completed a 12-week randomised, double-blind study&#xD;
      with ethyl-EPA 3g/day versus placebo as add-on to standard antipsychotic treatment, in forty&#xD;
      subjects with chronic, refractory schizophrenia (submitted for publication). While there were&#xD;
      no differences between the groups for the changes in the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale&#xD;
      (ESRS) for parkinsonism, dystonia or akathisia scores, the ethyl-EPA group showed a&#xD;
      significantly greater reduction in ESRS dyskinesia scores at 12 weeks (p=0.008). This result&#xD;
      is potentially of great importance. Given the chronic nature of illness in our sample, most&#xD;
      of these dyskinetic symptoms are likely to have been due to TD. This same study also reported&#xD;
      a significant advantage for the ethyl-EPA group in terms of overall symptom reduction (PANSS&#xD;
      total) (p=0.03), and analysis of co-variance indicated an association between PANSS total&#xD;
      score reduction and ESRS dyskinesia score reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate whether EPA may have an antipsychotic effect that is&#xD;
      associated with an anti-dyskinetic effect. It has been suggested that an intrinsic aspect of&#xD;
      the disease process of schizophrenia predisposes individuals with severe forms of the illness&#xD;
      to antipsychotic-induced TD. These authors hypothesise that pathologic over-activity of&#xD;
      mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neural systems may mediate persistence of psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms despite adequate treatment, while increased TD vulnerability may be caused by&#xD;
      overactive nigrostriatal dopamine activity from this process that is enhanced by&#xD;
      antipsychotic drug exposure. If this is so, then it is possible that EPA could, by a common&#xD;
      mechanism, have both an anti-dyskinetic and antipsychotic effect. This would explain the&#xD;
      significant association that we found between reduction in dyskinesia scores and reduction in&#xD;
      overall symptoms in our preliminary study (unpublished).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA) versus placebo as&#xD;
           supplementary medication in reducing symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of ethyl-EPA versus placebo as supplementary medication in&#xD;
           reducing symptoms of psychosis in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether there is an association between the antidyskinetic and antipsychotic&#xD;
           actions of ethyl-EPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of ethyl-EPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group comparison of ethyl-EPA and placebo in the&#xD;
      treatment of established TD in patients with schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder.&#xD;
      There will be a pre-trial screen, following which subjects will enter the randomised&#xD;
      treatment phase for 12 weeks. Responders will then be offered the option of open add-on&#xD;
      treatment with ethyl-EPA for a further 40 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source of patients: In- and out-patients from state hospital and community psychiatric&#xD;
      services in the greater Cape Town area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: Recruitment will stop when 84 eligible patients have been randomised to&#xD;
      trial treatment. A recruitment period of 12 to 18 months is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-trial screenings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written, informed consent will be obtained prior to screening procedures. All patients will&#xD;
      be screened to assess their eligibility for the trial. The screening visit will include the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either an encapsulated ethyl-EPA supplement 2&#xD;
      g/day (2X500 mg capsules twice daily) (Laxdale Ltd.), or placebo (medicinal liquid paraffin&#xD;
      BP 2 g/day), in addition to the medication that they had been receiving, for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Ethyl EPA is a highly purified derivative of fish-oil. The Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration has affirmed the status of fish-oil as generally recognised as safe with EPA&#xD;
      doses up to 3 g/day. Trial supplies will be packed by an independent contract clinical trials&#xD;
      supplies company (DHP), who will prepare the placebo and active packs for the entire trial&#xD;
      and assign the randomisation numbers to the packs. The randomisation code will be broken&#xD;
      after completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects who have been on stable medication for the preceding 6 weeks will be&#xD;
      considered. Psychotropic medication will be fixed for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticholinergic medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticholinergic medication may be prescribed following randomisation, for treatment-emergent&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other psychotropic medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were stabilised on other psychotropic medications (anxiolytic, hypnotic,&#xD;
      antidepressant, mood stabilising) before entry to the trial may continue on these&#xD;
      medications. Anxiolytic or hypnotic medication may be prescribed for treatment-emergent&#xD;
      conditions, eg. insomnia or acute anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other concomitant medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any medication for physical conditions that was taken prior to the commencement of the trial&#xD;
      may be continued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication for other conditions that arise during the course of the trial will be permitted,&#xD;
      at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other omega-3 fatty acid preparations are not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) dyskinesia score from baseline to&#xD;
           week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures for effect on TD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in ESRS for parkinsonism, dystonia, akathisia, and total scores from baseline to&#xD;
           week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of subjects in each group who achieve a 30% reduction in ESRS total&#xD;
           scores at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to remission (defined as a 30% reduction in ESRS total scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of patients achieving a CGI Severity of TD score of &lt; 3 at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures for effect on psychosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative and&#xD;
           general psychopathology scores from baseline to week 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of relationship between change in TD scores and change in symptoms of psychosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlations between the above measures of TD and psychosis symptoms will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures for safety and tolerability:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The incidence of treatment-emergent EPS will be assessed at each visit by the proportion&#xD;
           of subjects requiring anticholinergic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Other tolerability and safety measures will include the reporting of adverse events,&#xD;
           vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All concurrent medication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A physical examination will be carried out at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to liver functions, haematology and prolactin, the following tests will be done:&#xD;
      bleeding time, fasting blood sugar and fasting lipogram. Although EPA is classified by the&#xD;
      FDA as Generally Recognised as Safe in doses up to 3g/day, there have been reports of adverse&#xD;
      effects on bleeding time, glycaemic control and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venepuncture will be performed at the pre-trial screen (visit 1), visit 4 (week 4) and at&#xD;
      endpoint (visit 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  haemoglobin, platelet count, total white cell count, differential white cell count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prolactin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bleeding time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lipogram (fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood-sugar (fasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and patient withdrawals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any new medical condition, or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition occurring&#xD;
      during the wash-out and randomised phase will be recorded on the case record forms (CRF's).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal from trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may occur for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deterioration in the patient's condition, or lack of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occurrence of an adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient lost to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data will be recorded in the case record forms. Two trained persons will&#xD;
      independently perform a double data entry in a database. Verifications will be conducted&#xD;
      during each of the two data entry processes and after comparison of the double data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed by a biostatistician. The primary intent of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the ability of ethyl-EPA versus placebo to reduce TD symptoms in 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. The principal null hypothesis is therefore that ethyl-EPA will not differ from&#xD;
      placebo on the primary efficacy measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We obtained an estimate of the variability of the change in ESRS dyskinesia scores after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment with ethyl-EPA and placebo as add-on to their previous antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication from a previous trial conducted at our centre, which gave 2.13 as the standard&#xD;
      deviation (unpublished). Using this estimate and with a significance level of 5% and 90%&#xD;
      power, 32 patients per randomised group would be sufficient to detect a 1.75 point difference&#xD;
      in change in ESRS dyskinesia scores (the difference obtained in our preliminary study) from&#xD;
      baseline to endpoint. Allowing for an estimated withdrawal rate of 30%, we will need to&#xD;
      recruit 42 patients per treatment group into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single statistical analysis will be performed at the end of the study. All of the tests&#xD;
      will be interpreted at 5% significance level (2-tailed). Data analyses will be performed with&#xD;
      Statistica software (StatSoft, Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy measure will be the change in the ESRS dyskinesia score from baseline to&#xD;
      endpoint. This will be analysed using analysis of covariance, including baseline score,&#xD;
      treatment received, the centre and the centre-by-treatment interaction as factors.&#xD;
      Comparisons will be performed by intention-to-treat, with last observation carried forward&#xD;
      (LOCF). An additional analysis will be performed on the per-protocol population, and an&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on the per-protocol population without the LOCF to assess the&#xD;
      effects of any withdrawals from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESRS scores for parkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia, as well as the PANSS total and&#xD;
      subscale scores will be analysed in the same way as the ESRS dyskinesia score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented to evaluate the main comparison&#xD;
      of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student's t test and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient will be used for&#xD;
      univariate differences and correlations respectively between numeric variables. To determine&#xD;
      the contributions of individual variables toward TD scores, significant univariate results&#xD;
      will be followed with regression analysis with simultaneous entry, using the method of least&#xD;
      squares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of the contributions of the predictor variables to the proportion of&#xD;
      patients classed as responders will be analysed using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to remission will be calculated. Comparison of the time to remission for the two groups&#xD;
      will be in terms of Kaplan-Meier estimates for their survival curves. Controlling for&#xD;
      covariates will be done by Cox proportional hazard regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receiving at least one dose of trial medication will be included in the&#xD;
      assessments of safety/tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event frequencies will be summarised by body system. All adverse events will be&#xD;
      presented in a table sorted by body system classification, along with degree of severity and&#xD;
      relationship to treatment. Adverse events will be listed in full in an Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory findings (haematology and biochemistry) will be summarized and evaluated using the&#xD;
      laboratory's normal ranges. The data will be tabulated in normal/abnormal categories. Shift&#xD;
      tables will be constructed where appropriate, to summarize changes in the data over the&#xD;
      course of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs and physical examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, double pressure product and heart rate&#xD;
      will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. Frequency tables will be calculated for&#xD;
      the respective physical examination variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comply with The Declaration of Helsinki (Republic of South Africa Revision,&#xD;
      1996) and ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be submitted for approval to the Institutional Review Board of the University&#xD;
      of Stellenbosch and the Medicines Control Council of South Africa (regulatory authority).&#xD;
