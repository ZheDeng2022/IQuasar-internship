  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is associated with increased inflammatory cytokines and reduced&#xD;
      adiponectin, that may be mediated in part by TNF production from abdominal fat. We reasoned&#xD;
      that an anti-TNF agent would reduce C-reactive protein (CRP) and increase adiponectin,&#xD;
      improving the inflammatory milieu associated with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;

      Screening visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty six patients will be randomized to receive etanercept or identical placebo. During the&#xD;
      screening visit, after informed consent is obtained, subjects will undergo a medical history&#xD;
      and physical exam, which will include vital signs, weight, abdominal girth measurements and&#xD;
      an evaluation for signs of underlying infection. A purified protein derivative (PPD) of 5&#xD;
      tuberculin units (TU) (0.1 milliliter of 5 TU/0.1 ml solution) will be intradermally placed&#xD;
      to test for the presence of tuberculosis (TB). Fasting blood work will include a complete&#xD;
      blood count (CBC), glucose, insulin, a cholesterol panel, and urine pregnancy test. Subjects&#xD;
      will be shown what a subcutaneous injection entails using placebo. Patients will be selected&#xD;
      based on their laboratory results, abdominal girth measurements and PPD negativity 48 hrs&#xD;
      after placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return 48 hours after their first screening visit for evaluation of their PPD&#xD;
      test. In the event of a positive PPD, subjects will be excluded from the study, and their&#xD;
      primary care physicians will be notified of their test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or Massachusetts Institute of&#xD;
      Technology (MIT) Clinical Research Center (GCRC) after an overnight fast. Fasting blood work&#xD;
      will be obtained to test for CRP, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TNF-alpha receptor 1,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha receptor 2, free fatty acids, glucose, insulin and a cholesterol panel, and CBC. A&#xD;
      urine pregnancy test will be done. Patients will be asked to recall the food they consumed&#xD;
      over the past 24 hours. A bionutritionist will measure height, weight, waist, hip, chest,&#xD;
      arm, neck and thigh circumference. Subjects will be instructed to practice adequate birth&#xD;
      control throughout the study. Serum will be stored for etanercept antibody testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then undergo an insulin modified frequently sampled intravenous (IV) glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (FSIGT) as initially developed by Bergman et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Hologic QDR 4500) will be used to determine whole&#xD;
      body and regional fat. The technique has a precision error (1 SD) of 3% for whole body fat&#xD;
      and 1.5% for lean mass. Subjects will also undergo a single thin-slice CT scan of the abdomen&#xD;
      at L4 vertebral body to determine visceral and subcutaneous fat area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry for the measurement of resting energy expenditure indirect calorimetry&#xD;
      using the Deltatrac instrument (Sensormedics, Anaheim, CA) will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given a total of either etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously or placebo&#xD;
      subcutaneously at the GCRC at the end of their visit. They will receive this in two&#xD;
      injections of 25 mg each, one given immediately following the other, at different body sites.&#xD;
      Etanercept will be supplied as a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder. The&#xD;
      pharmacy will reconstitute it with 1 mL of the supplied sterile bacteriostatic water for&#xD;
      injection (BWFI), United States Pharmacopeia (USP) (containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol). Each&#xD;
      vial of etanercept contains 25 mg etanercept, 40 mg mannitol, 10 mg sucrose, and 1.2 mg&#xD;
      tromethamine. Subjects will receive the 50 mg dose of etanercept or placebo once a week,&#xD;
      given as two 25 mg injections, one immediately following the other, at different body sites,&#xD;
      at each of their ensuing three visits to the GCRC, on Visit Day 8, Visit Day 15 and Visit Day&#xD;
      22. Subjects will be monitored for 30 minutes after the injection of study drug at each&#xD;
      visit. The skin injection site will be observed and their vital signs will be taken. If a&#xD;
      subject has a significant exposure to varicella virus during the study, transient termination&#xD;
      of the study will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 8 visit, Day 15 visit, Day 22 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report to MGH or MIT Clinical Research Center after an overnight fast. Each&#xD;
      subject will undergo a history and physical exam to assess for safety and compliance. Fasting&#xD;
      blood work will be obtained. A bionutritionist will measure subjects' height, weight, hip and&#xD;
      waist circumference and calculate a waist to hip ratio. They will receive 50 mg of either&#xD;
      etanercept or placebo, given as two 25 mg doses subcutaneously, at different body sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 25 visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report to MGH or MIT Clinical Research Center after an overnight fast. Each&#xD;
      subject will undergo a history and physical exam to assess for safety and compliance. Blood&#xD;
      work, a urine pregnancy test and 24 hour food recall will be collected, identical to that on&#xD;
      Day 1 visit. Anthropomorphic measurements will be the same as the Day 1 visit. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) identical to that on the Day 1 visit.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a DEXA, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), and CT, and indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry identical to those on the Day 1 visit. No study drug will be administered at this&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
