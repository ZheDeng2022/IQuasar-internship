      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate, total-body irradiation, and&#xD;
      donor stem cell transplant followed by cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil in treating&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Giving&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation before a donor&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells and&#xD;
      helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also,&#xD;
      radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8, can find&#xD;
      cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When&#xD;
      the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's&#xD;
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the&#xD;
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.&#xD;
      Giving fludarabine phosphate and total-body irradiation before the transplant together with&#xD;
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.&#xD;
      Giving a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody together with donor stem cell transplant,&#xD;
      cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil may be an effective treatment for advanced acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the transplant-related mortality (TRM)&#xD;
      and toxicity of delivering 131I-BC8 (iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8) (anti-cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation [CD]45 antibody) at a starting dose of 22 Gy to the normal organ receiving&#xD;
      the highest dose in combination with the non-myeloablative regimen of fludarabine&#xD;
      (fludarabine phosphate) (FLU), 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), cyclosporine (CSP),&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related or unrelated&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients 16 to 50 years old who have&#xD;
      advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate rates of donor chimerism resulting from this combined preparative regimen and&#xD;
      to correlate level of donor chimerism with estimated radiation doses delivered to&#xD;
      hematopoietic tissues via antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine rates of disease relapse, graft vs. host disease, and 2-year disease-free&#xD;
      survival in patients receiving 131I-BC8 antibody combined with FLU, 2 Gy TBI, CSP, MMF, and&#xD;
      HLA-matched related or unrelated allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive therapeutic iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on day -12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -4 to -2 and undergo TBI on&#xD;
      day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANTATION: After completion of TBI, patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell (PBSC) transplant on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients with a matched related donor receive cyclosporine IV or orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56 followed by a taper to day 180 in the absence of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease. Beginning 4-6 hours after PBSC transplant, these patients also&#xD;
      receive mycophenolate mofetil PO BID on days 0 to 27. Patients with a matched unrelated donor&#xD;
      receive cyclosporine IV or PO BID on days -3 to 100 followed by a taper to day 180. Beginning&#xD;
      4-6 hours after PBSC transplant, these patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice&#xD;
      daily (TID) on days 0 to 40 followed by a taper to day 96.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months&#xD;
      and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
