  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the importance of a substance called endothelin.&#xD;
      Endothelin is produced by coronary arteries. This study examines this substance to determine&#xD;
      whether it has an effect on controlling blood flow in coronary arteries. When these arteries&#xD;
      release too much endothelin, the blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced and this may be&#xD;
      important in heart conditions. This protocol examines an investigational drug called BQ-123&#xD;
      to see if it blocks the effect of endothelin. We assess the blood flow in the coronaries and&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of BQ-123. It is anticipated that this endothelin blocker will open up&#xD;
      coronary arteries and increase the blood flow to the heart.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many substances that influence the diameter of the coronary artery and a number of&#xD;
      these are actually released by the lining of the coronary arteries (referred to as the&#xD;
      endothelium). Over the past 15 years, our laboratory has been instrumental in establishing&#xD;
      the role of endothelium-released relaxing factors which relax (open) the coronary arteries.&#xD;
      We are now focussing our attention on factors which constrict the coronary artery, in&#xD;
      particular a substance called endothelin-1 (ET-1). This potent constrictor substance has been&#xD;
      found to accumulate at coronary artery sites which may produce unstable angina (ie the&#xD;
      culprit lesion or stenosis). Hence ET-1 may produce localized constriction of a coronary&#xD;
      stenosis thereby further narrowing the remaining lumen and cutting off blood flow to the&#xD;
      heart muscle and thus leading to unstable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If ET-1 is important in the development of unstable angina, then medications which inhibit&#xD;
      the effects of ET-1 should improve the condition. To achieve a blockade of ET-1, inhibitors&#xD;
      of the two receptors (ET-A and ET-B) responsible for ET-1's action must be administered.&#xD;
      Animal and human studies have demonstrated that a blockade of the ET-A receptor by the new&#xD;
      antagonist, BQ-123, inhibits most of the ET-1 induced constrictor response. BQ-123 has been&#xD;
      safely administered systemically by intravenous infusion and locally in the human forearm&#xD;
      where it produces dilation of the forearm arteries. It has not been previously administered&#xD;
      into human coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented patients whose routine diagnostic angiogram shows suitable anatomy (i.e., normal&#xD;
      angiogram for the control group, or one/two vessel coronary artery disease with an&#xD;
      identifiable culprit stenosis) will have placement of a coronary artery angiographic&#xD;
      catheter. Placement of this catheter does not require an additional puncture of an artery&#xD;
      (already performed in the routine diagnostic angiogram).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angiographic catheter allows visualization of the internal diameter of the coronary&#xD;
      arteries by the injection of a radiographic contrast with the image being recorded on a cine&#xD;
      film. Specialized imaging machines will measure the diameter of the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the angiographic catheter, an infusion catheter (by which the drugs can be&#xD;
      administered) and a coronary Doppler flow wire are placed in the coronary artery. The latter&#xD;
      instrument is a well-established tool for measuring coronary blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After establishing baseline values for heart rate, blood pressure, culprit stenosis internal&#xD;
      diameter and coronary blood flow, the following sequential intracoronary infusions will be&#xD;
      undertaken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infusion of the endothelin antagonist, BQ-123, over a 60 minute period. This inhibitor&#xD;
           requires up to 60 minutes exerting a full effect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adenosine bolus injection, to assess the vasodilation capacity of the small coronary&#xD;
           arteries; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nitroglycerin bolus injection, to assess the maximal vasodilation capacity of the large&#xD;
           coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of endothelin antagonist infusion, and immediately after the&#xD;
      bolus injections, the above parameters will be reassessed. It is anticipated that this&#xD;
      research protocol will be completed within 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the research protocol, the patient will undergo appropriate coronary intervention&#xD;
      as dictated by the clinical situation. If coronary atherectomy is required for clinical&#xD;
      indications, then the specimen extracted by this procedure will be sent for specific analysis&#xD;
      of endothelin-1 content. A correlation between the amount of endothelin at the culprit&#xD;
      stenosis and the response to the endothelin antagonist can then be examined. In cardiac&#xD;
      transplant recipients, endomyocardial biopsies are also routinely obtained for clinical&#xD;
      purposes at the time of catheterization. One of these specimens will be used for ET-1&#xD;
      immunoreactivity analysis. A total of 2 teaspoons of blood will be taken and frozen for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
