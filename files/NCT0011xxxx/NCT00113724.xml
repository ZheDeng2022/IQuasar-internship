  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a novel taxane analog, TPI 287. TPI 287 is&#xD;
      synthetically manufactured from naturally occurring taxanes extracted from yew starting&#xD;
      material. The synthesis involves modification to the taxane side chain to overcome multidrug&#xD;
      resistance and to achieve mutant tubulin binding. This study will be a multi-center, dose&#xD;
      escalation, sequential group, phase I study evaluating the intravenous administration of TPI&#xD;
      287, a novel third generation taxane.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of TPI 287 for&#xD;
      phase II clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of TPI 287&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine antitumor activity of TPI 287&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of TPI 287&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacodynamic profile of TPI 287&#xD;
