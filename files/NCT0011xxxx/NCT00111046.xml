  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess post operative pain following the insertion of&#xD;
      radioactive plaque for choroidal melanoma in patients after receiving either ibuprofen or&#xD;
      tramadol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with choroidal melanomas who are offered ruthenium plaque radiotherapy have their&#xD;
      plaque sutured to the sclera under general anaesthesia. The plaque is removed in a few days&#xD;
      after delivering the required radioactive dosage to the tumour. While the plaque is in situ,&#xD;
      patients require analgesia. The management of post-operative pain is generally not considered&#xD;
      a high priority, more importance being given to the regression of the melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is indicated by the lack of any study addressing this aspect of care. The failure of&#xD;
      patients in general, to complain, may perhaps be due to them having accepted that some degree&#xD;
      of pain following 'major surgery for a malignant ocular condition' is the norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per current protocol, ibuprofen is being prescribed, unless contraindicated. Although many&#xD;
      are comfortable, others request additional analgesics. Most opioid analgesics provide better&#xD;
      pain relief but are associated with nausea, vomiting, constipation and respiratory&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tramadol is an opioid analgesic that is reported to have less of the above mentioned side&#xD;
      affects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons: To compare the analgesic effect of oral tramadol versus ibuprofen in such&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
