  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare ketorolac, a potent, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drug (NSAID), with ibuprofen, a commonly used NSAID, for the treatment of the painful crisis&#xD;
      of sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCD is a common disorder among African Americans and other minority groups. It is&#xD;
      characterized by chronic anemia and episodic vaso-occlusive crises. The most common of these&#xD;
      crises is the painful crisis. Current treatment of the painful crisis includes rest,&#xD;
      hydration, and analgesic medication. Morphine is the most commonly prescribed analgesic&#xD;
      medication for moderate to severe painful episodes, but there are several side effects&#xD;
      associated with its use, including somnolence, respiratory depression, constipation,&#xD;
      dysphoria, and pruritus. Other analgesic medications, including NSAIDs, may improve pain&#xD;
      control and decrease the need for morphine and other opioid drugs; however, more research is&#xD;
      needed to confirm the benefits in individuals with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 120 children who will receive standard opioid and supportive therapy.&#xD;
      In addition to this care, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the&#xD;
      following: 1) intravenous ketorolac and oral placebo; or 2) intravenous placebo and oral&#xD;
      ibuprofen. Outcome assessments will include the duration of hospitalization for opioid&#xD;
      therapy; the degree of pain intensity and relief determined by validated pain scales; and the&#xD;
      utilization of opioid medications during hospitalization. All participants will be monitored&#xD;
      for potential adverse effects of the study medications by laboratory measurements and&#xD;
      clinical assessments. Additionally, participants will self-report pain levels using the&#xD;
      Oucher pain scale. Participants will be monitored for the development of adverse events,&#xD;
      including gastrointestinal symptoms and deterioration of kidney function, as determined by&#xD;
      daily kidney function tests including BUN, creatinine, and hematuria.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the time to a 50% reduction in reported pain intensity. This endpoint is relative to the baseline pain intensity rating on the Oucher scale (minimum 0, maximum 10; higher scores indicate greater pain). The endpoint will be reached when the reported pain intensity is at least one-half of the baseline value on two consecutive measurements at least 4 hours apart. The time ascribed to the endpoint will be the time of the second of these two consecutive pain scales. Participants who do not have a 50% reduction in reported pain intensity, as defined above, before discharge from the hospital will be censored at the time of last rating on the Oucher pain scale before discharge from the hospital</description>

        <title>Time to a 50% Reduction in Reported Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is the time to a 50% reduction in reported pain intensity. This endpoint is relative to the baseline pain intensity rating on the Oucher scale (minimum 0, maximum 10; higher scores indicate greater pain). The endpoint will be reached when the reported pain intensity is at least one-half of the baseline value on two consecutive measurements at least 4 hours apart. The time ascribed to the endpoint will be the time of the second of these two consecutive pain scales. Participants who do not have a 50% reduction in reported pain intensity, as defined above, before discharge from the hospital will be censored at the time of last rating on the Oucher pain scale before discharge from the hospital</description>

        <population>One participant was randomized but was discharged (unexpectedly early) from the hospital before study drug was administered. Thus, no primary or secondary outcome data are available for this one participant.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Extremely slow accrual led to the trial closing in 2008. Because less than 10% of planned enrollment was achieved, no statistical analysis of the primary or secondary outcome data was performed because of lack of power and generalizability.</limitations_and_caveats>
