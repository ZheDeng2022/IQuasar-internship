  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following liver transplantation, rapid bone loss occurs, particularly within the first 6&#xD;
      months post-transplant. This may be associated with fractures, most notable vertebral. The&#xD;
      ability to assess osteoporosis therapies in this system may provide useful information for&#xD;
      osteoporosis management in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That treatment with the bisphosphonate, zoledronate, at the time of liver&#xD;
           transplantation and at 1 month post-transplantation will prevent the early&#xD;
           transplant-related bone loss (measured by bone densitometry and biochemical bone markers&#xD;
           at 3 months) seen in patients who are not treated with a bisphosphonate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That continuing treatment with zoledronate at 3 monthly intervals for a total duration&#xD;
           of 12 months will result in further improvements in bone density beyond that seen at 3&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. That calcium and vitamin D (vit D) supplementation of liver transplant patients does not&#xD;
           prevent marked bone loss following transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in&#xD;
      liver transplant patients comparing therapy with the bisphosphonate, zoledronate, to patients&#xD;
      who do not receive bisphosphonate therapy. All groups will receive calcium and vit D&#xD;
      supplementation from the time patients are listed for transplantation and for 12 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation. Recruited subjects will be 17 years or older (ie adult in terms of&#xD;
      consent requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study groups comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Zoledronate plus calcium and vit D supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronate 4 mg will be administered by intravenous infusion (details below) at baseline&#xD;
      (within 72 h of liver transplantation), followed by zoledronate 4 mg infused as outlined&#xD;
      below at 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-transplantation PLUS calcium 600mg daily (Caltrate, one&#xD;
      tablet) and ergocalciferol 1000 IU daily (Ostelin, one capsule) for 12 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Placebo plus calcium and vit D supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo will consist of 50 ml N/Saline infused over 15 minutes as for the zoledronate regime&#xD;
      PLUS calcium 600mg daily (Caltrate, one tablet) and ergocalciferol 1000 IU daily (Ostelin,&#xD;
      one capsule). Patients with low vitamin D levels (&lt;60 nmol/L) and parathyroid hormone (Pth)&#xD;
      levels above normal &gt;6.5 should receive ergocalciferol 5000 U daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronate/Placebo Infusion regime&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zoledronate 4 mg will be infused in 100 ml N/Saline over 15 minutes in patients with a&#xD;
      creatinine level &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (i.e &lt;165 Âµmol/L). Patients&#xD;
      with renal impairment as indicated by a serum creatinine level &gt;1.5 x ULN will be discussed&#xD;
      on an individual basis with the Medical Adviser of Novartis. If zoledronate is to be given,&#xD;
      an extended infusion time may be used. Renal toxicity has been reported with rapid infusions&#xD;
      (5 min) of 8 mg of zoledronate in patients with pre-existing renal failure. Further&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal failure are being undertaken by Novartis to&#xD;
      clarify this area. Zoledronate infusion should be freshly prepared and administered without&#xD;
      delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Pharmacy will be responsible for providing the infusions (zoledronate&#xD;
      reconstituted in N/Saline or N/Saline alone), appropriately masked, for both Groups 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Bone Density at 3 months post-transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal loss of bone following transplantation is seen by 3 months. Earlier data on bone loss&#xD;
      in liver transplant patients from the RPAH unit demonstrated an average of 24% bone loss by 3&#xD;
      months post-transplantation. Prevention of this effect should provide a precise and early&#xD;
      measurement of the effect of zoledronate on transplant-related bone loss. Bone density of the&#xD;
      hip, spine, and total body will be measured by dual xray absorptiometry (DEXA) at baseline&#xD;
      (not more than 6 months prior to liver transplantation), and 3, 6 and 12 months following&#xD;
      liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bone Density at 6 and 12 months post-transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
           The BMD assessments at 6 and 12 months will assess further changes in bone density&#xD;
           between the treated and control groups beyond those assessed at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biochemical Markers of Bone Metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biochemical markers of bone formation (osteocalcin and total and bone specific alkaline&#xD;
           phosphatase) and bone resorption (urinary collagen cross-links, N-teleopeptide and&#xD;
           deoxypyridinoline, as well as serum cross-links, C-teleopeptide) will be assayed in&#xD;
           serum/urine collected at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following liver&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fracture Events Fracture incidence in the RPAH patients has been previously reported as&#xD;
           17% in the first 6 months post-transplantation. The fracture rate is now probably lower&#xD;
           due to improvements in immunosuppressive therapy. It is not anticipated that this study&#xD;
           will have sufficient power to detect a significant reduction in fractures however&#xD;
           fracture events will be recorded, including reduction in height of vertebral bodies at&#xD;
           baseline and 12 months post-transplantation.&#xD;
