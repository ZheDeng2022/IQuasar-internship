      The purpose of this study is to see if providing effective antimalarial treatment at home for&#xD;
      parents/guardians to treat their children for malaria will lead to an improved health outcome&#xD;
      compared to conventional healthcare.&#xD;

      Population: Representative sample of Ugandan children aged 1 to 5 years from 400 households&#xD;
      (approximately 540 children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Site: The study will be conducted in the Mulago III parish community of Kampala,&#xD;
      Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 13 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention: *Pilot period: After enrollment, households will participate in a one&#xD;
      month pilot period to test the household pictorial diaries. At the end of the pilot period,&#xD;
      households will be randomized to participation in the home-based management of fever (HBMF)&#xD;
      arm or standard care arm for the remainder of the study (12 months). *HBMF arm: Households&#xD;
      randomized to the HBMF group will be provided with pre-packaged coartemether to keep at home.&#xD;
      Primary caregivers will be instructed to treat children participating in the study&#xD;
      empirically with coartemether at home when the child develops fever. Study personnel will&#xD;
      distribute drugs and educate the caregivers about administration of drugs, recognition of&#xD;
      danger signs of fever/malaria, and when to seek additional care. *Standard care: Households&#xD;
      randomized to the standard care arm will be asked to continue their current behaviour and to&#xD;
      manage fever in their children as they would normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Household diaries and monthly visits. Primary caregivers will be asked to keep&#xD;
      a diary regarding the health of study participants for the duration of the study (13 months).&#xD;
      Information on illnesses, treatments given, visits to health care facilities, and health care&#xD;
      expenditures will be collected. Study personnel will visit the households monthly to collect&#xD;
      completed diaries. At each visit, questionnaires will be administered to gather additional&#xD;
      data on the health of the participants and treatment seeking behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory evaluations: Temperature, height, weight, mid-upper arm&#xD;
      circumference, spleen size, haemoglobin, and thick blood smear will be assessed at&#xD;
      enrollment, and at the beginning and end of the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives: 1. To measure the impact of home-based management of fever with&#xD;
      coartemether on malaria-related morbidity compared to the current standard of care in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To measure the impact of home-based management of fever with coartemether on economic&#xD;
      measures compared to the current standard of care in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Treatment incidence density (treatments per time at risk) for each treatment&#xD;
      arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary clinical outcomes: 1) mean days of fever; 2) incidence of febrile episodes; 3) mean&#xD;
      haemoglobin at study end; 4) change in mean haemoglobin; 5) prevalence of splenomegaly; 6)&#xD;
      prevalence of parasitaemia; 7) incidence of visits to health care facilities, and&#xD;
      hospitalizations; 8) mortality rate; 9) anthropometric measurements; 10) proportion of&#xD;
      &quot;appropriate&quot; treatments; 11) proportion of delayed treatments; 12) treatment incidence&#xD;
      density of treatments given at &gt;50% and at full dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic outcomes: 1) household cost/febrile episode; 2) household costs for treatment of&#xD;
      febrile episode/month; 3) provider cost/child for delivery of HBMF; 4) estimated provider&#xD;
      facility cost/patient for uncomplicated fever, and for severe disease; 5) total net&#xD;
      cost/child/year; 6) net cost/additional child appropriately treated; 7) net cost/day of fever&#xD;
      averted&#xD;
