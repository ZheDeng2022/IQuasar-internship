  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent head and neck cancer. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the objective response rate (complete&#xD;
      response [CR] + partial response [PR]) in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head&#xD;
      and neck following treatment with GW572016 (lapatinib ditosylate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Secondary objectives of this study are to estimate time to progression, describe the&#xD;
      adverse event profile, and to obtain preliminary assessments of changes in pre- versus&#xD;
      post-treatment measurements for selected biomarkers in tumor cells from these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=&#xD;

             institution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility of patients receiving medications or substances known to affect, or with&#xD;
             the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of GW572016 will be&#xD;
             determined following review of their use by the Principal Investigator; patients&#xD;
             requiring oral anticoagulants (coumadin, warfarin) are eligible provided there is&#xD;
             increased vigilance with respect to monitoring international normalized ratio (INR);&#xD;
             if medically appropriate and treatment available, the investigator may also consider&#xD;
             switching these patients to low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, where an interaction&#xD;
             with GW572016 is not expected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of GW572016 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Able to retain and absorb medication given by mouth or feeding tube&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
                  nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered&#xD;
                  more than 4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have had prior treatment with EGFR targeting therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or receiving concurrent&#xD;
             anticancer therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to GW572016&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GW572016 is member of the&#xD;
             4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with GW572016,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with GW572016; human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral&#xD;
             therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
             with GW572016; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease resulting in an inability to take&#xD;
             oral medication, malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for intravenous (IV)&#xD;
             alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption, uncontrolled&#xD;
             inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)&#xD;
