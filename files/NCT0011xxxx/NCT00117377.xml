    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify how pimecrolimus cream 1% modifies the molecular and&#xD;
      cellular changes associated with the post-lesional phase of atopic dermatitis (AD). Healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and patients with atopic dermatitis will be studied.&#xD;
