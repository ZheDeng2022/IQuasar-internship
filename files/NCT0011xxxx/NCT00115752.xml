  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how genetic makeup contributes to the variation in people regarding&#xD;
      their sensitivity to and experience of pain. Scientists believe that differences in&#xD;
      information found in genes may explain why an analgesic drug, that is, one that treats pain,&#xD;
      works effectively for some people but not for others. The study will explore pain that is&#xD;
      acute (fast and short period). Knowledge gained from this ongoing study may permit&#xD;
      development of an individualized analgesic drug prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 16 to 35 who are in good health and have been referred for removal of impacted&#xD;
      wisdom teeth; who are not allergic to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (known as NSAIDs), sulfites, or certain anesthetics; who are not pregnant or nursing; and who&#xD;
      are willing to have a biopsy before and after dental surgery are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will come to the clinic for one test visit and one treatment visit. During the first&#xD;
      visit, a questionnaire will evaluate patients' psychological state, including mood and&#xD;
      depression. There will be a clinical examination of their wisdom teeth. A blood sample of 10&#xD;
      milliliters (about 0.4 ounces) will be collected from the forearm to provide DNA material&#xD;
      containing genes stored in cells. The primary genetic analysis will be done at NIH, although&#xD;
      the DNA collected might also be sent to a laboratory outside NIH. DNA samples will be coded&#xD;
      so that names of patients cannot be traced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, two of the patients' lower wisdom teeth will be removed. Patients&#xD;
      will be given a local anesthetic in the mouth and a sedative given through a vein in the arm.&#xD;
      While the mouth is numb, a small piece of tissue will be removed from inside the cheek, near&#xD;
      the wisdom tooth. It is the first biopsy. After the two wisdom teeth are removed, a small&#xD;
      piece of tubing will be placed into both sides of the mouth where the teeth were removed.&#xD;
      Every 20 minutes, for the next 3 hours, the researchers will collect inflammatory fluid from&#xD;
      the tubing, to measure the chemicals thought to cause pain and swelling. Also every 20&#xD;
      minutes, patients will rate the pain they feel by answering questions. If there is pain&#xD;
      before 3 hours following surgery, they will receive a dose of fentanyl to relieve moderate to&#xD;
      severe pain. A second biopsy will occur 3 hours after surgery, to measure changes in&#xD;
      chemicals produced in response to surgery. Immediately afterward, patients will receive 30 mg&#xD;
      of ketorolac (Toradol) whether or not pain is felt. They will answer questionnaires about&#xD;
      pain for 3 hours after receiving the drug, to rate how well it works. They will stay at the&#xD;
      clinic up to 6 hours after the surgery. If pain is not relieved with ketorolac, patients will&#xD;
      receive a one-time dose of tramadol, a pain medication for moderate to severe pain. After the&#xD;
      study procedures are completed, patients will receive pain medication for pain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored closely, because all drugs have side effects. Ketorolac is a&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, one that may cause gastrointestinal upset. Fentanyl is a&#xD;
      powerful narcotic drug that is safe at the dosage used in this study, but stomach upset,&#xD;
      dizziness, and breathing trouble may occur. Also, risks from the biopsy include discomfort&#xD;
      from injecting the numbing medicine, infection, and bleeding. There may be discomfort from&#xD;
      the sedative injected into the vein, and there may be bruising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits from participating are having wisdom teeth removed at no cost as well as close&#xD;
      monitoring before and after surgery. There are no plans to give patients the results of&#xD;
      genetic tests or questionnaires. Years of research may be needed before such information has&#xD;
      the chance to become meaningful.&#xD;

      The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the role of genetic factors including single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms from cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 gene on acute pain after tissue injury&#xD;
      and the analgesic effect of a COX inhibitor. Patients will be healthy volunteers scheduled&#xD;
      for the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Genotyping will be performed before&#xD;
      surgery and patients stratified to treatment with a COX inhibitor in this protocol or to&#xD;
      other protocols examining different polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under local anesthesia, 2 mandibular third molars will be removed. Microdialysis sampling in&#xD;
      the extraction socket will be performed with pre- and post-surgical biopsies. Patients will&#xD;
      receive a COX inhibitor as an analgesic drug for the post-operative pain. Outcomes evaluated&#xD;
      will include clinical pain response, gene expression profile using microarray and&#xD;
      quantitation of related proteins after oral surgery and the interaction of these factors with&#xD;
      analgesia by a COX inhibitor. By studying these responses in patient samples for each&#xD;
      genotype (non-variant homozygote, heterozygote and variant homozygote) from the COX-2 gene,&#xD;
      we will attempt to replicate and extend previous findings on the role of genetic factors in&#xD;
      the inflammatory process, clinical pain and variation in response to analgesic drugs.&#xD;
