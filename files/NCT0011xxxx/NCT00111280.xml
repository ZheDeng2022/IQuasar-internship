  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, roll-over trial to evaluate the long term safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of TMC125, administered as part of an individually optimized antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy, in HIV 1 infected subjects. In addition, the antiviral activity and immunological&#xD;
      effect of TMC125 as part of an antiretroviral regimen over time, and the evolution of HIV&#xD;
      phenotype and genotype will be evaluated.&#xD;

      The purpose of this Phase II, open-label, roll-over trial is to evaluate the long term safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of TMC125, administered as part of an individually optimized antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy, in HIV 1 infected subjects. In addition, the antiviral activity and immunological&#xD;
      effect of TMC125 as part of an antiretroviral regimen over time, and the evolution of HIV&#xD;
      phenotype and genotype will be evaluated. Subjects who were randomized to an active control&#xD;
      arm of any sponsor-selected TMC125 trial and virologically failed or completed the entire&#xD;
      treatment period, or to placebo arm and were treated for at least 48 and who may derive&#xD;
      benefit from TMC125 treatment as judged by the investigator can be enrolled. Based on the&#xD;
      currently selected studies, a maximum of 170 subjects will be enrolled in the current trial.&#xD;
      A dose of 800mg b.i.d . of TMC125 (formulation TF035) and after the formulation switch, 200mg&#xD;
      b.i.d. (formulation F060), will be given in combination with an investigator-selected,&#xD;
      optimized underlying therapy starting at baseline and consisting of at least 2 drugs&#xD;
      (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and/or allowed protease inhibitors [PIs]&#xD;
      and/or enfuvirtide [T 20]) for 48 weeks. Tolerability and safety will be assessed throughout&#xD;
      the trial. The efficacy parameters will be determined at defined time points during the&#xD;
      trial. The trial will involve a screening visit preferable on the same day as the withdrawal&#xD;
      visit of the sponsor-selected trial, a baseline visit, a treatment period of 48 weeks, a&#xD;
      final visit and a 4 week follow-up period. TMC125, 800 mg twice a day and after formulation&#xD;
      switch, at 200 mg twice a day&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject having previously been randomized to an active control arm of a sponsor&#xD;
             selected TMC125 trial and has completed the entire treatment period or has met the&#xD;
             definition of virological failure, as defined in the original protocol, before TMC125&#xD;
             C211 screening or subjects who were randomized in a fully blinded TMC125 trial, being&#xD;
             unblinded after treatment for at least 48 weeks and identified as having received&#xD;
             placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to take TMC125 in combination with the investigator-selected&#xD;
