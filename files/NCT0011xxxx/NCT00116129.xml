  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of an orally administered growth hormone stimulating drug,&#xD;
      (code named MK-0677) in the treatment of female subjects with primary fibromyalgia. The basis&#xD;
      for this study is the observation that many fibromyalgia patients are growth hormone&#xD;
      deficient; an earlier study of injectable growth hormone had shown benefit in this population&#xD;
      of fibromyalgia patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines whether MK-0677 treatment will improve symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is the observation that many fibromyalgia patients are growth&#xD;
      hormone deficient in terms of low levels of IGF-1, and that improving IGF-1 levels with&#xD;
      growth hormone injections has been shown to improve fibromyalgia symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MK-0677 is an orally administered growth hormone secretagogue manufactured by Merck &amp; Co.,&#xD;
      Inc. that acts on the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the anterior pituitary to&#xD;
      stimulate the release of growth hormone. This pathway represents an additional regulation of&#xD;
      growth hormone release from pituitary somatotrophs to that mediated by growth hormone&#xD;
      releasing hormone (stimulating) and somatostatin (inhibitory). Both stimulatory pathways lead&#xD;
      to a pulsatile release of growth hormone, with approximately 4 hour intervals between peak&#xD;
      levels. This growth hormone secretion leads to a rapid and robust up regulation of IGF-1&#xD;
      levels by about 50 to 100% that can be maintained with chronic therapy at a dose of 25&#xD;
      mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of MK-0677 25 mg in primary fibromyalgia subjects over a&#xD;
           24-week treatment period, as assessed by the FIQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-0677 25 mg in subjects with fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of this study are to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MK-0677 25 mg is superior to placebo in reducing muscle tenderness, as assessed by the&#xD;
           Fibromyalgia Myalgic Score (FMyS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MK-0677 25 mg is superior to placebo in improving the subjects' global perception of&#xD;
           change in fibromyalgia symptoms, as assessed by the Subjects' Global Impression of&#xD;
           Change Questionnaire (PGIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MK-0677 25 mg is superior to placebo in improving the subjects' quality of life, as&#xD;
           assessed by the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QOL).&#xD;
