    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the Celacade™ system in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with chronic&#xD;
      systolic heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence continues to accumulate on the importance of inflammation in the development and&#xD;
      progression of heart failure (HF). The Celacade™ system may reduce chronic inflammation by&#xD;
      stimulating the immune system's physiological anti-inflammatory response. The ACCLAIM study&#xD;
      is an international, approximately 2,000-patient, Phase III clinical research study designed&#xD;
      to test the safety and efficacy of the Celacade™ system in reducing the risk of mortality and&#xD;
      cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with chronic systolic HF.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≦ 30%, measured within the past six months&#xD;
             (by any technique), unless there was a cardiovascular event that could have modified&#xD;
             the LVEF during that period (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], myocardial&#xD;
             infarction [MI]). If the patient was started on a beta-blocker or biventricular pacing&#xD;
             (cardiac resynchronization therapy, or CRT), the LVEF measurement must have been at&#xD;
             least three months after starting the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalized for heart failure; OR, received intravenous (IV) administration of an&#xD;
             inotropic agent (therapeutic dose for HF), human B-natriuretic peptide, or IV diuretic&#xD;
             (minimum 40 mg of furosemide or equivalent) in a clinic, outpatient or emergency&#xD;
             department within the past 12 months (stable for at least 2 weeks). Exceptions:&#xD;
             patients in NYHA Class III or IV who have a LVEF of &lt; 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On standard therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF), which must include angiotensin&#xD;
             converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (unless&#xD;
             contraindicated or patient is intolerant), with or without other appropriate agents.&#xD;
             If on a beta-blocker, patient must have been on a beta-blocker for at least three&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No changes in active cardiac medications for heart failure during the two weeks prior&#xD;
             to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with the conditions of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of a transplanted tissue or organ or left ventricular assist device (LVAD)&#xD;
             (or the expectation of the same within the next 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned Automatic Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (AICD) or CRT within the next 12&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute MI, or CABG, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), AICD, or CRT within the&#xD;
             past three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need for chronic intermittent inotropic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy: evidence of disease within the previous five years. Exceptions: basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma, provided that it is neither infiltrating nor sclerosing, and carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within the first six months of&#xD;
             delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic corticosteroids, cytostatics, immunosuppressive drug therapy&#xD;
             (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), and DNA depleting&#xD;
             or cytotoxic drugs taken within four weeks prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, or patients of childbearing potential not using adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Porphyria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to sodium citrate or any &quot;caine&quot; type of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous Celacade™ treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient scheduled for hospice care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or laboratory tests at the screening assessment that would&#xD;
             interfere with the objectives of the study or that would, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, preclude safe completion of the study. Abnormal findings could include: known&#xD;
             HIV infection or other immunodeficiency state, chronic active viral infection (such as&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C), acute systemic infections (defined as patients undergoing treatment&#xD;
             with antibiotics), gastrointestinal tract bleeding, or any severe or acute concomitant&#xD;
             illness or injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical, social, or geographical factor that would make it unlikely that the&#xD;
             patient could comply with study procedures (e.g., alcohol abuse, lack of permanent&#xD;
             residence, severe depression, disorientation, distant location, or a history of&#xD;
             noncompliance).&#xD;
