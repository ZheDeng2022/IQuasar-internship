      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in&#xD;
      Uganda. Although effective tools for prevention and control of malaria exist, their delivery&#xD;
      presents a problem. Intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine&#xD;
      (SP) is effective, yet &gt;60% of women in Uganda do not get it as &lt; 40%, attend antenatal care.&#xD;
      Effective ways of delivering IPT with SP to pregnant women at a community level need to be&#xD;
      developed. This study assessed whether community based resource persons like traditional&#xD;
      birth attendants (TBAs), community reproductive health workers (CRHWs), adolescent peer&#xD;
      mobilizers (APMs) and drug-shop owners (DSV) can distribute IPT with SP to pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objectives of this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess community based approaches for delivering malaria prevention to pregnant women&#xD;
           in Uganda;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria treatment&#xD;
           and prevention in pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether community based resource persons can deliver IPT to pregnant women and&#xD;
           reach those most at risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of IPT on anaemia and pregnancy outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate cost-effectiveness of the approaches and assess the acceptability and&#xD;
           sustainability of the approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study was conducted in 5 sub-counties of the Mukono district, situated on the&#xD;
      shores of L. Victoria in Central Uganda. The district is hyper-endemic for malaria. 25&#xD;
      parishes with a total population of 75,000 people were used to test the new approaches. Phase&#xD;
      1 obtained qualitative data on community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with&#xD;
      malaria prevention in pregnancy. Phase 2 was an intervention study that assessed distribution&#xD;
      of IPT to pregnant women by TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs compared with health units. Pregnant&#xD;
      women of all parities were enrolled. Key resource persons in each parish were identified to&#xD;
      sensitise the communities on the intervention. Data was collected regarding: timing of the&#xD;
      first dose of SP, proportion of women who complete two doses of SP, birth weight of babies,&#xD;
      proportion of low birth-weight babies, and proportion of adolescent pregnancies. The third&#xD;
      phase of the study evaluated the sustainability of the approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Plan: The first phase of the study took two months. The second phase took 14-16 months.&#xD;
      Data analysis was expected to take 12 months.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The objectives of this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess new community based approaches for delivering malaria prevention to pregnant&#xD;
           women in Uganda;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess community perceptions, beliefs and practices associated with malaria treatment&#xD;
           and prevention in pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs can administer IPT with SP to pregnant&#xD;
           women at a community level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs can reach women at most risk of malaria in&#xD;
           pregnancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of community based distribution of IPT with SP on anaemia in&#xD;
           pregnancy and birth outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the acceptability and sustainability of delivering IPT with SP to pregnant&#xD;
           women at a community level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the new community based approaches for delivering&#xD;
           malaria prevention interventions to pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted in the Mukono district, Central Region, Uganda. The district is&#xD;
      situated 50-150kms east of Kampala. The district has an estimated population size of&#xD;
      1,128,500. The district lies at altitudes from 1,158m to 1,219m and is bordered by Kayunga&#xD;
      district in the North and Lake Victoria in the South. It has high temperatures and heavy&#xD;
      rainfall during the months of March to May and October to November. The district is divided&#xD;
      into 6 counties, 28 sub-counties and 145 parishes. A sub-county usually has a population of&#xD;
      about 30,000 people while a parish has approximately 3,000 people. The Baganda are the&#xD;
      majority tribe in the district. Other tribes include: Basoga, Badama, Banyole, Banyarwanda,&#xD;
      Barundi, Balulu, Lugbar and Jaluos. There is a high fertility rate, of 7.2 births per woman&#xD;
      and an annual population growth rate of 2.3%. The district is hyper- to holoendemic for&#xD;
      malaria. The population is served by 4 hospitals, 5 health centres IV, 23 health centres III&#xD;
      and 25 health centres II. There are numerous drug-shops, TBAs, private midwives and CHRWs who&#xD;
      provide health care in the district. Drug shops are licensed and registered at the District&#xD;
      Health Office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five rural sub-counties from the lake- shore region with the same level of malaria&#xD;
      transmission were selected. Within each sub-county, 5 parishes were selected based on:&#xD;
      availability of a health centre II, III or IV, and trained TBAs, DSVs, CRHWs and APMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study population included all the pregnant women who live in the study&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE ONE: Meetings and discussions were held with civic leaders, women leaders, and&#xD;
      community resource persons in the study areas to present the study and solicit consent from&#xD;
      the community and opinion leaders. A formative study was carried out to explore the&#xD;
      communities' ideas about approaches to deliver malaria prevention and to assess perceptions,&#xD;
      beliefs and practices associated with malaria prevention in pregnancy. Focus group&#xD;
      discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews targeting pregnant women, opinion leaders, and men&#xD;
      and women in different age groups were conducted in each sub-county. FGDs had 6-7&#xD;
      participants within the same age range and sex. In-depth interviews were held with DSVs,&#xD;
      TBAs, opinion leaders, traditional healers, CRHWs, APMs and health workers in each&#xD;
      sub-county. A survey was conducted in the 25 parishes to get a register of the number of&#xD;
      women in the reproductive age group and the number of women currently pregnant. The total&#xD;
      population in the 25 parishes is approximately 75,000 people of which 43% are in the&#xD;
      reproductive age group. Pregnant women were given cards with personal identification numbers&#xD;
      (PINs) and a GPS map was constructed for easy tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE TWO: An intervention study testing community based approaches for delivering IPT with&#xD;
      SP to pregnant women was conducted. The study had four delivery approaches: TBAs, DSVs, CRHWs&#xD;
      and APMs were trained to give a two dose regimen of SP to pregnant women. These approaches&#xD;
      were compared with routine services at health centres II to IV. The intervention was coupled&#xD;
      with community mobilisation and sensitisation to ensure that all women were informed on the&#xD;
      intervention. Information materials and posters were distributed in the study areas to&#xD;
      indicate the benefits of malaria prevention and where to get SP. All pregnant women who&#xD;
      visited DSVs, TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and health centres and consented to participate in the study&#xD;
      were recruited and given IPT with SP once during the second and third trimester. Baseline&#xD;
      data were obtained on Hb levels, parasitaemia, history of previous illnesses, obstetric&#xD;
      history and socio-demographic data. Appointments were made for the pregnant women to have a&#xD;
      blood sample taken for investigations before receiving the first dose of SP. TBAs, CRHWs,&#xD;
      APMs and DSVs were trained to keep appropriate calendars of scheduled visits for the second&#xD;
      dose of SP. Pregnant women received health education, iron and folic acid supplementation,&#xD;
      de-worming and information on proper nutrition. All pregnant women used their card with PIN&#xD;
      number for identification wherever they went to get care. The women were encouraged to&#xD;
      deliver at health units. TBAs, CRHWs, APMs and DSVs were supplied with baby weighing scales&#xD;
      for babies who are delivered at home (within 5 days of delivery). Pregnant women who had a&#xD;
      history of allergy to sulphonamide containing drugs were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who consented to participate were told about the necessity of taking a blood sample to&#xD;
      check Hb levels and malaria parasites. Local laboratory assistants were hired, trained and&#xD;
      supervised for quality control. Women were given appointments to visit the laboratory&#xD;
      assistants or go to a laboratory in the study area. Two blood samples were taken, one at&#xD;
      recruitment and another at 36 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timing of the first dose of SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of women who complete two doses of SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Birth weight of babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of low birth-weight babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal Hb and malaria parasite counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of adolescent pregnancies enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of pregnant women who agree to take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of scheduled visits completed by each delivery approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The costs per low birth weight of babies avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The costs per anaemic pregnant woman avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mothers' perceptions on the four different SP delivery outlets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculations were based on Pockock, 1983 and three outcome variables were&#xD;
      used: Hb level of 11.0 gm/dl, standard deviation (SD) 1.5 gm/dl; mean birth weight of&#xD;
      3000gms, SD 500gms; and proportion of women who take malaria prophylaxis in Uganda, currently&#xD;
      estimated at 34%. To detect differences in Hb of 0.5 gm/dl, birth weight of 150gms and a&#xD;
      change of 12% in the proportion of women using malaria prophylaxis; between the control and&#xD;
      any delivery approach of the study, the sample sizes required are 170, 211, and 310 for the&#xD;
      three variables respectively, allowing for a 20% loss of follow up. For this study, the&#xD;
      sample size of 310 was taken for each arm giving a total sample size of 1,550.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost component of the intervention study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all of the approaches an attempt was made to collect information from a societal point of&#xD;
      view so that all costs could be included irrespective of who pays for them. The approaches&#xD;
      incurred costs falling into three main categories: patient related costs, supplier costs and&#xD;
      health facility based costs. Patient related costs due to malaria illness in pregnancy was&#xD;
      collected as part of the overall intervention study. A questionnaire was developed to capture&#xD;
      costs borne by the pregnant women and the families as a result of malaria related morbidity&#xD;
      (e.g. number of visits to health centres and hospitals to seek ANC as well as treatment for&#xD;
      malaria illnesses, transport costs, transport time, number of SP pills consumed, time lost by&#xD;
      the pregnant woman due to malaria illness and time lost by family members to provide care.&#xD;
      The questionnaire was administered to all women immediately after birth. Supplier costs&#xD;
      referred to the costs of enabling TBAs, DSVs, CHRWs and APMs to distribute SP (e.g. training&#xD;
      costs of suppliers as well as delivery costs). Interviews with TBAs, CRHWs and APMs were&#xD;
      conducted to assess time spent on average per week distributing SP. The total number of SP&#xD;
      tablets distributed was recorded. Regarding health facility based costs, the patient&#xD;
      questionnaire identified the average number of health facility visits per pregnant woman for&#xD;
      ANC and malaria related morbidity. Two hospitals and six health centres were randomly&#xD;
      selected from the study areas and visited to collect the relevant costing information.&#xD;
      Bottom-up costing was used to estimate the costs of patient specific inputs such as drugs&#xD;
      prescribed and laboratory tests taken for individual patients. This was done in the hospital&#xD;
      through a review of a sample of malaria patient notes and in health centres through&#xD;
      examination of a sample of OPD cards for malaria patients. All remaining costs were&#xD;
      determined utilizing standard step-down costing. As the main measures of effect, the number&#xD;
      of low birth weight babies per pregnancy avoided and the number of anaemic women per&#xD;
      pregnancy avoided was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE THREE: Following the intervention study, data was collected from a sample of women who&#xD;
      participated in the study and the community resource persons to get their views on&#xD;
      sustainability of the delivery system. This was a qualitative study using FGDs and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA GENERATED BY THE STUDY: The formative study generated qualitative data on perceptions,&#xD;
      beliefs and practices associated with malaria prevention in pregnancy; data on costs of the&#xD;
      interventions; and data on acceptability and sustainability of the community based&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: After completing and validating field forms, data was double data entered and&#xD;
      validated using EPINFO version 6.0. Analysis was done using SPSS PC for Windows Version 10.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics was computed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare&#xD;
      differences in means. Logistic regression analysis will be used to identify factors&#xD;
      associated with access, utilisation and impact of malaria prevention interventions.&#xD;
      Qualitative data will be analysed thematically to explain some of the findings and help in&#xD;
      interpretation of quantitative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS: The results will be disseminated at the national level to policy&#xD;
      makers, program managers and the scientific community in Uganda. Dissemination will take&#xD;
      place within the study district and the participating communities. Data will be published in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The research proposal was be submitted to the Ethics Committee in&#xD;
      Denmark and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology for approval. Informed&#xD;
      consent (verbal) was obtained from all pregnant women participating in the intervention.&#xD;
      Consent was obtained from community leaders, women and opinion leaders. Sterile needles and&#xD;
      syringes were used to draw blood. The women were informed about laboratory examination&#xD;
      results. Women received explanations on the following issues: advantages and disadvantages of&#xD;
      the intervention; and possible adverse effects with use of SP in pregnancy. An explanation&#xD;
      was given to the women that they were free to withdraw from the epidemiological study any&#xD;
      time and they had access to SP if they wished. All malaria cases and other diseases that&#xD;
      arose during pregnancy were treated and referral of complicated cases made.&#xD;
