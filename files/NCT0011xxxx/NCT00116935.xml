  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who have been diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive imatinib (Gleevec) either for 12 or for&#xD;
      36 months following surgery. The study participants are required to have a histologically&#xD;
      verified GIST with a high risk of GIST recurrence despite complete removal of all macroscopic&#xD;
      GIST tissue at surgery. The high/very high risk of recurrence is defined as one of the&#xD;
      following: 1) the largest tumor diameter is over 10 cm; 2) the mitosis count is high (over 10&#xD;
      mitoses per 50 high power microscope fields, HPFs); 3) the largest tumor diameter over 5 cm&#xD;
      and the mitosis count is over 5/50 HPFs; 4) tumor spillage has taken place into the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity at the time of surgery or following spontaneous tumor rupture. All study participants&#xD;
      will receive imatinib 400 mg/day orally, but the duration of imatinib administration will be&#xD;
      determined randomly (either for 12 or for 36 months). The study participants will be followed&#xD;
      up using blood tests and computed tomography (or MRI) of the abdomen. The computed tomography&#xD;
      examinations will be performed at 6 month intervals for a median of 5 years. A total of 280&#xD;
      patients will be entered into the study. The study hypothesis is that adjuvant imatinib may&#xD;
      prevent some of the GIST recurrences, and that there may be a difference in the rate of GIST&#xD;
      recurrence between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, prospective, phase III, multicenter study carried out in&#xD;
      the Nordic countries and in Germany. Following macroscopically complete surgery, the study&#xD;
      participants will be allocated to receive imatinib either for 12 or for 36 months. At&#xD;
      randomization, the patients are stratified into 2 strata: 1) local disease (1 GIST tumor); 2)&#xD;
      intra-abdominal implants or resectable intra-abdominal/hepatic metastases, or intra-abdominal&#xD;
      spillage is present, or R1 surgery has been carried out (microscopic disease has been left&#xD;
      behind). The imatinib dose is 400 mg/day administered with food. Imatinib dose adjustments&#xD;
      are made as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history, current medication, weight, height, and ECOG performance status are recorded&#xD;
      prior to study entry. Physical examination, blood cell counts, blood biochemistry, pregnancy&#xD;
      test, chest X-ray or CT, and CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis are carried out/measured&#xD;
      prior to study entry. FDG-PET is an optional staging examination. Research serum samples are&#xD;
      collected for banking prior to initiating imatinib and at 6-month intervals during the study.&#xD;
      Tumor tissue is reviewed centrally to confirm the histological diagnosis of GIST, and KIT and&#xD;
      PDGFRA gene mutation analyses will be performed from stored GIST tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants are monitored during adjuvant treatment and following adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment. Physical examination, weight and ECOG performance status are assessed at 4- to&#xD;
      26-week intervals. Adverse events are collected using structured forms at the times of the&#xD;
      evaluation visits. Blood cell counts and blood biochemistry are measured at 2- to 6-week&#xD;
      intervals during imatinib therapy, and at 6-month intervals following completion of adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy. CT or MRI examinations of the abdomen and pelvis are performed at 6-month intervals&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
