  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stage I and II low grade follicular lymphoma are randomised between standard&#xD;
      therapy (involved field radiotherapy) and investigational therapy (involved field&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy plus rituximab). The main endpoint is progression free survival&#xD;
      but overall survival and the influence of t(14;18) status will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is the only modality which has been proven to have curative potential in&#xD;
      patients with localised low grade lymphoma. Despite excellent control of the local tumour,&#xD;
      most patients relapse outside the area treated with radiation and most of these ultimately&#xD;
      die from lymphoma. This study tests the hypothesis that the addition of six cycles of&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus rituximab (systemic chemotherapy) can eradicate undetectable lymphoma&#xD;
      deposits outside the radiation field and thereby improve the cure rate. The study will&#xD;
      specifically test the hypothesis that six cycles of adjuvant CVP chemotherapy&#xD;
      (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone) in combination with Rituximab will improve&#xD;
      progression-free survival for patients with stage I and II low-grade follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      treated with involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT). That is, will patients given radiotherapy&#xD;
      plus systemic chemotherapy live longer or remain free from disease longer than patients&#xD;
      treated with radiation alone? Radiotherapy alone is widely regarded as the standard treatment&#xD;
      for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of secondary endpoints to the study, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison the pre- and post-treatment prevalence of the t(14:18) translocation, in&#xD;
           peripheral blood and bone marrow, of patients treated with either IFRT alone or IFRT&#xD;
           plus chemotherapy. This translocation is potentially a marker for minimal residual&#xD;
           disease and eradication of the marker from blood cells may have prognostic implications.&#xD;
           The clinical value of &quot;molecular remission&quot; as an early predictor of freedom from&#xD;
           progression (FFP) and survival will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of overall survival and FFP for patients treated with IFRT alone with overall&#xD;
           survival and FFP for patients treated with combined IFRT and systemic therapy. Delay of&#xD;
           progression of disease may be of limited value if overall survival is the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of acute and late toxicity and second malignancy rates for patients treated&#xD;
           with IFRT or IFRT plus systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Delineation of the location of first relapse in relation to radiation therapy fields.&#xD;
