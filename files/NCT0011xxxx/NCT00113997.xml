      This 1-week study will test the safety and dosing of an anticoagulation system called REG1&#xD;
      that is designed to improve control of &quot;blood thinning.&quot; Patients with heart attack and other&#xD;
      conditions require treatment with an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to prevent the formation&#xD;
      of blood clots. However, anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding. The REG1&#xD;
      system is designed to minimize this risk. One part of the system stops the activity of factor&#xD;
      IX (a protein that helps blood clot) while the other part of the system (the antidote)&#xD;
      inactivates the drug and stops the thinning process. This study will examine in normal&#xD;
      healthy subjects how the REG1 system works in the body and how it leaves the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 12 and 65 years of age who weigh 50-120 kilograms (110-264&#xD;
      pounds) and have no history of bleeding problems or significant bleeding may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must avoid foods that may alter the blood's clotting ability and must not take&#xD;
      any medications the week of the study. They undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for an overnight stay. Two catheters&#xD;
      (plastic tubes) are placed in the subject's arm veins, one for drawing blood samples and the&#xD;
      other for injecting one of the following: REG1 drug, REG1 antidote, REG1 drug and antidote,&#xD;
      or placebo. Two injections of study medication are given, spaced 3 hours apart, each over a&#xD;
      1-minute period. After each injection, blood is collected at specific times to measure levels&#xD;
      of the drug or antidote in the body and the blood's ability to clot. Subjects also provide a&#xD;
      24-hour urine collection and stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample is drawn 24 hours after the drug or antidote injection from the previous day.&#xD;
      If the blood test result is normal, subjects are discharged home with instructions to follow.&#xD;
      They return to the Clinical Center at 36 hours and 48 hours for additional blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 3 and 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample is collected at the end of day 3 and day 7. Urine and stool samples are also&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Given the central role of thrombosis in the pathobiology of acute ischemic heart disease,&#xD;
      injectable (intravenous or subcutaneous) anticoagulants have become the foundation of medical&#xD;
      treatment for patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina and&#xD;
      myocardial infarction; ACS) and for those undergoing coronary revascularization procedures,&#xD;
      either percutaneously or surgically (Harrington et al., 2004; Popma et al., 2004). Currently&#xD;
      available anticoagulants include unfractionated heparin (UFH), the low molecular weight&#xD;
      heparins (LMWH), and the direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) (e.g., recombinant hirudin,&#xD;
      bivalirudin, and argatroban). The present paradigm both for anticoagulant use and for&#xD;
      continued antithrombotic drug development is to establish a balance between efficacy&#xD;
      (reducing the risk of ischemic events) and safety (minimizing the risk of bleeding)&#xD;
      (Harrington et al., 2004). Each of the available agents carries an increased risk of bleeding&#xD;
      relative to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major adverse event associated with anticoagulant and antithrombotic drugs is bleeding,&#xD;
      which can cause permanent disability and death (Ebbesen et al., 2001; Levine et al., 2004).&#xD;
      Generally, cardiovascular clinicians have been willing to trade off an increased risk of&#xD;
      bleeding when a drug can reduce the ischemic complications of either the acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes or of coronary revascularization procedures. However, recent data have suggested&#xD;
      that bleeding events, particularly those that require blood transfusion, have a significant&#xD;
      impact on the outcome and cost of treatment of patients with ACS. Transfusion rates in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery range from 30-60%,&#xD;
      and transfusion in these patients is associated with increased short, medium and long-term&#xD;
      mortality (Bracey et al., 1999; Engoren et al., 2002; Hebert et al., 1999). Bleeding is also&#xD;
      the most frequent and costly complication associated with percutaneous coronary interventions&#xD;
      (PCI), with transfusions being performed in 5-10% of patients at an incremental cost of&#xD;
      $8000-$12,000 (Moscucci, 2002). In addition, the frequency of significant bleeding in&#xD;
      patients undergoing treatment for ACS is high as well, ranging from 5% to 10% (excluding&#xD;
      patients who undergo CABG), with bleeding and transfusion independently associated with a&#xD;
      significant increase in short-term mortality (Moscucci et al., 2003; Rao et al., 2004).&#xD;
      Therefore, despite the continued development of novel antithrombotics, a significant clinical&#xD;
      need exists for safer anticoagulant agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hospitalized patients with acute ischemic heart disease, the ideal anticoagulant would be&#xD;
      deliverable by intravenous or subcutaneous injection, immediately effective, easily dosed so&#xD;
      as not to require frequent monitoring and immediately and predictably reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UFH is the only antidote-reversible anticoagulant currently approved for use. However, UFH&#xD;
      has significant limitations. First, heparin has complex pharmacokinetics that make the&#xD;
      predictability of its use challenging (Granger et al., 1996). Second, the dose predictability&#xD;
      of its antidote, protamine, is challenging, and there are serious side effects associated&#xD;
      with its use (Carr and Silverman, 1999; Welsby et al., 2005). Finally, heparin can induce&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia (HIT) and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) (Warkentin, 2005;&#xD;
      Warkentin and Greinacher, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these limitations, heparin remains the most commonly used anticoagulant for&#xD;
      hospitalized patients primarily because it is &quot;reversible.&quot; Newer-generation anticoagulants,&#xD;
      such as the LMWHs have improved upon the predictability of UFH dosing and do not require&#xD;
      lab-based monitoring as part of their routine use. HIT and HITT are observed less frequently&#xD;
      with the LMWHs, relative to UFH, but they have not eliminated this risk. Two of the three&#xD;
      commercially available DTIs, lepirudin and argatroban, are specifically approved for use in&#xD;
      patients who have developed or have a history of HIT. Bivalirudin is approved for use as an&#xD;
      anticoagulant during PCI and therefore provides an attractive alternative to UFH in patients&#xD;
      who have HIT. However, there are no direct and clear antidotes to reverse the anticoagulant&#xD;
      effects of the LMWHs, nor of the DTIs, which presents a particular risk to their use in&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures (Jones et&#xD;
      al., 2002). Bleeding in patients treated with LMWH's or DTI's is managed by administering&#xD;
      blood products (including clotting factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid reversal of drug activity can be achieved by formulation of a drug as an infusible&#xD;
      agent with a short half-life, or via administration of a second agent, an antidote, that can&#xD;
      neutralize the activity of the drug. Short-acting direct thrombin inhibitors such as&#xD;
      bivalirudin, which can be reversed simply by cessation of infusion, are being developed as&#xD;
      infusible anticoagulants for use in CABG surgery (Merry et al., 2004). However, the&#xD;
      co-morbidities such as renal dysfunction, present in a large percentage of patients&#xD;
      undergoing CABG (or PCI) procedures (Al Suwaidi et al., 2002), may preclude rapid clearance&#xD;
      of the drug and thus delay reversal of activity, and/or the relatively large quantity of drug&#xD;
      required to sustain anticoagulation (i.e., necessary to achieve effective steady state levels&#xD;
      of a short-half-life agent) may significantly interact with underlying renal impairment to&#xD;
      compound the problem. Therefore, it remains to be seen if these drugs will indeed achieve&#xD;
      rapid reversal of anticoagulation following stoppage of infusion in the target patient&#xD;
      populations, and whether the clearance of the drug itself may exacerbate renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach to providing controlled anticoagulation embraced by Regado&#xD;
      Biosciences is the utilization of an anticoagulating agent with medium-term duration of&#xD;
      action (~12 hours) that can achieve clinically appropriate activity at relatively low doses,&#xD;
      in combination with a second agent capable of specifically binding to and neutralizing the&#xD;
      primary anticoagulant. Such a &quot;drug-antidote&quot; combination can ensure predictable and safe&#xD;
      neutralization and reversal of the anticoagulant activity of the drug (Rusconi et al., 2004;&#xD;
      Rusconi et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cell-based model of coagulation (Hoffman et al., 1995; Kjalke et al., 1998; Monroe et&#xD;
      al., 1996) (Figure 1) provides the clearest explanation to date of how physiologic&#xD;
      coagulation occurs in vivo. The advance of this model over prior descriptions of the&#xD;
      coagulation reaction is that it incorporates the cellular surfaces upon which the specific&#xD;
      coagulation factors accumulate and react, and thereby more accurately explains the phenotypes&#xD;
      observed in individuals lacking, or deficient in, the various coagulation factors and&#xD;
      platelet receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this model, the procoagulant reaction occurs in three distinct steps,&#xD;
      initiation, amplification and propagation. Initiation of coagulation takes place on tissue&#xD;
      factor-bearing cells (e.g., activated monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells).&#xD;
      Coagulation factor VIIa, which forms a complex with tissue factor, catalyzes the activation&#xD;
      of coagulation factors IX (FIX) and X (FX), which in turn generates a small amount of&#xD;
      thrombin from prothrombin. In the amplification phase (also referred to as the priming&#xD;
      phase), the small amount of thrombin generated in the initiation phase activates coagulation&#xD;
      factors V, VIII, and XI and also activates platelets, which supplies a surface upon which&#xD;
      further procoagulant reactions occur. In vivo, the small amounts of thrombin generated during&#xD;
      the amplification phase are not sufficient to convert fibrinogen to fibrin, due to the&#xD;
      presence of endogenous thrombin inhibitors termed serpins, such as anti-thrombin III,&#xD;
      -2-macroglobulin and heparin cofactor II. The final phase of the procoagulant reaction,&#xD;
      propagation, occurs exclusively on the surface of activated platelets. During propagation,&#xD;
      significant amounts of FIXa are generated by the FXIa-catalyzed activation of FIX. FIXa forms&#xD;
      a complex with its requisite cofactor FVIIIa, which activates FX. Subsequently, FXa forms a&#xD;
      complex with its requisite cofactor FVa. The FXa-FVa complex activates prothrombin, which&#xD;
      leads to a &quot;burst&quot; of thrombin generation and fibrin deposition. The end result is the&#xD;
      formation of a stable clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon this model, FIXa play two roles in coagulation. In the initiation phase, FIXa&#xD;
      plays an important role in generating small amounts of thrombin via activation of FX to FXa&#xD;
      and subsequent prothrombin activation. However, this role of FIXa is at least partially&#xD;
      redundant with the tissue factor FVIIa-catalyzed conversion of FX to FXa. The more critical&#xD;
      role of FIXa occurs in the propagation phase, in which the FVIIIa/FIXa enzyme complex serves&#xD;
      as the sole catalyst of FXa generation on the activated platelet surface. Therefore, a&#xD;
      reduction in FIXa activity, either due to genetic deficiency in FIX (i.e. hemophilia B) or&#xD;
      pharmacologic inhibition of FIX/IXa, is expected to have several effects on coagulation.&#xD;
      First, inhibition or loss of FIXa activity should partially dampen the initiation of&#xD;
      coagulation. Second, inhibition or loss of FIXa activity should have a profound effect on the&#xD;
      propagation phase of coagulation, resulting in a significant reduction or elimination of&#xD;
      thrombin production. Finally, limitation of thrombin generation during the propagation phase&#xD;
      will at least partially quell feedback amplification of coagulation by reducing activation of&#xD;
      platelets and upstream coagulation factors such as factors V, VIII and XI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhibitors of FIX activity, such as active site-inactivated factor IXa (FIXai) or monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies against FIX (e.g., the antibody BC2), have exhibited potent anticoagulant and&#xD;
      antithrombotic activity in multiple animal models, including various animal models of&#xD;
      arterial thrombosis and stroke (Benedict et al., 1991; Choudhri et al., 1999; Feuerstein et&#xD;
      al., 1999; Spanier et al., 1998a; Spanier et al., 1997; Spanier et al., 1998b; Toomey et al.,&#xD;
      2000). In general, these studies have shown that FIXa inhibitors have a higher ratio of&#xD;
      antithrombotic activity to bleeding risk than unfractionated heparin in animals. However, in&#xD;
      these studies, at doses marginally higher than the effective dose, animals treated with these&#xD;
      agents have exhibited bleeding profiles no different than heparin. Such an experience in&#xD;
      well-controlled animal studies suggests that, in the clinical setting, the ability to control&#xD;
      the activity of a FIXa inhibitor would enhance its safety and facilitate its medical use. In&#xD;
      addition, FIXai has been shown to be safe and effective as a heparin replacement in multiple&#xD;
      animal surgical models requiring anticoagulant therapy, including rabbit models of synthetic&#xD;
      patch vascular repair, as well as canine and non-human primate models of CABG with&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (Spanier et al., 1998a; Spanier et al., 1997; Spanier et al., 1998b).&#xD;
      FIXai has also been used successfully for several critically ill patients requiring&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass and in the setting of other extracorporeal circuits such as&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Spanier et al., 1998a) by physicians at the Columbia&#xD;
      College of Physicians and Surgeons, on a compassionate care basis. Thus, FIXa is a validated&#xD;
      target for anticoagulant therapy in coronary revascularization procedures (both CABG and&#xD;
      PCI), and for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis in patients suffering from acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes.&#xD;
