      Psoriasis is a common skin disease affecting an estimated 2.6% of the US population. It is a&#xD;
      chronic, recurrent condition for which there is no cure, but there are ways to control it.&#xD;
      Psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia (abnormal increase in the number of&#xD;
      normal cells of the outer layer of the skin). Tetrathiomolybdate (TM), a copper chelator (a&#xD;
      drug that removes copper from the bloodstream) was first created to treat Wilson's disease, a&#xD;
      disorder caused by too much copper in the blood. Studies in animals have since shown that TM&#xD;
      may also prevent the formation of new blood vessels and may also block the key components of&#xD;
      inflammation (swelling, redness, and pain) caused by psoriasis. TM is not approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for any use yet. It is an investigational drug used for clinical research. We propose to test&#xD;
      whether a new treatment with TM can in fact improve or stabilize psoriasis.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tetrathiomolybdate in&#xD;
      psoriasis therapy. Psoriasis is a common skin disease affecting an estimated 2.6% of the US&#xD;
      population. It is a chronic, recurrent condition for which there is no cure but ways to&#xD;
      control it. Psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, increased dermal&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and infiltration of activated lymphocytes. Beginning with the observation that&#xD;
      cyclosporin A, whose primary action is to inhibit lymphokine release and proliferation of T&#xD;
      cells, was effective in the treatment of psoriasis, the last two decades saw a major paradigm&#xD;
      shift in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, from a view of psoriasis as a disease of epidermal&#xD;
      origin to a view of it as an epidermal response to immunological injury. In fully activated T&#xD;
      cells in psoriatic skin, the T1/T2 cytokine balance is shifted in favor of T1 expression,&#xD;
      with production of IL-2 and IFN-γ. Activated T1 lymphocytes also produce TNF-α. This is a&#xD;
      pivotal cytokine that regulates an array of proinflammatory mediators. Recently, anti-TNF-α&#xD;
      therapy using a chimeric anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody (infliximab) and a&#xD;
      TNF-receptor-immunoglobulin fusion protein (etanercept) have shown to be highly effective in&#xD;
      patients with severe psoriasis. Efforts to treat psoriasis by inhibiting neovascularization&#xD;
      of psoriatic plaques have also been shown to be effective. A randomized phase I/II clinical&#xD;
      trial using Neovastat, a naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis, resulted in&#xD;
      dose-dependent improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, thus&#xD;
      providing further evidence that altered angiogenesis is an integral part of psoriasis&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Since TM has proven antiangiogenic and anti-TNF-α activities, we are very&#xD;
      encouraged that TM therapy will be beneficial in psoriasis.&#xD;
