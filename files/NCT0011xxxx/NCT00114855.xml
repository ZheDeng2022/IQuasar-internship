  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine to what degree Hypocol® (Red Yeast Rice) may lower&#xD;
      low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in a European population. The effect of Red Yeast&#xD;
      Rice on fasting blood glucose and inflammatory markers will also be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical end-point trials have demonstrated that lowering cholesterol levels with statins&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. Subgroup analyses of the large&#xD;
      clinical studies, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention (WOSCOP) and Cholesterol and&#xD;
      Recurrent Events (CARE), have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins may extend to&#xD;
      mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. A variety of mechanisms accounting for these effects&#xD;
      have been suggested. Among these, the anti-inflammatory activity is particularly attractive&#xD;
      because inflammation is considered an early step in the development of atherosclerosis. Thus,&#xD;
      statin therapy has been shown to lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a plasma&#xD;
      marker of inflammation, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Furthermore, statins may possess&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties by their ability to reduce the number of inflammatory cells in&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques. Red Yeast Rice contains Lovastatin and lowers LDL-cholesterol.&#xD;
      However, it is not known to what degree Red Yeast Rice may lower LDL-cholesterol in a&#xD;
      European population. Some reports have suggested an effect of Red Yeast Rice on fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose by an unknown mechanism.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with mild Type IIa, Type IIb or IV hyperlipidaemia (LDL-cholesterol &gt;3.0&#xD;
             mmol/L&lt; 6.0 mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting serum TG level &lt; 4.5 mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mildly elevated blood glucose defined as at least one of three of the following&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HbA1c% &gt;5.5% &lt; 7.5%;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fasting glucose &gt; 5.5 mmol/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus on stable oral antihyperglycemic treatment for more than&#xD;
                  8 weeks and HbA1c% &lt; 7.5% at the time for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., post-menopausal (defined as &gt;12&#xD;
             months since last menstrual period) or surgically sterilised, or using adequate&#xD;
             barrier contraception if of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking lipid-lowering medication and are not able to complete the 4-week&#xD;
             wash-out prior to the start of the dietary run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active malignant disease the last 5 years (excluding treated basal cell&#xD;
             carcinoma).&#xD;
