  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Policy makers and consumers are increasingly concerned about the quality and efficiency of&#xD;
      care provided to individuals with severe, chronic illnesses such as schizophrenia. These&#xD;
      illnesses are expensive to treat and present significant challenges to organizations that are&#xD;
      responsible for providing effective care. Occurring in 1% of the United States population,&#xD;
      schizophrenia accounts for 10% of permanently disabled people, and 2.5% of all healthcare&#xD;
      expenditures. Clinical practice guidelines have been promulgated. Schizophrenia is treatable&#xD;
      and outcomes can be substantially improved with the appropriate use of antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication, caregiver education and counseling, vocational rehabilitation, and assertive&#xD;
      treatment. However, in the VA and other mental health systems, many patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia receive substandard care. Methods are needed that improve the quality of usual&#xD;
      care for this disorder while being feasible to implement at typical clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most efforts to improve care for schizophrenia have focused on educating clinicians&#xD;
      or changing the financing of care, and have had limited success. We believe a more&#xD;
      fundamental approach should be tried. While there are many potential strategies, experience&#xD;
      in chronic medical illness and mental health support the efficacy of specific approaches.&#xD;
      Collaborative care models are one such approach. They are a blueprint for reorganizing&#xD;
      practice, and involve changes in division of labor and responsibility, adoption of new care&#xD;
      protocols, and increased attention to patients' needs. Although collaborative care models&#xD;
      have been successful in other chronic medical conditions, they have not yet been studied in&#xD;
      the treatment of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a collaborative care model for schizophrenia that builds on work in other&#xD;
      disorders, and includes service delivery approaches that are known to be effective in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The model focuses on improving treatment through assertive care management,&#xD;
      caregiver education and support, and standardized patient assessment with feedback of&#xD;
      information to psychiatrists. This project, &quot;EQUIP&quot; (Enhancing Quality Utilization In&#xD;
      Psychosis) is implementing collaborative care and evaluating its effectiveness in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;

      have been successful in other chronic medical conditions, they have not yet been studied in&#xD;
      the treatment of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a collaborative care model for schizophrenia that builds on work in other&#xD;
      disorders, and includes service delivery approaches that are known to be effective in&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The model focuses on improving treatment through assertive care management,&#xD;
      caregiver education and support, and standardized patient assessment with feedback of&#xD;
      information to psychiatrists. This project, &quot;EQUIP&quot; (Enhancing Quality Utilization In&#xD;
      Psychosis) is implementing collaborative care and evaluating its effectiveness in&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project was to implement the care model at two large VA mental health&#xD;
      centers, and evaluate its effect on clinicians, the organization of care, and treatment&#xD;
      appropriateness, utilization and outcomes in veterans with schizophrenia. We hypothesized&#xD;
      that this care model would increase provider adherence to treatment guidelines and improve&#xD;
      the quality of care. We planned to describe implementation of the model, and barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to its implementation. We planned to evaluate the model by comparing treatment&#xD;
      under the care model with usual care. Changes in the structure of care were evaluated using&#xD;
      qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQUIP was a controlled trial of the care model. At two VA medical centers, clinicians (n=66)&#xD;
      and their patients (n=398) were randomized to an intervention or a control condition. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, a chronic care model was implemented for 15 months. Before, during, and&#xD;
      after implementation, surveys and semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians&#xD;
      and managers to assess their clinical practices, competencies, expectations, experiences, and&#xD;
      observations concerning the implementation. Data sources included patient interviews,&#xD;
      clinician interviews, and data from VistA. The feasibility of more broadly implementing the&#xD;
      collaborative care model was assessed utilizing qualitative and quantitative information&#xD;
      about the model's strengths and weaknesses, factors that facilitated/impeded implementation,&#xD;
      direct costs of implementation and maintenance, and effects on treatment service utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is complete. Data analyses are ongoing. Reports are being written and&#xD;
      published. Presentations are being given.&#xD;
