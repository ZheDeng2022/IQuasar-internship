  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Zestra(TM) in&#xD;
      women with acquired mixed desire/interest/arousal/orgasm disorders under conditions of home&#xD;
      usage. The primary efficacy hypothesis will compare the effect of Zestra versus placebo on&#xD;
      the incidence of &quot;successful and satisfactory&quot; sexual encounters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zestra(TM)&#xD;
      compared to a placebo oil in women diagnosed as having acquired mixed&#xD;
      interest/desire/arousal/orgasm disorders with varying presentations of each component in&#xD;
      conditions of home use in conjunction with sexual activities. The study is a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel design trial. After subject screening, there is an&#xD;
      open-label, placebo run-in period of four weeks, followed by a double-blinded 12 week&#xD;
      treatment period. This design is consistent with the Paris 2003 recommendations for female&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction (FSD) clinical trials and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance&#xD;
      on Clinical Development of Products for the Treatment of Female Sexual Dysfunction although&#xD;
      the duration of active treatment in this study is 12 weeks rather than the 6 months suggested&#xD;
      by the FDA for Phase 3 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy assessment will be the subjects' assessments of &quot;successful and&#xD;
      satisfactory&quot; sexual encounters as recorded in a diary (question 10 in the Female Sexual&#xD;
      Encounter Profile [FSEP©]). Secondary evaluations of efficacy will include the other FSEP&#xD;
      questions, a subject self-assessment questionnaire (Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI©]),&#xD;
      two global assessment questions, a treatment satisfaction questionnaire (WITS©), the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS), a consumer testing survey (QualiLife&#xD;
      Consumer Testing Survey [QCTS©]), and a distress scale (Female Sexual Distress Scale&#xD;
      [FSDS©]), sexual encounter frequency, and drop-out rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of outcome measures in this study is based on the most current information&#xD;
      available. The FSEP© has been used in many FSD studies and specifically meets the FDA&#xD;
      recommendations for a primary outcome measure. The initial validation study of the FSEP© was&#xD;
      presented at the 11th World Congress of the International Society for Sexual and Impotence&#xD;
      Research in Buenos Aires in 2004. The FSFI©, the FSDS©, and global assessment questions are&#xD;
      routinely used in FSD trials, and the first two have been subjects of ongoing validation for&#xD;
      a number of years. Global assessment questions have historically been used to calculate&#xD;
      response rates. The QCTS© is a consumer testing survey which addresses issues ultimately&#xD;
      impinging on product marketability. WITS© is a female oriented treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      instrument newly developed by Stanley E. Althof, Ph.D., Eric W. Corty, Ph.D., and Miki&#xD;
      Wieder, M.A., 2004; the authors' authorized use of this instrument in this study is part of&#xD;
      the ongoing validation for this questionnaire. Since depression can contribute to FSD and FSD&#xD;
      can contribute to depression, seriously confounding diagnostic and treatment schema, the&#xD;
      commonly used Beck Depression Inventory will be administered at the end of the baseline&#xD;
      run-in period and then at the end of the double-blinded treatment period. Relational factors&#xD;
      have the same confounding issues as depression; thus, the participants' attitudes about their&#xD;
      relationships with their partners will be assessed at baseline and end of treatment using the&#xD;
      Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Sexual encounter frequency may prove a useful outcome measure since&#xD;
      a beneficial effect of treatment may be reinforcing, while lack of efficacy by the placebo&#xD;
      may be discouraging. A similar hypothesis is the basis of drop-out analysis.&#xD;
