      Electrical stimulation of the foot can increase blood flow out of the leg. This increased&#xD;
      blood flow can prevent blood clots from forming in the leg veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood clots in the leg veins can break off and form life-threatening blood clots in the&#xD;
      lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent external pneumatic (air) compression of the foot is already used to increase&#xD;
      blood flow in at risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Electrical stimulation of the foot increases blood flow out of the legs to the&#xD;
      same degree as intermittent external pneumatic (air) compression of the foot.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT Background: Venous stasis caused by immobility is an important risk factor for&#xD;
      venous thromboembolic disease. This is especially true for orthopedic patients with multiple&#xD;
      trauma and those undergoing other orthopedic procedures. A safe and convenient method for&#xD;
      reducing venous stasis would be useful for preventing venous thrombosis in patients while in&#xD;
      hospital and particularly after discharge during rehabilitation. In a prior study, we&#xD;
      demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the foot was a safe and convenient method for&#xD;
      counteracting venous stasis. In this study, we compare the effects on venous blood flow of&#xD;
      intermittent pneumatic compression, an established method, to electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 40 healthy volunteers aged 50 - 80 were seated for 4 hours during which they&#xD;
      received mild electrical stimulation of the sole of the foot (plantar plexus of muscles) or&#xD;
      intermittent pneumatic compression. Popliteal and femoral venous blood flow velocities were&#xD;
      measured via Doppler ultrasound. Blood flow in the non-stimulated or non-compressed lower&#xD;
      extremity served as a simultaneous control. Subjects completed a questionnaire regarding&#xD;
      their acceptance and tolerance of both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION Venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism or venous thromboembolism (VTE) are&#xD;
      important complications of medical and surgical conditions that are associated with prolonged&#xD;
      immobilization. This is especially true for orthopedic patients with multiple trauma and&#xD;
      those undergoing other orthopedic procedures. Immobilization is also a major contributor to&#xD;
      the increased risk of VTE associated with prolonged air travel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite good evidence that prophylaxis is effective, there is widespread under utilization of&#xD;
      prophylaxis for VTE following major surgical procedures as well as medical conditions that&#xD;
      produce weakness or prolonged bed rest. There is also good evidence that the risk of VTE&#xD;
      continues for weeks after major orthopedic as well as other types of surgery. It is now&#xD;
      recognized that VTE occurring in the hospital and outside the hospital setting is a single&#xD;
      entity and that extended prophylaxis with anticoagulants reduces the risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulant prophylaxis after hospital discharge although indicated in certain high risk&#xD;
      groups is inconvenient since the recommended methods, LMWH and fondaparinux must be&#xD;
      administered by subcutaneous injection and warfarin requires laboratory monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical methods that increase blood flow in the leg veins are effective for reducing venous&#xD;
      thrombosis in high-risk hospitalized medical and surgical patients. These methods include:&#xD;
      high intensity electrical calf stimulation during surgery, graduated compression stockings&#xD;
      and intermittent pneumatic compression of the leg or foot. Of these, only graduated&#xD;
      compression stockings, which are not very effective, can be used after hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Graduated compression stockings, however, cannot be adapted to fit all leg shapes, may be&#xD;
      improperly applied, have a tendency to slip down the leg and are found to be uncomfortable by&#xD;
      many patients. High intensity electrical calf muscle stimulation is painful and can only be&#xD;
      used during general anesthesia. AC powered external pneumatic compression can only be used&#xD;
      while the patient is fully immobilized. Thus, alternative convenient methods are needed which&#xD;
      can be used both in the immobilized and partly mobile patient, particularly after hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have attempted to overcome the limitations of currently available physical devices by&#xD;
      using mild electrical stimulation of the plantar muscles of the feet. Each electrical&#xD;
      discharge elicits a foot twitch that causes the intrinsic foot muscles to contract. This&#xD;
      contraction compresses the plantar plexus of veins, thereby increasing venous velocity in the&#xD;
      popliteal and femoral veins that is transmitted proximally up the leg veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our plantar foot stimulation device is powered by a 9-volt battery and small enough to be&#xD;
      inserted into a sock. It has the potential to be worn while a patient is immobile, standing&#xD;
      or walking, and therefore is suitable for use both during the initial period of&#xD;
      immobilization and throughout convalescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an earlier study we reported that mild electrical stimulation of the plantar foot muscles&#xD;
      caused an increase in blood flow comparable to that produced by direct calf stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this new study is to determine if, over a 4 hour period, mild electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of the plantar foot muscles increases venous blood flow velocity to the same&#xD;
      degree as intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) of the leg in both obese and non-obese&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS IRB approval and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Forty&#xD;
      healthy subjects (N = 40) between the ages of 50 to 80 participated in the study. Half of the&#xD;
      subjects (N = 20) were non-obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 30. The other half of the&#xD;
      subjects (N = 20) were obese with a BMI &gt; 30. Exclusion criterion included a prior history of&#xD;
      deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or any trauma or surgery involving any part of&#xD;
      the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were studied over 2 sessions. At each session, subjects received either electrical&#xD;
      foot stimulation or intermittent pneumatic compression of one foot. The other lower extremity&#xD;
      served as a control. Subjects received either therapy at one session and the other therapy at&#xD;
      a second session at least 48 hours later. The right or left leg of each subject was randomly&#xD;
      assigned as the same control leg for both studies. The type of therapy given at the first&#xD;
      session was also randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study otherwise followed the protocol used in our initial study of electrical foot&#xD;
      stimulation. Subjects were seated for 4 hours in chairs placed at a fixed distance apart.&#xD;
      They were constantly monitored throughout the study to ensure that they remained seated.&#xD;
      Subjects were allowed to use a bathroom located several feet away only twice during the 4&#xD;
      hour period. During the 4 hour study period subjects were offered a maximum of 16 ounces of&#xD;
      fluid and a normal lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical foot stimulation was produced by surface electrodes placed on the sole of the foot&#xD;
      over the plantar muscle group. Electrical stimulation was delivered by the Focusâ„¢&#xD;
      Neuromuscular Stimulation System, Empi, Inc. (St. Paul, MN.) The crucial stimulus parameters&#xD;
      were: biphasic symmetrical square wave at 50 pulses per second, phase duration of 300&#xD;
      microseconds, a starting ramp up time of 2 seconds and a finishing ramp down time of 2&#xD;
      seconds per stimulation cycle, and a stimulation cycle of 12 seconds &quot;on&quot; and 48 seconds&#xD;
      &quot;off&quot; per minute. Stimulation was increased to an intensity just sufficient to create a&#xD;
      slight visible muscle twitch. This level of intensity caused no evident discomfort in any of&#xD;
      the subjects in our first study. Subjects were continually monitored throughout this study&#xD;
      for any indication of discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent pneumatic compression of the leg consisted of external intermittent pneumatic&#xD;
      compression with a knee high device. A Tyco Healthcare Kendall Novamedix A-V impulse systemÂ®&#xD;
      Model 6060 (Mansfield, MA 02048) was used. Operating parameters were: 130mmHg impulse&#xD;
      pressure with a 3 second impulse duration; &quot;Program Preset 1&quot; for deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      prophylaxis. The compression followed the approved standard patient protocol used at our&#xD;
      institution detailed in &quot;Utilization of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) Stockings&#xD;
      for DVT Prophylaxis&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Popliteal and femoral venous peak blood flow velocities were measured bilaterally using a&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound device at 0, 15, 120, and 240 minutes. The same ultrasound technician&#xD;
      obtained all Doppler studies on all subjects throughout the study. All Doppler tracings were&#xD;
      be read by the same independent reader in a blinded fashion. Immediately following completion&#xD;
      of each 4 hour session of electrical foot stimulation or intermittent pneumatic compression,&#xD;
      subjects were asked to complete a brief questionnaire regarding their acceptance and&#xD;
      tolerance of electrical stimulation or intermittent pneumatic compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS This study utilized a repeated measures design with two within group&#xD;
      factors: time to measurement, and stimulation (stimulation, control). Stimulation groups&#xD;
      [electrical foot stimulation and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC)] were not&#xD;
      independent. Blood flow measurements (at time = 120, 240) were analyzed with t tests and a&#xD;
      mixed model. Within the mixed model, the group effect is a fixed effect, and the subject&#xD;
      parameter is a random effect. The primary research question was the non-inferiority of the&#xD;
      experimental treatment (electrical foot stimulation) relative to standard treatment&#xD;
      (intermittent pneumatic compression). The non-inferiority index was 5.0 cm/sec; this index&#xD;
      was formulated prior to analysis. The questionnaire results were analyzed using Fisher's&#xD;
      Exact test. P-values that were less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically&#xD;
      significant. All analyses were done with SAS 9.1, Cary, NC.&#xD;
