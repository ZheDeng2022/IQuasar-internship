             conventional techniques, or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with a spiral computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have melanoma that can be biopsied once before, and at least twice after, MEDI-522&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females of at least 18 years of age at the time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of reproductive potential (defined as being &lt;1 year post-menopausal) must have a&#xD;

             contraceptives, intrauterine device [IUD], condom, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical&#xD;
             cap, abstinence, or sterile sexual partner) at the time informed consent is signed&#xD;
             (women only) or at the time of the initiation of MEDI-522 (men only), and must agree&#xD;
             to continue using such precautions while receiving MEDI-522 and for 30 days after the&#xD;
             final dose of MEDI-522&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;

             aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) greater than or equal to 3 x&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN); serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL;&#xD;
             hepatic alkaline phosphatase greater than or equal to 3.0 x ULN; prothrombin time (PT)&#xD;
             or international normalized ratio (INR) within normal range (unless a patient is&#xD;
             receiving anticoagulation therapy); or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal&#xD;
             range&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior radiation therapy are eligible, provided that therapy was&#xD;
             palliative in nature, not in the area where the tumor will be biopsied, and all&#xD;
