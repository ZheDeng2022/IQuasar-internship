  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see which of the two most common drugs used to treat&#xD;
      bronchiolitis works better. A child's participation in this study is expected to last less&#xD;
      than 4 hours. Approximately 600 patients will be recruited to participate in this study at&#xD;
      Kern Medical Center (KMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchiolitis is a very common lung infection in babies. There are many drugs used to treat&#xD;
      this disease but nobody knows which one, if any, works the best. Two of the most commonly&#xD;
      used drugs are albuterol and epinephrine. These are both drugs given during breathing&#xD;
      treatments with oxygen and a mask. We are doing this study to see which of these drugs works&#xD;
      better or if they are both equally good. The study works as follows: after the consent&#xD;
      process the baby gets three treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nebulizer 1 (Treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment + 30 minutes (approximately) Nebulizer 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment + 60 minutes (approximately) Nebulizer 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment + 120 minutes (approximately)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baby will be reevaluated and either discharged home or revert to standard therapy. If the&#xD;
      baby is discharged directly from the emergency department (E.D.), we will call you in three&#xD;
      days time to see how he/she is doing.&#xD;

      Double blind RCT. Primary outcome measure is admission defined as actual admission or&#xD;
      discharge with unscheduled return leading to admission within 72 hours. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include change in severity of illness and response of respiratory parameters to treatment.&#xD;
