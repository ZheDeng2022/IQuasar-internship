    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental drug, Org 24448, for&#xD;
      short-term treatment of depression. It will examine the effects of the drug on symptoms, such&#xD;
      as low mood and persistent sadness, poor sleep and appetite, poor motivation and lack of&#xD;
      enjoyment of things people normally enjoy, negative thinking, and feeling slowed down or&#xD;
      having trouble concentrating. It will also assess whether the drug improves cognitive&#xD;
      function, especially memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with major depression who do not have a serious, unstable medical illness and who are&#xD;
      21 to 55 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      psychiatric and medical history, diagnostic interview, physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, blood tests and, for women, a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are tapered off anti-depression drugs (and any other medications not allowed on&#xD;
      the study) over a 3-week period and then begin a 2-week drug-free period. During these 2&#xD;
      weeks they have an electroencephalogram (EEG) with light stimulation, and those whose EEG&#xD;
      indicates a seizure disorder are excluded from the study. Also at the beginning of the&#xD;
      drug-free period they begin taking a placebo (&quot;sugar pill&quot;) twice a day. After 2 weeks on&#xD;
      placebo, some patients begin treatment with Org 24448, while others remain on placebo. They&#xD;
      continue the medication for 8 weeks, during which time they have a weekly check of vital&#xD;
      signs, blood and urine tests, and rating scales for depression and anxiety. Level of&#xD;
      functioning is evaluated twice during the study. After 8 weeks of treatment, patients have a&#xD;
      physical exam, electrocardiogram (ECG), EEG, blood tests, and begin to come off the study&#xD;
      drug, tapering the medication over a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above procedures, some patients undergo the following tests during the&#xD;
      2-week drug-free period and again toward the end of the 8-week medication phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing, including measurements of cognitive abilities such as&#xD;
           memory, attention, problem-solving, and language skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positron emission tomography (PET): This nuclear medicine test provides information&#xD;
           about different brain regions. The patient lies on a table in the PET scanner (similar&#xD;
           to a computed tomography (CT) scanner), with a mask placed over his or her face that&#xD;
           helps keep the head still. A sugar fluid with a radioactive material attached to it is&#xD;
           injected into a catheter (plastic tube) that has been inserted into a vein in the&#xD;
           patient's arm. The scanner detects ...&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Depression is a devastating illness that is estimated to affect 12% to 17% of the population&#xD;
      at some point during the lifetime of an individual. Despite the availability of a wide range&#xD;
      of antidepressant drugs, 30% to 40% of patients with major depression fail to respond to&#xD;
      first-line antidepressant (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) treatment,&#xD;
      despite adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Thus there is a clear need to develop&#xD;
      novel and improved therapeutics for major depression. Current pathophysiological theories&#xD;
      regarding the neurobiology of depression include alterations in intracellular signaling&#xD;
      cascades, and impairments of cellular plasticity and resilience. There is recent evidence&#xD;
      suggesting that promoting growth factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may&#xD;
      provide a mechanism for the treatment of depression. New information indicating modulation of&#xD;
      glutamate receptors in the actions of antidepressant treatments suggests a novel approach to&#xD;
      develop a new class of antidepressants. Studies have shown that the biarylpropylsulfonamide&#xD;
      AMPA (2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid) receptor potentiators&#xD;
      (LY392098 and LY451616) have antidepressant effects in animal models of depression. Several&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that AMPA receptor activation can increase expression of BDNF both&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo. Thus, one possible new approach for the treatment of depression is to&#xD;
      use an AMPA receptor potentiator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we propose to compare the ampakine receptor potentiator Org 24448 to placebo&#xD;
      for the treatment of Major Depression. Inpatients and outpatients (primarily outpatients),&#xD;
      ages 21 to 70, with a diagnosis of Major Depression (without psychotic features), will be&#xD;
      randomized to double-blind treatment to either Org 24448 or placebo for a period of 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Acute efficacy will be determined by demonstrating a greater response rate using specified&#xD;
      criteria. Approximately 90 patients with acute major depression will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      in order to reach the goal of randomizing 70 patients in the controlled trial.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects, 21 to 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female subjects who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterile,&#xD;
             postmenopausal for at least one year) or must be using a medically accepted means of&#xD;
             contraception. Women using oral contraceptive medication for birth control must also&#xD;
             be using a barrier contraceptive. Women of childbearing potential must also have a&#xD;
             negative serum Beta-HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) at pre-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression (296.3) without psychotic&#xD;
             features, based on clinical assessment and confirmed by a structured diagnostic&#xD;
             interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV TR Axis I Disorders, SCID-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects have a history of at least one previous episode of depression prior to the&#xD;
             current episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have an initial score of greater than or equal to 32 on the Inventory of&#xD;
             Depressive Symptoms, Clinician version (IDS-C) at Visit 1 and Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must not have greater than a 25% decrease in the IDS-C total scores during&#xD;
             washout (between Visits 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Each subject must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and&#xD;
             examinations required by the protocol and must sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current major depressive episode of at least 4 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have not responded to adequate previous trials of at least one&#xD;
             antidepressant as determined by the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF)&#xD;
             criteria (score greater than or equal to 3). Additionally, patients who have not&#xD;
             completed antidepressants trials of adequate dose and duration due to intolerance to&#xD;
             therapy may be induced if they have demonstrated intolerance to greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 3 antidepressant medications in the current or a previous episode, and did not meet&#xD;
             ATHF criteria for a single adequate treatment trial in the current episode. 3&#xD;
             intolerant trials would count as an adequate failed trial. If this criteria has not&#xD;
             been met, the Principal Investigator may allow for a four-week prospective trial of a&#xD;
             standard antidepressant (at the patients' and clinicians' discretion) for potential&#xD;
             participants who have not responded to at least one adequate trial for the current&#xD;
             episode per inclusion criteria.&#xD;

After 4 weeks with insufficient response, the dose may be increased to 750 mg twice per day. The titration schedule may be delayed if the subject is experiencing adverse effects. The subject may be increased or decreased at the discretion of the investigator. The minimum dose allowed for the study is 250 mg once per day.</description>
