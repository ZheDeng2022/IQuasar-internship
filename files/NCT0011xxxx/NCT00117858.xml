      This project is designed to test how direct current (DC) electrical polarization of the brain&#xD;
      affects language and behavior in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is the&#xD;
      second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. It causes profound&#xD;
      disturbances of language and other cognitive functions and often results in highly disruptive&#xD;
      behavior. There is no effective treatment for the behavioral disorder or cognitive deficits&#xD;
      in FTD. In an earlier study, the researchers used DC polarization to the primary motor cortex&#xD;
      to enhance prefrontal function in healthy subjects. The experiment resulted in greater verbal&#xD;
      fluency. In a separate study of five patients with FTD, a similar effect on verbal fluency&#xD;
      was produced. The object of the current study is to replicate these findings in a larger&#xD;
      group of patients and to see if the results carry over into &quot;real world&quot; behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be 20 patients aged 35 to 75 years with FTD, referred to the Cognitive&#xD;
      Neuroscience Section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested in two sessions, separated by at least 48 hours. In one session&#xD;
      they will receive 40 minutes of anodal DC polarization; in the other they will receive 40&#xD;
      minutes of sham polarization. Participants will be tested for language, memory, and reaction&#xD;
      time before and 20 minutes after the polarization. For the behavior portion of the study, the&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory will be completed by an investigator with the caretaker on&#xD;
      admission (covering the preceding week) and again, by telephone, 1 week after discharge, to&#xD;
      cover the first week home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive no lasting benefit as a result of the study, but the study is&#xD;
      likely to yield generalizable knowledge on the effects of DC polarization treatment in FTD.&#xD;

      Introduction: In a recent sham-controlled pilot study we showed that surface anodal DC&#xD;
      polarization can improve verbal fluency in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This&#xD;
      study is designed to extend those findings in a double blind trial. Objective: To see whether&#xD;
      surface anodal DC polarization can improve verbal fluency and a global measure of behavior in&#xD;
      FTD patients. Design: We propose to treat 20 FTD patients anodal and sham DC polarization in&#xD;
      a double blind, crossover trial. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures are verbal&#xD;
      fluency and the score on the Neuropsychiatric Index, a commonly used scale for behavioral&#xD;
      problems in dementia. Secondary outcomes will include a modified behavioral scale,&#xD;
      administered every 12 hours during the study, a standard neurobehavioral rating scale, some&#xD;
      experimental tests of dominant frontal lobe function and a control task that we do not expect&#xD;
      to be affected.&#xD;
