      We propose to conduct a randomised-controlled study to investigate whether adopting&#xD;
      McRoberts' position, after 45 minutes of active pushing with no signs of progress, can&#xD;
      increase the probability of vaginal delivery, preventing the need for forceps or vacuum&#xD;
      assistance. In our study we will allow 45 minutes of pushing before a further 45 minutes of&#xD;
      either the same, or our intervention (McRoberts' manoeuvre).&#xD;

      When women are in labour, they firstly undergo the first stage of labour where the cervix&#xD;
      (neck of the womb) progresses to full dilatation. Once this occurs, they have reached the&#xD;
      second stage, where the mother can start pushing to deliver the baby. It is accepted practice&#xD;
      to allow mothers to actively push for a maximum of one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, the baby will deliver spontaneously. However, in about 30% of cases of those&#xD;
      who manage to labour to the second stage (fully dilated cervix), the obstetrician will have&#xD;
      to assist delivery by the use of forceps or vacuum extraction (instrumental delivery). There&#xD;
      are two main situations where delivery needs assistance; 'fetal distress' where the baby is&#xD;
      suspected to be compromised, or failure to progress where the baby has not delivered after&#xD;
      one hour of pushing. Unfortunately, instrumental delivery is associated with increased&#xD;
      maternal and fetal problems, particularly arising from trauma to the tissues. Therefore, the&#xD;
      identification of any new ways to increase the spontaneous delivery rate may decrease future&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder dystocia is a rare but dangerous scenario where the baby's head is delivered, but&#xD;
      the shoulders are trapped behind the pubic bones. The McRoberts' position is used in this&#xD;
      situation to deliver the baby. The mother's legs are flexed, and pushed up and out, lateral&#xD;
      to her abdomen. It is believed that this helps by flattening out the sacral bone (tail bone),&#xD;
      thereby widening the bony opening and allowing the shoulders to become free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent paper (1) reported the novel finding that McRoberts' position also doubled the&#xD;
      pressure generated by contractions compared to normal pushing. The authors believed that this&#xD;
      increase in pressure was caused by the fact that the uterus was brought closer to the&#xD;
      diaphragm that provides the power generated with pushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group wondered whether this substantial increase in pressure could be harnessed beyond&#xD;
      the rare setting of shoulder dystocia. We therefore propose to conduct a&#xD;
      randomised-controlled study to investigate whether adopting McRoberts' position, after 45&#xD;
      minutes of active pushing with no signs of progress, can increase the probability of vaginal&#xD;
      delivery, preventing the need for forceps or vacuum assistance. Studies have shown that after&#xD;
      one hour of active pushing, the fetus shows signs of increasing distress. In our study we&#xD;
      will allow 45 minutes of pushing before a further 45 minutes of either the same, or our&#xD;
      intervention (McRoberts' manoeuvre).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in their first pregnancy will be approached at 36 weeks in the antenatal clinic and&#xD;
      advised of our study in the form of written information. The majority of women will not be&#xD;
      approached again since they will not be relevant to this study, most having already&#xD;
      delivered. However, women who have been pushing for 45 minutes will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage of labour is a demanding process where it may not be practicable to obtain&#xD;
      written consent. Therefore, having given information about the trial at their 36 week&#xD;
      antenatal visit, we will enrol women after obtaining informed verbal consent. They will be&#xD;
      specifically asked whether they have read and understood the prior information given to them&#xD;
      at clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those consenting will be randomised to either continue in their current position or be placed&#xD;
      in McRoberts' position. The woman will be allowed to push for a further 45 minutes. After&#xD;
      this time, women in both groups who have not yet delivered will be aided by instrumental&#xD;
      delivery, if deemed necessary. A few days after delivery, we will provide women with a&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine patient satisfaction and how well they tolerated the procedure&#xD;
      they ended up having (i.e. Operative delivery or McRoberts position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to find a significant reduction in the number of instrumental deliveries in the group&#xD;
      of women placed in McRoberts' position as compared with the other group. A positive finding&#xD;
      may be immediately, and widely applicable.&#xD;
