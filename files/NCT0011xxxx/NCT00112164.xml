      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of activated Protein C (Xigris) for&#xD;
      improving clinical outcomes in individuals with acute lung injury (ALI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that procoagulant and inflammatory mechanisms may have a dual role in tissue&#xD;
      injury was tested in the phase III clinical trial of recombinant Xigris for severe sepsis&#xD;
      (Bernard, 2001). There was a significant reduction in mortality from 30% to 24% in patients&#xD;
      treated with Xigris. However, there is no information on the effect of Xigris on patients&#xD;
      with sepsis and co-existing ALI. Because Xigris is known to have both anti-coagulant and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties, it is plausible that it may be effective at treating patients&#xD;
      with ALI from pulmonary and non-pulmonary infectious causes. There is also a good rationale&#xD;
      for the hypothesis that Xigris may be effective at treating ALI from non-infectious causes.&#xD;
      In experimental lung injury, from a non-infectious cause, such as hyperoxia or a like&#xD;
      acid-lung injury, pro-coagulant mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of the ALI&#xD;
      (Eitzman, 1996; Barazzone, 1996). Furthermore, research has shown that plasma-protein C&#xD;
      deficiency occurs in almost all patients with ALI, and reduced Protein C levels are&#xD;
      associated with a higher mortality and more non-pulmonary organ system dysfunction, even in&#xD;
      patients with non-septic causes of ALI (Ware, 2003). Elevated levels of thrombomodulin, a&#xD;
      product of endothelial injury, were measured in the plasma of all patients with ALI&#xD;
      regardless of the clinical disorder associated with lung injury. The elevations of&#xD;
      thrombomodulin were much higher in edema fluid than in plasma, suggesting that local&#xD;
      activation and release of thrombomodulin had occurred, probably from both epithelial and&#xD;
      endothelial sources from the lung, again supporting the hypothesis that a common pathway to&#xD;
      lung injury may occur in both septic and non-septic causes of ALI. In addition, there is&#xD;
      considerable evidence that the normal fibrinolytic mechanisms are impaired in the alveolar&#xD;
      compartment in patients with ALI. Elevated levels of plasminogen-activator-inhbitor-1 (PAI-1)&#xD;
      in the plasma of pulmonary edema fluid have a predictive value for identifying patients with&#xD;
      ALI who are more likely to die than survive, regardless of the clinical risk factors that&#xD;
      predisposes the development of ALI (Prabhakaran, 2003). Thus, this supports the rationale for&#xD;
      testing Xigris as a treatment for patients with ALI, regardless of the clinical disorder&#xD;
      associated with the cause of the lung injury. Since Xigris has both anti-coagulant and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties (Esmon, 2000; Grey, 1994), this treatment could reverse both the&#xD;
      intravascular and the extravascular lung injuries and allow the lung epithelial and&#xD;
      endothelial barriers to recover from a functional breakdown of both barriers. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of the treatment of biochemical markers on alveolar epithelial injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Xigris or saline placebo, to be&#xD;
      administered continuously for 96 hours. Participants will be followed for 28 days, regardless&#xD;
      of whether the drug is stopped for an adverse event, if the participant or physician decides&#xD;
      to stop the drug, if the participant is discharged from the hospital with unassisted&#xD;
      breathing, or until death.&#xD;
