    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIF-1 is a common mediator of hypoxic and non-hypoxic pathways that affects a transcriptional&#xD;
      program leading to survival, angiogenesis, migration and invasion of cancer cells. We have&#xD;
      demonstrated that chronic administration of topotecan inhibits HIF-1alpha expression,&#xD;
      angiogenesis and tumor growth in human xenografts. Notably, the mechanism by which topotecan&#xD;
      inhibits HIF-1alpha protein expression is independent of replication-mediated DNA damage,&#xD;
      suggested a mechanism of action distinct from its cytotoxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed to explore the hypothesis that chronic administration of&#xD;
      topotecan (TPT) inhibits Hypoxia Inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression and&#xD;
      angiogenesis in patients with metastatic tumors over-expressing HIF-1alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with metastatic solid tumors expressing HIF-1alpha, for whom standard therapy&#xD;
      does not exist or would likely not be effective, will be evaluated for study eligibility. Due&#xD;
      to safety concerns, pregnant women and HIV-infected individuals are excluded from this study.&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, archival tumor tissue wil be evaluated for the expression of HIF-1alpha&#xD;
      as assessed by IHC. Only patients who have tumors that express HIF-1alpha and who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled on this study. Patients will be asked to undergo a&#xD;
      biopsy to evaluate HIF-1alpha expression before starting treatment and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment on cycle 2 (day 12 or 13 cycle 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan at the dose of 1.2 mg/m(2) will be administered orally daily x 5 for 2 weeks,&#xD;
      during a 28 days cycle. Imaging studies including CT, FDG-PET and DCE-MRI will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline, at the end of treatment on cycle 1 (day 9 or 10), end of treatment on cycle 2&#xD;
      (day 12 or 13) and then every 2 cycles and will provide information on clinical response as&#xD;
      well as tumor metabolism and angiogenesis. The repeat scans on day 9 or 10 of cycle 1 will be&#xD;
      performed solely for research purposes to evaluate for early changes in tumor metabolism and&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Additional correlative studies include evaluation of mRNA expression of HIF-1&#xD;
      target genes in tumor tissue, circulating markers of angiogenesis, and measurement of&#xD;
      circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEP). The goal of this trial is to establish whether&#xD;
      topotecan inhibits HIF-1alpha and angiogenesis in human cancers....&#xD;

&#xD;
        Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
        or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
        of study participation.&#xD;

        No unstable medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, vaccines and hormone&#xD;
        therapy with the exception of GnRH agonists) within the last 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
        nitrosoureas or mitomycin C or UCN-01); or those who have not recovered from adverse events&#xD;
        (reduce to grade 2 or less) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients&#xD;
        must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as&#xD;
        part of a Phase 0 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior therapy with topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents. Patients who are on&#xD;
        androgen suppression for the treatment of prostate cancer are eligible and will be allowed&#xD;
        to continue the androgen suppression therapy on study. No herbal/alternative medications&#xD;
        will be allowed on this study other than one multivitamin a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of&#xD;
        their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that&#xD;
        would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who&#xD;
        have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease has&#xD;
        remained stable for at least 4 months without steroids or anti-seizure medications may be&#xD;
        enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

        composition to topotecan or history of allergic reaction to any component of the topotecan&#xD;
        formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active peptic ulcer or GI condition that could alter absorption or motility.&#xD;
&#xD;

        mother is treated with topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known immune deficiency syndromes or who are HIV positive will be excluded&#xD;
