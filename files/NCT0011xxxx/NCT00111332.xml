  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipodystrophy is characterized by increased cardiovascular disease. Limited strategies are&#xD;
      available to increase cardiovascular fitness in this population, particularly among women.&#xD;
      Progressive aerobic and resistance training will increase aerobic capacity and improve&#xD;
      strength in HIV positive women with lipodystrophy.&#xD;

      Baseline Testing: Eligible patients will be tested at the General Clinical Research Center&#xD;
      (GCRC) of Massachusetts General Hospital or at the GCRC at Massachusetts Institute of&#xD;
      Technology (MIT). For women with regular menses, the admission will correspond to the early&#xD;
      follicular phase. Patients will receive a menstrual history calendar to submit at the&#xD;
      baseline and 16 week visits. A complete history and physical exam will be performed,&#xD;
      including a detailed history of all drugs being used in the treatment of the HIV disease or&#xD;
      any associated conditions. Weight will be measured and expressed as a percentage of ideal&#xD;
      body weight (IBW) and body mass index. Blood will be sampled to determine hormonal function&#xD;
      (testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, estradiol, LH, and FSH), nutritional status (albumin,&#xD;
      prealbumin), lipid parameters (HDL, LDL, cholesterol, triglycerides), immune function (CD4,&#xD;
      viral load, CBC), and thrombolytic markers (t-PA, PAI-1). An HIV test will be performed at&#xD;
      the baseline visit only, in order to document patient status. Glucose homeostasis will be&#xD;
      measured with the use of fasting glucose and insulin levels and an oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test (OGTT). Heart rate will be monitored to test cardiovascular function. A spot urine will&#xD;
      be collected for bone markers and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG). Lean body mass&#xD;
      and fat mass will be determined by a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] (to be performed&#xD;
      at the MIT CRC); total body water will be determined by bioimpedance analysis; muscle&#xD;
      cross-sectional area will be determined by anthropometric measurements. A quantitative&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scan of the thigh and abdomen will be done to measure visceral and&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat. A Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of calf muscles for determination of&#xD;
      lipid concentrations in skeletal muscle will be done. (Subjects with contraindications to&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] will be able to remain in the protocol, but the&#xD;
      MR-Spectroscopy will not be performed). A complete dietary assessment and resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure will be performed. Quality of life will be assessed using the MOS HIV&#xD;
      questionnaire and an activity questionnaire as well as the Karnofsky performance assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A submaximal exercise bicycle test will be done to assess aerobic capability, and a 6 minute&#xD;
      walk test, sit to stand and get up and go tests will be done to assess overall functional&#xD;
      status by the physical therapy (PT) department. Those who are not randomized to exercise at&#xD;
      the baseline visit, will have one repetition maximum (1 RM) testing. The 1 RM is defined as&#xD;
      the maximal amount of weight that can be lifted throughout full range of motion. The 1 RM&#xD;
      will be tested by performing exercises including calf raises, arm curls, lateral raises, knee&#xD;
      flexors, bench press and half squats. The 1 RM testing will be repeated on those who are not&#xD;
      randomized to exercise at the 8 and 16 week visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline investigation is over, subjects will be randomized into one of two groups&#xD;
      (exercise or no exercise) for 16 weeks. Strength training will be performed using standard&#xD;
      free weights under the supervision of a trained physical therapist or member of the study&#xD;
      staff. Each session begins with a 5 minute warm-up and a standard flexibility routine. The&#xD;
      strength training routine will follow and will focus on the following muscle groups: knee&#xD;
      extensors and hip extensors, ankle plantar flexors, elbow flexors, pectoralis and shoulder&#xD;
      abduction. The aerobic training program will follow the general guidelines established by the&#xD;
      American College of Sports Medicine. Training will be performed using a standard stationery&#xD;
      bicycle. Aerobic/endurance exercise will be performed with large muscle groups. The duration&#xD;
      of the aerobic component of the training session will be 20 minutes during the first two&#xD;
      weeks and 30 minutes thereafter. The intensity of the exercise will be 60% of maximal heart&#xD;
      rate during the first two weeks and 75% thereafter. As the weeks progress, the repetitions&#xD;
      and intensity of the exercise will be gradually increased. Subjects return to the GCRC at 8&#xD;
      weeks for a medical history, a physical exam, weight, and pregnancy test. Subjects return&#xD;
      again at 16 weeks for a visit identical to that at baseline.&#xD;
