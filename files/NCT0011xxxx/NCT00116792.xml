  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the combination of the thin-strut MULTI-LINK (i.e. VISION(tm) and/or&#xD;
      MINI-VISION(tm)) stent and pharmacologic therapy with the oral PPAR-gamma agonist&#xD;
      rosiglitazone will significantly reduce restenosis after intracoronary stenting in type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients. This approach would present a more effective and economical alternative to&#xD;
      the use of drug-eluting stents to reduce stent restenosis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with documented treatment&#xD;
             with insulin, oral hypoglycemics, or diet controlled by medical history. (Undocumented&#xD;
             or newly diagnosed diabetics must fulfill the American Diabetes Association&#xD;
             Criteria-Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of&#xD;
             Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetes Care 2003;26:S5-20)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification&#xD;
             (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C,&#xD;
             I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment of lesions in native coronary arteries requiring stenting. A total of two&#xD;
             separate lesions can be stented, located either in the same vessel (at least 10 mm or&#xD;
             1 cm apart) or in two separate vessels. Additional stents may be used for procedural&#xD;
             complications such as dissections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluation;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must provide written informed consent prior to the procedure using a form that&#xD;
             is approved by the local Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesion is ≥2.0 mm to ≤3.5mm in diameter (visual estimate);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individual lesions are ≤25 mm in length located in a native coronary artery;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesions are de novo lesions in native coronary vessels;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lesion stenosis is ≥50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate);&#xD;
