  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances, most patients with advanced colorectal cancer continue to have a&#xD;
      poor prognosis. 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab is a standard treatment option&#xD;
      for patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. Fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      are considered traditional chemotherapies that try to stop tumor growth by affecting how they&#xD;
      divide. Bevacizumab is a therapy to try to block the blood vessels that tumors need to grow.&#xD;
      It is considered a 'targeted agent'. Erlotinib is another targeted agent, that has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in treating lung and other cancers. This trial is assessing the potential&#xD;
      benefit of adding these second targeted agents to standard treatment.&#xD;

      -  Patients receive bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-FU intravenously. The&#xD;
           erlotinib is taken orally each day. One cycle of study therapy is 14 days. Cycles may be&#xD;
           repeated unless there are intolerable side effects or the cancer worsens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo a tumor measurement evaluation following 3 cycles of study&#xD;
           therapy, and then every 4 cycles thereafter.&#xD;

          -  No prior chemotherapy treatment for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients&#xD;
             may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation with radiosensitizing&#xD;
             chemotherapy. The last course of adjuvant chemotherapy must have concluded &gt; 12 months&#xD;
             prior to registration. Patients may not have previously received irinotecan,&#xD;
             oxaliplatin, antiangiogenesis agent, or EGFR inhibitor therapy in either the adjuvant&#xD;
             or metastatic setting. No concurrent use of additional investigational agents&#xD;
             (including up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment) is allowed while participating in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palliative radiation for metastatic disease is allowed, however at least 4 weeks must&#xD;
