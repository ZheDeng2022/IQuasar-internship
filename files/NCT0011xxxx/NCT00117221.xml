      This study will investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of brain activity during&#xD;
      sleep. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that in the absence of&#xD;
      external stimuli, the brain continues to show spatial patterns of activity that resemble&#xD;
      those during sensory and cognitive tasks. This phenomenon greatly affects the interpretation&#xD;
      of neuroimaging studies based on positive emission tomography (PET) and fMRI, which rely on&#xD;
      the contrast between brain activity during a task and activity during rest. In addition,&#xD;
      resting state activity in itself may reveal information on the large-scale organization of&#xD;
      neuronal networks and on functional abnormalities related to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants should represent a broad cross section of the healthy adult population. Any&#xD;
      neurologically and psychiatrically healthy male or nonpregnant female between 18 and 65 years&#xD;
      old may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies will be conducted in the In Vivo NMR Research Center. Concurrent electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG) and MRI studies will last between 1 and 2 hours. A typical study involves 15 minutes of&#xD;
      anatomical MRI scanning followed by a 60-minute functional scan during which the subject&#xD;
      relaxes with eyes closed and is encouraged to sleep while the fMRI/EEG are performed.&#xD;
      Participants may be scanned 1 to 20 times. No more than 1 scan will be performed per day and&#xD;
      no more than 20 scans will be performed within a year. During the last 5 to 10 minutes of the&#xD;
      scan, the participant will open his or her eyes and actively participate in a visual&#xD;
      stimulation or attention task. The participant's alertness will be measured by a behavioral&#xD;
      (button-press) response. The visual stimuli (contrast reversing checkerboard displays,&#xD;
      alternated with uniform grey fields) will be presented using the standard projection system&#xD;
      available with the MRI scanner. The attention task will involve repeated visual presentation&#xD;
      of groups of letters and digits; the participant will be asked about the correspondence&#xD;
      between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) scans will be performed on some participants. The precise and&#xD;
      undistorted signals available with MEG will be used to enhance the interpretation of&#xD;
      alertness and sleep-related characteristics of the EEG signals, which can vary quite&#xD;
      dramatically across subjects. In addition, the MEG signals will provide preliminary spatial&#xD;
      localization of the sleep-dependent changes more precisely than is possible with EEG. MRI&#xD;
      scanner noise will be simulated using tape recordings to allow comparison with the MRI/EEG&#xD;
      data. MEG scans will last 45 minutes to 2 hours. At all times during any of the brain scans&#xD;
      the participant will be able to communicate the MRI scientist or MEG/EEG technician and can&#xD;
      ask to be removed from the device at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will not have a direct benefit for participants. It may be help us learn more about&#xD;
      brain function, which may lead to better treatments.&#xD;

      Objective. The objective of the proposed study is to investigate the spatio-temporal&#xD;
      characteristics of brain activity during sleep. A number of recent fMRI (Ogawa, Lee et al.&#xD;
      1990) studies have shown that in absence of external stimuli, the brain continues to show&#xD;
      spatial patterns of activity that resemble the networks that activate during sensory and&#xD;
      cognitive tasks. This phenomenon greatly affects the interpretation of neuroimaging studies&#xD;
      based on PET and fMRI, since these rely on differential imaging in which activity during a&#xD;
      task is contrasted against activity during rest. In addition, resting state activity in&#xD;
      itself potentially contains unique information on the large scale organization of neuronal&#xD;
      networks and reveals information about functional abnormalities related to disease processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. To avoid confounding factors related to disease processes, subjects for&#xD;
      this study will be recruited from the normal adult population. In addition, subjects will be&#xD;
      screened for sleep behavior, and subjects with abnormal sleep behavior will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. The study is designed to facilitate MRI detection of cerebral metabolic differences&#xD;
      between the sleep and awake states. Wakefulness and sleep, and the various stages will be&#xD;
      classified in accordance with the EEG criteria, consistent with the guidelines of&#xD;
      Rechtschaffen and Kales (Rechtschaffen, 1968). For this purpose, we will optimize the&#xD;
      methodology for the concurrent acquisition of EEG and fMRI signals. Using concurrent EEG and&#xD;
      state-of-the-art MRI, we plan to establish the precise spatial distribution of changes in&#xD;
      brain activity that are associated with changes in the sleep/wake state and the various&#xD;
      stages of sleep, specifically early sleep (stage 1 and 2). Secondly, we plan to investigate&#xD;
      whether changes in regional brain metabolism as measured by MRI correlates with transitory&#xD;
      EEG phenomena during sleep, including fluctuations in band-specific power, sleep spindles,&#xD;
      and K-complexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure. As an outcome of this study, an atlas of activity clusters in normal&#xD;
      subjects will be established, both during waking conditions, as well as during several sleep&#xD;
      stages. Further outcomes will be spatial patterns of covariance with EEG band-specific power,&#xD;
      spindles, and K-complexes. These data will serve as a baseline for comparison with activity&#xD;
      patterns in patients.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any neurologically and psychiatrically normal, male or female, healthy volunteer between 18&#xD;
        and 65 years old is in principle eligible for the study. Subjects must be capable of&#xD;
        understanding the procedures and requirements of this study. Subjects must be willing to&#xD;
        sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning such as the&#xD;
        following: pregnancy, aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator; implanted cardiac&#xD;
        pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; known absent acoustic reflex; ocular&#xD;
        foreign body (e.g. metal shavings or insulin pump) and any pre-existing eye conditions.&#xD;
        Subjects who underwent brain surgery, who have a neurological lesion, a psychiatric history&#xD;
        or recurrent migraines that require medication will also be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        To minimize potential confounds, subjects with abnormal sleep/wake patterns will be&#xD;
        excluded. They should report no sleep problems or shift work, or medications that could&#xD;
        impair sleep, no illegal drugs or tobacco. Subjects will be in good health as assessed by&#xD;
        medical history, interview and physical exam.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Refrain from alcohol and caffeinated products for 1 day prior to the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Maintain their habitual bed times and wake-up times for 1 week prior to the study. A&#xD;
        wrist-worn activity monitor (Actigraph[R], Precision Control Design, Inc., Fort Walton&#xD;
        Beach, FL) may be used to confirm compliance with the latter instruction.&#xD;

        Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sleep disorder (reported or detected);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Psychopathology, personal or first-degree relative. (They are likely to place the subject&#xD;
        at risk for an adverse consequence related to the extended wakefulness portion of the&#xD;
        study);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Seizures or head injury with loss of consciousness greater than 5 minutes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Substance dependence (diagnosable);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Smoking tobacco or psychotropic medications (currently);&#xD;
&#xD;
