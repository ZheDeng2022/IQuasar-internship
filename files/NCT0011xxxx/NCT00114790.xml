  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an experimental radiation therapy technique which is&#xD;
      based on the principle of irradiating boron atoms with neutrons. When neutrons have&#xD;
      relatively low energy, boron atoms that have been targeted to cancerous tissue using a&#xD;
      suitable boron carrier (an amino acid derivative called BPA, boronophenylalanine) will&#xD;
      capture the neutrons. As a result from the neutron capture the boron atoms will split into&#xD;
      two, producing helium and lithium ions. The helium and lithium ions, in turn, have only a&#xD;
      short pathlength in tissue (about 5 micrometers) and will deposit their cell damaging effect&#xD;
      mainly within the tumor provided that the boron carrier (BPA) has accumulated in the tumor.&#xD;
      In practice, the study participants will receive BPA as an approximately 2-hour intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, following which the tumor is irradiated with low energy (epithermal) neutrons&#xD;
      obtained from a nuclear reactor at the BNCT facility. BNCT requires careful radiation dose&#xD;
      planning, but neutron irradiation will last approximately only for one hour. In this study&#xD;
      BNCT will be repeated, and the 2 treatments will be given 3 to 5 weeks apart. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that head and neck cancers that have recurred following conventional&#xD;
      radiotherapy might accumulate the boron carrier compound, and might respond to BNCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single BNCT-facility, non-randomized, non-comparative, open-label, phase I to II&#xD;
      trial to determine the value of BNCT in the treatment of inoperable, irradiated, locally&#xD;
      advanced cancers of the head and neck region. An attempt to perform 18F-labeled&#xD;
      boronophenylalanine (18F-BPA) SPECT or PET imaging will be made before BNCT. Patients whose&#xD;
      tumor uptake is &gt;2.5 times that of the corresponding normal head and neck tissue will be&#xD;
      enrolled, and treated with a single fraction BPA-based BNCT twice, 3 to 5 weeks apart.&#xD;
      Another 18F-BPA SPECT or PET study may be performed 1 to 3 months after BNCT to determine the&#xD;
      SPECT/PET response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neutron irradiation site is the FiR 1 reactor site, located at Otaniemi, Espoo, Finland,&#xD;
      about 6 kilometers from the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, where patient&#xD;
      evaluation and post-irradiation care will take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to BNCT, BPA is infused as a fructose complex (l-BPA-F) into a peripheral vein over 2&#xD;
      hours. Blood samples will be taken for monitoring whole blood boron concentration before&#xD;
      starting the BPA infusion, and thereafter at 20 to 40 minute intervals during the infusion,&#xD;
      following infusion, and after delivering neutron irradiation. The blood samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed for blood boron concentration to estimate the average blood boron concentration&#xD;
      during neutron irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated for response using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
