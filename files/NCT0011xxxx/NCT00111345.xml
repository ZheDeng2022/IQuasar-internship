  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to progressive therapy intensification in the four consecutive studies AML-BFM 78, 83, 93&#xD;
      and 98, prognosis for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved steadily. In&#xD;
      spite of the intensified therapy, rates of morbidity and mortality have remained unchanged or&#xD;
      have even decreased. Against the background that about 40% of the patients still die from&#xD;
      immediate causes of an underlying disease relapse or of nonresponse, it seems to be&#xD;
      justifiable to intensify therapy - especially for high-risk patients - which on its parts&#xD;
      will require an optimization of supportive measures. As the present risk stratification into&#xD;
      standard- (SR) and high-risk (HR) patients has proved effective, we will pursue the&#xD;
      risk-adapted therapy strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to improve prognosis in children with AML by intensification of&#xD;
      cytostatic therapy and to evaluate by randomisation the equivalence of a prophylactic central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) irradiation with a total dose of 18 Gy versus 12 Gy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in childhood has&#xD;
      improved considerably, but still 30% of the children experience a relapse of disease and&#xD;
      further 10% fail to respond sufficiently to the present therapies. A further intensification&#xD;
      of therapy might improve the overall survival of these children, but possible, implicit side&#xD;
      effects have to be considered carefully. Increase in dose intensification of the proven,&#xD;
      effective anthracyclines will be limited by the risk of cumulative cardiotoxicity. A&#xD;
      liposomal formulation of daunorubicin may offer a possibility to increase dosage, at least&#xD;
      partially, without causing cumulative cardiotoxicity. Objective one of this randomised study&#xD;
      is to ascertain if this dose increase improves therapy response and overall survival at&#xD;
      acceptable toxicity. The previous experiences with liposomal daunorubicin, gathered from the&#xD;
      relapse studies AML-BFM Rez 97 and International Therapy Study Relapsed AML 2001/012 as well&#xD;
      as from the pilot study AML-BFM 2002P, have shown that the induction therapy is feasible in&#xD;
      clinical centers with experience in AML therapy without leading to a marked increase of&#xD;
      toxicity or prolongation of granulocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First results of study AML-BFM 98 have shown that the patients of the standard risk (SR)&#xD;
      group did not benefit from an additional, second induction (HAM). On this account we did not&#xD;
      reintroduce this second induction course in the present study AML-BFM 2004. However, SR&#xD;
      patients will take part in the randomisation of initial therapy with a general view to&#xD;
      achieving higher effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients of the high-risk group, the administration of 2-chloro-2-deoxyadenosine (2-CDA)&#xD;
      will be integrated in the first phase of consolidation to achieve an even higher&#xD;
      intensification. It could be shown that 2-CDA possesses good antileukemic activity in&#xD;
      pediatric and adult AML. In a phase-II study it could also be demonstrated that 2-CDA has&#xD;
      good effectiveness in combination with cytarabine. Results of phase-II studies conducted at&#xD;
      St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, showed that 2-CDA has good effectiveness especially in&#xD;
      children with monoblastic leukemias (FAB M4/M5). Consequently, this intensification for&#xD;
      high-risk patients, who present in more than half of the cases with monoblastic leukemias&#xD;
      (FAB M4/5), may allow further improvement of therapy for this cohort. The pilot study AML-BFM&#xD;
      2002P confirmed that the study design was practicable without increasing significantly the&#xD;
      risk of higher toxicity. However, median duration of aplasia was significantly prolonged in&#xD;
      comparison to that of the AI (cytarabine, idarubicin)-block. Objective two of this study is&#xD;
      to determine by randomisation if an improvement of efficiency is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study AML-BFM 98 has already focussed on the question of whether or not doses of CNS&#xD;
      irradiation of 12 Gy and 18 Gy are equivalent with regard to their capacity of reducing the&#xD;
      risk of relapse. As the results of study AML-BFM 87 confirmed the necessity of CNS&#xD;
      irradiation, but did not reveal the necessary minimum dose, this randomisation has been&#xD;
      implemented in order to prevent, as far as possible, late sequelae of CNS irradiation by&#xD;
      reducing the radiation dose (= objective three).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the number of patients of study AML-BFM 98 was not sufficient to resolve this question,&#xD;
      this randomised analysis has been extended for a second period and will therefore be&#xD;
      continued in the current study AML-BFM-2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the intensification of cytostatic therapy, study AML-BFM 2004 seeks to optimise the&#xD;
      quality of supportive therapy by implementing measures of quality assurance. This demands an&#xD;
      up-to-date, complete documentation of each therapy phase. In studies AML-BFM 93 and 98, about&#xD;
      12% of deaths were due to primary complications such as leukostasis syndrome, haemorrhage or&#xD;
      severe infections (4%), infections in aplasia before achieving remission (4%) or infections&#xD;
      in remission (4%). Maybe the lives of even more children will be saved in the future by&#xD;
      improved standards for the prevention of primary complications. Further, the efficacy of&#xD;
      chemotherapy could be improved by less delays in therapy which are often due to infections or&#xD;
      other complications.&#xD;
