  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are ubiquitous organisms that cause isolated pulmonary&#xD;
      disease in otherwise healthy patients with yet undefined susceptibilities. Patients typically&#xD;
      present with a history of chronic cough, eventually progressing to hemoptysis, fever, and&#xD;
      hypoxia. With half or more of all patients failing standard three-drug therapy, this is an&#xD;
      insidious disease with a poor prognosis. Under the natural history protocol of nontuberculous&#xD;
      mycobacterial infection (NTM; #01-I-0202), 46 patients with diagnosed pulmonary MAC disease&#xD;
      are being studied. Numerous studies have suggested that a dysregulation in cytokine&#xD;
      production may make these patients susceptible to mycobacterial infection. Cytokines are&#xD;
      particularly important in the activaction of macrophages, which help to clear mycobacterial&#xD;
      infection. Interferon gamma 1b (Actimmune) and GM-CSF (Leukine) are two cytokine therapies&#xD;
      that have been approved in the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease and&#xD;
      post-transplantation hematopoietic reconstitution, respectively. A number of in vitro studies&#xD;
      suggest that either or both of these therapies may help to clear MAC infection. Given the&#xD;
      poor outcomes of therapy and the persistent, debilitating nature of the disease, new&#xD;
      therapies are desperately needed, and many are being tried without benefit of scientific&#xD;
      foundation. Currently, there are no prospective trials that show any effect of these drugs in&#xD;
      the lung delivered subcutaneously. This protocol proposes to perform a pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects, if any, of these macrophage stimulating cytokines in the context of&#xD;
      ongoing pulmonary MAC infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the local and systemic effect, if any, of adjuvant IFN gamma and GM-CSF in&#xD;
      pulmonary MAC patients.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen patients will be randomized into three treatment groups of five patients each. The&#xD;

      three months of (IFN{gamma}) and GM-CSF, respectively. All patients will undergo bronchoscopy&#xD;
      with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the beginning of the study, after three months, and at&#xD;

      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and other pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (P-NTM) are&#xD;

      Under the natural history protocol of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (NTM;&#xD;
      #01-I-0202), 46 patients with diagnosed pulmonary MAC disease, 20 patients with M. abscessus&#xD;
      disease, and 14 with other types of mycobacteria (M. fortuitum, M. massiliense, M.&#xD;
      mucogenicum and M. chelonae) are being studied.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for this protocol, a patient must meet the following five criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosed with M. avium complex (MAC) lung disease or other pulmonary mycobacterial&#xD;
        infection based on the 1997 version of American Thoracic Society (ATS) diagnostic criteria&#xD;
        and have positive AFB smear or culture for mycobacterial infection at least three months&#xD;
        prior to the date of enrollment. Patients with only histological evidence of mycobacterial&#xD;
        infection without positive smear or culture will not qualify for this protocol even if they&#xD;
        meet the ATS diagnostic criteria for nontuberculous mycobacterial lung infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient must have radiographic evidence on high resolution computerized tomography of&#xD;
        changes that are consistent with pulmonary mycobacterial infection. These include, but are&#xD;
        not limited to: multiple small nodules (less than 5 mm), and cylindrical bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must be on a treatment regimen based on ATS guidelines that has been stable for&#xD;
        at least three months. By stable, we mean that the patient has been tolerating the regimen&#xD;
        without any significant adverse reactions, and that no new agents have been begun in the&#xD;
        last three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must be female and can be post-menopausal (either through natural menopause or&#xD;
        surgical removal of her ovaries) or menstruating. If the patient is still menstruating and&#xD;
        randomized to a study group receiving a cytokine she must agree to monthly pregnancy&#xD;
        testing, while on study, as well as to utilizing a barrier type of contraception or&#xD;
        abstinence. She must not be under 40 years of age at the time of enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must be enrolled in protocol # 01-I-0202 (&quot;Natural History, Genetics,&#xD;
        Phenotype, and Treatment of Non-Tuberculoid Mycobacterial Infections&quot;).&#xD;

             toxicity by the Toxicity Table in Appendix II of protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are unable to tolerate bronchoscopy. This will be defined by the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant reactive airway disease that does not respond to&#xD;
             bronchodilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with the following laboratory abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;

        Staphylococcus or a gram negative rod are excluded from this trial until this infection has&#xD;
        been successfully treated.&#xD;
