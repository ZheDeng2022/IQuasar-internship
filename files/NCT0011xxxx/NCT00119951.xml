    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of participation in the Association of&#xD;
      Cancer Online Resources (ACOR) mailing lists on chronic disease management for cancer&#xD;
      patients, we are focusing on several priority areas. These include factors that influence the&#xD;
      use of online interventions over time and the effects of patient-provider interactions on the&#xD;
      use of eHealth interventions (as well as vice versa). We also are breaking new ground in a&#xD;
      number of important methodological areas related to online survey research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a qualitative analysis of a 10% sample of messages (approximately 5,200)&#xD;
           obtained over 5 months from 9 ACOR lists to develop a comprehensive set of potential&#xD;
           chronic disease management outcomes and a fuller understanding of the issues and themes&#xD;
           that characterize list participation. The content analysis will identify important&#xD;
           themes and issues in the messages. These themes and issues will help in survey&#xD;
           refinement and ground our proposed quantitative survey questionnaire items. Survey&#xD;
           analyses will also be enriched by the qualitative data. Finally, the qualitative&#xD;
           analysis will stand as an independent body of work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct a web-based survey of at least 1,680 new ACOR mailing list patient members and&#xD;
           approximately 1,680 non-patient subscribers to assess the positive and negative effects&#xD;
           of participation in ACOR lists at one month and four months after joining the list and&#xD;
           completing a baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disseminate study findings to ACOR leadership, participants and the larger online&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Develop a plan to convert the findings into training, recommendations, tools and&#xD;
           policies to improve list processes. We aim to answer real world, practical questions&#xD;
           using methodology that is at once rigorous, practical and ethical. The components are&#xD;
           inter-related and complementary.&#xD;

      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-based health applications can have powerful positive health effects (e.g. IOM, 2002:&#xD;
      Eng et al., 2000; Gustafson et al., 2000). Research has focused on Internet users as&#xD;
      consumers of information, not how they interact with one another, providing advice,&#xD;
      consolation, encouragement and pointers to resources. There has been little evaluation of&#xD;
      health-related mailing lists, email-based applications that connect millions of people, many&#xD;
      with chronic diseases, with one another. The Association of Cancer Online Resources (ACOR)&#xD;
      has teamed with The University of North Carolina (UNC) to assess the impact of participation&#xD;
      on patients, survivors and others (including caregivers) in 15 cancer-related mailing lists&#xD;
      managed by ACOR (www.acor.org). We are conducting a multi-method evaluation with several&#xD;
      elements. In the qualitative component, we are conducting a content analysis of a subset of&#xD;
      threaded discussions from archived mailing list pages to identify a comprehensive set of&#xD;
      themes and key outcomes. This information will provide a richer understanding of mailing list&#xD;
      processes and also will provide checks and balances on the quantitative survey. We also are&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of being a subscriber to ACOR mailing lists on a range of outcomes by&#xD;
      following a cohort of new subscribers for 4 months from sign-up (minimum n=1680). Baseline,&#xD;
      one and four month web-based surveys (with telephone as an option for those who cannot do web&#xD;
      surveys) will be administered to consenting subscribers. We also are surveying ongoing&#xD;
      subscribers who are patients and caregivers (minimum n=1680). We will disseminate findings to&#xD;
      several key audiences, including listowners and members as well as to a broader audience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a comprehensive set of potential chronic disease management outcomes and a&#xD;
           fuller understanding of the issues and themes that characterize mailing list&#xD;
           participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effects of participation in ACOR mailing lists one month and four months&#xD;
           after joining mailing lists and completing baseline surveys for new subscribers and&#xD;
           through one-time surveys to ongoing subscribers and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Disseminate study findings to ACOR leadership, participants and the larger online&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the qualitative component is to systematically identify themes about cancer&#xD;
      disease management and cancer mailing list support group experiences and to use that&#xD;
      knowledge to develop a more refined understanding of mailing list use. The analyses also&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation patterns within and across mailing lists over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mailing list group processes, the nature of online group social support, and the role of&#xD;
           mailing listowners in providing and helping group members support each other; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergent themes not previously noted in cancer-related stress and online group behavior&#xD;
           and communication research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility is based on joining one of 15 ACOR mailing lists over a 1 ½ year accrual period.&#xD;
      We defined eligible persons as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New patient/survivor subscribers aged 18 and over, have had cancer, and joined a&#xD;
           participating mailing list within the past 10 days; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing patient/survivor subscribers aged 18 and over, have had cancer, and have been a&#xD;
           member of a participating list for more than 10 days; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver subscribers aged 18 and over and care for a cancer patient or survivor in any&#xD;
           capacity (actively or passively).&#xD;
