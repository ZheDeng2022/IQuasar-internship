  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the residual allergenicity of the modified ragweed&#xD;
      pollen in Ragweed MATA MPL (modified pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate + Monophosphoryl&#xD;
      Lipid A) by skin prick testing. This is done by a comparison of the wheal response after skin&#xD;
      prick testing with different concentrations of aqueous native allergen, modified allergen,&#xD;
      modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen, and Ragweed MATA MPL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with proven type I hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A),&#xD;
      a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is&#xD;
      included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the&#xD;
      product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ragweed pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient,&#xD;
      an allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus&#xD;
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important&#xD;
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities is not seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of the modified ragweed pollen&#xD;
      in Ragweed MATA MPL using skin prick testing.&#xD;
