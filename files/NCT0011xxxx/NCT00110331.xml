  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how HIV affects the brain and nervous system, learning, and behavior&#xD;
      in children on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although HAART has resulted in&#xD;
      fewer HIV-infected children getting sick and even fewer dying from AIDS, many children on&#xD;
      this treatment regimen develop significant brain or nervous system problems, such as learning&#xD;
      difficulties, attention problems, hyperactivity, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who acquired HIV disease in the first decade of life and who have evidence of central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) disease (e.g., encephalopathy, CNS compromise, ADHD, bipolar disease,&#xD;
      major depression or psychosis) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, neuropsychological testing and a CT scan of the head,&#xD;
      if one has not been done within 12 months of entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI and MRS scan of the head: These tests use a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
           images of the brain and detect changes in certain brain chemicals that may be affected&#xD;
           by HIV infection. Both procedures are done at the same time. The patient lies on a table&#xD;
           that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud&#xD;
           knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts&#xD;
           about 50 to 60 minutes, during which time the patient can communicate with the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing: Patients' thinking and behavior are evaluated with tests to&#xD;
           measure their memory, attention, language, problem-solving, academic, and motor skills&#xD;
           and questionnaires to assess behavioral and emotional functioning, quality of life, and&#xD;
           adherence to HIV medication. Parents are also asked to complete questionnaires assessing&#xD;
           their child's behavioral and emotional functioning, quality of life, important life&#xD;
           events, and adherence to HIV medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected for analysis. For&#xD;
           this procedure, a local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space&#xD;
           between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates below the spinal cord. Some&#xD;
           fluid is collected through the needle. Blood tests and a physical examination are done&#xD;
           before the procedure to make sure it can be done as safely as possible. Patients may&#xD;
           also be sedated to prevent any discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: The blood tests, MRI and MRS scans and spinal tap are repeated 1 and 2 years&#xD;
           after the initial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some blood and spinal fluid samples from participants are stored for possible future studies&#xD;
      related to HIV research&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease&#xD;
      in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant minority of HIV-infected children has evidence of ongoing CNS disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific markers for CNS disease, factors predictive of risk for neurological decline, and&#xD;
      pathophysiologic mechanisms have not yet been identified in HIV-infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the clinical features (neurological and psychiatric exams, neuropsychological&#xD;
      evaluation, and neuroimaging), viral and neuroinflammatory factors, anatomic changes (brain&#xD;
      MRI) and patterns of brain metabolites (1H-MRS) associated with HIV-related CNS disease in&#xD;
      HIV-infected children in the HAART era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV disease acquired in the first decade of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of CNS disease (classification of encephalopathy or CNS compromise or diagnosis of&#xD;
      ADHD, bipolar disease, major depression, or psychosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial neurologic and psychiatric examinations, neuropsychologic test, neuroimaging, and CSF&#xD;
      sampling will be performed once a year for a total of 3 evaluations.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. For children greater than 7 years, ability to give assent if developmentally&#xD;
