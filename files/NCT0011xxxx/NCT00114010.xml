    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and immune response of healthy adult volunteers to&#xD;
      AMA1-C1, an experimental malaria vaccine developed by the NIAID. Malaria affects about 300&#xD;
      million to 500 million people worldwide each year, causing from 2 million to 3 million&#xD;
      deaths. Increasing drug resistance to the malaria parasite, as well as widespread resistance&#xD;
      of mosquitoes (the insects that transmit the parasite) to pesticides are reducing the ability&#xD;
      to control malaria through these strategies. A vaccine that could reduce illness and death&#xD;
      from malaria would be a valuable new resource in the fight against this disease. Early tests&#xD;
      of AMA1-C1 in 66 people in the United States and in Mali, West Africa, found no serious side&#xD;
      effects of the vaccine. This study will test a shorter schedule of vaccinations with AMA1-C1&#xD;
      than that used in the previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who weigh at least 110 pounds and with no&#xD;
      travel to malaria endemic areas in the past 12 months may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, and a urine pregnancy test for women who are able to bear children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections of either the experimental&#xD;
      malaria vaccine or a placebo (a solution that does not contain the vaccine) over a 2-month&#xD;
      period. The shots are given in an upper arm muscle, each 1 month apart. On the day of each&#xD;
      injection, participants give a history of symptoms since the last visit, have a brief&#xD;
      physical examination and blood test and, for women, a blood or urine pregnancy test. After&#xD;
      the injection, participants remain in the clinic 60 minutes for observation. In addition to&#xD;
      the injections, participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record temperature and symptoms on a diary card daily for the first 7 days after each&#xD;
           injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up clinic visits 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after each shot to check for side effects.&#xD;
           Blood samples are drawn before each injection and at each return clinic visit to check&#xD;
           the safety and immune response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have apheresis, a special procedure that separates certain components of the blood, 7&#xD;
           days after each injection to measure the function of germ-fighting blood cells. For this&#xD;
           procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in an arm vein and directed into a machine&#xD;
           that separates the different types of blood cells. The white cells are collected in a&#xD;
           plastic ...&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, single-blinded (blinded to volunteers) placebo-controlled Phase 1&#xD;
      clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers designed to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity&#xD;
      of a new malaria blood stage vaccine candidate, and to elucidate the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      antigen, AMA1-C1, formulated on Alhydrogel [R]. The trial will last 42 weeks. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be recruited and screened, and those determined to be eligible will be enrolled in the study,&#xD;
      based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Section 4.0 in this protocol.&#xD;
      After providing written informed consent the volunteers will be enrolled and randomly&#xD;
      allocated to receive 80 microgram dose of AMA1-C1 formulated on Alhydrogel [R] (12&#xD;
      volunteers) or Alhydrogel [R] alone (6 volunteers) at 0, 1 and 2 months. After each&#xD;
      injection, volunteers will be observed for 60 minutes for immediate reactions. Volunteers&#xD;
      will return to the clinic on study days 1, 3, 7, and 14 following each injection for clinical&#xD;
      assessment and collection of blood samples for evaluation of immune responses. Leukaphereses&#xD;
      will be performed 7 days after the third vaccination to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells for B and T cell studies. Safety data for the cohort up to and including follow up day&#xD;
      14 after the first, second and third injection will be available for review by the Medical&#xD;
      Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity of the vaccine will be assessed by standardized assays for antibody levels&#xD;
      against AMA1-3D7 and AMA1-FVO, and an in vitro growth inhibition assay (GIA). The cellular&#xD;
      basis of the immune responses will be evaluated by enumeration of relevant B and T cell&#xD;
      subpopulations, including total and antigen-specific naive, memory and effector&#xD;
      subpopulations specific for the antigens. The frequencies of B and T cells specific for the&#xD;
      vaccine antigens in the group that received AMA1-C1/ Alhydrogel [R] will be compared to those&#xD;
      in the group receiving Alhydrogel [R] alone. The total and antigen-specific cell frequencies&#xD;
      in pre-immune (day 0) samples will serve as additional negative controls for the&#xD;
      immunization. The goal of the study is to augment previously collected safety data for the 80&#xD;
      microgram antigen dose with a larger cohort, and to study the safety and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      accelerated vaccination schedule.&#xD;
