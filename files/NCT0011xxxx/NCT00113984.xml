    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the side effects of a fixed dose of vaccine and GM-CSF with&#xD;
      increasing doses of anti-CTLA-4 antibody in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      vaccine consists of a &quot;priming vaccine&quot; called PROSTVAC/TRICOM, made from vaccinia virus, and&#xD;
      a &quot;boosting vaccine&quot; called PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM, made from fowlpox virus. GM-CSF is a chemical&#xD;
      that boosts the immune system, and anti-CTLA-4 antibody is a protein that may improve&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity and the response to the vaccines. DNA is inserted into the priming and&#xD;
      boosting vaccine viruses to cause production of proteins that enhance immune activity and&#xD;
      also to produce prostate specific antigen (PSA)-a protein that is normally produced by the&#xD;
      patient's tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with androgen-insensitive prostate cancer that has spread&#xD;
      beyond the original site may be eligible for this 7-month study. Candidates must have disease&#xD;
      that has worsened despite treatments with hormones and up to one chemotherapy regimen. Their&#xD;
      tumor must produce PSA, and they must have no history of allergy to eggs or egg products&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram, pathological confirmation of the diagnosis and presence of the PSA&#xD;
      marker, chest x-rays, imaging studies to assess the extent of tumor, and, if clinically&#xD;
      indicated, a cardiologic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive the priming vaccination on study day 1. After 2 weeks and then again&#xD;
      every 4 weeks while on the study, they receive a boosting vaccine. All vaccines are injected&#xD;
      under the skin. On the day of each vaccination and daily for the next 3 days, patients&#xD;
      receive an injection of GM-CSF to increase the number of immune cells at the vaccination&#xD;
      site. On the day of the first six boosting vaccinations, they receive anti-CTLA-4 antibody as&#xD;
      an infusion through a vein over 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are monitored for safety and treatment response with the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests monthly, or more often if needed, to monitor liver, kidney, and&#xD;
           other organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies to assess the tumor before starting treatment, again around study days&#xD;
           99 and 183, and then every 3 months after that while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis (a procedure for collecting immune cells called lymphocytes) to measure the&#xD;
           immune response to treatment. Apheresis is done three times: before starting the study&#xD;
           and again around study days 99 and 183. For this procedure, blood is collected through a&#xD;
           needle in an arm vein. The blood circulates through a machine that separates it into its&#xD;
           components by spinning, and the lymphocytes are extracted. The rest of the blood is&#xD;
           returned to the patient through the same needle. This will only be done in participants&#xD;
           who have the tissue marker HLA-A2 (about 50% of patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose disease responds to treatment and who do not develop severe side effects may&#xD;
      continue treatment beyond the initial 7-month study period on vaccine alone (without the&#xD;
      antibody). After treatment is completed, patients are monitored for up to 15 years. This&#xD;
      includes a medical history and physical examination for 5 years following the last&#xD;
      vaccination. Information beyond 5 years is collected once a year by telephone.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most common cancer diagnosis in American males,&#xD;
           and the second leading cause of cancer death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proposed vaccine strategy represents a third-generation design that elicits a T-cell&#xD;
           immune response to cells expressing PSA and has been shown to break tolerance to this&#xD;
           self-antigen, and cause objective response and PSA declines in patients with metastatic&#xD;
           AIPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This strategy also utilizes an antibody to CTLA-4 that may block the normal signals to&#xD;
           down regulate the immune response following active vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti CTLA-4 antibodies have been associated with autoimmune events that are generally&#xD;
           manageable and have been associated with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of a combination of a fixed dose of vaccine and&#xD;
           anti-CTLA4, which will be dose escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate immunologic response (as measured by an increase in PSA specific T-cells&#xD;
           measured by ELISPOT in HLA-A2+ patients), and clinical response (as measured by RECIST&#xD;
           and PSA consensus criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have metastatic androgen insensitive prostate cancer with no bone pain requiring&#xD;
           narcotics and have had no more prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life expectancy greater than or equal to 6 months. ECOG 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious&#xD;
           intercurrent medical illness; no cardiac disease; no prior splenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No prior treatment with MDX-010 (Ipilimumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No serious hypersensitivity reaction to egg products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label, phase I safety trial with sequential cohorts of patients all&#xD;
           receiving a fixed dose of PSA-TRICOM vaccines and sargramostim, with dose escalation of&#xD;
           MDX-010 (Ipilimumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROSTVAC -V/TRICOM (vaccinia) 2 x 10(8) pfu subcutaneously will be administered as the&#xD;
           initial priming vaccine on day 1 of cycle 1 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROSTVAC -F/TRICOM (fowlpox) 1 x 10(9) pfu subcutaneously starting on day 15 followed by&#xD;
           monthly boosting vaccination. Sargramostim 100 mcg per day will be administered&#xD;
           subcutaneously at the vaccination site on days 1-4 of each vaccine cycle (prime and&#xD;
           boost).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MDX-010 (Ipilimumab) will be administered, as per the assigned dose level, as a&#xD;
           90-minute intravenous infusion on the same day as the monthly boosting vaccinations with&#xD;
           PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM (fowlpox). After 6 courses of MDX-010, patients may receive&#xD;
           Maintenance dose of MDX-010 every 3 months until there is evidence of disease&#xD;
           progression or toxicity, for up to an additional 12 months (equivalent to 4 additional&#xD;
           MDX-010 courses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly boosting vaccinations with PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM (fowlpox) and sargramostim may then&#xD;
           continue until patients meet off study criteria.&#xD;
