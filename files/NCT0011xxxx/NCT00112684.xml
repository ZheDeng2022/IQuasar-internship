    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvocidib in treating&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such&#xD;
      as alvocidib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Alvocidib may also stimulate the immune system in&#xD;
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. It may also stop the growth of solid tumors&#xD;
      by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxicity profile and dose-limiting toxicity of flavopiridol (alvocidib) in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the immunomodulatory effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics of this drug, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in patients who&#xD;
      experience clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive alvocidib intravenously (IV) over 4½ hours once weekly in weeks 1-4.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease after 4 courses of therapy&#xD;
      discontinue study treatment. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 1&#xD;
      additional course of therapy beyond documentation of CR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of alvocidib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD&#xD;
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed within 4 weeks.&#xD;
