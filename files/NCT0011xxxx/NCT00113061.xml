  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of exercise training on elevated&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, an indicator of inflammation, in initially inactive&#xD;
      women and men.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, has been reported to be an independent predictor of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in both women and men. Recently published data from cross-sectional&#xD;
      analyses showed that CRP is inversely related to cardiorespiratory fitness, and that this&#xD;
      association is independent of body mass index. Regular exercise may affect CRP levels, and&#xD;
      can possibly be used as a means of reducing elevated CRP levels. Though there are a number of&#xD;
      studies focusing on related topics, there are no published reports from randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials on the effect of exercise training alone on CRP levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 200 individuals will be randomly assigned to either a no exercise control group&#xD;
      or an exercise group. Exercising individuals will participate in 3 or 4 training sessions&#xD;
      each week for 4 months, and will progress to a total energy expenditure of 16 kcal [kg(-1),&#xD;
      week(-1)], which is an exercise dose at the upper end of current public health&#xD;
      recommendations for physical activity. The target exercise intensity will be 50-70% of&#xD;
      baseline volume of oxygen consumed (V02 max). VO2 max is the maximal rate of oxygen&#xD;
      consumption during exercise, and is a measurement of fitness. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be plasma CRP concentration. Secondary outcomes will be changes in variables that are&#xD;
      potential mechanisms through which regular exercise might reduce CRP. These variables include&#xD;
      visceral adiposity, the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha&#xD;
      (TNF-alpha), and heart rate variability as a measure of autonomic balance. Although the&#xD;
      primary outcome is CRP level, this study will also contribute significantly to the limited&#xD;
      body of literature examining the effect of exercise on the variables of visceral adiposity,&#xD;
      cytokines, and heart rate variability.&#xD;
