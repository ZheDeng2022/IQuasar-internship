  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether significant alterations in serum&#xD;
      lipoproteins as provided by the drug lovastatin can substantially reduce atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression or even induce regression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two conceptual advances occurring in the 1980's made it possible to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      significant alterations in serum lipoproteins can substantially reduce atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression or even induce regression. The first advance was in the development of&#xD;
      arteriograms used in characterizing atherosclerosis, greatly reducing the number of patients&#xD;
      required for the evaluation of an intervention designed to prevent coronary atherosclerosis&#xD;
      progression. The second advance was the development of lovastatin that provides a&#xD;
      lipid-lowering alternative much easier to tolerate than the niacin/colestipol combination&#xD;
      previously used, and has been shown to be comparably effective for LDL reduction in patients&#xD;
      with a family history of high cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 270 high-risk coronary artery disease patients, not eligible for coronary artery&#xD;
      bypass surgery, were recruited for the study. All patients received angiograms and were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the lovastatin or placebo groups stratified by three baseline&#xD;
      factors: sex, smoking status, and plasma cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients initially received lovastatin 40mg twice a day or a matching placebo. Those patients&#xD;
      receiving lovastatin whose total plasma cholesterol level was less than 110mg/dL at one visit&#xD;
      or 120 mg/dL on two successive visits had their dosage halved, and were maintained on the&#xD;
      optimal dosage for the remainder of the study. Coronary angiography was performed prior to&#xD;
      screening and at month 24 (visit 18). Angiographic assessment of both femoral arteries was&#xD;
      also performed at baseline and at month 24. Noninvasive ultrasound imaging of the carotid&#xD;
      arteries (including carotid intima-media thickness) was performed every 6 months. Patients&#xD;
      reported to the clinic monthly for 12 months, and at two-month intervals thereafter. Plasma&#xD;
      lipids, routine laboratory safety and physical examinations were also performed.&#xD;
