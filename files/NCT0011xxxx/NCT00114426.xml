  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, we will implement a randomized controlled trial to determine whether&#xD;
      nocturnal NIMV applied for 3 months: 1) improves (disease-specific) health related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQL) of COPD patients compared to a control group of patients treated with sham NIMV&#xD;
      therapy (primary outcome); 2) improves exercise tolerance and walking capacity of COPD&#xD;
      patients; and 3) improves heart rate variability and decreases sympathetic tone in COPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COPD is one of the fastest growing conditions in the world, affecting over 16 million people&#xD;
      in the US and over 1 million in Canada and costing society over $23 billion per annum (in the&#xD;
      US). Its prevalence has risen by 41% since 1982, and the age-adjusted death rate has&#xD;
      increased by 17% between 1966 and 1982 (in contrast to the decline in the age-adjusted death&#xD;
      rates from all other causes during the same time period). By 2020, COPD will become the third&#xD;
      leading cause of death (currently 4th representing 5% of all deaths worldwide) and 5th&#xD;
      leading cause of disability (currently 12th) worldwide. Ironically, despite the rapidly&#xD;
      growing public health burden of COPD, it is the most underfunded disease among all major&#xD;
      causes of mortality in North America. Despite some progress in the management of COPD over&#xD;
      the past two decades, there is still a paucity of efficacious therapies that can effectively&#xD;
      modify the natural course of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing interest in nocturnal non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) therapy&#xD;
      for long-term COPD management for several reasons. It may restore inspiratory rate, which&#xD;
      diminishes by 30% during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, improve gas exchange, and rest&#xD;
      chronically tired respiratory muscles in COPD. Indeed, several uncontrolled studies have&#xD;
      provided some empirical evidence to support the use of nocturnal NIMV in COPD. However, there&#xD;
      is a paucity of well-designed controlled trials evaluating this novel therapy particularly&#xD;
      for COPD patients at a high-risk for morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, we will implement a randomized controlled trial to determine whether&#xD;
      nocturnal NIMV applied for 3 months: 1) improves (disease-specific) health related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQL) of COPD patients compared to a control group of patients treated with sham NIMV&#xD;
      therapy (primary outcome); 2) improves exercise tolerance and walking capacity of COPD&#xD;
      patients; 3) reduces the number of clinical relapses in COPD patients; 4) improves heart rate&#xD;
      variability and decreases sympathetic tone in COPD; and 5) is a &quot;cost-effective&quot; therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carefully select COPD patients ready for discharge from an acute care hospital and&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this trial. Participants will then undergo a &quot;run-in&quot; phase&#xD;
      of 4 weeks during which their clinical status will be stabilized. Patients experiencing a&#xD;
      clinical exacerbation during the &quot;run-in&quot; phase will be excluded from the study. After the&#xD;
      &quot;run-in&quot; phase, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: nocturnal NIMV&#xD;
      therapy + standard medical therapy or &quot;sham&quot; + standard medical therapy. The Chronic&#xD;
      Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and the Health Utilities Index Mark 2/3 (HUI 2 and HUI 3)&#xD;
      will be used to measure HRQL of study participants at baseline and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and&#xD;
      12 weeks. We will also measure the study participants' exacerbation rate during the study&#xD;
      period. A six-minute walk test will be used to determine the walking capacity of the study&#xD;
      participants. In addition, 2-D echocardiography and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic&#xD;
      monitoring will be used to determine the effect of nocturnal NIMV on cardiac performance over&#xD;
      a 3 month period. Finally, we will perform a comprehensive economic analysis to determine the&#xD;
      costs as well as the benefits associated with the nocturnal NIMV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that this study will show that those treated with nocturnal NIMV therapy will&#xD;
      have better HRQL at 3 months compared to those on sham therapy and this will be associated&#xD;
      with improved walking capacity and decreased rates of exacerbation. We also anticipate that&#xD;
      nocturnal NIMV therapy will improve heart rate variability and lower pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      pressure (during daytime).&#xD;
