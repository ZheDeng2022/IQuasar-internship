  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma&#xD;
      remains a non-curable disease however, newer medications and their combinations appear to&#xD;
      provide higher response rates and higher complete response rates than current treatment&#xD;
      options. One of the new medications in multiple myeloma is Velcade. Preliminary results from&#xD;
      a study using a combination of Velcade with Doxil have shown high response rates (disease&#xD;
      reduction). Preliminary results also show that an addition of dexamethasone to Velcade in&#xD;
      patients not responding to Velcade alone showed improved response rates. This study involves&#xD;
      treatment with a new combination of three standard medications: Velcade, Doxil, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (VDd combination). The proposed combination of all three drugs may improve&#xD;
      efficacy and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velcade is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment in multiple&#xD;
      myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease&#xD;
      progression on the last therapy. Velcade is still currently under investigation for other&#xD;
      indications. Doxil is not approved for use in multiple myeloma but is an approved drug for&#xD;
      use in patients with some other cancers. Several published clinical trials provide evidence&#xD;
      that Doxil is an active agent in multiple myeloma and it is used in treatment combinations&#xD;
      for multiple myeloma in general practice. Dexamethasone is a standard therapy for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, but is not approved by the FDA for that use. The combination of all three drugs is&#xD;
      experimental (not FDA approved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to determine if this new combination therapy with Velcade, Doxil&#xD;
      and dexamethasone is an effective treatment and also to determine the side effects that occur&#xD;
      when this combination treatment is given.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma remains a non-curable disease. Initial therapy with one of the commonly used&#xD;
      regimens, such as thalidomide with dexamethasone, VAD, dexamethasone pulses, and melphalan&#xD;
      with prednisone results in at least partial response (PR) in approximately 50-75% of&#xD;
      patients. Complete responses (CRs) with any of these regimens are uncommon. A proportion of&#xD;
      patients will have further improvement of response after autologous stem cell transplant,&#xD;
      which usually follows initial therapy. However, virtually all patients will eventually&#xD;
      relapse and will require re-treatment. Emerging data suggests that achieving CR or near CR&#xD;
      after transplantation will result in a more durable remission and longer survival. It is not&#xD;
      clear whether CR in response to initial therapy and prior to transplant may have similar&#xD;
      impacts on overall outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer agents and their combinations appear to provide higher response rates and higher CR&#xD;
      rates. One of the new active agents in multiple myeloma is Velcade (bortezomib, formerly&#xD;
      known as PS-341). This molecule has a novel mechanism of action by specifically inhibiting&#xD;
      the proteasome. In a reported phase II trial, Velcade as a single agent induced at least&#xD;
      minimal responses (MR) in 35% of patients and CR in 4% of patients, and at least a&#xD;
      stabilization of the disease in 59% of patients with heavily pretreated, relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma using strict SWOG criteria. Velcade alone is superior than dexamethasone&#xD;
      pulses in a phase III randomized study in patients with at least one but no more than 3 lines&#xD;
      of therapy. Preliminary reports indicate that combinations of Velcade with other active&#xD;
      anti-myeloma agents appear to provide superior outcomes than Velcade alone. An additional 18%&#xD;
      of patients responded when dexamethasone was combined with Velcade in a patient population&#xD;
      refractory to Velcade alone. Velcade with Doxil was shown to produce high response rates in a&#xD;
      phase I study with 60% PR rate and 20% CR rate and acceptable toxicity in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. There is only limited data on the outcomes of treatment&#xD;
      of newly diagnosed patients with myeloma with Velcade or its combinations. Velcade as a&#xD;
      single agent has been shown to have impressive response rate in newly diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      55% percent of patients achieving at least PR and 77% of patients achieving at least MR as&#xD;
      per preliminary report from a phase II study. Treatment with Velcade did not appear to affect&#xD;
      stem cell collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high activity of Velcade alone in untreated patients and the superior&#xD;
      activity of combinations of Velcade with either Doxil or dexamethasone, we propose combining&#xD;
      all three agents as a VDd combination (i.e. Velcade, Doxil, and dexamethasone). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that this combination will have similar or better efficacy compared to other&#xD;
      commonly used combinations for initial therapy (i.e. thalidomide with dexamethasone,&#xD;
      dexamethasone pulses, VAD or melphalan and prednisone) or Velcade alone and higher than these&#xD;
      treatment regimens CR rate with acceptable toxicity.&#xD;
