  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect blood plasma and white blood cells from individuals using a procedure&#xD;
      called apheresis. Apheresis is a method of collecting larger quantities of certain blood&#xD;
      components that can safely be collected through a simple blood draw. The blood components&#xD;
      will be used in laboratory research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are currently enrolled in a NIH clinical research&#xD;
      protocol may participate in this study. Relatives of patients and normal healthy volunteers&#xD;
      will also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will undergo one of the following two apheresis procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated pheresis Blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and circulated&#xD;
           through a cell separator machine. The plasma (liquid part of the blood) and white cells&#xD;
           are extracted, and the red cells are re-infused into the donor through the same needle&#xD;
           or a needle in the other arm. An anticoagulant (medication to prevent blood from&#xD;
           clotting) is usually added to the blood while in the machine to prevent it from clotting&#xD;
           during processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual pheresis One unit (1 pint) of blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm&#xD;
           vein, similar to donating a pint of whole blood. The red blood cells, with or without&#xD;
           plasma, are separated from the rest of the blood and returned to the donor through the&#xD;
           same needle. Manual pheresis will be done only when a person s estimated total blood&#xD;
           volume or red cell count is too low to safely permit removal of blood through a pheresis&#xD;
           machine. An adult small in size or markedly anemic, for example, may fall into this&#xD;
           category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the blood collected through apheresis may be stored for future studies of HIV disease&#xD;
      and immune function and for HLA testing, a genetic test of markers of the immune system. Some&#xD;
      of the blood may be used to screen for different types of viral liver infections, such as&#xD;
      hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, F, or G.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to carry out research procedures on the plasma or mononuclear components of blood,&#xD;
      it is often necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma or mononuclear cells than can be&#xD;
      safely obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely obtained&#xD;
      using apheresis procedures in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit. Other specimens are also&#xD;
      sometimes needed for research, such as other blood components, body fluids (such as semen or&#xD;
      urine) or secretions (from nose, mouth, or different skin areas). While this protocol is&#xD;
      specifically designed to conform to the requirements of the Apheresis Unit for donors to have&#xD;
      apheresis and other collection procedures, it also permits collection of these other donor&#xD;
      specimens. However, the protocol, by itself, is not an independent research study but rather&#xD;
      designed to facilitate sample collections that may aid other studies.&#xD;
