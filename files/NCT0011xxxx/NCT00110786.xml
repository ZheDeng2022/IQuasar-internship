  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed MATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen (hay fever). This novel formulation is&#xD;
      designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only four escalating dose&#xD;
      injections administered before the start of the pollen season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the safety and efficacy of Ragweed MATAMPL will be assessed by exposing&#xD;
      allergic subjects to Ragweed pollen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC). Patient&#xD;
      symptomatic response to pollen and patient quality of life in the EEC will be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis is a nasal inflammatory disorder initiated by an immunoglobulin-E (IgE)&#xD;
      mediated hypersensitivity to allergens. This condition is characterized by sneezing,&#xD;
      rhinorrhea, nasal itching and congestion. When a patient is exposed to an allergen to which&#xD;
      they are sensitive, the allergen cross-links with the Ig E antibody, which is bound to the&#xD;
      surface of tissue mast cells. This cross-linking then triggers the release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      substances, such as histamine and eicosanoids, and is known as the early response. In a skin&#xD;
      prick test, this reaction produces a wheal-and-flare response. Normally, systemic exposure to&#xD;
      an allergen also leads to the more prolonged late reaction, in which eosinophils, basophils,&#xD;
      and activated T cells are recruited to the site of exposure. The recruited T cells also&#xD;
      secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5, typically associated&#xD;
      with helper T cells type 2 (TH2), which further propagate the inflammatory cascade.&#xD;
      Typically, the early response occurs within 15 to 30 minutes (but as quickly as a few&#xD;
      seconds) and usually resolves within 1 to 3 hours, and the late response occurs within 6 to&#xD;
      12 hours and resolves in 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic vaccination (AV), also referred to as immunotherapy or allergen-specific&#xD;
      immunotherapy (SIT), is a curative approach that is available for allergic diseases, which&#xD;
      directly treats the underlying disease. AV is the practice of administering gradually&#xD;
      increasing quantities of an allergen extract to an allergic patient to ameliorate the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with the subsequent exposure to the causative allergen. AV is believed to&#xD;
      exert its beneficial effects on the immune system, at least in part, by modifying the&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte response to subsequent natural allergen exposure. AV has been shown to inhibit&#xD;
      both early and late responses to allergen exposure. AV acts on T cells to modify peripheral&#xD;
      and mucosal TH2 responses to allergen in favor of helper T cell type 1 (TH1) responses. One&#xD;
      of the hallmarks of successful AV is the redressing of a &quot;healthy&quot; TH1/TH2-balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although efficacious, immunotherapy is generally considered a long-term disease modifying&#xD;
      measure that requires months to years of treatment, entails multiple injection regimens and&#xD;
      involves some risk for adverse immune reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent improvements, such as optimal dosing, allergen modification (to reduce allergenicity&#xD;
      while maintaining immunogenicity), adjuvant adsorption (to control release) and adjuvant&#xD;
      activity (to assist immunomodulatory action) are being explored to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      anaphylaxis and decrease the commitment to multiple injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel allergy vaccine (Ragweed MATAMPL) has been developed for the prevention or relief of&#xD;
      allergic symptoms caused by a variety of pollens. Ragweed MATAMPL, which contains the&#xD;
      allergens of ragweed (chemically modified by glutaraldehyde) adsorbed onto L-tyrosine with&#xD;
      the addition of the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), is being evaluated for the&#xD;
      specific treatment of ragweed seasonally induced allergic rhinitis. Ragweed MATAMPL is&#xD;
      intended for use as a pre-seasonal therapeutic allergy vaccine in patients with proven&#xD;
      seasonal allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis due to IgE mediated allergy to ragweed. This&#xD;
      novel vaccine formulation is designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only&#xD;
      four escalating dose injections, in contrast to the longer schedules currently in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Ragweed MATAMPL as determined by patient symptomatic response to pollen and patient quality&#xD;
      of life in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC) that reproduces the clinical setting. The&#xD;
      development of the EEC, which delivers a controlled pollen challenge over time and allows&#xD;
      evaluation of a patient's response at any time point throughout the challenge process,&#xD;
      provides the opportunity to examine various aspects of efficacy of anti-allergic treatments&#xD;
      within a single center at various times of the year. The EEC affords a more controlled&#xD;
      environment than natural pollen exposure in which variables such as unpredictable pollen&#xD;
      levels, varying weather conditions during the study period, and varying levels of pollen&#xD;
      exposure within the patient population are eliminated. Furthermore, the question of patient&#xD;
      compliance is largely eliminated because the patients are scrutinized closely while they are&#xD;
      recording symptoms. In addition, an EEC study is an acceptable study model for determining&#xD;
      the dose response for an allergic rhinitis drug as outlined in the draft U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) guidelines &quot;Allergic Rhinitis Clinical Development Programs for Drug&#xD;
      Products,&quot; April 2000.&#xD;
