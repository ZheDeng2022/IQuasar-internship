  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and immunogenicity of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine&#xD;
      candidate in individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection successfully treated with HAART. The&#xD;
      rationale for this study is based on previous scientific experiments, including data&#xD;
      indicating that this vaccine can elicit strong HIV-1-specific T cell immune responses in&#xD;
      humans and monkeys and lead to a retardation of HIV-1 disease progression in animal models of&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIV vaccine to be administered during this study consists of three recombinant HIV clade&#xD;
      B viral antigens: the envelope glycoprotein gp120 and two regulatory proteins, Nef and&#xD;
      Tat.The antigens are formulated in a proprietary adjuvant, AS02A, comprised of two&#xD;
      immunostimulants in an oil-in-water emulsion (gp120/NefTat/AS02A). The vaccine and the&#xD;
      adjuvant are manufactured and provided for the study by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals,&#xD;
      Rixensart, Belgium. The drugs will be given by intramuscular (IM) injection at a standard&#xD;
      dose of 20 mg together with 0.5 ml of the AS02A adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty HIV-1 infected individuals will be randomly enrolled into three different study&#xD;
      groups, receiving either the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine (10 individuals), the AS02A adjuvant&#xD;
      alone (5 individuals) or a placebo (5 individuals). After obtaining informed consent,&#xD;
      subjects will have a history and physical exam performed and have laboratory tests to confirm&#xD;
      they meet all inclusion and exclusion entry criteria. Women of childbearing potential will&#xD;
      have a pregnancy test prior to each injection of the investigational product. Injections with&#xD;
      vaccine, adjuvant alone, or placebo will then be performed at weeks 0, 4, and 12. Study&#xD;
      participants will undergo close monitoring after each vaccination. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained for immunological assays at study baseline (2 times) and weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 14, 24,&#xD;
      and 48. All patients will maintain their antiretroviral treatment regimen during the entire&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;

      DESIGN: This study is a randomized, double blind clinical trial of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A&#xD;
      vaccine in individuals with well-controlled chronic HIV-1 infection who have been&#xD;
      successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The adjuvanted&#xD;
      protein vaccine candidate consists of three recombinant viral antigens: the envelope&#xD;
      glycoprotein gp120 and two regulatory proteins, Nef and Tat. The latter are expressed as one&#xD;
      recombinant fusion protein, NefTat. The antigens are formulated in the proprietary AS02A&#xD;
      adjuvant. The goal of this trial is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine in HIV-1-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION: 48 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE: 20 subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection receiving highly active antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (HAART) with HIV RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL on at least two measurements in the&#xD;
      previous 6 months and a CD4+ T cell count &gt;400 cells/mm3 within 45 days of study entry will&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGIMEN: Enrolled patients will be randomized to receive either the vaccine&#xD;
      (gp120/NefTat/AS02A) (10 individuals), the AS02A adjuvant only (5 individuals) or a placebo&#xD;
      (5 individuals). Injections will be administered IM at weeks 0, 4, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The two primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the gp120/NefTat/AS02A vaccine in individuals&#xD;
           with well-controlled chronic HIV-1 infection on HAART; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the cell-mediated immune response (IL-2 secreting CD4+ T cells) to at least&#xD;
           one vaccinal antigen induced by the vaccine-adjuvant combination in individuals with&#xD;
           chronic HIV-1 infection on successful HAART, at two weeks after the third vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS: The two co-primary study endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the occurrence, intensity, and relationship of any local and general signs and symptoms&#xD;
           during a 7-day follow-up period after each vaccination (primary safety endpoint); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the changes in the frequency of IL-2 secreting CD4+ T cells in response to at least one&#xD;
           vaccinal antigen (primary immunogenicity endpoint) in the three different patient&#xD;
           categories, assessed two weeks after the third vaccination.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    1. Condoms (male or female) with or without spermicidal agent. Condoms are&#xD;
                       recommended because their appropriate use is the only contraception method&#xD;

&#xD;
                    3. Intrauterine device (IUD). An IUD is an adequate method of birth control,&#xD;
                       but increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. An FDA-approved oral contraceptive, provided there is no interaction with&#xD;
                       the woman's current antiretroviral therapy or other medications;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the male&#xD;
                  subject or his partner must also use contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 RNA &gt; 50 copies/mL within 6 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received antiretroviral therapy within 12 months of known HIV-1 seroconversion.&#xD;

             renal, pancreatic, or neurological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (&lt;24 hours) febrile illness on the day of vaccination (temperature &gt;101 degrees&#xD;

          -  Any condition or history of illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, might&#xD;
             interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives&#xD;
