  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess whether&#xD;
      iseganan, applied topically to the oral cavity, can prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia&#xD;
      among patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated and survive for up to 14 days.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized and receive their first dose of Study Drug within 24 hours of&#xD;
      oral/nasal intubation and the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The Study Period will&#xD;
      begin with the first administration of Study Drug (Study Day 1). Three mL of Study Drug (9 mg&#xD;
      iseganan or matching placebo) will be applied to all visible surfaces in the oral cavity and&#xD;
      the oral portion of the endotracheal tube (for non-tracheostomy patients) every 4 hours&#xD;
      through Study Day 14, or until the diagnosis of microbiologically-confirmed pneumonia (based&#xD;
      on central laboratory results) or extubation, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated for clinically defined pneumonia at least once daily and, if&#xD;
      diagnosed, blood specimens will be collected and cultured, and a bronchoscopic alveolar&#xD;
      lavage (BAL) specimen (for intubated patients) or a respiratory secretion specimen (for&#xD;
      extubated patients) will be obtained PRIOR to initiating or changing any systemic&#xD;
      antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
