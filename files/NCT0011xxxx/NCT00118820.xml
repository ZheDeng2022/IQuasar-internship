  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite over 50 years of antibiotic use and multiple clinical investigations (&gt;50), no&#xD;
      definitive studies exist to confirm or refute the use of systemic antibiotics to prevent&#xD;
      postoperative inflammatory complications after third molar (M3), aka &quot;wisdom teeth&quot; removal.&#xD;
      Among patients having M3s extracted, does the administration of systemic prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics when compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
      complications? The first specific aim of the study is to implement a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when&#xD;
      compared to placebo, decrease the rate of postoperative alveolar osteitis (AO) after M3&#xD;
      extraction. For this proposal, postoperative AO is the primary outcome variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second specific aim is to implement a pilot study using a randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine if systemic prophylactic antibiotics, when compared to placebo,&#xD;
      decrease the rate of postoperative infection after M3 extraction. For the purposes of this&#xD;
      proposal, postoperative infection is a secondary outcome variable. Based on sample size&#xD;
      estimates, we believe it will be necessary to implement a multi-year trial to address the&#xD;
      second specific aim definitively. As such, we will use the experience and preliminary results&#xD;
      derived from this clinical trial to develop and implement a future large scale clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third specific aim is to identify risk factors associated with postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
      complications in order to develop a model to predict if the prophylactic administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics will prevent the postoperative inflammatory complications of alveolar osteitis&#xD;
      and infection following the removal of M3's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to provide compelling clinical evidence to support&#xD;
      recommendations regarding the use of systemic antibiotics in this setting and alter clinical&#xD;
      practice based on the results of a well-done, definitive clinical investigation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The management of impacted M3s is a high volume procedure. In the United States, the cost of&#xD;
      M3 removal has been estimated to be over 2 billion dollars, not including costs for consults,&#xD;
      x-rays, medications, surgical center charges, or over 5 million surgical extractions and&#xD;
      treatment of postoperative inflammatory complications (Flick. 1999). Practices associated&#xD;
      with M3 removal can have a significant impact on large numbers of patients, providers, and&#xD;
      payers. There is currently no consensus on the use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to&#xD;
      decrease the risk of inflammatory complications following M3 removal.The most common&#xD;
      post-operative inflammatory complications following M3 extraction are alveolar osteitis (AO)&#xD;
      and wound infection (Larsen, 1992; Piecuch et al., 1995; Sekar et al., 2001). AO, aka &quot;dry&#xD;
      socket,&quot; is a wound-healing problem characterized by severe, unremitting pain. The reported&#xD;
      frequency of AO is 6-68%. Bacterial colonization stimulates plasmin production and&#xD;
      fibrinolysis with dissolution of the extraction site clot . More than 45% of patients who&#xD;
      sustain AO require 4 or 5 more postoperative appointments for resolution of symptoms (Larsen,&#xD;
      1992; Andra et al., 1990). Given its common occurrence, identifying treatments, i.e. systemic&#xD;
      antibiotics, to decrease the rate of AO following M3 extraction would be an important&#xD;
      contribution to enhancing patient outcomes. The second common postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
      condition following M3 extraction is wound infection. The reported frequency of postoperative&#xD;
      infection ranges from 1.2 - 27%, with most studies reporting a frequency of &lt;10%. Because&#xD;
      wound infections are bacterial, it is hypothesized that using systemic antibiotics will&#xD;
      reduce the rate of postoperative wound infections. There are, however, no definitive&#xD;
      prospective studies that support or refute the necessity of systemic antibiotics in the&#xD;
      prevention of postoperative inflammatory complications of AO or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies published to date addressing the role of systemic antibiotics and M3 removal have&#xD;
      one or more major methodological flaws in study design characterized as :1) no or ambiguous&#xD;
      definition of the outcome variable, 2) inadequate sample size, 3) non-uniformity of protocol&#xD;
      design, 4) lack of randomization techniques and 5) poor-follow-up monitoring. Clearly, there&#xD;
      is a need for a definitive, rigorous, well-designed placebo-controlled randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial to ascertain the efficacy of systemic antibiotics in preventing postoperative&#xD;
      inflammatory complications after M3 removal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demographics: While all ages are eligible for study enrollment, as a practical matter,&#xD;
             most patients having M3s removed are usually &gt; 13-14 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gender: Males and females will be offered to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Race: All races and ethnicities are eligible for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical status: at least one impacted mandibular third molar ( M3 ) must be scheduled&#xD;
             for extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anesthesia: Patient request that the procedure be executed using intravenous sedation&#xD;
             or general anesthesia. Intravenous sedation will be accomplished with use of an IV&#xD;
             placed in the antecubital fossa of each patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Health status: Healthy patients or patients with mild systemic disease, i.e. ASA&#xD;
             status &lt; 3, are eligible for study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing infection: Infection is characterised as having an area with frank&#xD;
             purulence and/or cellulitis characterized by erythema, induration and inability to&#xD;
             open the mouth wide enough to provide access to the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing Systemic Illness: as evidenced by severe dry mouth, patients who have&#xD;
             undergone radiotherapy for oral cancer, patients that are immunocompromised, patients&#xD;
             that require antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis, as well as, patients who are&#xD;
             taking antimicrobials for other systemic diseases, i.e., uncontrolled diabetes., ASA&#xD;
             status &gt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergic Reactions to Medications: Patients who are allergic to Penicillin and&#xD;
             Clindamycin will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anesthesia: Patient request that the operation be performed with local anesthesia&#xD;
             without intravenous sedation or general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for study enrollment. If after&#xD;
             consultation with the obstetrician, there is no contraindication to removing the&#xD;
             impacted teeth with sedation or contraindication to receiving the test medications&#xD;
             (penicillin or clindamycin) and the patient wants to pursue treatment, she would be&#xD;
             considered eligible for study enrollment.&#xD;
