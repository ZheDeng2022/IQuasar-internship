  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a pulsed magnetic field (PMF) pad will&#xD;
      improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: A pulsed magnetic field pad will effectively reduce the symptoms of RA in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RA is a condition characterized by pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes. These&#xD;
      symptoms often persist despite the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and&#xD;
      disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Many women for whom these drugs do not work&#xD;
      turn to complementary and alternative therapies, including the use of magnetic devices.&#xD;
      Although few studies have investigated the effects of low strength PMF pads in persons with&#xD;
      RA, evidence suggests that PMF may help relieve pain, inflammation, and fatigue. This study&#xD;
      will determine the effects of a PMF device on RA symptoms in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:&#xD;
      active PMF pad treatment, sham PMF pad treatment, or standard of care, which may include drug&#xD;
      therapy or physical therapy. Participants in the active and sham PMF pad groups will be&#xD;
      treated with their assigned pad for approximately 8 minutes, twice a day for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Questionnaires and self-report scales will be used to assess pain, fatigue, sleep&#xD;
      quality, mood, and inflammation episodes. Blood and urine collection will occur to assess&#xD;
      levels of stress hormones and certain proteins.&#xD;
