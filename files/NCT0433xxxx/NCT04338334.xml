    <textblock>
      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of cohesive bandage on the axillary web syndrome in&#xD;
      improving pain, reducing swelling and increasing mobility and functionality of the shoulder.&#xD;
      Design: randomized single-blinded controlled trial. Follow-up: five physical therapy&#xD;
      assessments: pre-intervention; post-intervention, 3 and 6 months post-intervention&#xD;
      post-intervention. Participants: 90 consecutive women diagnosed with axillary web syndrome&#xD;
      after undergoing unilateral breast cancer surgery with ALND or SLND at the Prıíncipe de&#xD;
      Asturias Hospital in Alcalà de Henares, Madrid (Spain). Randomization: women will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to two groups by EpiData 3.1 software. Interventions: Control group: Physical&#xD;
      Therapy composed of manual lymph-drainage technique in axilla, and proximal ipsilateral arm,&#xD;
      specific thumb manual lymph-drainage on the taut cords to make them gradually more flexible,&#xD;
      in conjunction with progressive active arm therapeutic exercises; Intervention group:&#xD;
      progressive active arm therapeutic exercises with cohesive bandage.&#xD;

    <description>Oxford Shoulder Score. The OSS is a unidimensional score comprising 12 questions about pain and disability involving activities of daily routine. Thus, each of the 12 questions is scored from 0 to 4, with 4 representing best outcome/least symptoms. Scores from each question are summed so the overall score run from 0 to 48 with 48 being the best outcome; so that the lower scores indicate more pain and disability. The OSS Spanish version is applicable, reliable, valid, and responsive to assess shoulder disability in Spanish women after breast cancer treatment</description>

    <description>FACTB+4. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): HRQoL was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Spanish version 4. FACT-Bv4 is a 40-item questionnaire designed to measure multidimensional HRQoL in women with breast cancer. The 40 items cover four generic scales of well-being (Physical, Emotional, Social, and Functional) and two side-specific subscales: Breast Cancer (9 items) and Arm (4 items). The Arm-specific subscale assesses arm morbidity: 1) pain, 2) poor range of arm movements, 3) numbness, and 4) stiffness. The Breast Cancer subscale plus the arm subscale range from 0 to 56 points. The Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is the sum of Physical and Functional wellbeing plus Breast Cancer Subscale (range 0-92 points). The FACT-B total score can range from 0 to 144, with a higher score indicating better HRQoL.</description>

    <description>Cohesive bandage is a self-adherent lightweight bandage, made of a porous nonwoven polyester material. A single self-adherent inelastic bandage will be directly applied at full stretch on cleaned and dried skin (10cm 3M CobanTM Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co, United States) in a spiral method around the limb, starting at the hand and a layer overlap of 50%, so that the greatest compression was located at the distal points, gradually decreasing toward the proximal shoulder part. Cohesive latex-free bandages will be available for those allergic women. Women will do progressive active arm therapeutic exercises with bandaging.</description>
