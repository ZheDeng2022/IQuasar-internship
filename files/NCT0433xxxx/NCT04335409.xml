  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major goals of radiotherapy include local disease control and improvement of the patients'&#xD;
      prognoses. One possible side effect of radiotherapy for lung cancer is radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
      Severe (grade ≥3) radiation pneumonitis can even be fatal in approximately 2% of the&#xD;
      patients. It would be important to identify patients developing radiation pneumonitis and&#xD;
      requiring medical treatment early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the patients are asked to complete a questionnaire (paper version) once&#xD;
      a week during the period of radiotherapy and up to 24 weeks following radiotherapy. In this&#xD;
      questionnaire, the patients are asked to state and rate their symptoms potentially associated&#xD;
      with pneumonitis. Scoring points are assigned to the severity of the symptoms (symptom&#xD;
      scores), and the resulting sum score (patient score) will be used for identification of&#xD;
      radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this trial is to evaluate the usefulness of a new symptom-based scoring&#xD;
      system with respect to the identification of patients developing pneumonitis after&#xD;
      radiotherapy of breast or lung cancer. The discriminative power of the symptom-based scoring&#xD;
      system will be assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Taking into&#xD;
      account that 5% of patients will not qualify for Full Analysis Set, a total of 78 patients&#xD;
      should be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If statistical significance of the AUC is reached, the most-informative (optimal) scoring&#xD;
      point to identify radiation pneumonitis will be derived. Sensitivity analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted to further investigate the performance of the symptom-based scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 10 patients, the paper version of the symptom-based scoring system (questionnaire) will be&#xD;
      supplemented by a mobile application (app) asking the same questions regarding symptoms&#xD;
      potentially associated with radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;

      Background Most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) receive radiotherapy in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy as definitive treatment. Also, a considerable number of&#xD;
      patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are treated with radiotherapy with&#xD;
      or without concurrent chemotherapy. Radiation pneumonitis is a possible side effect of&#xD;
      radiotherapy for lung cancer. Severe pneumonitis was reported to be fatal in approximately 2%&#xD;
      of patients. In our centre, the prevalence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was 7.6% in&#xD;
      patients irradiated for lung cancer. The prevalence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis in&#xD;
      patients with risk factors was 18.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonitis can occur up to 23 weeks following radiotherapy. Therefore, the symptoms may not&#xD;
      be associated with previous radiotherapy, and pneumonitis may be missed. It would be&#xD;
      important to identify patients developing radiation pneumonitis and requiring medical&#xD;
      treatment more early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to develop a symptom-based scoring system that contributes to an earlier&#xD;
      detection of radiation pneumonitis requiring medical intervention (grade ≥2) after&#xD;
      radiotherapy for lung cancer. This scoring system is a prerequisite for a mobile application,&#xD;
      which can be used by the patients at home to rate their symptoms possibly related to&#xD;
      pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are asked to complete a questionnaire (paper version) once a week during the period&#xD;
      of radiotherapy and up to 24 weeks following radiotherapy. In this questionnaire, the&#xD;
      patients are asked to state and rate their symptoms potentially associated with pneumonitis.&#xD;
      Scoring points are assigned to the severity of the symptoms (symptom scores), and the&#xD;
      resulting sum score (patient score) will be used for identification of radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint To assess the performance characteristics of the symptom-based scoring&#xD;
      system for detection of radiation pneumonitis the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)&#xD;
      curve is used to show the connection between sensitivity and specificity for every possible&#xD;
      cut-off for the scoring system and to select the optimal scoring point for detection of&#xD;
      radiation pneumonitis- The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated to prove the&#xD;
      diagnostic ability of the scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General trial design and duration This is a single-center prospective study, which aims to&#xD;
      assess the performance of a new symptom-based score and to identify its optimal scoring point&#xD;
      with respect to the detection of patients developing pneumonitis following radiotherapy of&#xD;
      breast cancer or lung cancer. The recruitment of all 98 patients (93 patients plus drop-outs)&#xD;
      should be completed within 33 months. The treatment period will be 6-7 weeks, and the follow&#xD;
      up period 24 weeks. This equals a total running time for the trial of approximately 40&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom-Based Scoring System (Paper Version) The patients are asked to complete a paper-based&#xD;
      questionnaire (symptom-based scoring system, paper version) once a week during the period of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and up to 24 weeks following radiotherapy. The patients are asked to state and&#xD;
      score their symptoms that are potentially associated with pneumonitis, namely cough,&#xD;
      shortness of breath and fever. Scoring points are assigned to the severity of the symptoms (=&#xD;
      symptom scores), and the resulting sum score (patient score) will be used to identify&#xD;
      radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time of radiotherapy, the patients will complete the paper-based questionnaire&#xD;
      directly prior to their appointment with a physician who will perform a physical examination&#xD;
      once a week. Following radiotherapy, the patients will be contacted by phone once a week and&#xD;
      asked to answer the questions of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of an increase of the total score compared to baseline, patients receive either a&#xD;
      follow-up telephone call after 3 days, are asked to come to the hospital as outpatients or&#xD;
      are admitted to hospital. In case of suspected pneumonitis, patients undergo lung function&#xD;
      tests. If the suspected diagnosis of pneumonitis is substantiated, patients receive a chest&#xD;
      x-ray plus/minus computed tomography. If the diagnosis symptomatic radiation pneumonitis&#xD;
      (grade ≥2) has been confirmed, patients receive medical intervention. The vast majority of&#xD;
      the patients receive prednisolone, which is considered the mainstay of the treatment for&#xD;
      radiation pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptom-based sum score is correlated to pneumonitis (yes vs. no). At the end of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, patients are asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their satisfaction&#xD;
      with the score. In case of a dissatisfaction rate &gt;20%, the score needs modifications before&#xD;
      it can be used in future studies. In case of a dissatisfaction rate &gt;40%, it will be&#xD;
      considered not useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup Analysis: Symptom-Based Scoring System (Mobile Application) In 10 patients, the&#xD;
      paper version of the symptom-based scoring system (questionnaire) will be supplemented by a&#xD;
      mobile application (app) asking the same questions regarding cough, shortness of breath and&#xD;
      fever. The symptoms collected by the app will not be evaluated or analyzed. With regard to&#xD;
      the app, only its functionality will be tested in this study. The patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire of the app directly after completing the questionnaire of the&#xD;
      paper version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics / Sample size calculation The main goal of this trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      usefulness of a new symptom-based scoring system with respect to the identification of&#xD;
      patients developing pneumonitis after radiotherapy for lung cancer. The discriminative power&#xD;
      of the symptom-based scoring system will be assessed by calculating the area under the ROC&#xD;
      curve (AUC). Assuming a ratio between patients without and with radiation pneumonitis of&#xD;
      3.63, a sample size of 93 patients is required in the full analysis set to yield statistical&#xD;
      significance at the significance level of 5% with a power of 90% if the AUC under the&#xD;
      alternative hypothesis is in fact at least 0.9. Taking into account that 5% of patients will&#xD;
      not qualify for Full Analysis Set, a total of 98 patients should be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If statistical significance of the AUC is reached, the most-informative (optimal) scoring&#xD;
      point to identify radiation pneumonitis will be derived. Sensitivity analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted to further investigate the performance of the symptom-based scoring system.&#xD;
