  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of underage alcohol use continues to be a public health concern. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have reported associations between teen drinking tendencies and parental attitudes&#xD;
      and beliefs, parental awareness of teen drinking, parental monitoring and the quality of the&#xD;
      parent-teen relationship and communication. The extensive work in this area has resulted in&#xD;
      parent-based intervention (PBI) efforts to prevent or reduce adolescent alcohol use. Several&#xD;
      independent studies have indicated that teens whose parents received a PBI reported less&#xD;
      alcohol use and fewer alcohol-related consequences. Despite these strengths, one major&#xD;
      limitation of PBI is that they do not currently take into account the large role that social&#xD;
      networking sites (SNS) use plays in adolescents' lives and in relation to their alcohol use.&#xD;
      Most (90%) adolescents are on SNS, and their Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter profiles&#xD;
      include alcohol content. Thus, adolescents are making and exposed to SNS alcohol displays and&#xD;
      these displays are associated with high-risk drinking cognitions and alcohol use. As such,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to develop and refine an interactive PBI designed to reduce&#xD;
      high-risk SNS cognitions (i.e. attitudes and norms), alcohol use, and negative consequences&#xD;
      among adolescents. To achieve study aims, the investigators propose an iterative process of&#xD;
      focus groups in order to develop and refine the interactive PBI to be delivered in the pilot&#xD;
      study with 1 and 6-month follow-up among 100 parent/teen dyads. The objective of this R34&#xD;
      application is to establish feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed interactive&#xD;
      PBI that focuses on the role of SNS in adolescent alcohol use as well as to determine&#xD;
      preliminary effect sizes for future studies. Determining an efficacious way to reduce alcohol&#xD;
      use and high-risk alcohol display cognitions affords future research the opportunity to make&#xD;
      use of social network-based interventions, thus the proposed research has great potential to&#xD;
      serve as a catalyst for future research.&#xD;

      Although adolescents spend an increasing amount of time with their friends, parents remain an&#xD;
      important source of support and continue to play a key role in the lives of their&#xD;
      adolescents. The extensive work in this area has resulted in parentbased intervention (PBI)&#xD;
      efforts to prevent or reduce adolescent alcohol use. Research has shown that teens whose&#xD;
      parents received a PBI reported less alcohol use and fewer alcoholrelated consequences up to&#xD;
      9-month follow-up relative to controls. However, one major limitation of PBIs is that they do&#xD;
      not currently take into account the large role that social networking sites (SNS) play in&#xD;
      adolescents' lives and in relation to their alcohol use. Most (90%) adolescents are on SNS,&#xD;
      and their Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter profiles include alcohol content. Thus,&#xD;
      adolescents are making and exposed to SNS alcohol displays, and these displays are associated&#xD;
      with high-risk cognitions and alcohol use. Research has argued that existing parental&#xD;
      mediation techniques grounded primarily on television/film media have fundamental&#xD;
      inadequacies when applied to more interactive media such as websites, social media, and&#xD;
      mobile apps as they do not account for the interactivity, immersive virtual environments, and&#xD;
      mediated communication innate to SNS. Further, most PBIs are presented in static manual form.&#xD;
      The investigators are unaware of any study to date that has developed and tested an&#xD;
      interactive PBI about alcohol use and the role of SNS in adolescent alcohol use. As such, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop and refine an interactive PBI designed to reduce both&#xD;
      high-risk SNS cognitions and alcohol use among adolescents. This application responds to&#xD;
      PA-18-067 &quot;Pilot and Feasibility Studies in Preparation for Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention&#xD;
      Trials&quot; as it aims to establish feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed&#xD;
      interactive PBI that focuses on the role of SNS in adolescent alcohol use as well as to&#xD;
      determine preliminary effect sizes for future studies. The specific aims are as follows: Aim&#xD;
      1: Develop and refine an interactive PBI targeting the influence of SNS on high-risk SNS&#xD;
      cognitions and alcohol use among adolescents. Interactive PBI content and text message&#xD;
      prompts will be developed through focus groups, which will inform a new interactive PBI to be&#xD;
      tested in a pilot study (Aim 2). A total of 16 focus groups (8 parent, 8 teen) will be&#xD;
      conducted with 8-10 people in each group with parents only being in focus groups with other&#xD;
      parents and teens being only with other teens. Focus groups will occur in two phases whereby&#xD;
      an initial sample of participants (4 parent and 4 teen focus groups) will engage in parent&#xD;
      and teen specific focus groups (split by age of teen-15-17 and 18-20) in which they will be&#xD;
      asked to view and interact with the interactive SNS PBI and generate additional PBI content.&#xD;
      Based on focus group data from the first round of focus groups, revisions will be made for&#xD;
      use in the remaining 8 focus groups (4 parent, 4 teen). Aim 2: Conduct a pilot study with&#xD;
      parents and their adolescents aged 15-20 from the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) area to determine&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect sizes (to estimate power and sample size&#xD;
      for a future R01 application). Parent/teen dyads (N=100) will be randomized to interactive&#xD;
      PBI (n=50) or active control (n=50) with a 1- and 6-month follow-up. Parents in the&#xD;
      interactive PBI condition will receive the interactive web-based SNS PBI with text message&#xD;
      prompts developed and finalized through Aim 1 focus groups. Parents in the active control&#xD;
      condition will receive an emailed copy of the Surgeon General's Call to Action: A Guide for&#xD;
      Families. General Hypotheses (parent and teen). The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      interactive SNS PBI will be feasible (i.e., number of eligible participants, number of&#xD;
      parents who gave consent, number of teens who gave consent, length of time to achieve planned&#xD;
      recruitment and enrollment goal, rate of study completion and rate of study attrition) and&#xD;
      acceptable (i.e., proportion of parents and teens who find the intervention acceptable; ease&#xD;
      of viewing and interacting with interactive PBI content; relevance of material; finding&#xD;
      content helpful, beneficial, important; ratings of individual web-based modules and text&#xD;
      messages of the PBI; the proportion of parents and teens who would recommend the study to&#xD;
      other families, and the proportion of parents and teens who found the interactive PBI to be&#xD;
      favorable overall) relative to active control. The investigators further hypothesize that&#xD;
      teens and parents in the interactive PBI condition will report more positive communication&#xD;
      about alcohol and SNS at the 1- and 6-month follow-up relative to active control. Parent&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that at 1- and 6-month follow-up, parents in the&#xD;
      interactive PBI condition will report greater knowledge about alcohol as well as the role of&#xD;
      SNS in alcohol use relative to active control. Teen Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that teens in the interactive PBI condition will report less drinking, fewer alcohol-related&#xD;
      negative consequences, less favorable attitudes toward posting about alcohol on SNS, greater&#xD;
      perceived vulnerability to the risks of posting alcohol displays on SNS, and decreased&#xD;
      normative perceptions about how many teens post alcohol displays on SNS relative to active&#xD;
      control at 1- and 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
