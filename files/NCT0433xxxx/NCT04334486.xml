    <textblock>
      This study will examine the history of video game use an activities of manual dexterity with&#xD;
      the scored skills used in the Eyesi surgical simulator. Subjects will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in video games or no video games prior to testing skills in Eyesi to examine training effects&#xD;
      of video game participation and changes in manual dexterity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A popular crossover fighting video game released in 2001 for the Nintendo Gamecube that&#xD;
      emphasizes reflexes and dexterity to perform specific maneuvers will be used in this study as&#xD;
      a potential dexterity trainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eyesi is a training device utilized in many ophthalmology residency training programs to&#xD;
      improve intraocular operative skills. The EyeSi is a validated training tool that uses&#xD;
      high-end virtual reality that can be equipped with instrumentation for cataract or&#xD;
      vitreoretinal surgery. The device itself consists of eyepieces that replicate a surgical&#xD;
      scope, a mannequin head where handpiece probes can be inserted and position tracked to&#xD;
      virtually recreate a surgical environment. The simulator also has a monitor that can be used&#xD;
      to see the surgical simulator environment. As part of the software, numerous training tasks&#xD;
      and exercises are available programmed into the device. These exercises utilize numerous&#xD;
      metrics such as distance traveled, tissue treatment, efficiency, instrument handing, and&#xD;
      others to provide the user with a raw score out of 100 for each task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be asked to complete a manual dexterity questionnaire including history of&#xD;
      video game use as well as tasks demonstrating manual dexterity ability such as the ability to&#xD;
      play a musical instrument. Participants will then be randomized to the intervention group or&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will be asked to play 10 minutes of the Gamecube game &quot;Super Smash&#xD;
      Brothers Melee&quot; as their &quot;warm-up&quot; prior to completing the EyeSi surgical tasks of&#xD;
      navigation, forceps, and bimanual with their scores collected and averaged across all tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will complete the EyeSi surgical tasks of navigation, forceps, and bimanual&#xD;
      with their scores collected and averaged, but will not perform a &quot;warm-up&quot; task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned statistical analysis will include an average of total scores across navigation,&#xD;
      forceps, and bimanual tasks. Chi square analysis will then be utilized to determine any&#xD;
      statistical significance between intervention and control groups. Simulator scores will also&#xD;
      be associated with questionnaire responses and simple linear regression will be used for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
