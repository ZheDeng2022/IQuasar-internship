  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies the side effects of itacitinib when given together with standard&#xD;
      treatment (tacrolimus and sirolimus), and to see how well it works in preventing&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) in patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or&#xD;
      myelofibrosis who are undergoing reduced intensity conditioning donor stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. GVHD is a common complication after donor stem cell transplantation,&#xD;
      resulting from donor immune cells recognizing recipients' cells and attacking them. Adding&#xD;
      itacitinib to tacrolimus and sirolimus may reduce the risk GVHD and ultimately improve&#xD;
      overall outcome and survival after donor stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, estimate graft-versus-host disease free relapse free&#xD;
      (GRFS) survival at 1- year post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1- and 2-years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the probabilities of overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS) at 1- and&#xD;
      2-years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate rate of infection and development of second malignancies including&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorders at 1- and 2-years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess patients' quality of life (QOL) at day 100 and 1 year post alloHCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize and evaluate hematologic recovery, donor cell engraftment and immune&#xD;
      reconstitution by cell count and flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize changes in aGVHD biomarkers (Reg-3alpha, TNF-RI, and ST2) and a composite&#xD;
      biomarker panel (IL2Ralpha, TNF-R1, IL-8, and hepatocyte growth factor), JAK-regulated&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNFalpha, CRP, Beta2 Microglobulin, and IFNgamma) and&#xD;
      STAT3 phosphorylation (downstream of JAK signaling) over time and by aGVHD status/grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (RIC): Patients receive fludarabine via infusion on days -9 to&#xD;
      -5 and melphalan on day -4 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT (HSCT): Patients undergo HSCT on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day -3&#xD;
      and continuing until day 100 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) or PO and sirolimus PO beginning day -3&#xD;
      and continuing until day 100 with a taper in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically&#xD;
      for up to 2 years post- transplantation.&#xD;
