      In recent years, immunotherapy research has made great progress, especially the&#xD;
      immunocheckpoint inhibitors represented by anti-pd-1 antibody have shown good efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of malignant tumors, and some patients can achieve long-term survival. However,&#xD;
      despite the encouraging clinical data, only a small number of people have benefited.&#xD;
      Therefore, how to further improve the efficacy of immunotherapy and expand the benefit&#xD;
      population has become the focus of this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The applicant was previously published in Oncoimmunology (2017; E1331807) pointed out in the&#xD;
      above article: MDSC is a group of immunosuppressive cells, the number of this group of cells&#xD;
      in the body of cancer patients is more than normal, its presence affects the proliferation,&#xD;
      activation and function of T cells, is one of the important factors affecting the efficacy of&#xD;
      immunocheckpoint inhibitors. Therefore, ideal drugs used in combination with immunocheckpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors should meet the following conditions: first, they can kill or inactivate tumor&#xD;
      cells to release tumor-specific or associated antigens; Second, MDSC and other&#xD;
      immunosuppressive cells can be eliminated. Third, the number and function of T cells were not&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is a synthetic antimetabolic tumor drug widely used in the treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Myelosuppression is the dose - limiting&#xD;
      toxicity of gemcitabine, which includes lymphocytopenia. Therefore, if the commonly used&#xD;
      clinical dose gemcitabine is used in combination with pd-1 antibody, the effect of pd-1&#xD;
      antibody will be affected due to the reduction of lymphocytes caused by gemcitabine.&#xD;
      Therefore, we speculated that the reduced-dose treatment of gemcitabine combined with pd-1&#xD;
      antibody might have synergistic anti-tumor effect on the second-line and above second-line&#xD;
      treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with negative driver gene, and the adverse reactions&#xD;
      were relatively mild.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase IV, open, non-randomized, single-arm, single-center study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety and efficacy of half-dose gemcitabine combined with pd-1 antibody in&#xD;
      second-line and above treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients with negative driver&#xD;
      genes. Fifty subjects will be enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint of the study was&#xD;
      ORR, while secondary endpoints included DCR, PFS, and OS.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Conventional view holds that chemotherapeutic drugs work by directly killing tumor cells. In&#xD;
      recent years, with the in-depth understanding of immunity, people have realized that the&#xD;
      anti-cancer effect of chemotherapy drugs depends on the body's sound immune system, and&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs have been more and more recognized as an immune regulator. However, it&#xD;
      should be noted that the combination of drugs may not achieve the desired results, or even&#xD;
      the opposite.&#xD;
