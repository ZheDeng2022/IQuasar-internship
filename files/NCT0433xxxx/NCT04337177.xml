  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot pharmacokinetic trial to determine the safety and efficacy of a flavored, orally&#xD;
      administered irinotecan VAL-413 (Orotecan®) given with temozolomide for treatment of&#xD;
      recurrent pediatric solid tumors including but not limited to neuroblastoma,&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, hepatoblastoma and medulloblastoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20 patients ≥ 1 year of age or ≤ 30 years of age with recurrent pediatric solid tumors&#xD;
      will be enrolled. During the first cycle of treatment, each patient will receive 4 daily&#xD;
      doses of VAL-413 (Orotecan®) and one daily dose of the intravenous preparation of irinotecan&#xD;
      taken orally (IRN-IVPO), together with 5 days of concurrent temozolomide. During all&#xD;
      subsequent cycles, only Orotecan® will be given with temozolomide in 5 day courses&#xD;
      administered every 21 days as tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing regimen in this study will be Temozolomide at 100 mg/m2/day with Orotecan® at&#xD;
      either 90 or 110mg/m2/day, administered orally for 5 consecutive days at the beginning of&#xD;
      every 21-day cycle. A single dose of IRN-IVPO will be substituted at the same dosage as&#xD;
      Orotecan® during Cycle 1. Up to 17 cycles of treatment may be administered on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from this study will allow for an assessment of Orotecan® safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      Interval medical histories, targeted physical exams, complete blood counts, and other&#xD;
      laboratory and safety assessments will be performed at Day 1 of each treatment cycle for all&#xD;
      study subjects. At baseline and during study, disease status will be assessed by appropriate&#xD;
      clinical and imaging evaluation (CT, MRI, or PET) and using Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST), or for patients with neuroblastoma, using International Neuroblastoma&#xD;
      Response Criteria. In addition, a palatability survey will be conducted on Day 1 or Day 4 of&#xD;
      the first cycle, which will allow patients to evaluate the taste of Orotecan®. Serum samples&#xD;
      will be collected at various time points on Days 1 and 4 during Cycle 1 to characterize and&#xD;
      compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of Orotecan® and conventional irinotecan given orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of first-cycle toxicity will be used to identify the recommended phase II dose for&#xD;
      Orotecan®. Toxicity will be evaluated and documented using NCI CTCAE guidelines. The&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose will be identified as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6&#xD;
      patients experiences a first cycle dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two different dose levels of VAL-413 (Orotecan®) will be studied in combination with fixed-dose temozolomide using a standard 3 + 3 phase I design. The first three patients will receive temozolomide in combination with Orotecan® at 90 mg/m2/day, which is the standard dose of irinotecan. If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs during Cycle 1 in these patients, then subsequent patients will start Cycle 1 using a Orotecan® dose of 110 mg/m2/day. In the event the starting dose of 90 mg/m2/day is not tolerable due to toxicity, a lower starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day may be implemented.</intervention_model_description>
