  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research the investigators are looking for the direct relationship between&#xD;
      Beta-hydroxybutyrate and hypertension. Since recent research showed a connection between&#xD;
      exercise and hypertension, and diet control and hypertension. The investigators are studying&#xD;
      the possible effect of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels on blood pressure control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure that is ≥ 140 mm hg and / or a&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure that is ≥ 90 mm hg a modifiable and it is known to be a serious risk&#xD;
      factor for cardiovascular disease. Exercise is widely recommended as a lifestyle modification&#xD;
      for hypertensive patients because of its beneficial effect on lowering blood pressure (BP).&#xD;
      Similarly, calorie restriction is also documented to lower systemic hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, both exercise and calorie-restriction are associated with increased&#xD;
      circulating levels of ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB). β-Hydroxybutyrate (βHB;&#xD;
      3-hydroxybutyric acid) is a &quot;ketone body&quot; which is produced the liver, mainly from the&#xD;
      oxidation of fatty acids, and is exported to peripheral tissues for use as an energy source.&#xD;
      It is transported to extrahepatic tissues, and traditionally recognized as a vital&#xD;
      alternative source of energy during starvation. However, recent evidences indicate that apart&#xD;
      from serving as energy fuel, ketone bodies such as βHB block nucleotide-binding domain,&#xD;
      leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (Nlrp3)-inflammasome-mediated&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, and thereby play a prominent role in maintaining physiological&#xD;
      homeostasis parameter such as blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among environmental factors, excessive salt intake is the most common and important risk&#xD;
      factor for hypertension, in which patient with salt-sensitive hypertension demonstrated an&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There is substantial evidence suggesting that blood&#xD;
      pressure's (BP) response to dietary salt intake vary considerably among individuals which is&#xD;
      a phenomenon described as salt sensitivity of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another reference demonstrated a lower circulating level of the ketone body,&#xD;
      beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), in high salt-fed hypertensive rats. Despite the high salt intake,&#xD;
      the specific rescue of (βHB) levels by nutritional supplementation of its precursor,&#xD;
      1,3-butanediol, attenuates hypertension and protects kidney function by inhibiting the renal&#xD;
      Nlrp3 inflammasome in rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing Knowledge and Literature Review: PubMed search builder was used to construct the&#xD;
      following search entry: hypertension AND β-Hydroxybutyrate. The initial search yielded 39&#xD;
      titles. Studies (RCTs or systemic reviews) relevant to the research question were isolated&#xD;
      manually by reading the abstracts. However, due to the novelty of the idea, the investigators&#xD;
      were not able to identify any related literature except of &quot;Chakraborty, Saroj&quot; study. which&#xD;
      was a non-human research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research impact: The current evidence regarding the effect of β-Hydroxybutyrate&#xD;
      supplementation on the reduction of salt-sensitive hypertension was only proven on a&#xD;
      non-human level. The research will address this gap in knowledge by looking for any&#xD;
      relationship between the levels of (βHB) and salt-sensitive hypertensive in human subjects,&#xD;
      which may change the current understanding of the treatment of salt-sensitive.&#xD;
