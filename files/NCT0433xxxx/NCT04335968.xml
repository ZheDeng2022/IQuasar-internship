  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the most frequent complications after surgery in&#xD;
      elderly patients, affecting between 20 and 40% of patients older than 60 after major surgery.&#xD;
      This complication has huge consequences for the patients, families and society: increase of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, prolonged length of stay, cognitive and functional decline leading&#xD;
      to loss of autonomy, and important additional healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among numerous risk factors identified, perioperative inflammatory stress is a key element in&#xD;
      delirium genesis: surgical trauma releases danger signals in systemic circulation, activating&#xD;
      immune cells and leading to neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a neurohormone regulating circadian rhythm. But it also exhibits antioxidant and&#xD;
      free radical scavenger properties, and regulates energy metabolism and immune function. It&#xD;
      has already demonstrated a neuroprotective potential in various animal models. Its use&#xD;
      against delirium is promising: it decreases delirium incidence in elderly patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in medical ward, and several studies are now recruiting in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the trial is that in a high-risk population, perioperative melatonin can&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of POD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of perioperative melatonin administration on&#xD;
      postoperative delirium incidence in the first 10 days after surgery, in elderly patients&#xD;
      (over 70 years old) being hospitalized and scheduled for acute surgery of fractured lower&#xD;
      limb (from femoral head to tibial plateau).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, national multicentric (21 centers), phase III, superiority,&#xD;
      comparative randomized (1:1) double-blinded clinical trial with two parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: melatonin 4mg per os every night, starting the evening before surgery (or&#xD;
      2 hours before emergency surgery) and until day 5 after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: placebo of this drug with the same schedule, during the same period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are aged 70 or older, hospitalized and scheduled for surgery of a severe&#xD;
      fracture of a lower limb (from femoral head to tibial plateau).&#xD;

      Postoperative delirium (POD) is one of the most frequent complications after surgery in&#xD;
      elderly patients, affecting between 20 and 40% of patients older than 60 after major surgery.&#xD;
      This complication has huge consequences for the patients, families and society: increase of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, prolonged length of stay, cognitive and functional decline leading&#xD;
      to loss of autonomy, and important additional healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among numerous risk factors identified, perioperative inflammatory stress is a key element in&#xD;
      delirium genesis: surgical trauma releases danger signals in systemic circulation, activating&#xD;
      immune cells and leading to neuroinflammation. In the brain, especially in hippocampus,&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, immune cells recruitment and microglial activation alter synaptic&#xD;
      plasticity and lead to acute cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, with aging, an increase in&#xD;
      initial neuroinflammatory response and a decrease in subsequent resolution phase are&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a neurohormone regulating circadian rhythm. But it also exhibits antioxidant and&#xD;
      free radical scavenger properties, and regulates energy metabolism and immune function. It&#xD;
      has already demonstrated a neuroprotective potential in various animal models. Its use&#xD;
      against delirium is promising: it decreases delirium incidence in elderly patients&#xD;
      hospitalized in medical ward, and several studies are now recruiting in ICU. Concerning the&#xD;
      perioperative period, only two studies with conflicting results are available. The first one&#xD;
      (Sultan, 2010), that has shown that melatonin decreases POD incidence, has strong&#xD;
      methodological limitations (no calculated sample size, only 53 patients in melatonin group,&#xD;
      all patients, even in the control group received melatonin if they developed POD, etc). In&#xD;
      the second one (deJonghe, 2014), melatonin had no effect on POD incidence, but showed a&#xD;
      reduction in the proportion of patients with POD exceeding 2 days. These conflicting results&#xD;
      emphasize the need for a third RCT, with optimized methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the trial is that in a high-risk population, perioperative melatonin can&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of POD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of perioperative melatonin administration on&#xD;
      postoperative delirium incidence in the first 10 days after surgery, in elderly patients&#xD;
      (over 70 years old) being hospitalized and scheduled for acute surgery of fractured lower&#xD;
      limb (from femoral head to tibial plateau).&#xD;

      2 hours before emergency surgery) and until day 5 after surgery.&#xD;
