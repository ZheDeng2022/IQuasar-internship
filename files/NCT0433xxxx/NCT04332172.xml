  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if pregnant women screening positive for&#xD;
      alcohol risk like the brief alcohol intervention application that the investigators have&#xD;
      developed (called the MommyCheckup, which is a technology-delivered SBIRT, or e-SBIRT), and&#xD;
      if it helps them to reduce alcohol use. The investigators also wish to test whether e-SBIRT&#xD;
      effects can be enhanced by booster sessions and/or tailored text messages.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 20 participants in phase 1 and 384 participants in phase 2. Participants in&#xD;
      both phases will be pregnant women age 18-35 years who score positive on a frequently used&#xD;
      and well-validated screening tool for alcohol use risk in pregnancy (the T-ACE). The&#xD;
      investigators will also add an additional requirement of either drinking weekly or more in&#xD;
      the past month, or having 4 or more drinks at a time at least monthly in the 12 months before&#xD;
      becoming pregnant. To be eligible for the study, participants must also report mobile device&#xD;
      ownership (e.g., smartphone), willingness to receive study-related text messages and to use&#xD;
      their mobile device for study-related assessments and/or booster sessions, and being at 20&#xD;
      weeks gestation or less. Participants will be excluded if they are not planning to carry the&#xD;
      pregnancy to term, or are unable to communicate in English. All participants must reside in&#xD;
      Connecticut, Massachusetts, or Michigan. Completion of the baseline assessment is an&#xD;
      enrollment criterion that is also necessary for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (Phase 1 and Phase 2) will be recruited via community flyers as well as ads&#xD;
      placed on social media (Facebook and Instagram). The flyers and ads will contain basic&#xD;
      information indicating that they are for a health-related study for women 18-35 years of age&#xD;
      who can communicate in English. Interested women meeting these criteria will be provided a&#xD;
      website address, Quick Response (QR) code, or link to a study website, where they will be&#xD;
      provided with additional basic information about the study and link to the screening&#xD;
      information sheet and screening survey via their own smartphone or tablet. Clicking on the&#xD;
      link will first take them to the screening information sheet in Qualtrics.Those who click &quot;I&#xD;
      agree&quot; at the end of the information sheet, will then be offered the initial&#xD;
      computer-directed screening survey. This survey will ask a range of questions so that the&#xD;
      study's inclusion and exclusion criteria are not readily apparent (in order to limit fraud).&#xD;
      Both the information sheet and screening survey will be accessible via their own smartphone&#xD;
      or tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening survey will be used to determine whether initial inclusion criteria have been&#xD;
      met [(age, state of intended delivery of baby, pregnancy status, and alcohol risk (T-ACE&#xD;
      positive and either drinking weekly or more in the past month, or having 4 or more drinks at&#xD;
      a time at least monthly in the 12 months before becoming pregnant)]. Study staff will contact&#xD;
      interested women who meet study inclusion criteria by phone in order to validate their&#xD;
      eligibility (survey completed by a real person, who can communicate in English, has a working&#xD;
      smartphone, is willing and able to receive text messages, and understands study&#xD;
      requirements). The following strategies will be implemented to reduce the possibility of&#xD;
      fraudulent participation: 1) manual review of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to screen for&#xD;
      duplicates, identify addresses of non-US origin, detect fraudulent completion (e.g., bots),&#xD;
      2) manual review of Qualtrics survey data to detect suspicious response times (e.g.,&#xD;
      completing the survey too quickly), unusual patterns in responses, respondent names,&#xD;
      respondent email addresses, and patterned completion timestamps indicating that one&#xD;
      person/bot is completing the survey repeatedly until eligible, and 3) inclusion of a required&#xD;
      open-ended narrative response to detect fraudulent completion. IP addresses will be deleted&#xD;
      from the participant's screening survey data when no longer needed for fraudulent&#xD;
      participation detection purposes. Only interested women who pass these screens and can be&#xD;
      confirmed via the phone call will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full trial consent will also be presented electronically and will proceed only if&#xD;
      participants provide written informed consent via e-signature (using DocuSign). Participants&#xD;
      who meet all eligibility criteria and who provide consent will then be randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      study condition during the baseline assessment. The staff member who enrolls the participant&#xD;
      will not have access to the assigned condition/content, which will aid in blinding study&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes varying levels of two separate interventions. The interactive and&#xD;
      tailored baseline MommyCheckup single-session e-SBIRT was built on principles of Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing and Self-Determination Theory, and is presented to participants directly via&#xD;
      their own electronic device (e.g., smartphone, tablet), which interacts with them through an&#xD;
      animated talking narrator. The e-SBIRT booster sessions will be sent to participants as a&#xD;
      text message that includes a link to the booster content. Participants will be texted these&#xD;
      links on two occasions: 6 weeks following the baseline session, and at 30 weeks gestation.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the text messaging intervention will receive a test message at the&#xD;
      conclusion of their baseline session, in order to confirm that the software has the correct&#xD;
      cellphone number. These participants will then begin receiving text messages twice weekly&#xD;
      until after the 34-week assessment, or until they text back &quot;STOP&quot; to end the messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline session, participants will be asked to complete follow-up assessments&#xD;
      at 4 weeks post-baseline, at 27 weeks gestation, 34 weeks gestation, and at 4 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum. In addition, all participants will be mailed a nail specimen collection kit at 36&#xD;
      weeks gestation asking them to provide nail clippings that will be analyzed for Ethyl&#xD;
      Glucuronide (EtG). Fingernails will be collected at 36 weeks gestation, or toenails may be&#xD;
      collected at 38 weeks gestation as an alternative to fingernails. (Nails will be gathered&#xD;
      from Phase 1 participants at 6 weeks post-baseline for fingernails, or 8 weeks post-baseline&#xD;
      for toenails, in order to assess the effectiveness of the specimen collection procedures).&#xD;
      Nail types may not be mixed for a single specimen collection. Specimens from all available&#xD;
      fingernails or toenails weighing 50-100 mg gathered at 36 weeks (fingernails) or 38 weeks&#xD;
      (toenails) will allow for sufficient nail growth to capture EtG as evidence of alcohol use&#xD;
      concentrated in the timeframe of approximately 20-34 weeks gestation, based on typical&#xD;
      fingernail and toenail growth rates. Additionally, this timeframe will allow us to avoid&#xD;
      detecting post-delivery alcohol use since it takes approximately two weeks for fingernails&#xD;
      and four weeks for toenails to grow sufficiently for detectability. Participants will be&#xD;
      reminded of the upcoming nail specimen collection at their 27-week and 34-week data&#xD;
      collections, plus reminders will be included when the survey links are sent by text for these&#xD;
      data collection timepoints. In the event of preterm birth, nail specimens will be requested&#xD;
      immediately. The level of detectability for either nail type will be set at 8 ng/mL, which is&#xD;
      the lower level of quantitation used for research (the standard level of detectability used&#xD;
      for non-research testing is 20 ng/mL).&#xD;

Uses a high-quality video featuring gain-framed messaging, quit recommendation, and testimonial from a race-matched woman; tailored on race-ethnicity, efficacy, binge frequency, and level of concern regarding her own alcohol use. The e-BI poses a question regarding the participant's willingness to avoid alcohol throughout her pregnancy. Responses to this question will sort participants into one of three major branches, each using motivational principles to promote alcohol abstinence during pregnancy.</description>
