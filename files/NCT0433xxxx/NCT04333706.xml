  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will advance a novel and potent strategy to eliminate minimal residual disease&#xD;
      (MRD) in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) present even after multimodal treatment,&#xD;
      thereby improving survival and increasing cure rate in this aggressive cancer. Patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced TNBC are at high risk of developing lethal metastatic disease within 2 years&#xD;
      of diagnosis, especially for those without a pathologic complete response (pCR) after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The high risk occurs despite surgical excision of the primary tumor&#xD;
      and axillary lymph nodes to eliminate residual disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two phases, I and II. Phase I will be made up of 2 patient cohorts,&#xD;
      Cohorts A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A, will include Stage I to III TNBC patients with less than a complete pCR after&#xD;
           neoadjuvant therapy who will be treated with capecitabine (1000mg/m2/BID; for 14 days&#xD;
           every 21 days) as standard of care. This cohort will be used to determine baseline bone&#xD;
           marrow disseminated tumor cells (BM DTC) response to capecitabine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B, will include patients with metastatic TNBC, HER2/neu-negative and hormone&#xD;
           resistant breast cancer. A total of 4 doses of sarilumab will be given with the starting&#xD;
           dose of 150 mg SQ at 3-weeks cycles given 3 days prior to each of the first 4 of 8&#xD;
           cycles of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2/BID; for 14 days every 21 days). If dose escalation&#xD;
           is possible, sarilumab will be administered every 3 weeks at 200 mg SQ for 4 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II is a single arm study in Stage I to III TNBC with less than a complete pCR after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy evaluating the combination of sarilumab with capecitabine (1000mg/m2/BID;&#xD;
      for 14 days every 21 days) as compared to historical control patients treated with&#xD;
      capecitabine alone. There are 8 cycles of capecitabine. The first 4 cycles will be combined&#xD;
      with sarilumab. The Phase II sarilumab dose will be determined by the Phase I best tolerated&#xD;
      dose. In patients without bone marrow DTC clearance after 4 doses of sarilumab, 4 more doses&#xD;
      of sarilumab will be given in combination with the last 4 cycles of capecitabine.&#xD;
