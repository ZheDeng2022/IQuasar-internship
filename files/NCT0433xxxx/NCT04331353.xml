    <textblock>
      The Allergen Reduction and Child Health Study (ARCHS) is a 12-month, two group randomized&#xD;
      control trial of children with asthma and who are exposed to cockroaches. Children ages 5 -&#xD;
      17 living in the Greater New Orleans area will be recruited from a variety of clinic and&#xD;
      community settings. The overall goal of the study is to improve patient-centered asthma&#xD;
      outcomes (asthma symptom days, health care utilization, asthma control and quality of life)&#xD;
      by targeting one key allergen - cockroach exposure in the child's home. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a simple intervention of insecticidal bait that is low cost, simple to implement, and&#xD;
      which is lower toxicity than other forms of pest control. The reduction in the number of&#xD;
      cockroaches in the home is an environmental outcome that is patient-centered and is likely to&#xD;
      add to its acceptance by families of children with asthma.&#xD;

      Background and Significance: Asthma is a serious, complex, and highly prevalent childhood&#xD;
      respiratory disorder leading to inflammation and narrowing of the airways. If uncontrolled it&#xD;
      negatively impacts long-term lung function. An estimated 6.2 million, 1 in 12, U.S. children&#xD;
      have asthma and asthma outcome disparities are pervasive. An important contributor to asthma&#xD;
      disparities is greater exposure to asthma triggering allergens. The proposed study addresses&#xD;
      an evidence gap related to the most effective way to reduce exposure to asthma triggers in&#xD;
      the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims: There are three specific aims. First to compare the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      multicomponent intervention to reduce asthma triggers to a single intervention to reduce&#xD;
      cockroach exposure in the home testing the hypothesis that among children with asthma exposed&#xD;
      to cockroaches, a single intervention targeting cockroach remediation is as effective one&#xD;
      with multiple components that targets multiple allergens. Specific Aim 2 compares the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the different interventions on the number of cockroaches in the home testing&#xD;
      the hypothesis that insecticidal bait is as effective at reducing cockroaches as a&#xD;
      multi-component approach. Specific Aim 3 examines whether the effect of insecticidal control&#xD;
      on asthma outcomes differs by the allergen profile of the child. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that cockroach eradication results in improved outcomes independent of cockroach&#xD;
      sensitization status and the number of other allergens to which a child is sensitized. The&#xD;
      long term objective is to provide evidence for the NHLBI Expert Panel currently reviewing the&#xD;
      Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3) and specifically the&#xD;
      effectiveness of indoor allergen reduction strategies on asthma management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description: A 12-month, two group randomized clinical trial of 290 children ages 5 -17&#xD;
      with doctor diagnosed asthma recruited from clinics in the Greater New Orleans area.&#xD;
      Comparator Group 1 targets dust mites, mold, cockroach, animal dander and smoke exposure.&#xD;
      Interventions include asthma education, cleaning techniques, impermeable bed covers, HEPA&#xD;
      vacuum cleaners, air purification, and insecticidal baiting. Comparator Group 2 targets&#xD;
      cockroaches and the intervention is targeted insecticidal baiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include asthma symptom days, asthma-related health care utilization&#xD;
      (emergency room visits, hospitalization, unscheduled clinic visits), quality of life, asthma&#xD;
      control, medication use, and cockroach burden. Pulmonary function will be measured as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome. Asthma outcome data will be collected monthly. Other data will be&#xD;
      collected during home visits at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each outcome will be modeled separately. Two sets of analyses will be conducted. First, a&#xD;
      generalized linear regression model will be employed to model the change score from baseline&#xD;
      to 12-months with Comparator group 2 as the predictor and other potential confounders as&#xD;
      covariates. In the second approach, intervention effects will be assessed longitudinally by&#xD;
      modelling the outcomes at each assessment time (excluding baseline) using models for repeated&#xD;
      outcomes such as linear mixed model or generalized estimating equations depending on the&#xD;
      distribution of the outcome. Sensitivity analyses will be performed to verify the stability&#xD;
      of multiple imputation assumptions using different multiple imputation procedures and&#xD;
      consistency of the final results.&#xD;
