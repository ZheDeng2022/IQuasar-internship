      This feasibility study investigates the impact of reminder-focused-positive-psychiatry (RFPP)&#xD;
      on attention-deficit-hyperactive-disorder (ADHD) and posttraumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      symptoms, vascular-function, inflammation and well-being of adolescents with comorbid ADHD &amp;&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized clinical trial, 24 subjects with comorbid ADHD and PTSD, aged 12-18 years&#xD;
      old, free of known medical and other major psychiatric disorders, will be recruited from the&#xD;
      pool of eligible subjects at Los Angeles and Kern County Children Mental Health Centers&#xD;
      (&gt;1500 subjects) after obtaining informed consent from parents as well as subjects'&#xD;
      assentment. Commonwealth and Oswell Kern County Mental Health Clinic will be used for&#xD;
      subjects enrollment, randomization as well as study implementation from trauma disorder&#xD;
      clinic. Kern Medical will be used for manuscript write up and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will be randomized to: group-RFPP or trauma-focused&#xD;
      group-cognitive-behavioral-therapy (TF-CBT). Participants will complete&#xD;
      twice-weekly-intervention for 6-weeks-trial. The group-RFPP-intervention will be inclusive of&#xD;
      RFPP interventions on a) traumatic-reminders, and b Avoidance &amp; negative-cognition.&#xD;
      Vascular-function-measured as temperature-rebound (TR), C-reactive-protein (CRP),&#xD;
      homocysteine, SNAP-questionnaire, Clinician-Administered PTSD-Scale-children-version&#xD;
      (CAPS-CA) and neuropsychiatric-measures will be measured at baseline and 6th week. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and subjects will be informed of the risks associated with use of venipuncture and&#xD;
      loss of confidentiality of collected information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD and ADHD are major public health problems. Many individuals with comorbid ADHD and PTSD&#xD;
      continue to suffer despite treatment with FDA approved medications including antidepressants&#xD;
      (sertraline and paroxetine), prazosin and/or the Institute of Medicine approved&#xD;
      psychotherapy. Long-term outcomes with even the most intensive treatments, although&#xD;
      significant, were modest, and reveal persistent morbidity and disability for many individuals&#xD;
      with PTSD, especially in those with comorbid ADHD.19 While current treatments focused on&#xD;
      treatment to reduce the associated suffering and disability of morbid ADHD and PTSD. These&#xD;
      interventions are, however, not sufficient to promote human welfare, improve levels of&#xD;
      positive psychosocial characteristics (PPCs), and resilience. Positive psychiatry (PP)&#xD;
      focuses on promoting well-being, enhancing behavioral and mental wellness in both youth and&#xD;
      adults20, however its impact on youth with comorbid PTSD and ADHD has not been studied. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that PP intervention would significantly enhance vascular function, resilience,&#xD;
      wellbeing, increase posttraumatic growth and reduce inflammation in morbid ADHD and PTSD.&#xD;
      This randomized trial will the first to investigate the impact of psychiatric positive&#xD;
      interventions, as opposed to intervention on ameliorating vulnerability, on adolescents with&#xD;
      morbid ADHD and PTSD. Findings of this study can provide a better understanding of impact of&#xD;
      PP on psychiatric and biomolecular characteristics of adolescent with PTSD and ADHD. If&#xD;
      successful, this proposal will be available for large scale studies following which it could&#xD;
      potentially be deployed in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized clinical trial, the three related and overlapping specific aims are&#xD;
      directed to examine the feasibility of PP intervention, as well as its impact on positive&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing, and neurovascular inflammation in adolescent subjects with comorbid&#xD;
      ADHD and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis. In this randomized clinical trial, 24 subjects with comorbid ADHD and PTSD, aged&#xD;
      12-18 years old, free of known medical and other major psychiatric disorders, will be&#xD;
      recruited from the pool of eligible subjects at Los Angeles and Kern County Children Mental&#xD;
      Health Centers (&gt;1500 subjects) after obtaining informed consent from parents as well as&#xD;
      subjects' assentment. Commonwealth and Oswell Kern County Mental Health Clinic will be used&#xD;
      for subjects enrollment, randomization as well as study implementation from trauma disorder&#xD;
      clinic. Kern Medical will be used for manuscript write up and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents and subjects will be informed of the risks associated with use of venipuncture and&#xD;
      loss of confidentiality of collected information. Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1)&#xD;
      PP group intervention, or 2) control condition group (12 in each group) for 6 week&#xD;
      intervention and 6 week of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited subject will be followed before, during and after interventions. Both groups will&#xD;
      be on adequate stimulant therapy for ADHD. Group PP intervention consists of 12 sessions of&#xD;
      group PP in 6 week that will be completed by the participant with the guidance of a trainer.&#xD;
      Sham control condition consists of 12 sessions in 6 week of group exercises that will be&#xD;
      completed by the participant with the guidance of a trainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo radial artery flow mediated dilatation, a measure of vascular&#xD;
      function, venipuncture for measuring of CRP, homocysteine and IL-6, as well as completion of&#xD;
      positive psychiatry and wellbeing batteries at baseline, 3rd and 6th of intervention and 12th&#xD;
      week follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A- Measurements A1.History and Physical Exam (H&amp;P): All consented patients will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline H&amp;P, intervention, and post-trial observation periods by a physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2. Medications: All medications during pre-trial, intervention and post-trial will be&#xD;
      charted A3. Psychiatry Batteries: SNAP teacher and parent questionnaire, Positive&#xD;
      Psychotherapy Inventory, VIA Survey of Character Strengths, PERMA, PANAS, optimism,&#xD;
      posttraumatic growth inventory, Connor Davidson resilience scale, Clinician Administered PTSD&#xD;
      Scale (CAPS) children version will be measured at baseline, 3rd, 6th and 12th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A4. Vascular Function Assessment via FMD: After resting in a supine position in a room with&#xD;
      temperature 23° to 25° C for 30 minutes, brachial artery endothelial function will be&#xD;
      assessed noninvasively by ultrasound using reactive hyperemia procedure. Brachial artery&#xD;
      diameter above antecubital crease will be measured at least 60 cycles from baseline to 5 min&#xD;
      cuff inflation, and 5 min post cuff deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A5.Venipuncture and laboratory measurements: Venous blood samples of all subjects after 8&#xD;
      hours of fasting will be drawn at baseline, 3rd, 6th and 12th week. The assessment of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and homocysteine will be performed using the standard techniques.&#xD;
      The concentrations of IL-6 will be determined using commercially available solid-phase&#xD;
      sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The range of detection is 15-1540 pg/ml for&#xD;
      IL-6.21&#xD;
&#xD;
      B- Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1.Reminder Focused Positive Psychiatry: RFPP group will receive 6 week (12 sessions and 12&#xD;
      exercises) of positive psychiatry to improve wellbeing. The group PP exercises are inclusive&#xD;
      of Posttraumatic Growth, Resilience, Gratitude and Optimism, Self-regulation and Personal&#xD;
      Strength, Enjoyable and meaningful activities, Personal mastery and self-efficiency. Groups&#xD;
      last approximately 60 minutes, and positive responding (responding to others in an active and&#xD;
      constructive way), personal strengths, gratitude, forgiveness and identifying positives from&#xD;
      negative situations will be included. Nondirective prompts will be used to stimulate in-depth&#xD;
      discussion. Feedback from subjects will be captured. All facilitators have experience of&#xD;
      facilitating therapeutic groups and of working with individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD and&#xD;
      PTSD. Facilitators participate in all exercises themselves, they share personal examples from&#xD;
      their own lives with the group, and are encouraged to do the 'ongoing exercise' in their own&#xD;
      time. Participants are not prohibited from sharing distressing, unpleasant, or negative&#xD;
      states and experiences in the group. Negative contributions are validated but not focused on.&#xD;
      Instead, facilitators establish a link between the negative experience and one or more of the&#xD;
      intervention's target areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed during the last 4 months of the study. T test and&#xD;
      Chi Square test will be used to assess differences between groups. The association between PP&#xD;
      and control condition will be analyzed by linear and mixed regression analyses. In addition,&#xD;
      the change in overall symptoms, ADHD and PTSD specific symptoms, and neurovascular&#xD;
      inflammation in response to PP will be evaluated. These analyses will be adjusted for&#xD;
      demographics, mental and medical covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Sample Size for Specific Aim 1-3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A measurable change in vascular function and increase in PERMA are outcomes of interest. The&#xD;
      sample size of 12 per group that has been chosen based on priori study, will detect a 20%&#xD;
      difference in vascular function and PERMA score amongst groups, with a study power of 0.8 and&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
