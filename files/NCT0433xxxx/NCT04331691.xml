  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite&#xD;
      concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes including diuretics.&#xD;
      Patients with resistant hypertension has at least 1.5-fold higher cardiovascular risk than&#xD;
      those with non-resistant hypertension. Therefore, controlling blood pressure is crucial in&#xD;
      patients with resistant hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been unclear which antihypertensive agent should be added in patients who cannot reach&#xD;
      target blood pressure despite use of three antihypertensive agents. There have been three&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials that proved the efficacy of spironolactone in resistant&#xD;
      hypertension, but they were small sized, comparison study to placebo. Recently published&#xD;
      PATHWAY-2 study which compared the efficacy of spironolactone with placebo, doxazosin, and&#xD;
      bisoprolol showed superiority of spironolactone in blood pressure lowering in patients with&#xD;
      resistant hypertension. Thus, revised ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guideline for arterial hypertension&#xD;
      recommended spironolactone as the fourth agent for resistant hypertension. However, in real&#xD;
      world, adherence to spironolactone may not be adequate because of adverse effect such as&#xD;
      gynecomastia, hyperkalemia, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, sub-study of PATHWAY-2 revealed that amiloride changes systolic blood pressure by&#xD;
      -22.2 mmHg (95% CI, -24.7 to -19.7) which is comparable with the effect of spironolactone&#xD;
      (-21.8 mmHg; 95% CI, -24.2 to -19.3). However, it was not randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare the effect between spironolactone and amiloride in patients with resistant&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the effect of spironolactone and amiloride on home blood pressure&#xD;
      in resistant hypertensive patients and to compare the rate of target blood pressure&#xD;
      achievement between spironolactone and amiloride in resistant hypertensive patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects with office SBP of 140-180 mmHg with 3 antihypertensive medications of different&#xD;
      classes including thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics and daytime average daytime SBP of ≥&#xD;
      135 mmHg are enrolled in the 4-week run-in period. During run-in period, subjects will&#xD;
      receive sevikar HCT (5/20/12.5 mg). After a 4-week run-in period, subjects who have&#xD;
      uncontrolled average home SBP, defined as average of &gt;135 mmHg, will be randomized to either&#xD;
      spironolactone or amiloride. 118 subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups. Subjects randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups will receive&#xD;
      12.5 mg of spironolactone and the other group will receive 5 mg of amiloride. Subjects who&#xD;
      did not reach the target blood pressure after 4 weeks of treatment should be increased to 25&#xD;
      mg of spironolactone or 10 mg of amiloride. After 12 weeks of treatment, study will be end.&#xD;
