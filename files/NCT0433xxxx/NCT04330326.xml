      This short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated trial aims to&#xD;
      establish metabolic improvements in NAFLD subjects by dietary supplementation with cofactors&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine, L-carnitine tartrate, nicotinamide riboside and serine. Concomitant use of&#xD;
      pivotal metabolic cofactors via simultaneous dietary supplementation will stimulate three&#xD;
      different pathways to enhance hepatic β-oxidation and this study's hypothesis is that this&#xD;
      will result in decreased amount of fat in the liver.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators aim to lower liver fat content in obese patients with NAFLD by&#xD;
      increasing the hepatic levels of pivotal metabolic cofactors via simultaneous dietary&#xD;
      supplementation of serine, L-carnitine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and nicotinamide riboside&#xD;
      (NR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on a three-step strategy to increase the amount of fat oxidization in&#xD;
      liver: (1) First, the investigators will include L-carnitine to enhance the transport of&#xD;
      fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane (by forming a long chain acetylcarnitine ester&#xD;
      and being transported by carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I and CPT II). Carnitine also&#xD;
      plays a role in stabilizing coenzyme A (CoA) and acetyl-CoA levels through the ability to&#xD;
      receive or give an acetyl group. (2) Second, the investigators will include nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside, precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to boost the level of hepatic&#xD;
      β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. Decreased electron transport chain function&#xD;
      combined with impaired rates of fatty acid β-oxidation leads to the accumulation of&#xD;
      incomplete products of β-oxidation, which combined with increased levels of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS) contribute to insulin resistance. Furthermore, as L-carnitine, nicotinamide&#xD;
&#xD;
      riboside stimulate the transfer of fatty acids from cytosol to mitochondria.(3) Finally, they&#xD;
      will include the two glutathione precursors serine and N-acetylcysteine to increase&#xD;
      glutathione levels in the hepatocytes. Increased glutathione levels will also protect against&#xD;
      free radical-mediated oxidative stress generated by the increased β-oxidation of fatty acids&#xD;
      in mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that each agent is able to decrease liver fat amount separately and a&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study using serine supplementation, and a phase I study using this&#xD;
      three-step approach resulted in a significant decrease in plasma metabolites associated with&#xD;
      liver fat without significant side effect. Concomitant use of pivotal metabolic cofactors via&#xD;
      simultaneous dietary supplementation will stimulate three different pathways to enhance&#xD;
      hepatic β-oxidation. The novel design with this study is to give the L-carnitine, NR, serine&#xD;
      and NAC as a cocktail. Based on investigators' hypothesis is that this will result in&#xD;
      decreased amount of fat in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 45 male and female adult overweight and obese subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with NAFLD. Eligible subjects must have signed an informed consent, meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomized on a&#xD;
      2:1 basis to the cofactor mixture or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will take a mixture of cofactors or matching placebo as powder dissolved in&#xD;
      water by mouth. Subjects in active treatment will receive dietary supplementation with&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine, L-carnitine tartrate, nicotinamide riboside, and serine, administered as a&#xD;
      mixture. Half dosage of the co-factors will be given for two weeks (one dose taken just after&#xD;
      dinner), and full dosage for 8 weeks (two equal doses taken just after breakfast and dinner).&#xD;
      Patients who can tolerate the study agents will start to take half dose of co-factors&#xD;
      supplementation (i.e., 1 dosage daily just after dinner) for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active treatment duration will be 10 weeks for each subject and the total study duration&#xD;
      is estimated as 14 months. The study comprises seven clinical visits; (1) pre-screening&#xD;
      visit, (2) screening visit, (2) randomization visit, (3) post-treatment visit (day 14); (4)&#xD;
      post-treatment visit (day 28); (5) post-treatment visit (day 42) and (4) end of treatment&#xD;
      visit (day 70). At visit 1 informed consent will be signed, all procedures including clinical&#xD;
      and physical examination, assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, genetic analysis&#xD;
      and transient elastography will be done. At visit 2 and visit 7, all procedures including&#xD;
      review of 3-day diet records, clinical and physical examination; body composition analysis&#xD;
      with Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), ECG evaluation, blood, urine and stool sampling&#xD;
      for routine laboratory tests, lipidomics, metabolomics and gut microbiota analysis and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy will be carried out. At visit 3, eligible&#xD;
      study subjects will be randomized to active therapy or placebo groups and study agents will&#xD;
      be dispensed as half-of therapy. At visit 4, and 6, clinical and physical examination, ECG&#xD;
      evaluation, blood, urine and stool sampling for routine laboratory tests, lipidomics,&#xD;
      metabolomics and gut microbiota analysis, magnetic resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy and&#xD;
      initiation of full dose therapy (i.e. taking cocktails two times just after breakfast and&#xD;
      dinner) will be realized. At visit 5, visit 4 and 6 will be repeated excluding magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and MR spectroscopy. After the visit 7, participants will stop taking study&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject will be considered as having completed the study if he/she has completed all&#xD;
      assessments at the End of Treatment Visit (Visit 7) and has been followed up until 10 weeks&#xD;
      after initiation of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics for the primary outcome parameter will be tested by Mann-Whitney U test or t-test&#xD;
      depending on the results of normality test. For the secondary and third outcome parameters&#xD;
      one-way repeated measures ANOVA will be performed.&#xD;
