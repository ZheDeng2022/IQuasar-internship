  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REMD-477 (Volagidemab) is a human anti-glucagon receptor antibody. Its proposed mechanism of&#xD;
      action in controlling hyperglycemia is by blocking glucagon receptor (GCGR) signaling. In&#xD;
      this way, it increases hepatic glucose uptake, decreases hepatic glycogenolysis and&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis, increases glycogen synthesis, and ultimately decreases blood glucose levels.&#xD;
      This protocol will test the hypotheses that REMD-477 is safe and tolerable in patients with&#xD;
      severe hyperglycemia on apelisib and prevent hyperglycemia associated with alpelisib in&#xD;
      patients with advanced breast cancer who discontinue alpelisib due to severe hyperglycemia&#xD;
      despite appropriate medical management.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has experienced grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia during treatment with alpelisib&#xD;
             (any cycle) despite standard of care measures (e.g metformin) leading to&#xD;
             discontinuation of alpelisib.&#xD;

             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
