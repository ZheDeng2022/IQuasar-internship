      When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present),&#xD;
      and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this&#xD;
      task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several&#xD;
      images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists'&#xD;
      percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent&#xD;
      results showed that this is not true: perception and decisions are strongly biased by past&#xD;
      visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to&#xD;
      achieve perceptual stability of otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a&#xD;
      crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an&#xD;
      x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the&#xD;
      previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical&#xD;
      tasks, in this proposal, the investigators plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3)&#xD;
      mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine the participants' percepts and&#xD;
      decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, the investigators will establish the presence of&#xD;
      serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor&#xD;
      classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor&#xD;
      search in radiology. In Aim 3, once the investigators fully understand these boundary&#xD;
      conditions in Aim 2, they will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control&#xD;
      and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result&#xD;
      of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways&#xD;
      (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will&#xD;
      allow the investigators to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor&#xD;
      recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken&#xD;
      together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow the investigators to establish,&#xD;
      identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search&#xD;
      tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients&#xD;
      everywhere.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SPECIFIC AIMS Radiological scans are critically important for the health and well-being of&#xD;
      millions of patients [1]. Despite advances in machine learning and computer vision, reading&#xD;
      and searching in radiological scans still depends on the visual system of human observers&#xD;
      (radiologists), who receive continuous training to best detect tumor masses and anomalies.&#xD;
      Radiologists can examine hundreds and hundreds of x-rays on a daily basis, seeing several&#xD;
      images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of their work is that radiologists'&#xD;
      percepts and decisions on a current x-ray are completely independent from prior viewings.&#xD;
      However, participants recently demonstrated that the visual system has visual serial&#xD;
      dependencies (VSDs) at many levels, from perception to decision making [2, 3]. These&#xD;
      sequential dependencies mean that what was seen in the past influences (and captures) what is&#xD;
      seen and reported at this moment. Theoretically, VSDs would be helpful in an autocorrelated&#xD;
      natural world, but they are suboptimal in search tasks conducted in artificial situations&#xD;
      where images may not always be related. Importantly, serial dependences in perceptual&#xD;
      processing could thus produce significant errors during diagnostic searches through&#xD;
      radiological scans. The investigators' central hypothesis is that VSD can have a disruptive&#xD;
      effect in radiologic searches that impairs accurate detection and recognition of tumors or&#xD;
      other structures. This hypothesis is supported by the investigators' robust pilot data, which&#xD;
      show that VSD strongly biases object classification in naïve observers and expert&#xD;
      radiologists. The rationale for the proposed research projects is that once it is known how&#xD;
      serial dependence arises and how it impacts visual search, we can understand how to control&#xD;
      for it. Hence, accuracy of tumor detection and diagnosis can significantly improve. The&#xD;
      specific objectives of this proposal are to establish (Aim 1), identify (Aim 2) and mitigate&#xD;
      (Aim 3) the impact of VSD on visual search tasks in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Establish the presence of sequential effects in perceptual decision making in&#xD;
      clinically relevant tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous theoretical work on sequential dependencies, based on simplified&#xD;
      laboratory experiments, predicts that there should also be sequential effects in clinically&#xD;
      relevant tasks such as tumor search and recognition in images. The investigators will test&#xD;
      tumor recognition in four different domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor&#xD;
      localization, and search times. Pilot data in both naïve observers and expert radiologists&#xD;
      supports the investigators' hypothesis that there are sequential effects in clinically&#xD;
      relevant perceptual judgments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify that the sequential effects in Aim 1 are, in fact, VSD. The investigators&#xD;
      will test our prediction that the sequential effects in Aim 1 are, in fact, VSD, which is&#xD;
      operationally defined by a set of diagnostic criteria: VSDs are spatially, temporally, and&#xD;
      feature-similarity tuned. Aim 2 will therefore identify the tuning and boundary conditions of&#xD;
      VSD in tumor search. This is crucial to develop strategies to mitigate the harmful&#xD;
      consequences of VSD in Aim 3. Pilot data supports the feasibility of this aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Improve visual search performance in radiologists by mitigating VSD. Aim 2 will define&#xD;
      the boundary conditions under which VSD operates in tumor search. Aim 3 will develop task&#xD;
      manipulations to mitigate the impact of VSD. As a result of these manipulations, visual&#xD;
      search performance should improve in measurable ways in several domains (detection,&#xD;
      classification, localization, and search times). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it&#xD;
      will allow the investigators to propose new guidelines that will improve tumor recognition in&#xD;
      radiological scans, making radiologists' judgments more effective and reliable. More&#xD;
      globally, taken together, the proposed studies in Aims 1, 2 and 3 will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to establish and work toward mitigating the deleterious role of VSD in a&#xD;
      critically important clinical task.&#xD;
