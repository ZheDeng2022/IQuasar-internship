      Study will be conducted in Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak in the&#xD;
      department of Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: - Prospective clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame: - Jan 2019 to April 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population / Participants: -Patients of age 18 years and above will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: - The anticipated change in treatment plan was expected to be 53% before and&#xD;
      after using CBCT. Based on the available data , sample size was calculated to enroll a&#xD;
      minimum of 18 patients in each group with a power level of 90% and alpha at the 5% level.&#xD;
      Considering the dropouts, a total of 50 patients (n=25 each group) will be recruited for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: - Study subjects will be recruited from the pool of patients enrolling in the&#xD;
      Outpatient department meeting the inclusion criteria in the Post Graduate Department of&#xD;
      Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics at PGIDS, Rohtak ,Haryana. Study will be performed after&#xD;
      obtaining due ethical clearance from Institutional Ethical Committee of PGIDS. Patients are&#xD;
      randomly divided into 2Dimensional periapical radiography (PA) group and 3Dimensional Cone&#xD;
      beam computed tomography (CBCT) group. Preoperative radiographs (both PA radiography and&#xD;
      CBCT) will be taken and periapical surgical procedures will be carried out under operating&#xD;
      microscope by the standardized treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of incisions, flap elevation and suturing, all surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      performed under operating microscope in an operating room under 8x to 16x magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full thickness (mucoperiosteal flap) will be reflected under aseptic conditions -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative mouth rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:1,00,000 will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Buccal intrasulcular incision will be given up to the alveolar crest including one tooth&#xD;
           mesial to the lesion &amp; one tooth distal to the lesion, using no.15 BP blade.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mesial and distal vertical releasing incision will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Full thickness flap will be gently reflected towards the apical area by periosteal&#xD;
           elevator. The flap will be frequently irrigated with sterile saline to prevent&#xD;
           dehydration of periosteal surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After complete elevation of the flap, bone cutting is done using bur and complete&#xD;
           debridement of the bony lesion will be performed by surgical curettes For additional&#xD;
           hemostasis during surgery cotton pellets soaked in 0.1% epinephrine will be applied&#xD;
           topically as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A 2-3mm root tip with a 0ยบ to 10ยบ bevel angle will be resected with cylindrical surgical&#xD;
           carbide bur at high speed with sterile water coolant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Root end preparations extending 3mm into the canal space along the long axis of the root&#xD;
           will be made using piezoelectric ultrasonic retrotips in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Isthmuses, fins, and other significant anatomic irregularities will be identified in&#xD;
           high magnification and will be treated with the ultrasonic instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Root end filling will be done with mineral trioxide aggregrate (MTA). The adaptation of&#xD;
           the filling material to the canal apical walls will be confirmed with the aid of an&#xD;
           operating microscope at high magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Later wound site will be closed and sutured with 4-0 silk suture after irrigating the&#xD;
           defect properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post - Operative Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and 2D periapical radiographic examinations will be performed every 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months by assessing the same parameters as baseline except that PD, CAL will not be measured&#xD;
      until 12 months .CBCT scan will be done at 12 months follow up . Routine examination&#xD;
      procedure will be used to evaluate any evidence of clinical signs and/or symptoms.&#xD;
      Postoperative complications and Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHQoL) questionnaire&#xD;
      response will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healing Outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2D Radiographic healing will be assessed by the criteria followed by Rud et al (1972) and&#xD;
      Molven et al (1987) Score 1 - Complete healing, defined by re-establishment of the lamina&#xD;
      dura Score 2 - Incomplete healing (scar tissue) Score 3 - Uncertain healing Score 4 -&#xD;
      Unsatisfactory healing (failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessment of quality of life following surgical endodontic treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient received a questionnaire to fill out for each day starting the day of surgery&#xD;
      for 7 days postoperatively. The questionnaire consisted of 15 questions in which patients&#xD;
      were to evaluate their quality of life with the 5-point Likert- type scale, ranging from 1&#xD;
      (not at all) to 5 (very much).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Dimensionally at 12 months of follow up periapical healing will be assessed by modified&#xD;
      PENN 3D criteria: Score 1 - Complete healing Score 2 - Limited healing Score 3 - Uncertain&#xD;
      healing Score 4 - Unsatisfactory healing&#xD;
