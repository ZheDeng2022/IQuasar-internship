    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) impose a significant global health&#xD;
      burden. Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for&#xD;
      CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant effort from industry and academia, development of pharmacologic therapies&#xD;
      for AKI and CKD has been hampered by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-predictive animal models The inability to identify and prioritize human targets The&#xD;
      limited availability of human kidney biopsy tissue A poor understanding of AKI and CKD&#xD;
      heterogeneity Historically, AKI and CKD have been described as single, uniform diseases.&#xD;
      However, growing consensus suggests that different disease pathways lead to different&#xD;
      subgroups of AKI and CKD (AKIs and CKDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to human kidney biopsy tissue is a critical first step to define disease heterogeneity&#xD;
      and determine the precise molecular pathways that will facilitate identification of specific&#xD;
      drug targets and ultimately enable individualized care for people with AKI and CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of research centers across the United States are collaborating to bring&#xD;
      state-of-the-art technologies together to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ethically obtain and evaluate kidney biopsies from participants with AKI or CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define disease subgroups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create a kidney tissue atlas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify critical cells, pathways, and targets for novel therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KPMP is made up of three distinct, but highly interactive, activity groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment Sites: The recruitment sites (RS) are responsible for recruiting&#xD;
           participants with AKI or CKD into the longitudinal study and performing the kidney&#xD;
           biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue Interrogation Sites: The tissue interrogation sites (TIS) are responsible for&#xD;
           developing and using innovative technologies to analyze the biopsy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central Hub: The central hub is responsible for aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing&#xD;
           the generated data and providing scientific, infrastructure, and administrative support&#xD;
           for the KPMP consortium.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is a prospective cohort study, whose goal is to&#xD;
      use deep molecular phenotypes of kidney biopsies, along with longitudinally collected&#xD;
      clinical phenotypic data, in order to develop new disease ontologies, classification systems,&#xD;
      and treatments for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since its&#xD;
      inception, the KPMP has sought out and included substantive patient-representative feedback&#xD;
      regarding disease experience, lack of innovation in new kidney disease therapies and patient&#xD;
      tolerance for risk levels in balance with potential benefits both to the individual and&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KPMP Has publicly and operationally committed itself to always put participants and their&#xD;
      best interests first and this foundational principle informs and undergirds every facet of&#xD;
      the study. Both AKI and CKD are conditions that impose a significant global health burden.&#xD;
      Yet, no effective therapies currently exist for AKI, and only a few are available for CKD.&#xD;
      The network will utilize state-of-the-art methods to perform molecular interrogation of the&#xD;
      tissue and to link the molecular data to kidney structure and clinical information in the&#xD;
      form of a kidney tissue atlas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular and imaging data derived from kidney tissue will be integrated with&#xD;
      clinico-pathologic and genetic information, as well as other data derived from analyses of&#xD;
      fluid biospecimens, including peripheral blood, urine, and stool. Using advanced analytics to&#xD;
      integrate the data, KPMP will aim to define kidney disease subgroups in molecular terms by&#xD;
      identifying critical cells, pathways and targets for novel therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AKI or CKD will be recruited from clinical care encounters (e.g., clinic visits&#xD;
      for CKD patients, hospitalization or emergency room visits for AKI patients) and from&#xD;
      electronic resources (e.g., existing registries, electronic health records). All study&#xD;
      procedures are designed to optimize participant safety and will be ethically conducted,&#xD;
      ensuring subjects fully understand the scope of the study and any possible risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, kidney tissue will be obtained for molecular phenotyping and clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis. The diagnostic interpretation will be returned to the participant's primary&#xD;
      caregiver to inform clinical care, but no treatment interventions will be prescribed by the&#xD;
      KPMP. In addition to kidney biopsy, the study will involve collection of baseline (time of&#xD;
      biopsy) and longitudinal biospecimens (including urine, plasma, serum, DNA and stool) and&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Participants will be followed through scheduled&#xD;
      in-person and remote (telephone) study visits, as well as through periodic review of&#xD;
      electronic health records.&#xD;

        The KPMP will focus on participant populations that account for large proportions of the&#xD;
        public health burden of acute and chronic kidney diseases as evidenced by research and&#xD;
        federal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For CKD, high priority populations include CKD in the setting of diabetes (diabetic kidney&#xD;
        disease, DKD) and hypertension-associated CKD (H-CKD). A special population of people with&#xD;
        long-standing type 1 diabetes (more than 25 years) who remain free of clinically-evident&#xD;
        DKD will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For AKI, the focus will be on acute intrinsic non-glomerular disease, primarily on acute&#xD;
        tubular necrosis (ATN). KPMP will also include a special population of patients at risk for&#xD;
        AKI or with early AKI captured by an open (surgical) kidney biopsy performed at the time of&#xD;
        clinically indicated laparotomy. The rationale for including this special AKI population is&#xD;
        that AKI often occurs early in the clinical course of conditions like sepsis, major surgery&#xD;
        and trauma.&#xD;
