      The BURAN study is a randomized, open-label phase III study to assess the treatment effect of&#xD;
      once-daily buparlisib in combination with weekly paclitaxel compared to weekly paclitaxel&#xD;
      alone in patients with refractory, recurrent, or metastatic head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (HNSCC) that have progressed after prior anti PD 1/anti PD L1 monotherapy; prior&#xD;
      anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy in combination with platinum-based therapy; or after sequential&#xD;
      treatment of anti PD 1/anti PD L1 therapy, either prior to or post, platinum-based therapy.&#xD;
