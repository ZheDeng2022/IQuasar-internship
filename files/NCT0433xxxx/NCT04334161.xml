  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major global public health concern, for which the most effective therapy is&#xD;
      bariatric surgery. Beyond weight loss, bariatric surgery exerts powerful effects on glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, achieving complete type 2 diabetes remission in up to 70% of cases. An&#xD;
      exaggeration of these effects, however, can result in an increasingly recognized metabolic&#xD;
      complication known as postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (PHH). The condition&#xD;
      manifests 1-3 years after surgery with hypoglycaemic episodes after meals. Emerging data&#xD;
      suggest that PHH is more frequent than previously thought and affects approximately 30% of&#xD;
      postoperative patients, more commonly after gastric bypass than sleeve gastrectomy . Despite&#xD;
      such frequency, the underlying pathophysiology of PHH remains incompletely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A striking finding in PHH patients is the observed lack of insulin suppression and inadequate&#xD;
      glucagon response to the sharply falling glucose levels. The blunted glucagon response to&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia may result from altered alpha-cell function (acute or chronic) and an&#xD;
      interaction with gut hormones (e.g. glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that is known to exert&#xD;
      glucagon-inhibitory effects) or altered brain signalling. It is conceivable that, both, lack&#xD;
      of endogenous insulin suppression in response to falling postprandial blood glucose levels&#xD;
      and impaired glucagon secretion contribute to PHH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further neuroendocrine regulatory processes to counteract hypoglycaemia involve&#xD;
      catecholamines, cortisol, growth hormone and autonomic nervous system activity. Two previous&#xD;
      studies examined counter-regulatory hormones during experimentally induced hypoglycaemia in&#xD;
      patients after gastric bypass surgery and found lower levels than before surgery, suggesting&#xD;
      that bariatric surgery per se influences counter-regulation to hypoglycaemia. Underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms remain speculative. Of note, impaired neuroendocrine counter-regulation to&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia is further supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic patients, which may&#xD;
      be reflective of impaired hypoglycaemia awareness. The role of counter-regulatory hormones in&#xD;
      PHH patients remains not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the neuroendocrine milieu, effectiveness of hypoglycaemia counter-regulation&#xD;
      depends on the capacity to provide glucose from the liver, also known as endogenous glucose&#xD;
      production. In healthy humans, approximately 85% of the glucose produced by the liver during&#xD;
      the initial 60-90min of hypoglycaemia is derived from liver glycogen. Postprandial hepatic&#xD;
      glycogen stores, in turn, depend heavily on the hepatic glucose uptake following a meal.&#xD;
      Postprandial hepatic glucose disposal and mobilization of hepatic glucose during&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia in PHH patients remain unexplored to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no evidence, that increased insulin sensitivity is implicated in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PHH. Conversely, previous studies suggested increased non-insulin&#xD;
      dependent whole body glucose uptake in PHH compared to non-PHH in the light of similar or&#xD;
      even decreased insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the neuro-endocrine response to&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia in PHH vs. non-PHH post-gastric bypass individuals. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the glucagon response to standardized and controlled hypoglycaemia is&#xD;
      significantly diminished in PHH vs. non-PHH post-gastric bypass individuals. Involvement of&#xD;
      non-surgical non-PHH controls and sleeve-gastrectomy non-PHH controls will allow to explore&#xD;
      effects of bariatric surgery on counter-regulatory mechanisms to hypoglycaemia, including&#xD;
      differences between procedures (gastric bypass vs. sleeve gastrectomy).&#xD;
