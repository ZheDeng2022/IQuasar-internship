  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v)&#xD;
      supplementation will reduce systemic inflammation and prolong residual beta cell function in&#xD;
      individuals newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      probiotic-induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota may favorably alter the post-onset&#xD;
      disease state.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For individuals newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, this clinical trial will assess whether&#xD;
      probiotic supplementation has efficacy in reducing the endogenous systemic innate&#xD;
      inflammatory state known to exist in newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes and whether this&#xD;
      reduction correlates with preservation of endogenous insulin production as measured by&#xD;
      stimulated C-peptide during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT). The innate inflammatory&#xD;
      state will be measured by plasma-induced transcriptional assay and quantified as a composite&#xD;
      inflammatory index. Mixed meal tolerance testing is the gold standard measure of endogenous&#xD;
      insulin production. During this test, serial blood c-peptide levels are collected over 2&#xD;
      hours in response to challenge with a nutritional drink containing a mix of protein, fat, and&#xD;
      carbohydrate and the C-peptide area under the curve is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a randomized, placebo-controlled design, the investigators will measure changes in&#xD;
      systemic inflammation (primary outcome) and beta cell function (secondary outcome) after six&#xD;
      months of daily treatment with either Lp299v supplementation or placebo. These measures of&#xD;
      plasma-induced transcriptional assay and MMTT will be related to markers of beta cell stress,&#xD;
      the composition of the gut microbiota, analysis of the plasma metabolome, and levels of&#xD;
      microbial antigen exposure.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will examine the effect of probiotic supplementation on the endogenous innate inflammatory state in youth newly diagnosed with T1D, as measured by plasma-induced transcription and analyzed using a composite inflammatory index score.

    <description>Investigators will examine the rate of C-peptide decline, as measured by C-peptide AUC in youth newly diagnosed with T1D.

    <description>Investigators will examine the effect of probiotic supplementation using 16s rRNA sequencing to determine the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

    <measure>Markers of systemic microbial antigen exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years (duration of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Gut leakiness will be measured by examining the levels of microbial antigens in the plasma before and after treatment and correlating these antigen levels with the changes in the composition of the gut bacteria. It is hypothesized that changes in antigen levels and gut bacteria will only be seen in the participants receiving the probiotic. It is further hypothesized that those with the greatest reduction in antigens will have the most significant changes in gut bacteria composition.</description>
