  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pilot study of HIV-positive individuals who have been on&#xD;
      tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy for at least 4 months. The overall goal of this&#xD;
      research is to determine the feasibility of giving patients and their providers monthly&#xD;
      feedback about Tenofovir-Diphosphate (TFV-DP) drug levels and to examine patient and provider&#xD;
      behaviors in response to receiving this information. This study will build upon the Aim 1&#xD;
      observational study and the subsequent patient and providerFeedback Development Workgroups&#xD;
      (FDWs).&#xD;

      This is a prospective, pilot study of HIV-positive individuals who have been on&#xD;
      tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy for at least 4 months. The overall goal of this&#xD;
      research is to determine the feasibility of giving patients and their providers monthly&#xD;
      feedback about Tenofovir-Diphosphate (TFV-DP) drug levels and to examine patient and provider&#xD;
      behaviors in response to receiving this information. This study will build upon the Aim 1&#xD;
      observational study and the subsequent patient and provider Feedback Development Workgroups&#xD;
      (FDWs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will consent a sample (N=60) of HIV-positive patients for monthly assessments,&#xD;
      including blood specimen collections to assess TFV-DP drug levels. Participants enrolled in&#xD;
      this prospective, pilot study will be randomized to either the intervention arm in which they&#xD;
      will receive monthly feedback on their TFV-DP drug levels (Feedback Group; N=30) or the&#xD;
      control arm in which they will receive no feedback on TFV-DP drug levels (No Feedback Group;&#xD;
      N=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at the Gugulethu Research Offices (GRO) of the Desmond Tutu HIV&#xD;
      Foundation (DTHF) in Gugulethu, 15km outside Cape Town, South Africa (SA). Study participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from patients attending one of four public-sector ART clinics in the&#xD;
      Klipfontein Health District, Western Cape, including (1) Hannan Crusaid Treatment Centre, (2)&#xD;
      Nyanga Clinic, (3) Gugulethu Clinic (NY1), and (4) Vuyani Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will occur over 3-4 months, during which study staff will recruit an average of&#xD;
      15-20 participants per month, for a total of 60 participants. Participants will remain in the&#xD;
      study for 5 months, attending a baseline and 4 subsequent monthly study visits. At each&#xD;
      monthly visit, study staff will obtain venous blood samples for dried blood spots (DBS) which&#xD;
      will measure TFV-DP levels and a viral load (VL) assay. ART adherence will also be assessed&#xD;
      through the Wise Pill electronic monitoring device (EMD) a medication dispenser that sends an&#xD;
      electronic medication event record to the Wisepill server when medication is taken and&#xD;
      monthly self-reported medication adherence. Socio-demographic characteristics, medical&#xD;
      history, mental health, substance use, and other contextual factors will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and at the final study visit. In addition, at each visit, participants randomized to&#xD;
      the intervention arm will receive feedback on their previous month's TFV-DP drug levels.&#xD;
      Clinic providers will also receive TFV-DP drug level results for the participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both intervention and control groups, the study will monitor any changes to ART adherence&#xD;
      behavior on the part of patients and providers. Potential changes will be monitored by&#xD;
      reviewing participants' clinic charts to determine if any actions were made to the medical or&#xD;
      adherence management of patients since the previous visit (e.g., additional VL requests&#xD;
      beyond those prescribed for a stable patient, referral for intensive counselor-based or group&#xD;
      adherence counseling, outreach by Health Care Workers (HCWs) for adherence monitoring and&#xD;
      support, additional doctor-requested patient appointments). The study will also conduct Exit&#xD;
      Interviews with participants and hold Provider Focus Group Discussions (FGD) to further&#xD;
      understand whether (and if so, how) TFV-DP drug level feedback influenced medication&#xD;
      adherence and patient management.&#xD;
