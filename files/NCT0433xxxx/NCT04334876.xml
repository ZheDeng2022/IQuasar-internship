      The purpose of this study is to validate the use of a rapid, at home, point-of-care (POC)&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test in high risk healthcare workers. Additionally, we would like to&#xD;
      evaluate the incidence of seroconversion in this high-risk population and to identify&#xD;
      possible candidates for convalescent plasma donation for therapy/prophylaxis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The success of Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong in limiting the impact of the sudden acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also know as COVID-19, has been attributed&#xD;
      to their preparedness but mostly to the implementation and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 fast&#xD;
      diagnostic tests and establishment of decentralized point-of-care (POC) testing&#xD;
      (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00010-2). So far, the frontline response to the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. PCR is the gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosing an infectious agent, and it has the advantage that the primers needed&#xD;
      for such tests can be produced with relative speed as soon as the viral sequence is known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first quantitative reverse-transcriptase-based PCR (RT-PCR) tests for detecting SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      were designed and distributed in January by the World Health Organization (WHO), soon after&#xD;
      the virus was identified. The test protocol is complex and expensive, however, and is mainly&#xD;
      suited to large, centralized diagnostic laboratories. Tests typically take 4-6 hours to&#xD;
      complete, but the logistical requirement to ship clinical samples means the turnaround time&#xD;
      is 24 hours at best. A new fast PCR test (45 min) from Cepheid has been approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration on March 21st with availability at the end of the month. Rapid&#xD;
      POC tests are also needed to accelerate clinical decision-making and to take some of the&#xD;
      workload off centralized test laboratories. Most importantly, the current state of the matter&#xD;
      in Indiana University Health system, as well as many around the country is that healthcare&#xD;
      workers including from the ER and ICU are currently unable to receive adequate testing&#xD;
      through existing facilities. Worst, their access to appropriate personal protective equipment&#xD;
      (PPE) has been limited, increasing their exposure risk and causing a significant amount of&#xD;
      stress and anxiety for front-line healthcare providers across the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Back to the Singapore experience, they have used immunoassays that can provide historic&#xD;
      information about viral exposure, as well as diagnostic evidence. They exploited&#xD;
      antibody-antigen recognition, either by using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to detect viral&#xD;
      antigens in clinical samples or by using cloned viral antigens to detect patient antibodies&#xD;
      directed against the virus. The lateral flow assay format - essentially a dipstick encased in&#xD;
      a cassette - contains the capture reagents (either an mAb directed at a viral antigen or a&#xD;
      viral antigen that is recognized by patients' antibodies) immobilized at defined locations on&#xD;
      a nitrocellulose membrane, as well as labelled detector mAbs that recognize the same target.&#xD;
      A positive result, which is triggered by binding between the analyte and capture mAb and&#xD;
      binding by the detector mAb, is visible as a colored line. Two drops of blood from a pinprick&#xD;
      is enough to detect a virus. They're essentially the same as home pregnancy kits. Several of&#xD;
      these assays are available in Asia, and most European Countries have been using them too. In&#xD;
      US, RayBiotech has developed such a similar test using knowledge from the Asian tests&#xD;
      (https://www.raybiotech.com/covid-19-igm-igg-rapid-test-kit/). This product is CE marked and&#xD;
      certified for diagnostic use in the EU. The application for FDA Emergency Use Authorizations&#xD;
      of tests was submitted on March 16th, 2020. At the moment, the FDA has only approved PCR&#xD;
      testing. No lateral flow tests have been approved as of March 23rd, 2020. However, this&#xD;
      lateral flow test can be used legally in the US, for in vitro diagnostic use, as a POC test&#xD;
      when administered by a licensed medical practitioner. These kits were developed in-house by&#xD;
      Ray Biotech and validated using samples taken in hospital from patients showing clinical&#xD;
      symptoms in Guangzhou China (all confirmed via PCR). Current stocks of 10,000 kits are being&#xD;
      replenished daily at RayBiotech, with efforts to increase production ten-fold within the next&#xD;
      week. The CE certificate can be found here:&#xD;
      https://www.raybiotech.com/files/images/CG-COV_CE-Certificates.jpg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong positive experience, and to curb the fast spread of&#xD;
      the virus in the US, we propose to use the POC SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody in high risk&#xD;
      healthcare workers with or without symptoms, previously quarantine or not. Indeed, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the incidence of seroconversion among ER and ICU healthcare workers is high&#xD;
      and higher than current models predict and that several cases are asymptomatic or with mild&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two additional benefits of testing seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Although there are no official reports, we clearly hear and see selfies of anxiety,&#xD;
           stress and exhaustion from our colleagues at the front line. Thus for the healthcare&#xD;
           workers knowing that they have seroconverted, will help them be more confident that they&#xD;
           are now protected and can work in safer conditions as it has recently been shown that&#xD;
           reinfection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques&#xD;
           https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The healthcare workers represent an ideal pool of donors for convalescent plasma due to&#xD;
           their commitment and the fact that they have usually been tested to give blood or are&#xD;
           currently blood donors. The FDA just approved a master protocol for collection and&#xD;
           administration of convalescent plasma:&#xD;
           https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exem&#xD;
           ption-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, &quot;you cannot fight a fire blindfolded, and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't&#xD;
      know who is infected.&quot; (World Health Organization Director-General, 16 March 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful and validated, we will hope to rapidly scale it up to propose the rapid&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody testing to the general population as has been done in countries that&#xD;
      have had almost no death due to COVID-19.&#xD;

        <description>To determine the number of high risk health care workers with a positive SARS CoV2 IgG on a rapid, at home, self-administered, point-of-care (POC) test. Positive POC tests were then assessed for confirmation using a serum antibody test.</description>
        <time_frame>Subjects self-administered the at home POC test and self-reported at their convenience. Testing/reported took approx 15min. Follow up at home testing allowed q 3 weeks post-reporting for a total of 3 at-home tests possible</time_frame>
        <population>There was a total of 571 subjects consented. Of these, 71 were lost to follow-up, giving a total of 500 subjects who completed the survey and submitted results for the POC test. Of these 500, 58 subjects did a second follow up point of care test, and 15 patients completed a 3rd test.</population>
