  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  i. Age 55 years or older. ii. Diagnosis of the index event made by neurologist or&#xD;
             general physician of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA (WHO definition) of undetermined&#xD;
             etiology occurring within the previous 6 months (180 days). The event must be either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. An ischemic stroke confirmed by neuroimaging; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A transient ischemic attack, defined as involving a focal unilateral motor&#xD;
                  deficit, speech/language deficit or hemianopia, with symptom duration &lt;24 hours&#xD;
                  (note: amaurosis fugax/ transient monocular blindness, pure sensory spells,&#xD;
                  isolated vertigo spells, etc. do not qualify for enrolment given the potential&#xD;
                  for misdiagnosis of such events).&#xD;
&#xD;
        iii. Patient meets the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least one 12-lead ECG has already been obtained as part of the routine clinical&#xD;
             post-stroke/TIA work up, and not ECGs have shown any episodes of AF or atrial flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A Holter monitor has already been obtained as part of the routine clinical&#xD;
             post-stroke/TIA work-up, and does not show any episodes of AF or atrial flutter&#xD;
             ≥30seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv. The patient is being actively investigated for the etiology of the stroke/TIA event and&#xD;
        additional cardiac monitor is desired to screen further for the possibility of AF or atrial&#xD;
        flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        v. The following diagnostic test have already been completed as part of clinical routine&#xD;
        post-stroke/TIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Brain imaging with CT or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Vascular imaging of the extracranial and intracranial circulation with either CT&#xD;
             angiography or MRI angiography to exclude significant large vessel occlusion disease&#xD;
             as the most likely mechanism for index ischemic event (carotid Doppler ultrasound is&#xD;
             acceptable for those presenting with anterior circulation ischemic events).*&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Transthoracic (or transesophageal) echocardiography to exclude thrombus or other&#xD;
             structural heart disease that in the opinion of the investigator is the most likely&#xD;
             cause for the stroke/TIA events.* *(if a baseline investigation cannot be obtained&#xD;
             clinically after the index event and prior to study enrolment, then it is acceptable&#xD;
             for study purposes for investigations to be obtained after patient enrolment into the&#xD;
             study but prior to the 90-day follow-up visit.) vi. Informed consent from the patient&#xD;
             (or from a legally authorised representative if the patient is not competent, due to&#xD;
             stroke-related cognitive impairment, aphasia, or anosognosia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        vii. The patient is expected to survive at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  i. Any previously documented atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (a remote history&#xD;
             of transient AF during perioperative period is not exclusionary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Exclusively retinal stroke or retinal TIA event. iii. A most responsible etiological&#xD;
        diagnosis for the qualifying stroke/TIA event has already determined i.e. cervicocephalic&#xD;
        artery dissection, venous sinus thrombosis, hypercoagulable states, or other known cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv. Planned carotid endarterectomy within 90 days. v. Any finding on echocardiography for&#xD;
        which there is already an evidence-based indication for long-term anticoagulation (e.g.&#xD;
        mechanical heart valve, thrombus, etc) vi. Inability to use the AliveCor smartphone ECG&#xD;
        monitor upon enrolment into the study (if patient is randomised into interventional&#xD;
        group).* vii. Participating in a clinical trial involving investigational medication. viii.&#xD;
        Endocarditis. ix. Pregnancy.&#xD;
