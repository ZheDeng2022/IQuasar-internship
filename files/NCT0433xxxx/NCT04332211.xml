  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) utilizes 100% oxygen delivery at a pressure greater than 1&#xD;
      atm for the treatment of various emergent medical conditions including carbon monoxide&#xD;
      poisoning. The most commonly associated complication of HBOT is middle ear barotrauma (MEB)&#xD;
      which occurs when the eustachian tube does not allow air to enter the middle ear space to&#xD;
      equalize the pressure between the ambient environment and the inner ear. Patients&#xD;
      experiencing MEB usually feel pressure or pain in their ear(s). The spectrum of symptoms&#xD;
      ranges from sensation of ear fullness and muffled hearing to severe pain, vertigo and&#xD;
      tympanic membrane rupture. The incidence of MEB, depending on the definition used is between&#xD;
      2-45%. The severe discomfort associated with MEB sometimes causes HBOT to be postponed or&#xD;
      abandoned. Last year 27/991 treatments at our Center for Hyperbaric and Dive Medicine were&#xD;
      aborted due to MEB. Currently there is no objective criteria for predicting which patients&#xD;
      will experience these complications, nor is there consensus on effective prevention measures.&#xD;
      At our facility, oxymetazoline, a topical nasal decongestant, is the standard rescue&#xD;
      medication administered for patients that have symptoms of MEB during HBOT. This is despite&#xD;
      two negative studies showing that this medication does not work any better than placebo.&#xD;
      Other studies involving scuba divers and airplane travelers showed that oral pseudoephedrine&#xD;
      is effective in decreasing MEB. However, the use of pseudoephedrine for patients undergoing&#xD;
      HBOT has not been studied. The investigators plan to perform a randomized double blind&#xD;
      placebo control trial to determine if pseudoephedrine is effective in decreasing the rate of&#xD;
      MEB during HBOT.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To investigate the efficacy of pre-treatment with oral pseudoephedrine 60mg for&#xD;
      decreasing MEB during HBOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients randomized to pseudoephedrine will have a lesser need for oxymetazoline&#xD;
      rescue therapy while being compressed. They will also report less ear pain once at pressure&#xD;
      compared to patients receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To measure the incidence of MEB during HBOT. The investigators will also identify&#xD;
      factors (age, gender, medical history) that could predispose an individual to developing MEB&#xD;
      during HBOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The incidence of MEB defined as requiring stopping compression of the chamber and&#xD;
      oxymetazoline rescue will be greater than 30%. Female sex, age above 60, and prior history of&#xD;
      ear conditions will be associated with development of MEB.&#xD;
