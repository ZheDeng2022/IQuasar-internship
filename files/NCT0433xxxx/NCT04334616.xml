      OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to compare the frequency of POST in patients&#xD;
      intubated by trainee anaesthetist using Video LaryngoscopeTM(VDL) versus Conventional&#xD;
      Macintosh Laryngoscope (CL) at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sore Throat: A sore throat is pain, scratchiness or irritation of the throat usually&#xD;
           from irritation or inflammation of the throat (pharynx)(11).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The visual analogue scale (0-10) will be used to evaluate the severity of sore throat&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trainee Anesthetist: Anesthesia residents level I and II having experience of more than&#xD;
           six months. They will have to achieve the initial competence of doing intubation under&#xD;
           direct supervision and need to be familiar with conventional as well as VDL technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NULL HYPOTHESIS: There is no difference in the frequency of POST in patients intubated by&#xD;
      trainee anaesthetists using VDLTM versus conventional Macintosh laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS: There is a difference in the frequency of POST in patients intubated by&#xD;
      trainee anaesthetists using VDLTM versus conventional Macintosh laryngoscope.&#xD;

      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: The study will be conducted at main Operating Room, Department of Anaesthesiology,&#xD;
      Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY: This study will be conducted for a period of one year or till the&#xD;
      completion of sample size after approval of synopsis by ERC and CPSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      W.H.O software is used to calculate sample size (See Annexure 1) Frequency of POST in VDL&#xD;
      group = 28% (7) Frequency of POST in CL Group =54% (7) Power of the test = 80% Type I error=&#xD;
      5% Sample size in each group =55 (Total sample size 110)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Control Trial (Observer Blinded)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING TECHNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non probability consecutive sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION: After approval from Ethical Review Committee potential patients will be&#xD;
      screened in the ward. After eligibility, the consent will be administered by the study&#xD;
      investigators. If patient agree to participate and signed the consent, he/she will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Selected patients will be randomly allocated by a computer-generated&#xD;
      number, either into conventional laryngoscopy (CL) group or video laryngoscopy (VDL) group&#xD;
      through sealed envelopes. All patients will be managed with general anaesthesia requiring&#xD;
      control mode ventilation and intubation. The direct supervision of consultant anesthetist&#xD;
      involved in the study protocol would be there for every case. After instituting routine&#xD;
      American society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) recommended monitoring standards, induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia would be done by the consultant anaesthetistwith Propofol 1.5-2 mg/Kg, Nalbuphine&#xD;
      0.1 milligram per Kg and Atracurium 0.5 mg/Kg. The readiness of intubating conditions will be&#xD;
      judged by orbicular oculi response of train of four stimuli. Patient would be considered&#xD;
      ready to intubate when there will be no response to the neuromuscular stimuli. The head of&#xD;
      the patient will be placed in sniffing position with under head pillow to facilitate the&#xD;
      sniffing position.Selection of VDL or ML will be done as per consecutive sampling. Patient in&#xD;
      Macintosh laryngoscopy group (MLG) are going to be intubated by trainee anaesthetist as&#xD;
      defined by operational definition with laryngoscope size 3 or 4 blade as per the decision.&#xD;
      Similarly the patient in (VLG) will be intubated by trainee anaesthetist as defined earlier&#xD;
      with laryngoscope size 3 or 4 as per decided plan. Intubation will be done by trainee&#xD;
      anaesthetist using appropriate size of endotracheal tube (ETT).The size 7-7.5 mm ID would be&#xD;
      used for adult females, while male patients will require size 8-8.5 mm ID of ETT. All ETT&#xD;
      tubes will be lubricated with water-based gel (Aplicare Lubricating Jelly) before intubation.&#xD;
      Number of attempts of Laryngoscopy will be noted along with the time taken if less than or&#xD;
      greater than 30 seconds also if any alteration like bougie was used. The inflation of the&#xD;
      cuff would be guided by any obvious leak as measured by the APL bag valve pressure of 20 mm&#xD;
      Hg. Later on inflation of cuff pressure would also be confirmed by pressure manometer. The&#xD;
      cuff pressure between 20-25 mm Hg is said to be adequate. The intubation time including the&#xD;
      number of intubation attempts or any other maneuver used to aid the intubation will be noted&#xD;
      down. Orogastric tube lubricated by water based gel (Aplicare Lubricating Jelly) will be&#xD;
      passed in all patients. Number of attempt in passing Orogastric Tube or if the aid of Magill&#xD;
      forceps used will be noted.All patients would be positioned supine initially and then head up&#xD;
      (reverse trandelenberg), as per surgeons preference which is usual for laparoscopic general&#xD;
      surgical procedures Anesthesia will be maintained with Isoflurane in mixture of O2/Air. Dual&#xD;
      antiemetic prophylaxis that is dexamethasone 0.1 mg/Kg at start and Ondansteron 0.1 mg/Kg at&#xD;
      the end would be used for every patient. Endotracheal tube cuff pressurewill be regularly&#xD;
      checked at 30 mins interval. Patient will be excluded if the duration of surgery exceeds one&#xD;
      hundred and fifty minutes. Patient will be reversed from anaesthesia when fully recovered&#xD;
      from paralytic effect of Atracurium. This again will be judge by twitch monitoring. All&#xD;
      patients will be extubated as guided by the subjective and objective criteria of extubation.&#xD;
      Reversal of neuromuscular paralysis will again be assessed by twitch response to train of&#xD;
      four stimuli at orbicularis oculi muscle. Patient would be given reversal once all four&#xD;
      twitches would be there. Patient would be observed for postoperative sore throat at 1, 12 and&#xD;
      24 hours post operatively by the primary investigator who is blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
      The visual analogue scale (0-10) will be used to evaluate the severity of sore throat. The&#xD;
      definite measurement of POST will be taken at 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS MANAGEMENT In investigators opinion, there would be no adverse event related&#xD;
      to the trial protocol. However, if any event either serious or non-serious happened then will&#xD;
      be reported to the ERC and other relevant entities are per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: All statistical analysis will be performed using statistical packages for&#xD;
      social science version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Mean and standard deviation will be&#xD;
      computed for age, weight, height, BMI. Frequency and percentage will be computed for gender,&#xD;
      mallampatti grade, Type of Laryngoscope, Alteration of airway management at intubation,&#xD;
      Cormack &amp;Lehane intubation grade, Number of attempts of Laryngoscopy and sore throat (at 1&#xD;
      hr., 12 and 24 hrs.). Both groups will be compared by Chi-square test for frequency of POST&#xD;
      between both groups, P value ≤0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification analysis will be performed to observe effect of confounding variables like&#xD;
      age, BMI, gender, mallampatti grade, Type of Laryngoscope, Alteration of airway management at&#xD;
      intubation, Cormack &amp; Lehane intubation grade, duration of intubation and number of attempts&#xD;
      of Laryngoscopy. After stratification Chi-square test will be applied to compare POST between&#xD;
      groups. p≤0.05 will be considered significant&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE Data will be stored in lock and key and no one will access other&#xD;
      than study investigators. Electronic data would be password protected. Data will be stored&#xD;
      for 15 years as per GCP and other regulatory guidelines. Data will be frequently monitored by&#xD;
      PI for quality checks and queries will be resolved timely basis.&#xD;
