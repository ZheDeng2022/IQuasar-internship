      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a transplant, blood stem cells from one person are given to someone else. The cells&#xD;
      grow into the different cells that make up the immune system. This can cure people with&#xD;
      certain immunodeficiencies. But transplant has many risks and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if stem cell transplant can be successfully performed in people with primary&#xD;
      immunodeficiency disease and cure them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 4-69 for whom a primary immunodeficiency (PID) or Primary Immune Regulatory&#xD;
      Disorder (PIRD), has caused significant health problems and either standard management has&#xD;
      not worked or there are no standard management options, along with their donors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will be screened under protocol 01-C-0129. They will donate blood or bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT or PET scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before transplant, participants will have dental and eye exams. They will have a bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy. For this, a needle will be inserted through the skin into the pelvis to remove&#xD;
      marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be hospitalized before their transplant. They will have a central catheter&#xD;
      put into a vein in their chest or neck. They will get medications through the catheter to&#xD;
      prevent complications. Participants will get stem cells through the catheter. They will stay&#xD;
      in the hospital for at least 4 weeks. They will give blood, urine, bone marrow, and stool&#xD;
      samples. They may need blood transfusions. They may need more scans. They will take more&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits on days 30, 60, 100, 180, and 360, and 24 months after the&#xD;
      transplant. Then they will have visits once a year for about 5 years&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With the availability of whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)&#xD;
           for patients with suspected primary immune deficiency or Primary Immune Regulatory&#xD;
           Disorder (PIRD), the number of recognized PID s and PIRD s has increased in recent years&#xD;
           to over 400 distinct immune defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation represents a potentially curative&#xD;
           therapy for many hematologic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is now an accepted standard or an appropriate&#xD;
           experimental approach for treatment of an increasing number of PID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of conditioning regimens containing high doses of alkylating agents, often in&#xD;
           combination with total body irradiation, are considered myeloablative and are essential&#xD;
           and for suppression of the host-versus-graft response to the donor stem cells (i.e.&#xD;
           rejection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation (HSCT) using selected conditioning regimens and selected donor sources&#xD;
           in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and immune function and reversing the disease&#xD;
           phenotype in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether allogeneic HSCT results in sustained donor engraftment defined as&#xD;
      neutrophil recovery with ANC greater than or equalto 500/mm(3) for 3 consecutive days&#xD;
      associated with &gt; 50% donor T-cell and myeloid cell donor chimerism before day 100 for&#xD;
      diseases characterized by loss of function and &gt;75% donor T-cell and myeloid cell chimerism&#xD;
      for diseases characterized by gain-of-function mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ages 4-69 years old with a known PID or PIRD, or with clinical evidence of&#xD;
           a PID or PIRD with a history of recurrent infections requiring prolonged courses of&#xD;
           therapy, or evidence of immune dysregulation manifested by autoimmune/autoinflammatory&#xD;
           disease, atopy, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, or impaired&#xD;
           response to vaccination. A virally-driven malignancy alone will also constitute a basis&#xD;
           for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 or 8/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B, -C,&#xD;
           DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing) or a haploidentical related donor; unrelated&#xD;
           donors are identified through the National Marrow Donor Program.&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents with the exception of&#xD;
             virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation&#xD;
             prior to allo HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to agents (steroids, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, sirolimus, MMF, G-CSF)&#xD;
             used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active psychiatric disorder which is deemed by the PI to have significant risk of&#xD;
             compromising compliance with the transplant protocol or which does not allow for&#xD;
             appropriate informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents have the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with the study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
