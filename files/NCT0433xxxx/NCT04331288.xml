  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess pharmacokinetic interactions between ethanol&#xD;
      (EtOH) and PT150 (900 mg qd) in non-treatment-seeking alcohol-experienced volunteers-(to&#xD;
      include military service members, veterans and/or civilians).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study can be classified as a phase 1, single center, and drug-drug interaction (DDI)&#xD;
      study. The within-subjects' experimental procedures will assess pharmacokinetic interactions&#xD;
      between ethanol (EtOH) and PT150 (900 mg qd) in non-treatment-seeking alcohol-experienced&#xD;
      volunteers (to include military service members, veterans and/or civilians). The specific aim&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PT150 (a novel, selective&#xD;
      Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist) in combination with alcohol and to determine the&#xD;
      amount of PT150 and alcohol in blood (i.e., the pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between&#xD;
      alcohol and PT150) in 10 non-treatment seeking participants. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the possibility of any adverse interactions between alcohol and PT150. While PT150&#xD;
      might be effective in the treatment of AUD, because alcohol can affect the way that PT150 is&#xD;
      metabolized in the body, we first need to determine 1) that it is safe to take PT150 in&#xD;
      combination with alcohol, and 2) the amount of PT150 and alcohol in blood after PT150 has&#xD;
      reached steady state. This study population will be drawn from adults of any race or&#xD;
      ethnicity, males, and females who are post-menopausal, undergoing hormone replacement&#xD;
      treatment at a stable dosage for at least 3 months, infertile and not hormone cycling, or&#xD;
      using approved non-hormonal contraception for at least two weeks after the last dose.&#xD;
      Potential enrollees will be drawn of those NOT seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      (AUD). Statistical goals for the study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PT150 given in&#xD;
      combination with exposure to alcohol. The primary objective includes assessing if measures of&#xD;
      concentration and timing of PT150 levels in the blood differ between the PT150 challenge&#xD;
      (challenge on Day 8 and continually observed through Day 9) in combination with alcohol&#xD;
      (ethanol beverage) compared to the steady-state PT150 challenge, absent alcohol challenge, on&#xD;
      Day 7. Secondary objectives are to determine if measures of concentration and timing of BAL&#xD;
      in the blood differ between the active alcohol challenges only (Day 1/baseline) and PT150&#xD;
      challenges in combination with alcohol challenges (Day 8). Other secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      evaluating health and safety outcomes as well as withdrawal from alcohol. After completion of&#xD;
      the screening period, the remaining study duration will proceed as follows for each&#xD;
      participant: Admission for an initial 1-day in-patient stay; Discharge followed by 4 days of&#xD;
      outpatient visits; Readmission for a 4-day inpatient stay; and for females, a follow-up visit&#xD;
      will be scheduled to occur at least 14 days after the final dose of PT150 is administered to&#xD;
      ensure pregnancy has not occurred. This results in a total participant duration of 10 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Have a self-reported medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Women must either be unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or&#xD;
             post-menopausal) or using non-hormonal, medically acceptable contraception during the&#xD;
             study and for at least 2 weeks after study completion, with or without additional&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Be receiving HRT where their dose has not been stable for a minimum of 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;

             half-lives [whichever is longer]) and for the entire duration of the study. These&#xD;
             items should be excluded for a longer time period if the DDI mechanism is induction or&#xD;
             time-dependent inhibition. Concomitant medication use includes any prescription,&#xD;
