      Single center, open-label, intra-individual dose-escalation study in subjects with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After assessing eligibility during a screening period of up to 4 weeks, up to 6 subjects will&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will check into the clinic one day prior to dosing (Day -1). To evaluate and compare&#xD;
      drug exposure levels in plasma and CSF, plasma and CSF will be serially sampled over a period&#xD;
      of 36 hours. Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Day 5 after all required study&#xD;
      procedures are completed and if medically justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic approximately 1 week after discharge from the clinic for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a man or woman aged between 45 and 75, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented clinically established diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage&#xD;
             1 to 3 and Montreal Cognitive Assessment greater or equal than 26. Diagnosis of&#xD;
             Parkinson's Disease consistent wit MDS Research Criteria for the Diagnosis of&#xD;
             Parkinson's Disease must include bradykinesia with sequence effect, and motor&#xD;
             asymmetry (especially if no rest tremor). Diagnosis has to be made less than 3 years&#xD;
             prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject understands the nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks&#xD;
             and side effects, and i willing and able to comply with all compulsory stud procedures&#xD;
             and provides signed and dated written informed consent (in accordance with local&#xD;
             regulations) prior to any study procedures being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject used any NSAIDs, steroids, colchicine or anti-IL-1 inhibitors within 7&#xD;
             days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject received any investigational drugs within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer), prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject had an active systemic infection (other than common cold) within 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of severe hypersensitivity to previous drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has any severe, progressive or uncontrolled medical condition at Screening&#xD;
             or on Day -1 that in the judgment of the investigator prevents the subject from&#xD;
             participating in the study.&#xD;
