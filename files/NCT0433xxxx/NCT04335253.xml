      Multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase I/IIa clinical study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability, PK, PD, and antitumor activity of EOS884448 in participants with advanced&#xD;
      cancers. The study will consist in a dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD, the RP2D,&#xD;
      and the safety of EOS884448 in participants with advanced cancers.&#xD;
