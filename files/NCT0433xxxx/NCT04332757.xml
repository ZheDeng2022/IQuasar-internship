      The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of a personalised physical&#xD;
      training programme in returning servicewomen to fitness following childbirth. The idea behind&#xD;
      the program is to target core and pelvic floor muscles, along with whole body strength and&#xD;
      endurance to help servicewomen return to work safely and in a physically fit condition. The&#xD;
      study will monitor the response to training using the following measures: urogynaecological&#xD;
      measures (e.g., pelvic floor strength, prolapse, urinary incontinence), military specific&#xD;
      fitness tests, musculoskeletal health (e.g., muscle and bone mass &amp; function) and mental&#xD;
      health and wellbeing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an independent groups study design, the aim was to investigate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      postpartum physical development programme on core reconnection (i.e., pelvic floor function,&#xD;
      core strength/stability and urogynaecological measures), occupational physical performance,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health, and psychological health/wellbeing in servicewomen. Given that policy&#xD;
      guidance is urgently needed regarding the safe return of servicewomen to functional&#xD;
      occupational fitness, the aim of our proposed research is to inform the appropriate physical&#xD;
      preparation of servicewomen in the postpartum period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants at selected sites around the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst will receive&#xD;
      usual care/no formal intervention (acting as a control group [CON]) and participants at&#xD;
      different sites around Army Headquarters will receive usual care and additionally complete an&#xD;
      18-week phased physical development (rehabilitation and training) programme between weeks 6&#xD;
      and 24 postpartum (acting as the intervention group [INT]). If recruitment numbers are low at&#xD;
      the main sites (Aldershot and Tidworth) we will seek to recruit participants to INT from&#xD;
      Bulford, Middle Wallop, Larkhill and Marlborough Lines for INT and to CON from Sandhurst,&#xD;
      Odiham, Pirbright, Keogh, Minley, Deepcut as well as locations outside of the named INT&#xD;
      sites. The geographical separation of sites was deemed to be important for maintaining&#xD;
      differences between intervention and control group activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a phased 18-week physical development programme to train both&#xD;
      rehabilitative and performance enhancement elements of physical preparation. The&#xD;
      rehabilitation element of the programme will specifically target pelvic floor function and&#xD;
      core strength and stability (known collectively as Core Reconnection training) from weeks 6&#xD;
      to 24 postpartum, and the training element of the programme will contain resistance and&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) from weeks 12 to 24 postpartum&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of a tailored rehabilitation and&#xD;
      physical preparation programme for postpartum women on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Occupational fitness performance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Female health assessments (i.e., urinary incontinence, pelvic floor strength);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Musculoskeletal health;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychological health and wellbeing.&#xD;

    <measure>Tendon Properties Changes Between 6, 12 and 24 Weeks Postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>Tendon properties will be measured at weeks 6, 12 and 24 postpartum.</time_frame>
    <description>Tendon stiffness and young's modulus will be measured using ultrasonography with a linear array probe. Patella tendon length and elongation will be calculated as the distance from the apex of the patellar and the shadow created by a fixed marker. Patella tendon stiffness will be calculated by dividing knee extensor torque by the estimated patella tendon moment arm. Knee extensor torque will be calculated as the sum of the measured knee extension torque and the antagonistic torque, estimated through the root mean square of the biceps femoris muscle electromyography signal. Force-elongation data will be fitted with to a second order polynomial curve to determine patella tendon stiffness. Tendon CSA will be assessed along the full resting length of the tendon on the axial plane through ultrasonography. Young's modulus will then be calculated as tendon stiffness multiplied by the ratio of tendon length over tendon cross-sectional area.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Protein and Collagen Turnover Changes Between 12 and 18 Weeks Postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>: Muscle protein and collagen turnover will be measured at weeks 12 and 18 postpartum.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle protein/collagen turnover will be measured from blood, saliva and skeletal muscle biopsy samples. Participants will provide a saliva sample before being given a drink of 'heavy' water (D2O); water that is enriched with a metabolic isotope tracer that can be used to evaluate the rate of protein and collagen turnover by determining the rate of tracer incorporation into muscle tissue. The muscle biopsy will be used to measure the incorporation of deuterated alanine into muscle tissue over time and enable the calculation of the fractional rate of muscle protein synthesis by mass spectrometry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Mass Changes Between 6, 12, 18 and 24 Weeks Postpartum</measure>
