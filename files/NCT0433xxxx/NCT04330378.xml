  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-at-home models seek to address the impending shortage of hospital beds by&#xD;
      reimagining the way we deliver acute hospital-level care - substituting the ward for a&#xD;
      patient's home. Such programmes have been well established in other countries such as&#xD;
      Australia, Europe and USA to be a less costly way to provide inpatient care as a result of a&#xD;
      reduction of fixed costs of building and running hospitals, with equivalent variable costs&#xD;
      and comparable clinical outcomes. Acute services are provided at home, including regular&#xD;
      visits by doctors, nurses and therapists, intravenous therapy, simple investigations and 24/7&#xD;
      access to doctors. The clinical service is tech-enabled, by remote monitoring and&#xD;
      telecommunication technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although overseas experience suggests that hospital-at-home programmes are an effective, safe&#xD;
      and scalable substitute for inpatient beds, and promising strategy to meet the bed demands of&#xD;
      our ageing population, the outcomes in the local environment is unclear. Singapore has a&#xD;
      unique healthcare system compared to primarily insurance driven (USA) or publicly funded (UK&#xD;
      and Australia), which favours subsidies of inpatient care compared to community-based care.&#xD;
      In addition, cultural beliefs of hospitals as a source of comfort and healing and&#xD;
      unfamiliarity with healthcare providers performing home visits may provide unique challenges&#xD;
      which may affect outcomes of a hospital-at-home programme in Singapore. In an Asian setting,&#xD;
      family and informal caregivers are heavily involved in the care of patients and may pose&#xD;
      unique barriers and facilitators to such care at home that may not be evident in similar&#xD;
      models in Western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and processes of a new&#xD;
      hospital-at-home programme in Singapore.&#xD;

      1. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesise that hospital-at-home programmes may reduce cost of delivering care with&#xD;
           comparable clinical outcomes (readmissions, mortality, and hospital-acquired&#xD;
           complications) and positive patient and staff experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the mean direct cost of care per day of index hospitalisation for patients&#xD;
      receiving HaH care to similar patients receiving usual inpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, in terms of 30-day readmissions, mortality and&#xD;
           hospital-acquired complications) of HaH compared to usual inpatient care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate impact of patient-reported outcomes (EQ-5D, Care Transitions Measure and&#xD;
           patient satisfaction scores) of HaH compared to usual inpatient care, including impact&#xD;
           on medication management;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand the experiences of patients receiving HaH care and their caregivers; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To understand the experiences of clinicians providing HaH in providing such care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further exploratory objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify factors that potentially influence the decisions of patients to accept HaH&#xD;
           care, such as patient demographics, family and social setup, or perspectives of&#xD;
           home-based care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the use of telehealth platforms for vital signs monitoring and&#xD;
           teleconsultation that was used within the intervention arm; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      We study will recruit 147 patients in the intervention group and 147 patients in the control&#xD;
      group from 2 sites: National University Hospital (NUH) and Alexandra Hospital (AH). Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited from both AH and NUH with no restrictions of proportion from each center.&#xD;
      There are no restrictions based on race of the subject. We will exclude children as this is&#xD;
      an adult medical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.1 Recruitment Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study personnel will screen through the electronic health record of all patients newly&#xD;
      admitted overnight every working weekday in the following settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NUH EMD Lodgers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NUH Acute Medical Unit (AMU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NUH General Medicine Wards&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NUH Cardiology Wards&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AH wards under General Medicine (GM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients thought to be suitable by the research assistant will be confirmed by the NUHS@Home&#xD;
      consultant for clinical criteria, who will subsequently discuss with the primary physician&#xD;
      regarding eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are subsequently enrolled into the NUHS@Home programme will be approached for&#xD;
      consent to be in the hospital-at-home cohort. The NUHS@Home team will be activated. Patients&#xD;
      will be sent home via ambulance, where they will be reviewed by a NUHS@Home nurse.&#xD;
      Intravenous therapies, pillboxes for medication, remote monitoring software, and&#xD;
      telecommunication tools will be set up as indicated. NUHS@Home doctors will visit at least&#xD;
      once daily, and nurses at least twice daily as required. Therapists will conduct home visits&#xD;
      as necessary. The NUHS@Home team is available 24/7. When conventional discharge criteria are&#xD;
      met, the patient will be discharged. The NUHS@Home clinical team will be under clinical&#xD;
      governance of Division of Advanced Internal Medicine at NUH and patients will be considered&#xD;
      'inpatients' throughout the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are suitable for NUHS@Home programme but the programme has no bed capacity will&#xD;
      be approached for consent to be in the control cohort. There will be no change to the&#xD;
      patient's clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were offered but declined enrolments inot the NUHS@Home programme will be&#xD;
      approached for consent to be in the rejected cohort. There will be no change to the patient's&#xD;
      clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.2 Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has capacity, the study team will go through the study information with the&#xD;
      patient and caregiver (which will cover the process for recruitment and the randomisation&#xD;
      process) and take written informed consent. If the patient requests, their main spokespersons&#xD;
      will be involved in the discussion. If the patient has no capacity to consent, the main&#xD;
      spokesperson will represent them in this scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria are entered elsewhere in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may discontinue the intervention if they are transferred back to hospital during the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Subject Replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who drop out will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Methods and Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.1 Screening Encounter&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients which are potentially eligible would be screened both using the electronic health&#xD;
      record and in person using a screening checklist to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.2 Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients or their proxies who consent will undergo a baseline questionnaire. This includes&#xD;
      baseline demographics, Barthel's score, assessment of health literacy, mini-COG, EQ-5D-5L and&#xD;
      EQ-VAS. If a proxy is used, the same proxy will need to complete all subsequent&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.3 Final Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a final questionnaire 14 days from enrolment. If a proxy was used for&#xD;
      initial questionnaires, the same proxy will be used to complete the final questionnaire. This&#xD;
      includes EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS, perception of care transitions and patient satisfaction survey.&#xD;
      The visit will either be done in the clinic (if patients are coming for a clinic appointment)&#xD;
      or over a phone call. Patients and caregivers in the intervention group will undergo an&#xD;
      additional survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the 'rejected cohort' will not undergo this questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2.4 Post Study Follow up and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 days from discharge, the study team will collect patient outcomes from all 3 cohorts from&#xD;
      the electronic medical record. Every 3 months, the study team will extract billing data for a&#xD;
      list of itemised consumables and their associated cost to the patient. Patients will not be&#xD;
      involved in this data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      5.4.4 Stakeholder Perspectives Using a Qualitative Approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible and enrolled into the NUHS@Home Programme will be recruited for&#xD;
      this study. They will also be asked if their family member/caregiver (excluding hired&#xD;
      domestic help) might be interested to participate in the in-depth semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focused ethnography approach is adopted to elicit situated experiences of patients&#xD;
      receiving care at home and the perceptions of caregivers and care providers in regard to&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to this new care model. Participant observations of care practices&#xD;
      at home and interviews with the three parties including patients, caregivers and the staff&#xD;
      will be undertaken. Analysis will be conducted using constant comparison technique to compare&#xD;
      incidents applicable to each theme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations will be carried out at participants' home by adopting 'observer as participant'&#xD;
      role (Gold, 1958), where observations will be favored over participation. Interview guide&#xD;
      will be adopted from the initial qualitative interviews and will focus on the following&#xD;
      areas: Patients experiences of receiving the care at home: Caregivers and staff's perceptions&#xD;
      of providing the care at home; Facilitators and barriers of receiving/providing care via HaH&#xD;
      model and specific questions in regard to the rich points of social interaction observed in&#xD;
      the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following themes will be explored from the patient and their caregivers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe their experience of being admitted to the Hospital at Home programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What, if any, are the benefits they have experienced during Hospital at Home?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What, if any, are the disadvantages and drawbacks they have experienced during Hospital&#xD;
           at Home?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did this program meet their expectations? Why or why not?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would they choose to be transferred to Home Hospital again if needed hospitalisation in&#xD;
           the future? Why or why not?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How did they feel about the vital signs monitoring setup at home?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What, if any, is their experience of video or phone calls from the doctor during&#xD;
           hospital at home?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What, if any, is their experience with private doctors or nurses that attended to them&#xD;
           during their stay?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any suggestions for the future development of Home Hospital?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be audio-recorded and will last approximately 30-60 minutes. The interviews&#xD;
      will focus on understanding the experiences of patients, caregivers and care providers on&#xD;
      their perceptions of the HaH intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of interviews required will depend on data saturation, estimated to involve&#xD;
      20-30 patients and 20-30 caregivers.&#xD;

    <description>All patients who are enrolled into the NUHS@Home Programme will be recruited into this arm. Patients will be sent home via ambulance, where they will be reviewed by a NUHS@Home nurse. Intravenous therapies, pillboxes for medication, remote monitoring software, and telecommunication tools will be set up as indicated. NUHS@Home doctors will visit at least once daily, and nurses at least twice daily as required. Therapists will conduct home visits as necessary. The NUHS@Home team is available 24/7. When conventional discharge criteria are met, the patient will be discharged. The NUHS@Home clinical team will be under clinical governance of Division of Advanced Internal Medicine at NUH and patients will be considered 'inpatients' throughout the treatment period.</description>
