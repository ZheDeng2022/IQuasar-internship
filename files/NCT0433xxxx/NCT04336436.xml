      This study is designed to tackle the issue of physician burnout via a wide-lens approach,&#xD;
      integrating both mindfulness-based training and nutritional counseling in the management of&#xD;
      professional burnout. The investigators will evaluate the effects of mindfulness training and&#xD;
      nutritional counseling interventions through assessment of changes in physiological and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters known to be adversely affected in burnout, in addition to the&#xD;
      standardized Professional Fulfillment inventory scores at 3-6 months post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a preponderance of data to support the detrimental effects of burnout on physicians'&#xD;
      health and wellbeing. Physician burnout is defined as severe emotional exhaustion,&#xD;
      depersonalization towards others and reduced sense of personal achievement. Burnout is often&#xD;
      accompanied by feelings of moral distress, loss of interest and energy, and detachment from&#xD;
      patients, colleagues and personal relatives. With the recent rapid expansion in global&#xD;
      healthcare systems in response to societal changes, rates of physician burnout have been on&#xD;
      the rise. It is estimated that 54% of physicians in the United States suffer from&#xD;
      professional burnout, a 2-fold higher prevalence than that estimated for the general working&#xD;
      population of 28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burnout has serious negative implications on the physical health and wellbeing of&#xD;
      individuals. In recent studies, burnout was associated with higher incidence of coronary&#xD;
      heart disease and hospitalization from cardiovascular causes. Additionally, burnout was found&#xD;
      to be an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia (total&#xD;
      cholesterol â‰¥220 mg/dl). Higher incidence of musculoskeletal pain and pain-related disability&#xD;
      were also reported amongst subjects with high burnout. Excessive fatigue, insomnia,&#xD;
      headaches, gastrointestinal and respiratory issues were all positively correlated with&#xD;
      burnout level. More strikingly, burnout was found to be a significant predictor of mortality&#xD;
      in those below the age of 45-years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burnout carries its repercussions on mental health as well. In a study of 2,555 dentists,&#xD;
      burnout was a significant predictor of depression occurrence during the 3-year follow-up&#xD;
      period. Increased psychotropic and antidepressant use was associated with high burnout, with&#xD;
      a stronger correlation observed for men than women. High level of burnout was also linked to&#xD;
      increased risk of anxiety, substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and even suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burnout is a serious threat to the medical profession at large. With more than half of the US&#xD;
      physicians suffering from professional burnout, its implications ripple through the entirety&#xD;
      of the healthcare system. Burnout decreases both patient care quality and physician&#xD;
      productivity. Increased sickness absences have been reported in high burnout. In a recent&#xD;
      report, severe burnout independently accounted for 52 sickness absences in a 2-year follow-up&#xD;
      period. Additionally, burnout has resulted in more physicians leaving practices or reducing&#xD;
      their work hours. A healthcare system loses on average $500,000 to $1,000,000 with the&#xD;
      departure of a physician, in addition to the ever-increasing workload of physicians who&#xD;
      remain in practice. Most significant of all, burnout leads to major medical errors. With the&#xD;
      estimated 250,000 deaths in the United States occurring due to medical errors, developing&#xD;
      effective strategies to eliminate physician burnout has become an ever-present priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of prospective studies and clinical trials have been conducted to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of different interventions on mitigating physician burnout. A major cluster of these&#xD;
      studies have focused on behavioral interventions, more specifically, mindfulness-based&#xD;
      approaches aimed at reducing the mental and emotional repercussions of burnout. Such&#xD;
      behavioral interventions included practices of contemplation-meditation exercises,&#xD;
      discussions on enhancing self-care and intensification of present-moment awareness. Efficacy&#xD;
      in the latter studies was mostly assessed via quantification of change in burnout and&#xD;
      stress-related scores, most notably the Maslach Burnout Inventory score, a well-established&#xD;
      tool for assessment of burnout in the occupational setting. The majority of these studies&#xD;
      reported favorable effects on burnout scores. However, limited to no-data exist on the&#xD;
      physiological and biochemical effects of mindfulness-based interventions on physician&#xD;
      burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second cluster of studies implemented lifestyle changes, more specifically, incentivized&#xD;
      exercise programs and nutritional counseling for burnout. However, studies examining the&#xD;
      effects of physical activity tended to be short in duration, of small magnitude, and lacked&#xD;
      adequate assessment of the physiological and biochemical effects of exercise on burnout [23].&#xD;
      Additionally, a significant lack of research on nutritional and dietary interventions in&#xD;
      physician burnout exist in the literature, despite the vitality of good nutrition in the&#xD;
      health and wellbeing of physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study intends to tackle the issue of physician burnout via a wide-lens&#xD;
      approach, integrating both mindfulness-based training and nutritional counseling in the&#xD;
      management of professional burnout. The effects of the interventions will be evaluated&#xD;
      through assessment of changes in physiological and biochemical parameters known to be&#xD;
      adversely affected in burnout, in addition to the standardized Professional Fulfillment&#xD;
      Inventory, at 3-6 months post-intervention.&#xD;
