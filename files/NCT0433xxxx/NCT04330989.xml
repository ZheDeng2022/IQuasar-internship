  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of two parallel, pilot randomized groups that will obtain preliminary&#xD;
      data about the the acceptability, fidelity, and clinical outcomes associated with a&#xD;
      multi-component adherence support strategy for HIV treatment and prevention among pregnant&#xD;
      and breastfeeding women. The study will take place in Lilongwe, Malawi.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the anticipated gains for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT)&#xD;
      programs are to be realized, adherence to antiretroviral regimens will be critical. To date,&#xD;
      however, there are few evidence-based approaches that are scalable and sustainable in busy,&#xD;
      programmatic settings where HIV burden is high. The study seeks to implement the&#xD;
      intervention, which includes patient-centered counseling and adherence supporter training,&#xD;
      for both HIV-positive (for antiretroviral therapy, or ART) and HIV-negative (for pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis, or PrEP) pregnant and breastfeeding women, thus providing a universal approach&#xD;
      to support PMTCT programs holistically. The study will enroll pregnant women 18 years of age&#xD;
      or older receiving antenatal care services at one of the designated study facilities. In&#xD;
      Group 1, the study will enroll 100 HIV-positive women who started (or re-started, after a 6&#xD;
      months or longer treatment interruption) a first-line ART regimen within the past 30 days. In&#xD;
      Group 2, the study will enroll 200 HIV-negative women willing to initiate and continue oral&#xD;
      PrEP, in the form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF-FTC), and who&#xD;
      report factors that place them at elevated risk for HIV acquisition.&#xD;

    <description>Integrated next step counseling: iNSC is a structured, patient-centered approach informed by motivational interviewing techniques, which aims to foster an environment for joint-problem solving in order that the participant may identify their individual needs to increase or sustain sexual health through biomedical and non-biomedical approaches. iNSC frames the counselling sessions as a non-judgmental discussion to explore the facilitators and challenges to sexual health and medication adherence.&#xD;
Adherence supporter training: Participants will be asked to identify a partner, family member, or friend to whom they are willing to disclose their HIV status (for HIV-positive women) or their intent to initiate PrEP (for HIV-negative women). Participants may also select a clinic-based peer to serve this adherence supporter role. Trainings will emphasize basic HIV knowledge, importance of antiretroviral adherence, potential drug side effects, and practical strategies for supporting adherence.</description>
