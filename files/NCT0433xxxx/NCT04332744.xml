  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-arm, phase II clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of talazoparib (PF-06944076) in combination with enzalutamide in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer (mHNPC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men age ≥ 18 years with high-volume mHNPC that are not candidates for curative intent and&#xD;
      have not received previous systemic treatment with any other agent for unresectable locally&#xD;
      advanced or mHNPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing ICF and confirm eligibility, patients will start treatment with enzalutamide in&#xD;
      addition to standard ADT. After 2 cycles of enzalutamide-containing regimen, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:2 ratio to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A - Enzalutamide 160 mg orally daily continuously; Cohort B - Enzalutamide 160 mg in&#xD;
      combination with talazoparib (PF-06944076) 0.5 mg, both orally daily and continuously in&#xD;
      28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In either arm, patients will be requested to continue ADT throughout trial participation&#xD;
      (unless surgical castration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified based on HR gene alterations (presence versus&#xD;
      absence/unknown) detected in the baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      period during which survival and at least the first two new anti-cancer therapies will be&#xD;
      collected every six months (± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product until&#xD;
      the end of study (EoS).&#xD;
