  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares three medical cooling devices for effectiveness of cooling the core of&#xD;
      non-shivering subjects. This relates to common protocols to cool patients experiencing&#xD;
      myocardial infarctions or stokes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Body core and brain cooling by 1-3°C has been used as an adjunct in treatment of stroke and&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Body surface cooling is simple and non-invasive however&#xD;
      this process is difficult to implement effectively because skin cooling stimulates shivering&#xD;
      heat production, a defense mechanism that protects the body core from cooling. It is&#xD;
      sometimes necessary to pharmacologically inhibit shivering in order to cool the body from&#xD;
      surface cooling strategies such as application of cold packs or cold water-perfused blankets&#xD;
      or pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two commercial cooling units that are currently used are: 1) the Blanketrol III with standard&#xD;
      Gel Pad (Gentherm Inc.); and 2) the Arctic Sun with hydrogel coated pads (Arctic Sun). A new&#xD;
      cooling attachment system has been developed for the Blanketrol III. The new Kool Kit&#xD;
      includes a head wrap, and a vest and lower body blanket. The effectiveness of the Kool Kit&#xD;
      has not been quantified or compared to the current two systems mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since shivering heat production attenuates core cooling, it must be eliminated in clinical or&#xD;
      research settings where core cooling effectiveness is the main dependent variable. Previous&#xD;
      studies from this laboratory (Laboratory for Exercise and Environmental Medicine) have used a&#xD;
      human model for severe hypothermia which meperidine (Demerol) is infused to inhibit&#xD;
      shivering. Under these conditions the primary core cooling capacity of a cooling system can&#xD;
      be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to evaluate the Tco cooling rate, in hospital treatment conditions,&#xD;
      [ambient temperature (Ta) = 22ºC] during surface cooling of non-shivering subjects with&#xD;
      either: 1) Blanketrol with Gel Pads; 2) Blanketrol with Kool Kit; or 3) an Arctic Sun cooling&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to compare the core cooling rates induced by three commercial surface cooling&#xD;
      devices in non-shivering subjects. Because of the increased total surface area of the cooling&#xD;
      pads and blankets, the investigators hypothesize that the Blanketrol with Kool Kit will have&#xD;
      a greater rate of core cooling than the other two cooling systems tested.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy adults, who answer &quot;No&quot; to all the questions on a Get Active Questionnaire&#xD;
             (GAQ) and the &quot;Medical Screening Questionnaire for Hypothermia Study'.&#xD;
