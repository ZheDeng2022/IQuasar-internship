    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare two surgical techniques for the treatment of the&#xD;
      mandibular bone atrophies: Dense PTFE titanium-reinforced membranes (Group A) versus Titanium&#xD;
      mesh covered with cross-linked collagen membranes (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the main purposes are to compare test and control regarding (i) the percentage of&#xD;
      post-operative complications (ii) the three-dimensional bone gain (iii) histological,&#xD;
      histomorphometrical and microCT outcomes (iv) perImplant bone loss and soft tissue&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the last 10 years, short- and long-term studies have demonstrated that GBR is a successful&#xD;
      and reliable technique for vertical and horizontal ridge augmentation. GBR can be achieved&#xD;
      with two different approaches: application of either a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)&#xD;
      titanium-reinforced membrane (i.e., a non-resorbable membrane) or a collagen membrane (i.e.,&#xD;
      a resorbable membrane). To achieve vertical bone augmentation, a resorbable membrane must be&#xD;
      supported by a space-making device, such as a titanium mesh (Ti mesh) or a titanium&#xD;
      osteosynthesis plate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of a barrier device is a technique-sensitive procedure that is not free of&#xD;
      complications. The main cause of GBR failure is related to early or late exposure of a&#xD;
      barrier device, leading to contamination and infection of the biomaterial, irreversibly&#xD;
      compromising bone regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate complication rates and vertical bone gain (VBG) after GBR with&#xD;
      dense PTFE titanium-reinforced membranes versus with titanium mesh covered with cross-linked&#xD;
      collagen membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is, therefore, the evaluation of the healing&#xD;
      complications; in particular, the early or delayed exposure of medical devices used for bone&#xD;
      regeneration, during the healing period. This exposure is, as reported in all clinical&#xD;
      studies, the main cause of the failure of the surgery. A secondary objective, is the&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of bone regeneration obtained by the 2 techniques. In particular, the&#xD;
      evaluation of the reconstructed bone volume (RBV) with respect to the planned bone volume&#xD;
      (PBV). Other targets include the qualitative evaluation of bone regeneration through&#xD;
      histological and histomorphometric analysis of the bone biopsies obtained at the moment that&#xD;
      the medical device is removed and finally the evaluation of the peri-implant bone resorption&#xD;
      will be conducted over time. This study was designed as a pilot, parallel-group,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, comparative clinical trial. The study was conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethical&#xD;
      Committee of the Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital (Prot. CMF 01/2013; number 30/2013/O/Disp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 40 patients with partial edentulism, associated with alveolar atrophy in&#xD;
      the posterior regions of the mandible, who were referred to the Unit of Oral and&#xD;
      Maxillofacial Surgery, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized into two study groups, depending on a previous computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence. Group A included 20 patients treated by means of a dense PTFE&#xD;
      (d-PTFE) titanium-reinforced membrane, and Group B included 20 patients treated by means of a&#xD;
      titanium mesh (Ti mesh) and cross-linked collagen membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 3 different treatment phases: the first phase (T0) involves bone&#xD;
      regeneration with Dense PTFE titanium-reinforced membranes (Group A) or Titanium mesh covered&#xD;
      with cross-linked collagen membranes (Group B) and simultaneous implants placement; the&#xD;
      second one (T1), subsequently, after 6 months, this will forsee the removal of the&#xD;
      regeneration devices; the third (T2), 3 months after the aforementioned, will forsee the&#xD;
      final functional loading of the implants, with a consequent follow-up of the regenerated&#xD;
      bone. All the materials and tools used in the study are CE certified and have already been&#xD;
      used in the normal care path for patients who have undergone bone regeneration. Moreover, the&#xD;
      control visits and the radiological investigations of the data were summarized in the case&#xD;
      report form (CRF), and are those that characterize the normal care path of patients&#xD;
      undergoing necessary bone regeneration for prosthetic implant rehabilitation when the bone&#xD;
      quantity is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of group B (Ti mesh)&#xD;
      compared to technique A (d-PTFE membrane) in the incidence of complications. The Secondary&#xD;
      objectives include: assessment of reconstructed bone volume (RBV) compared to planned bone&#xD;
      volume (PBV), histological and histomorphometric analysis of bone quality obtained and&#xD;
      periimplant bone resorption after 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation showed that with a minimum of 17 patients per group (total of 34&#xD;
      patients), it will be possible to detect a 35% difference in complications and a difference&#xD;
      of 1 mm in VBG between the two groups with a standard deviation a=1 and a significance level&#xD;
      of a = 0.05 with a power of 80%. To protect from possible drop-outs, the sample size was&#xD;
      increased by to 20 patients per group (total of 40 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained in the two study groups (Groups A and B) were subjected to statistical&#xD;
      description and analyses using specific tests to determine statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between them. Both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations were&#xD;
      analyzed. The patient was regarded as the statistical unit of analysis for all analyses,&#xD;
      except that of implant stability, which was carried out considering the implant as the&#xD;
      statistical unit. Statistical differences in complication rates were investigated using&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. Differences in implant stability, peri-implant bone defects, and VBG at&#xD;
      T0 and T1 were investigated using t-tests for unpaired data. Statistical significance was set&#xD;
      at α = 0.05. The statistician was blinded and external to working group.&#xD;

The former complications are classified as:&#xD;
Class A, including flap damage (soft tissue perforation or laceration)&#xD;
Class B, including neurological damage (paresthesia or disesthesia)&#xD;
Class C,including vascular damage (hemorrhage). The latter complications are divided into four classes, according to the presence and extent of exposure, as well as the presence of a purulent exudate:&#xD;
