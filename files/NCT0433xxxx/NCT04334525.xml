  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restaurants are normative eating contexts for many families. Restaurant meals tend to be&#xD;
      higher in calories and lower in nutritional quality than those prepared at home. Targeting&#xD;
      children's food selection in restaurants has the potential to improve diet quality, attenuate&#xD;
      excess energy intake, and shape healthy habits. The objective of this study is to make&#xD;
      healthier kids' meal options more appealing and easier to choose via an in-restaurant&#xD;
      intervention that combines repeated exposure and choice architecture strategies. Six&#xD;
      locations of a quick-service restaurant will be paired based on income levels in the&#xD;
      surrounding census tracts. A location from each pair will be randomized to each study group&#xD;
      (intervention, control). Recruitment and data collection will be conducted across 3 cohorts,&#xD;
      with recruitment conducted during a family's regular visit. Study participation will involve&#xD;
      7 more visits to the location where the family was recruited, 6 of which will be during an&#xD;
      exposure period of about 2 months. Families in intervention restaurants will receive&#xD;
      placemats promoting healthier featured kids' meals. Participating families will also receive&#xD;
      a frequent diner card which, after purchasing one of the featured healthier kids' meals&#xD;
      across 6 occasions, makes them eligible for a free kids' meal of their choice during a&#xD;
      predetermined redemption period. In the control group, generic placemats will be provided,&#xD;
      and participating families will be provided with frequent diner cards that can be used for&#xD;
      any kids' meals. The aims of this study are: (1) to test effects of a healthier kids' meal&#xD;
      intervention on children's meal orders, and (2) to test effects of a healthier kids' meal&#xD;
      intervention on children's dietary intake. It is hypothesized that (1a) children in the&#xD;
      intervention restaurants will be more likely than controls to select one of the promoted&#xD;
      healthier kids' meals at post-test, (1b) children in the intervention group will order fewer&#xD;
      calories and desserts and less saturated fat, sodium, and sugar at post-test versus controls,&#xD;
      (1c) the promoted healthier meals will make up a greater percentage of kids' meals ordered in&#xD;
      intervention restaurants versus controls, based on sales data across the study period, and&#xD;
      (2) compared to controls, children in the intervention group will consume fewer calories and&#xD;
      less saturated fat, sodium, and sugar in the restaurant at post-test.&#xD;

      Restaurants are normative eating contexts for many families. Restaurant meals tend to be&#xD;
      higher in calories and lower in nutritional quality than those prepared at home. Targeting&#xD;
      children's food selection in restaurants has the potential to improve diet quality, attenuate&#xD;
      excess energy intake, and shape healthy habits. The objective of this study is to make&#xD;
      healthier kids' meal options more appealing and easier to choose via an in-restaurant&#xD;
      intervention that combines repeated exposure and choice architecture strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six locations of a quick-service restaurant will be paired based on income levels in the&#xD;
      surrounding census tracts. A location from each pair will be randomized to each study group&#xD;
      (intervention, control). Recruitment and data collection will be conducted across 3 cohorts.&#xD;
      After recruitment, families will be asked to order and eat like they normally would. All&#xD;
      participating families will then complete measures of children's orders, intake, and&#xD;
      demographics. Then families will receive placemats and frequent diner cards. Families in&#xD;
      intervention restaurants will receive placemats promoting healthier featured kids' meals.&#xD;
      These families will also receive a frequent diner card, which after purchasing one of the&#xD;
      featured healthier kids' meals across 6 occasions, makes them eligible for a free kids' meal&#xD;
      of their choice during a predetermined redemption period. In the control group, generic&#xD;
      placemats will be provided following baseline data collection, and families will also be&#xD;
      provided with frequent diner cards that can be used for any kids' meals. During subsequent&#xD;
      exposure periods, lasting about 2 months per cohort, families will return to the restaurant&#xD;
      location where they were recruited on a weekly basis. Placemats will be available at the&#xD;
      restaurant entrance, and corresponding signage will be displayed in the restaurant. In&#xD;
      intervention restaurants, signs will advertise promoted meals and the option to select a toy&#xD;
      in place of dessert. Participating children will be able to use their frequent diner card&#xD;
      during this time to earn a free meal during the subsequent redemption period. Families will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete a brief online survey once per week to monitor restaurant&#xD;
      patronage. In each restaurant, study staff will conduct observations of a subsample of&#xD;
      participating family and server interactions. Finally, post assessments will be completed&#xD;
      during predetermined redemption periods, lasting about 3 months per cohort. Placemats and&#xD;
      signage will still be available in restaurants during this time. Study staff will collect the&#xD;
      frequent diner cards and ask families to order and eat like they normally would and to not&#xD;
      throw out any food or leftovers. Families will be able to redeem any earned free kids' meals&#xD;
      during this time. When the family is done eating, study staff will approach the table to&#xD;
      administer study measures assessing orders, perspectives on the meal, and intake. Finally,&#xD;
      families will also be prompted to complete an online dietary recall (ASA24) after their post&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are: (1) to test effects of a healthier kids' meal&#xD;
      intervention on children's meal orders, and (2) to test effects of a healthier kids' meal&#xD;
      intervention on children's dietary intake. It is hypothesized that (1a) children in the&#xD;
      intervention restaurants will be more likely than controls to select one of the promoted&#xD;
      healthier kids' meals at post-test, (1b) children in the intervention group will order fewer&#xD;
      calories and desserts and less saturated fat, sodium, and sugar at post-test versus controls,&#xD;
      (1c) the promoted healthier meals will make up a greater percentage of kids' meals ordered in&#xD;
      intervention restaurants versus controls, based on sales data across the study period, and&#xD;
      (2) compared to controls, children in the intervention group will consume fewer calories and&#xD;
      less saturated fat, sodium, and sugar in the restaurant at post-test.&#xD;
