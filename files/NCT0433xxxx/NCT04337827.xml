  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective rituximab and acalabrutinib are when&#xD;
      given as a combination treatment for newly diagnosed B cell post transplant&#xD;
      lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Currently there is no approved therapy for PTLD.&#xD;
      Rituximab alone is commonly used and works in some cases, but not others. In addition,&#xD;
      participants with PTLD have trouble tolerating therapies with large amounts of side effects&#xD;
      due to their health conditions and medications for their transplant. Due to these reasons the&#xD;
      study team is looking for a new treatment with novel targeted agents in order to improve&#xD;
      outcomes and to minimize toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on emerging data of clinical efficacy of acalabrutinib in B cell malignancies and an&#xD;
      unmet need for novel therapies in PTLD, this study will investigate the use of rituximab and&#xD;
      acalabrutinib in participants with newly diagnosed B cell PTLD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized phase II study of acalabrutinib plus rituximab in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      B-cell PTLD in participants with both solid organ transplant (SOT) and Bone marrow transplant&#xD;
      (BMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK is important in B cells&#xD;
      and plays a role in the development of PTLD. Acalabrutinib is approved in the US for the&#xD;
      treatment of adult participants with indolent lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and is being&#xD;
      evaluated to treat other lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rituximab has been approved for treatment of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). While not&#xD;
      approved for PTLD, it has become the mainstay of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate to combination&#xD;
      treatment with rituximab and acalabrutinib in patients with PTLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study is to determine response rates, survival, failure&#xD;
      rates, and safety elements in participants with PTLD treated with combination rituximab and&#xD;
      acalabrutinib.&#xD;

             (anti-HBc) positive and who are surface antigen negative will need to have a negative&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg)&#xD;
             positive or hepatitis B PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects who are hepatitis C&#xD;

             infant. Rituximab can cross the placenta and is found in breast milk. Acalabrutinib&#xD;
             has been found in the breast milk of animals and there is not significant data&#xD;
             regarding its effect during pregnancy.&#xD;
