      Introduction: childhood tuberculosis continues to be a major public health problem, despite&#xD;
      the fact that the visibility of the epidemic in this population group has increased, studies&#xD;
      are still lacking that can resolve the gaps that persist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To design, implement and evaluate an integrated care strategy for children under&#xD;
      five years old household contacts of patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in&#xD;
      Medellín and the Metropolitan Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: quasi-experimental study, in which around 300 children household contacts of&#xD;
      patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis from Medellín and the Metropolitan Area&#xD;
      will be evaluated, who will be recruited in a period of one year. A subgroup of these&#xD;
      children, estimated at 85, who require treatment for latent tuberculosis, will be offered to&#xD;
      receive treatment for latent tuberculosis under a integrated care strategy that includes some&#xD;
      modifications to the currently standardized scheme in Colombia, with rifampicin treatment&#xD;
      daily oral route for four months, follow-up under the project scheme with the availability of&#xD;
      a nurse, general practitioner, specialists, care by professionals from other disciplines such&#xD;
      as social work, psychology, and nutritionist, and the provision of incentives (transport and&#xD;
      food assistance). This strategy will be compared with isoniazid treatment according to the&#xD;
      standardized scheme in the country, which was received by a cohort of children between 2015&#xD;
      and 2018. The study has the CIB Research Ethics Committee approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: this project is expected to contribute with greater local evidence of&#xD;
      integrated care strategies that allow greater compliance with treatment for latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis in children, so that there is a real impact in the control of childhood&#xD;
      tuberculosis and in the reduction of tuberculosis reservoirs in order to achieve the goals&#xD;
      proposed by the World Health Organization's End TB Strategy.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To design, implement and evaluate an integrated care strategy for children under five years&#xD;
      old household contacts of patients with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis in Medellín and&#xD;
      the Metropolitan Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quasi-experimental study with a one-year follow-up, which will include a cohort of children&#xD;
      household contacts of patients with smear positive pulmonary TB from Medellín and the Valle&#xD;
      de Aburrá Metropolitan Area, to carry out the contact tracing and treatment for latent TB in&#xD;
      those who is indicated, and who will receive the intervention of the integrated care&#xD;
      strategy. Compliance with the treatment achieved with this strategy will be compared with&#xD;
      compliance achieved with the treatment with isoniazid in the 2015-2018 cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrated care strategy for contact children of patients with smear positive pulmonary&#xD;
      TB will have the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic tests (TST, IGRAS, standardized chest x-ray, gastric aspirate, induced&#xD;
           sputum, smear microscopy, culture in solid and liquid media, Xpert Ultra MTB/RIF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Staff: Nursing assistant, General practitioner, Specialist (pediatrician, ID specialist,&#xD;
           radiologist), Other disciplines (nutritionist, psychology, social worker).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supply of scheme treatment with daily rifampicin for four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provision of social assistance and/or incentives (transport, food assistance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-centered care based on primary health care (active monitoring, permanent&#xD;
           education and contact, among others).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of treatment compliance for latent TB in contact children of patients with&#xD;
      smear positive pulmonary TB in Medellín and the Metropolitan Area who receive the integrated&#xD;
      care strategy is greater than the proportion of treatment compliance for children who&#xD;
      received isoniazid in the 2015-2018 cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: the sample will be children under five years old household contacts of patients with&#xD;
      smear positive confirmed pulmonary TB from Medellín and the Metropolitan Area notified to the&#xD;
      surveillance system during 2020, in whom treatment for latent TB is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling type: it will correspond to an Incidental Sampling, since the children of the study&#xD;
      will be recruited as new cases (incidents) of smear positive confirmed pulmonary TB&#xD;
      identified in Medellín and the Metropolitan Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: all children household contacts of smear positive pulmonary TB patients from&#xD;
      Medellín and the Metropolitan Area will be follow-up initially for a period of one year,&#xD;
      according to previous studies it is estimated that around 250 to 300 children will be&#xD;
      assessed with a proportion of estimated infection of 73.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complete intervention of the integrated care strategy (with medication, incentives and&#xD;
      active follow-up) will be provided to a subgroup of children who require treatment for latent&#xD;
      tuberculosis, and who will also be selected incidentally, according to their willingness to&#xD;
      participate. To calculate the sample size of this subgroup, compliance with the treatment&#xD;
      with isoniazid in the 2015-2018 cohort of 59% was considered, hoping that the proposed&#xD;
      strategy achieves at least 80% of compliance (expected goal), with a confidence level of 95%&#xD;
      and a power of 80%, it is estimated that a group of at least 75 children will be required in&#xD;
      the proposed comprehensive care strategy (sample size calculated with Epidat version 4.2), an&#xD;
      additional 10% will be estimated due to loss to follow-up, so the total number of children to&#xD;
      enter the integrated care strategy will be 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be the integrated care strategy, in which the effects of interventions&#xD;
      established in the regulations of the TB program at the national level will be observed, such&#xD;
      as the diagnosis and administration of treatment for latent TB in children household contacts&#xD;
      of patients with pulmonary TB, with two main modifications, the supply of daily oral&#xD;
      rifampicin for four months self-administered scheme (instead of daily oral isoniazid for nine&#xD;
      months self-administered scheme), and provision of incentives such as transport and food&#xD;
      assistance (monthly food supplies). In addition to this, immune response tests will be&#xD;
      performed measuring interferon gamma production levels (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus - QFT Plus&#xD;
      test) and tuberculin skin test (TST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardization of the personnel that will participate in the study will be carried out&#xD;
           both in data collection and in clinical assessment and information processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children recruitment: children will be recruited through contact with the tuberculosis&#xD;
           control program of the Health Authorities of Medellín, and other municipalities in the&#xD;
           Metropolitan Area that agreed to participate, which will immediately supply their&#xD;
           information on children under five years old household contacts of pulmonary TB patients&#xD;
           recruited by the program through epidemiological visits to the homes of patients with&#xD;
           pulmonary tuberculosis recently diagnosed and reported to the program. The staff of the&#xD;
           health authorities will request authorization from those responsible for the children to&#xD;
           share the information with the study staff. Additionally, the staff of the health&#xD;
           authorities will support in socializing the project to promote the participation of&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By telephone contact, it will start the informed consent process to participate in the&#xD;
           study to the parents or guardians of children under five years old identified as&#xD;
           household contacts of smear positive confirmed TB patients from the municipalities of&#xD;
           Medellín and the Metropolitan Area, that meet the inclusion criteria and that do not&#xD;
           have exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  According to what was previously found, the first two information collection formats&#xD;
           will be filled in by telephone with the variables corresponding to the index case&#xD;
           (person with TB of whom the child under five years old is contact) and some variables&#xD;
           corresponding to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the same phone call, an appointment will be assigned, during which the doctor&#xD;
           will carry out the basic clinical assessment with a complete physical examination, tests&#xD;
           for latent TB will be performed. Trained health personnel will apply tuberculin and take&#xD;
           the reading at 72 hours, previously taking a blood sample (5 ml sample of blood taken&#xD;
           through a puncture in the vein) for evaluation of interferon gamma production in&#xD;
           response to CFP-10, ESAT-6 and PHA antigens (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus-QFT Plus test),&#xD;
           as well as biomarker determination. This last test will also be performed on a urine&#xD;
           sample. A radiological chest study will be performed to rule out active disease with a&#xD;
           standardized reading. The first children with criteria for treatment for latent TB will&#xD;
           be invited to participate in the integrated care strategy, in which they will receive&#xD;
           care from the project by Nursing Assistant, General Practitioner, Specialists&#xD;
           (pediatrician, ID specialist, child radiologist), Other disciplines (nutritionist,&#xD;
           psychology, social worker), Treatment provision scheme with daily rifampicin for four&#xD;
           months, Supply of social assistance and / or incentives (transport, food assistance),&#xD;
           Patient-centered care based on primary health care (active monitoring, education and&#xD;
           permanent contact, among others).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with clinical and / or radiological criteria for active TB during the year of&#xD;
           follow-up and uptake will receive studies to confirm the diagnosis of active TB, taking&#xD;
           samples of induced sputum (two samples) and aspirating gastric juice (two samples) with&#xD;
           smear, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra test, and culture in solid and liquid media to the collected&#xD;
           samples. Stool and urine samples will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who receive treatment for latent TB under the integrated care strategy will&#xD;
           have a monthly clinical assessment during the period they receive the medication, to&#xD;
           detect side effects, observe compliance with the treatment, identify the development of&#xD;
           active disease (in those who present respiratory symptoms will be performed the same&#xD;
           tests as in children with suspected initial active TB). Liver function tests will be&#xD;
           performed after two months of treatment to detect liver adverse effects. Biomarkers will&#xD;
           also be measured in a blood sample, as well as in urine. At the end of the treatment, a&#xD;
           blood biomarker study will be performed again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be assessed at CIB medical office for clinical and epidemiological conditions&#xD;
      and to rule out the diagnosis of tuberculosis and confirm the diagnosis of latent TB; in&#xD;
      those who enter the integrated care strategy, treatment compliance and side effects will be&#xD;
      assessed, with a clinical assessment at the time of intake, monthly while receiving&#xD;
      medication (rifampin four months) and 12 months after the initial assessment; immune response&#xD;
      (TST and IGRA) at baseline will also be evaluated; as defined in the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest radiography (including standardized reading) and sampling of induced sputum and gastric&#xD;
      juice aspirate will be performed at the Pablo Tobón Uribe Hospital, the samples will be&#xD;
      processed at the Corporation for Biological Research (CIB). Liver function tests will be&#xD;
      taken at CIB, and processed in Laboratorio Echavarría.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis To describe the characteristics of children's exposure to TB, a univariate&#xD;
      analysis will be carried out, which will include the variables corresponding to the index&#xD;
      case, the child's exposure, and other epidemiological variables. Frequencies distribution and&#xD;
      proportions estimation will be carried out for the qualitative variables such as sex,&#xD;
      socioeconomic stratum, system of affiliation to the social security system in health, history&#xD;
      of BCG vaccination, bacteriological study and other variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the children in the 2015-2018 and 2020-2022 cohort will be compared&#xD;
      using the Z test for the difference in proportions for the qualitative variables and using&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney U test for the quantitative variables according to the normality of those&#xD;
      variables estimated with the Shapiro Wilk test. The characteristics of the index cases and&#xD;
      the characteristics of the children household contacts will be analyzed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis, a univariate analysis will be&#xD;
      carried out. The proportion of response to the TST will be calculated according to categories&#xD;
      in &lt;5 mm, between 5 and 10 mm and ≥10 mm, and the prevalence of positive response with cutoff&#xD;
      point ≥5 mm. Proportion of interferon gamma production (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus - QFT Plus)&#xD;
      will be calculated according to the categories of positive and negative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total agreement between the two immunological tests will be analyzed, as well as the&#xD;
      different possibilities of discordance. The kappa index will also be calculated. The&#xD;
      prevalence ratio of TST ≥5 mm and / or positive QFT will be calculated, and a bivariate&#xD;
      analysis will be made with the characteristics of exposure to TB in children, adjusting for&#xD;
      the index case cluster using Poisson regression. Subsequently, the multivariate analysis will&#xD;
      be performed adjusting for the variables that met the Hosmer-Lemeshow criterion in the&#xD;
      bivariate analysis (p-value &lt;0.25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A description of the characteristics of the treatment for latent TB will be made, a&#xD;
      univariate analysis of the characteristics of the treatment for latent TB will be made, by&#xD;
      estimating proportions, the qualitative variables related to the characteristics of the&#xD;
      administration of the treatment, side effects (appearance of symptoms such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal or allergic) and treatment compliance (temporary or permanent suspension,&#xD;
      cause of treatment suspension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in treatment compliance proportions between the 2015-2018 and 2020-2022&#xD;
      cohorts will be calculated, with 95% confidence.&#xD;
