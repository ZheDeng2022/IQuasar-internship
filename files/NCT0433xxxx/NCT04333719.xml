  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This nation-wide, multicentric, prospective and cross-sectional study aims to estimate the&#xD;
      prevalence of deep sedations (i.e. with a -4 or -5 score at the Richmond scale at the&#xD;
      induction time) for patients in terminal phase and receiving cares from a specialized&#xD;
      palliative care facility (palliative care units, dedicated beds in acute units, mobile teams&#xD;
      for inpatient or outpatients or home-based structures) in France.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inducing a deep sedation in palliative care is a sensitive practice. The abolition of the&#xD;
      communication in a crucial moment of life for the patients is particularly challenging. This&#xD;
      practice implies particular experiences for families and caregivers, often increased by the&#xD;
      deepness of the sedation. In France, the Claeys-Leonetti law has added additional indications&#xD;
      of deep sedation. The lack of data on the prevalence of this practice in palliative care&#xD;
      complicates the implementation of research projects and the improvement of professionals&#xD;
      skills. In existing literature, the proportions of patients thus sedated varied from 2.5 to&#xD;
      14.5%. To our knowledge, no study on the prevalence of deep sedative practices in terminal&#xD;
      diseases has been carried out in France. This observational study will help to better&#xD;
      understand the real importance of this practice among each palliative care structures. They&#xD;
      will also serve to build research projects on this theme supporting improvement of care for&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the deep sedation is defined as a sedation directly inducing from the&#xD;
      induction time a score of -4 or -5 at the Richmond vigilance scale (or a clinically&#xD;
      equivalent state for the investigator) as defined by the French society of palliative care&#xD;
      and accompanying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of inclusion, the investigator will collect the information about the structure of&#xD;
      palliative care (type, team composition, number of patients with an on-going terminal&#xD;
      disease), the characteristics of the sedated patient(s) (age, disease, treatments) and of the&#xD;
      sedation (sedative molecules, assessment of vigilance, consents and decision-making process).&#xD;
      In case of an on-going sedation previously initiated but still in progress the day of&#xD;
      inclusion, the investigator will retrospectively collect the required data.&#xD;
