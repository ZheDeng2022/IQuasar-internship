      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related macular degeneration is a common eye disease in people over 50. The &quot;dry&quot; form of&#xD;
      the disease can worsen into geographic atrophy, causing blind spots. Researchers want to&#xD;
      learn if replacing older eye cells with younger ones can help treat this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of putting cells inside the eye as a possible future treatment for dry&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 55 and older who have geographic atrophy with loss of vision. People who have had&#xD;
      &quot;wet&quot; macular degeneration in either eye are NOT eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye photos&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography. An intravenous (IV) line is placed in an arm vein. A dye is&#xD;
           injected. A camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the eyes' blood&#xD;
           vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinography. An electrode is taped to participants' forehead. They sit in the&#xD;
           dark. After 30 minutes, numbing eye drops and contact lenses are placed in their eyes.&#xD;
           They watch flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tuberculosis test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiography. Sticky pads are placed on participants' chest to record the heart's&#xD;
           electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 14 study visits over 5 and a half years. They will repeat&#xD;
      screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation surgery in one eye.&#xD;
      For this, cells from participants' blood are turned into RPE cells. These cells are placed in&#xD;
      their eye through a cut in their retina. They will get dilating eye drops, an IV line, and&#xD;
      anesthesia that may make them sleep. A gas bubble will be put in their eye to help it heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted yearly for up to 15 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly.&#xD;
      There is no treatment for geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced stage of dry AMD, in which&#xD;
      cells of the neurosensory retina and associated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) gradually&#xD;
      degenerate and die. Advances in stem cell biology allowing differentiation of pluripotent&#xD;
      cells into RPE in vitro make feasible a cell-based strategy for potential treatment of AMD,&#xD;
      and recent methods for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation offer promise of&#xD;
      individualized autologous] therapy. Such an approach involves generation of iPSC from somatic&#xD;
      cells taken from a patient with GA, differentiation of iPSC into RPE grown as a monolayer on&#xD;
      a thin scaffold in vitro, and transplantation of the RPE/scaffold construct into a small&#xD;
      region in the subretinal space of the same patient, with a goal of rescuing the overlying&#xD;
      neurosensory retina from further degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of subretinal transplantation of&#xD;
      iPSC-derived RPE, grown as a monolayer on a biodegradable poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)&#xD;
      scaffold, as a potential autologous cell-based therapy for GA associated with AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Five participants will undergo RPE transplantation in one eye. Eligible&#xD;
      eyes will have GA, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 20/100 and 20/500, and a&#xD;
      fellow eye that has same or better BCVA. If the National Eye Institute (NEI) Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (DSMC) gives clearance to proceed based on review of data from the first&#xD;
      cohort, a second cohort of up to seven additional participants with GA, BCVA between 20/80&#xD;
      and 20/500 in the eye being considered for RPE transplantation, and same or better visual&#xD;
      acuity in the other eye may undergo the procedure to gather additional safety and potential&#xD;
      efficacy data useful for planning future studies. Up to 20 participants may be enrolled to&#xD;
      allow for screening failures or for participants withdrawing from the study prior to RPE&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this phase I/IIa, prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical trial,&#xD;
      participants will undergo subretinal transplantation of autologous iPSC-derived RPE in one&#xD;
      eye and will be followed for five years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the safety of RPE/PLGA transplantation, as&#xD;
      determined by assessment of visual acuity change and summary of adverse events at 12 months&#xD;
      after RPE/PLGA transplantation. Secondary outcome measures include visual acuity change and&#xD;
      adverse event reporting at 24 and 60 months, and changes in the following at 12, 24 and 60&#xD;
      months as compared with baseline, assessed in the transplanted region, and compared where&#xD;
      applicable with other areas in the macula, and/or with corresponding regions in the fellow&#xD;
      eye: retinal sensitivity and fixation parameters assessed by microperimetry; multifocal&#xD;
      electroretinography (ERG) responses; macular structure on cross-sectional and en face imaging&#xD;
      by optical coherence tomography (OCT); macular features on color, single-wavelength&#xD;
      reflectance, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography; and fluorescein angiography (FA).&#xD;
      Some participants may undergo imaging of photoreceptor/RPE features using&#xD;
      adaptive-optics-assisted macular imaging under a separate protocol (e.g., 15-EI-0020).&#xD;

             must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using&#xD;
             Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing. (Note: Letter scores within five or fewer&#xD;
             letters of each other are accordingly considered equal for eligibility determination,&#xD;
             and other factors may be used to select the study eye if both are eligible by BCVA.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants in the second cohort, the study eye must have an ETDRS best-corrected&#xD;
             visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of less than or equal to 58 and greater than or&#xD;

             must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using&#xD;
             Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing. (Note: Letter scores within five or fewer&#xD;
             letters of each other are accordingly considered equal for eligibility determination,&#xD;
             and other factors may be used to select the study eye if both are eligible by BCVA.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The compromise in visual acuity for the study eye must be judged predominantly&#xD;
             secondary to dry AMD, in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye must have clarity of ocular media and degree of pupil dilation&#xD;
             sufficient to permit adequate fundus photography and safe vitrectomy surgery.&#xD;
