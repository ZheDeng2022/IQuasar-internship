    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best assistance level of an exoskeleton&#xD;
      footwear (EF) that can assist walking for people older than 40 with and without peripheral&#xD;
      artery disease (PAD). The test will be performed on two different groups of people for this&#xD;
      study that include: 1) people with PAD, and 2) individuals who don't have PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from 50 healthy older individuals and 25 patients with PAD, both&#xD;
      groups will be 40 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait biomechanics, muscle oxygenation, and energy cost for seven different walking conditions&#xD;
      including normal walking, walking with EF with no assistance, and walking with EF with 5&#xD;
      different levels of assistance will be collected from the healthy older individuals.&#xD;
      Additionally, subject-reported outcomes after each walking conditions including perceived&#xD;
      comfort and fatigue, rate of perceived exertion and feasibility of the EF will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait biomechanics, muscle oxygenation, energy cost, and patient-reported outcomes will be&#xD;
      measured in patients with PAD for four walking conditions including normal walking, walking&#xD;
      with EF but no assistance, walking with EF with the best two assistance levels. Subjects will&#xD;
      be allowed to acclimate to the EF prior to recording data. All patients with PAD will&#xD;
      participate in feasibility interviews that will assess acceptability, demand, implementation,&#xD;
      and practicality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to fill out questionnaires that assess quality of life, physical&#xD;
      function, and the ability to complete activities of daily living.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Claudication due to peripheral artery disease (PAD) causes patients to walk less and slower,&#xD;
      lose independence in daily living activities, and be sedentary compared to their healthy&#xD;
      counterparts. The investigators' research has identified functional limitations in the&#xD;
      walking patterns of claudicating patients. The most prominent and consistent deficit is of&#xD;
      the posterior calf muscles, the ankle plantarflexors, to generate healthy ankle torque and&#xD;
      power during walking. Previous work in the investigators' laboratory has established that&#xD;
      these functional deficits are related to the presence of a myopathy in the legs of patients&#xD;
      with PAD which is characterized by myofiber degeneration and muscle fibrosis. An intervention&#xD;
      that compensates for impaired muscle physiology and performance is needed to improve walking&#xD;
      ability and independence in patients with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this project is to improve the quality of life of patients with PAD by&#xD;
      using assistive exoskeletons. Currently, there is a critical treatment gap for those patients&#xD;
      with PAD whose disease presentation does not warrant operative revascularization (based on&#xD;
      risk-benefit analysis that considers multiple factors including disease severity, comorbid&#xD;
      conditions and operative risk), but who desire to regain their walking ability and&#xD;
      independence. Ankle-foot orthoses have recently been implemented to reduce the demands for&#xD;
      biological ankle plantarflexor torque and to compensate for power deficiency. Biological&#xD;
      ankle torque/power is torque/power generated by the plantarflexor muscles apart from that&#xD;
      provided by an assistive device. The investigators have developed a lightweight and low-cost&#xD;
      3D printable elastic exoskeleton and footwear combination called exoskeleton footwear (EF).&#xD;
      The EF assists with push-off by using springs that mimic ankle plantarflexor forces.&#xD;
      Exoskeletons that assist propulsion address both the myopathy and low blood flow problems&#xD;
      associated with claudication. Mechanical force from the EF compensates for insufficient&#xD;
      muscle propulsion force, while decreasing blood flow demand and the muscular stress caused by&#xD;
      ischemia. A properly designed exoskeleton will likely allow patients with PAD to walk longer&#xD;
      without pain or walk the distance needed for completing daily activities with less stress to&#xD;
      the affected leg. As a first step the investigators propose to determine the effect of EF on&#xD;
      walking performance, focusing on how different levels of EF support contribute to changes in&#xD;
      the biological ankle torque and power, energy cost, and calf muscle oxygenation. The&#xD;
      investigators will test healthy older adults to ensure and confirm comfort, low risk of&#xD;
      injury to the foot and calf, and high potential for device adoption in patients with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EF will then be evaluated in patients with PAD. Healthy older individuals are selected&#xD;
      for the initial phase of the project because, like patients with PAD, they produce less&#xD;
      push-off torque and power during walking compared with healthy young; making them an&#xD;
      appropriate model for PAD limitations. Furthermore, compared to patients with PAD, healthy&#xD;
      older can tolerate longer walking trials, which are necessary to identify effective device&#xD;
      parameters and also have a significantly lower risk of developing foot and calf injuries&#xD;
      while the comfort and shape of the EF are assessed and adjusted to accommodate individuals&#xD;
      with different foot and leg morphologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Walking performance will improve with EF in healthy older and patients with PAD.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize there will be an EF assistance level to satisfy&#xD;
      subject-reported preference and walking performance goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the levels of EF assistance force which produce better walking&#xD;
      performance in older subjects. Improvements in walking performance will be assessed by&#xD;
      measuring how different levels of EF assistance contribute to changes in the biological ankle&#xD;
      torque and power during push-off, the energy cost of walking, and the calf muscle oxygenation&#xD;
      during walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the levels of EF assistance force which produce better&#xD;
      subject-reported preference in older subjects. Preference will be measured using&#xD;
      visual-analog scales, perceived exertion and pain questionnaires, and interview-style surveys&#xD;
      about acceptability (satisfaction, intent to use), demand (perceived demand), and&#xD;
      practicality (effects, ability of participants to use EF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the effect of EF assistance levels on walking performance and&#xD;
      subject-reported preference in patients with PAD. Results from Aims 1 and 2 will guide the&#xD;
      assistance levels tested in this aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods Healthy elderly will be evaluated in a total of seven conditions&#xD;
      in Aims #1 and #2: five different EF stiffness levels including EF: Stiffness 1 (5.6 kN/m),&#xD;
      EF Stiffness 2 (7.9 kN/m), EF Stiffness 3 (10.5 kN/m), EF Stiffness 4 (13.3 kN/m), EF&#xD;
      Stiffness 5 (17.2 kN/m), EF with a disengaged spring and one normal walking condition (no&#xD;
      EF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAD patients will be evaluated in four conditions in Aim #3: two different EF stiffness&#xD;
      levels, one condition in which the subjects will wear the EF with a disengaged spring and one&#xD;
      normal walking condition (no EF). Spring stiffness will be adjusted as a function of body&#xD;
      mass to provide a normalized torque input across subjects. These stiffness levels were chosen&#xD;
      based on previous research work using a similar, device in healthy young individuals. The EF&#xD;
      will be set to release the spring at 42% of the stride. Increases in energy cost at stiffness&#xD;
      values above and below the optimal value will be an indicator the stiffness levels are within&#xD;
      the appropriate scale. Healthy older adults and patients with PAD will be tested to determine&#xD;
      the effect of EF assistance force on walking performance and energy cost and subject-reported&#xD;
      preference with varying EF assistance levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 adults, ages 50 years and older from the Nebraska and Western Iowa Veterans&#xD;
      Affairs' Medical Center (VAMC) and the surrounding Omaha community to complete Aims 1 and 2&#xD;
      will be recruited. Aim 3 will include 25 patients with PAD recruited from the VAMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Protocol for Aims #1 and #2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking: Subjects will complete seven minutes of walking at their preferred walking speed on&#xD;
      an instrumented treadmill (AMTI, Watertown, MA) while kinetics and kinematics are captured at&#xD;
      100 Hz with a 17 camera digital motion capture system (Cortex 6.2, Motion Analysis Corp,&#xD;
      Santa Rosa, CA). The three minutes of walking will be for subjects to get accustomed to the&#xD;
      new assistance level in the EF. Preferred walking speed will be determined prior to&#xD;
      collecting any data and it will be held consistent across the seven conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will also walk on flat ground for seven different conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Oxygenation: Bilateral gastrocnemius muscle oxygenation (StO2) will be measured using&#xD;
      continuous-wave near infrared spectroscopy (PortaMon, Artinis Medical System, Netherlands)&#xD;
      before, during and after each treadmill walking condition (described above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy cost: A portable metabolic cart will be used to measure gas exchange on a&#xD;
      breath-by-breath basis, providing a measure of oxygen consumption during each of the seven&#xD;
      treadmill walking conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived comfort and fatigue: A visual analog scale will be used to capture subjects'&#xD;
      perception of comfort and fatigue after each treadmill and flat ground condition. The visual&#xD;
      analog scale will range from 0 (low comfort; high fatigue) to 10 (high comfort; low fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of perceived exertion: Self-reported perceived exertion values from the Borg Rate of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion scale (6 (no exertion) to 20 (maximal exertion)) will be recorded after&#xD;
      each condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Protocol for Aims #3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking performance and subject-reported preference will be assessed in the same manner as in&#xD;
      Aims 1 and 2 except the treadmill walking test will be replaced with maximum walking distance&#xD;
      tests (see description below). For this reason, testing will be divided into two days, with&#xD;
      two maximum walking distances tests completed on each day. Subjects will rest until any&#xD;
      claudication pain subsides between each maximum walking distance tests. Subjects will&#xD;
      complete testing of the same outcomes (1-7 below) exactly as described in Aims 1 and 2 and&#xD;
      maximum walking times (8 below). Maximum walking times are the best indicator of the&#xD;
      implications of PAD on daily walking ability and participation in community activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes from the older subject's protocol will be assessed for PAD patients including 1)&#xD;
      walking: On the treadmill test, biomechanics variables during the zero degree incline portion&#xD;
      of the test will be collected. Rest time will be given between the conditions as needed for&#xD;
      claudication pain to subside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Muscle oxygenation, 3) Energy cost, 4) Perceived comfort and fatigue, 5) Rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion, 6) Feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two additional outcomes measured for the PAD patients will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived pain: Following the approach of perceived comfort and fatigue, a visual analog&#xD;
      scale will be used to capture subjects' perception of pain after each condition. The visual&#xD;
      analog scale will range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intense pain) and will be assess after each&#xD;
      EF condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Claudication Onset and Peak Walking Times: Walking ability will be determined with a&#xD;
      progressive-load treadmill test with initial and maximum claudication distances as outcomes.&#xD;
      Patients will walk on a treadmill that starts at 0% grade and 2.0 mph. Every two minutes, the&#xD;
      grade will be increase by 2% up to a maximum of 15% grade, and the speed held constant&#xD;
      throughout the test. The initial distance walked prior to the onset of pain (Claudication&#xD;
      Onset Time - COT) and the distance patients walked until the test had to be stopped due to&#xD;
      pain (Peak Walking Time -PWT) will be the outcome measures.&#xD;
