  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets (PLT), a major and essential constituent of blood, plays an important role in&#xD;
      physiological and pathological processes such as coagulation, thrombosis, inflammation and&#xD;
      maintenance of vascular endothelial cells the integrity (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet indices are a group of parameters that are used to measure the total amount of PLTs,&#xD;
      PLTs morphology and proliferation kinetics (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The commonly used PLT indices include PLT count, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet&#xD;
      distribution width (PDW), and plateletcrit (PCT). The MPV refers to the ratio of PCT to PLT&#xD;
      count. PDW is numerically equal to the coefficient of PLT volume variation, which is used to&#xD;
      describe the dispersion of PLTs volume (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that platelet indices have been applied in the diagnosis of hematological&#xD;
      system diseases. In recent years, it has been discovered that these indices are related to&#xD;
      the severity of illness and patients' prognosis. Reduction in PLT count is an independent&#xD;
      risk factor for critically ill patients in intensive care unit (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) System also&#xD;
      includes thrombocytopenia as an independent risk factor for mortality (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent research, it will be reported that MPV will be rising with interleukin-6 and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein in septic premature infants. MPV has been used as predictor of many&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases as MPV significantly higher on both day 1 and day 3 in neonatal sepsis&#xD;
      (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, elevated PDW and MPV will be accurate&#xD;
      diagnostic predictors for ascetic fluid infection (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPV and PDW will be used as biomarkers predicting the development of postoperative sepsis in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patient (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these evidences indicated that PLT indices will be considered as indicator in a series of&#xD;
      diseases (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advantages of platelet indices are simple, available, cheap tools and routinely done in the&#xD;
      hospital laboratory in all critical ill patients and may be a useful, sensitive tool for&#xD;
      diagnosis and monitoring these patients especially in limited resource countries as Egypt.&#xD;
      However, whether PLT indices are correlated with procalcitonin in assessment the severity of&#xD;
      illness is still under research in septic patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Blood will be drawn from the peripheral vein, arterial or a central catheter for evaluation&#xD;
      of whole blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin serum levels. This&#xD;
      procedure will be done at diagnosis, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (age, gender and BMI) and cause of sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procalcitonin and its correlation with changes in platelet indices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The odds ratio (OR) for mortality in patients with normal and abnormal platelet indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores.&#xD;
