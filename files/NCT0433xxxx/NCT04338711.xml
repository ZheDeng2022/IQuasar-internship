    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety of an&#xD;
      age-appropriate tofacitinib Modified Release (MR) formulation with varying level of enteric&#xD;
      coating. The effect of food on the PK of age-appropriate tofacitinib MR formulation with the&#xD;
      lowest and higher levels of enteric coating will also be assessed.&#xD;
