  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well durvalumab and olaparib work in treating prostate cancer&#xD;
      in men predicted to have specific genetic mutations (a high neoantigen load). Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. PARPs are&#xD;
      proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP&#xD;
      from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Giving&#xD;
      durvalumab and olaparib may kill more tumor cells in patients with prostate cancer predicted&#xD;
      to have a high neoantigen load.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle, total 6 cycles.&#xD;
      Starting cycle 4, patients with CDK12 mutations and mismatch repair deficiency&#xD;
      (MMRd)/microsatellite instability (MSI)-high will also receive olaparib orally (PO) twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) on days 1- 28 of cycles 4-6. Patients with homologous recombination mutation will&#xD;
      also receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of cycles 1-6. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 6&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks to complete 24 months (at 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months).&#xD;

             saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
