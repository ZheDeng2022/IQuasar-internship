    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether the baseline cT1 can predict those&#xD;
      whose condition relapses following treatment withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to investigate correlation of cT1 with histology to explore utility as a&#xD;
      monitoring tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 97 patients with AIH will be recruited and divided into 2 arms. 20 of which will&#xD;
      be treatment naive and the other 77 will have been on treatment for the past 18-24 months and&#xD;
      will be coming in for therapy cessation review.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AIH who have been undergoing immunosuppressive treatment for 18-24 months will&#xD;
      be invited for a series of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) scans to assess the utility of LMS for&#xD;
      monitoring characteristics of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study recruiting 97 participants&#xD;
      (20 of which will be treatment naïve at recruitment) from those patients scheduled for a&#xD;
      liver biopsy for therapy cessation review. They will be consented and invited for a&#xD;
      LiverMultiScan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients whose treatment is ended based on histology results will be followed up over the&#xD;
      subsequent 12 months, and those that experience a biochemical relapse or 'flare-up' will be&#xD;
      invited for a second LiverMultiScan prior to their scheduled liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend their planned outpatient hepatology appointment with their&#xD;
      doctor, who will document the intended treatment plan for each participant in line with their&#xD;
      usual care pathway. Their MRI scan will then be scheduled for the same day as their&#xD;
      outpatient appointment or within a 7-day window after their appointment with the consultant.&#xD;
