      A proof of concept study phase I/IIb with a first phase I of one month of slow titration to&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility and the safety and then a phase IIb using a single blind&#xD;
      randomized cross over study (2 periods of 1 month) to demonstrate that cerebroventricular&#xD;
      administration of A-dopamine (dopamine prepared in anaerobia to avoid dopamine oxidation)&#xD;
      affords a better control of motor fluctuations including dyskinesia as compared with&#xD;
      optimized oral treatment in patients with PD at the stage of severe motor complications&#xD;
      related with oral L-dopa using continuous actimetry at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study it will be expected to: 1) a higher benefit on motor symptoms 2) without&#xD;
      tachyphylaxis, 3) a good ergonomic of the intra-abdominal pump refilled with A-dopamine every&#xD;
      two weeks as compared with the numerous daily L-dopa doses and 4) a good safety profile of&#xD;
      this classical neurosurgical procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide.&#xD;
      The loss of dopamine through denervation in the striatum as a result of progressive neuronal&#xD;
      degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), is the primary neurotransmitter&#xD;
      marker of the disease. Since dopamine does not cross the digestive mucosa or the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier, its lipophilic precursor L-dopa has been employed and remains the pivotal oral&#xD;
      medication. However, after persistent use over several years, many pharmacokinetic drawbacks&#xD;
      contribute to the occurrence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Indeed L-dopa has a short&#xD;
      half-life, limited and variable reabsorption through the digestive and blood brain barriers&#xD;
      and potentially harmful peripheral distribution. Moreover, L-dopa requires the aromatic&#xD;
      L-amino acid decarboxylase for the synthesis of dopamine, which declines in the striatum with&#xD;
      disease progression. Intermittent oral doses of L-dopa induce discontinuous stimulation of&#xD;
      striatal dopamine receptors that in turn contribute to dysfunctional dopaminergic pathways.&#xD;
      Thus, continuous dopamine administration is considered more physiologically appropriate by&#xD;
      preventing oscillations in neurotransmitter concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously demonstrated that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administered&#xD;
      dopamine with an anti-oxidant adjuvant (sodium metabisulfite; SMBS) transiently improved&#xD;
      motor handicap and increased dopamine in rat brains with unilateral neurotoxin&#xD;
      6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced damage as well as&#xD;
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxicated monkeys. The clinical&#xD;
      feasibility of this administrative route has been supported by two PD patient case reports of&#xD;
      dopamine infusion to the frontal ventricle, whereby a reduction in motor handicap was&#xD;
      observed. Indeed, human case reports described a good tolerance to dopamine infusion over 1&#xD;
      year with a smooth control of motor symptoms. However, both preclinical and clinical reports&#xD;
      also highlight two overriding problems that prevented further development; occurrence of&#xD;
      tachyphylaxis and oxidation of dopamine causing enhanced dopamine metabolism and oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These prior challenges had been overcome by demonstrating that dopamine oxidation can be&#xD;
      avoided by preparing, storing and administering dopamine in very low oxygen conditions&#xD;
      (&lt;0.01% of O2 = anaerobia = A-dopamine). In vitro, a positive effect of dopamine was observed&#xD;
      on non-oncogenic dopaminergic neurons (LHUMES) survival. In vivo, A-dopamine restored motor&#xD;
      function and induced a dose dependent increase of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons in mice&#xD;
      after 7 days of MPTP intoxication that was not evident with either dopamine prepared&#xD;
      aerobically (O-dopamine) or in the presence of a conservator (sodium metabisulfite, SMBS) or&#xD;
      L-dopa. In the 6-OHDA rat model, continuous circadian i.c.v injection of A-dopamine over 30&#xD;
      days also improved motor activity without occurrence of tachyphylaxis. This safety profile&#xD;
      was highly favorable, as A-dopamine did not induce dyskinesia or behavioral sensitization as&#xD;
      observed with peripheral L-dopa treatment. In MPTP monkeys, A-dopamine improved the&#xD;
      doparesponsive motor symptoms without inducing any dyskinesia or tachyphylaxis during 2&#xD;
      months. Indicative of a new therapeutic strategy for patients suffering from L-dopa related&#xD;
      complications with dyskinesia, continuous i.c.v of A-dopamine had greater efficacy in&#xD;
      mediating motor impairment over a large therapeutic index without inducing dyskinesia and&#xD;
      tachyphylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, greater advances in programmable pumps now minimize tachyphylaxis by allowing&#xD;
      administration of a lower effective dopamine dose in accordance with the circadian cycle. Of&#xD;
      note, PD patients from previous studies received O-dopamine and at the same dose throughout a&#xD;
      24 hours cycle. Prior experience obtained from the use of an apomorphine pump and duodopa®&#xD;
      has identified the need to differentiate between diurnal and nocturnal minimum efficient dose&#xD;
      in order to avoid worsening motor fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, continuous circadian i.c.v. administration of dopamine close to the striatum is&#xD;
      feasible, efficient and safe in models of PD, supporting clinical development of this&#xD;
      strategy to be revisited in PD patients with L-dopa related complications with dyskinesia.&#xD;

The frequency of each event is determined by selecting one of 5 options: never (scored 0) / occasionally (scored 1) / sometimes (2) / often (3) / always (4). Each dimension total score range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting better quality of life.</description>
