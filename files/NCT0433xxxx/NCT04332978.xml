    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to demonstrate the non inferiority of the topical nasal fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate of the brand Plurair® in relation to the reference drug Flixonase® in the control&#xD;
      of symptoms related to perennial allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is one of the most&#xD;
      common forms of non-infectious rhinitis, characterized mainly by symptoms such as sneezing,&#xD;
      runny nose and nasal congestion. Depending on the time of exposure to allergens and the&#xD;
      duration of symptoms, allergic rhinitis is classified as perennial (OKUBO, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies for the assessment of perennial allergic rhinitis through symptom analysis used&#xD;
      diaries provided to the participants, so that they could describe their symptoms, starting in&#xD;
      the screening phase and ending at the end of treatment. In the present study, participants&#xD;
      recorded, in the diary, the severity of their rhinitis symptoms (obstruction, runny nose,&#xD;
      nasal itching and sneezing) and also associated eye symptoms (watery eyes, itchy eyes and&#xD;
      redness) using a four-point scale (0-absent, 1-mild, 2-moderate and 3-severe). For the&#xD;
      purpose of analyzing the primary parameter, the total daily reflective nasal symptoms (NRT)&#xD;
      was obtained by averaging the total morning and evening scores for each day ([morning NRT +&#xD;
      night NRT] / 2) of the individual nasal symptoms - obstruction, itching, runny nose and&#xD;
      sneezing - assessed reflexively in the last 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study in its design and analysis of efficacy and safety followed the guidelines of&#xD;
      regulatory agencies in the United States of America (FDA, 2000) and Canada (CANADA HEALTH,&#xD;
      2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluticasone propionate is a potent intranasal corticosteroid with negligible bioavailability,&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The onset of the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of fluticasone propionate occurs within 12 hours when 200 μg of the&#xD;
      medication is administered once a day (RATNER, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following guidelines for the use of fluticasone propionate and guidelines for the assessment&#xD;
      of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis, the objective of the present clinical study was&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two formulations of fluticasone propionate as a single&#xD;
      agent in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis through relief of nasal symptoms&#xD;
      assessed by recording in the participants' symptom diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted in accordance with the proposal for the treatment of perennial&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis, with local clinical research regulations, with the International&#xD;
      Harmonization Conference (ICH) Good Clinical Practices and with the principles of the&#xD;
      Declaration Helsinki and their respective revisions.&#xD;

Each cartridge of the study drug had a unique identification code related to one of the treatment arms through an electronically generated list, stratified by center. Participants were allocated to one of two treatment groups at a 1: 1 ratio.
