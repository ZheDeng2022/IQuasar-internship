  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loin Pain Hematuria Syndrome (LPHS) is a poorly understood, painful and incapacitating&#xD;
      condition that typically afflicts young women and was first described in 1967. Currently, the&#xD;
      treatment for LPHS is opioid prescription and in some extreme cases, surgical denervation of&#xD;
      the nociceptive impulses with renal auto transplantation and auto nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency nerve ablation is a minimally invasive alternative to opiate therapy,&#xD;
      auto-transplantation and nephrectomy in LPHS. In the investigators' previous exploratory&#xD;
      pre/post single centre studies, the investigators showed promising results with regards to&#xD;
      pain relief, mood, disability and quality of life post procedure. As these initial studies&#xD;
      were neither blinded nor randomized, improvements in pain and quality of life scores owing to&#xD;
      a placebo effect cannot be ruled out ; hence, to rule out any cause-effect relation between&#xD;
      treatment and outcome, selection-bias, influences the investigators intend to conduct a&#xD;
      double-blinded, parallel group, sham-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      present study is designed to assess the feasibility of conducting a large scale randomized&#xD;
      control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: In the present study the investigators hypothesize that the recruitment,&#xD;
      intervention, measurement and trial procedures will be feasible and acceptable, thus allowing&#xD;
      to proceed with a full randomized control trial&#xD;

      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blinded, parallel group, sham-controlled, randomized control, partial&#xD;
      crossover feasibility trial. This feasibility trial is a part of a larger clinical to trial&#xD;
      to assess both statistical and clinical significance of renal denervation treatment in LPHS.&#xD;
      This trial will involve 10 Saskatchewan -based patients for whom travel will be covered to&#xD;
      and from Regina. These patients will be randomized to either receive the treatment procedure&#xD;
      or the sham procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the feasibility measure, the QuinteT recruitment intervention methodology will be&#xD;
      utilized, involving a researcher interviewing patients at 6 months after the study (with the&#xD;
      inclusion of a satisfaction likert question regarding the study) and interviewing the study&#xD;
      personnel throughout the trial. Patient identifiers will be kept anonymous throughout the&#xD;
      QuinteT process, and the interviewer will be blind to the treatment allocation of the&#xD;
      patient. The feasibility assessments will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010&#xD;
      statement: extension to randomized pilot and feasibility trials guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team has produced two manuscripts regarding the impact of renal denervation on LPHS&#xD;
      patients. The investigators' initial article outlines four successful case studies reported&#xD;
      from a single centre, where &quot;half of the four patients experienced complete pain relief post&#xD;
      procedure, whereas the other two patients had a 75% improvement in their frequency of&#xD;
      analgesic use&quot; . The investigators then conducted a 12-patient cohort study and observed&#xD;
      10/12 patients at 3 months and 11/12 patients at 6 months reporting a &gt;30% reduction in pain&#xD;
      based on the McGill pain questionnaire, along with consistent improvements in disability,&#xD;
      mood and quality of life.These results provide the investigators with sufficient preliminary&#xD;
      results to scale the hypothesis, improve the study design, and introduce more rigor to the&#xD;
      methods so the investigators may use an RCT design to more-definitively assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of renal denervation on pain reduction for LPHS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal angiography will be performed to confirm the suitability of renal artery anatomy for&#xD;
      renal denervation therapy. If suitability criteria are met, the participant will then be&#xD;
      randomized for a sham procedure or a renal denervation procedure. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms: 1) renal denervation (treatment group) or 2)&#xD;
      sham treatment (control group) immediately following the renal angiogram. All eligible&#xD;
      participants will have an equal chance to be assigned to either treatment or control group&#xD;
      with a 1:1 treatment allocation design being used. Participants will be given general&#xD;
      anesthesia, thus they will be blinded to their randomized group assignment; they will not&#xD;
      know the difference between the renal angiography procedure alone and the renal angiography&#xD;
      plus denervation procedure. After the procedure the participants will be sent to the recovery&#xD;
      room and the nursing team caring for the patient will be blinded to the procedure. The&#xD;
      radiological aspect (sham or procedure) will not be entered on the hospital electronic&#xD;
      medical rounds/ PACS. If the angiographic information is needed by other health care&#xD;
      professional for a clinical event then it will be released upon request by the Interventional&#xD;
      Radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group: Participants remain blinded and are immediately treated with the renal&#xD;
      denervation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham Group: Participants remain blinded and remain in the procedure table for at least 20&#xD;
      minutes prior to introducer sheath removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, the sham procedure will consist of only a renal angiogram. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo diagnostic renal angiogram but will not receive any therapeutic endovascular&#xD;
      treatment. The diagnostic catheter will be kept in situ and dummy radiograph scan will be&#xD;
      performed for another 10-15 min before removing the femoral sheath from the sedated patient.&#xD;
      Participants will remain on the procedure table for at least 20 min after the angiogram to&#xD;
      prevent possible unblinding of randomisation allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical staff (Nephrologist and Nurse Practitioner) and the study coordinator will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment allocation. Only the interventional radiologist and his/her&#xD;
      designated study staff will not be blinded to a participant's randomization group. The&#xD;
      radiologist will not be involved with participants follow up following the procedure. This&#xD;
      way, the clinical follow-up will not be affected by clinician or participant knowledge of&#xD;
      specific treatment. Unblinding will occur after the six-month follow-up assessment. The&#xD;
      participant's will be told the type of treatment received and, if they were allocated to the&#xD;
      sham arm, they will undergo the RDN procedure. The participant's treatment allocation will&#xD;
      not be revealed until after the six month follow-up period is complete. After the initial&#xD;
      6-month follow-up period is over, the participants who were in sham group will undergo the&#xD;
      experimental treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer software will be used by an analyst, who is not involved with clinical care, to&#xD;
      randomly assign patients to either the treatment or control groups. All patients will have an&#xD;
      equal chance to be assigned either treatment group with a 1:1 treatment allocation design&#xD;
      being used. Currently, the investigators have one site that will treat patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following measures will be taken at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 and 6 month after the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): A descriptive questionnaire with 5 dimensions:&#xD;
      mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The dimensions&#xD;
      have five levels (no, slight, moderate, severe and extreme problems). Participants select the&#xD;
      level that corresponds to their perceived health status. Also, there is a vertical visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100, where participants record their health status lies with&#xD;
      the end points being &quot;The worst health the participant can imagine&quot; and &quot;The best health the&#xD;
      participant can imagine&quot;. The VAS results may be used to quantify the patient's judgement on&#xD;
      their own health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ): A questionnaire to measure the quality and quantity of&#xD;
      patient pain. The scale ranges from no pain (0) to maximum pain (78).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Pain Inventory Questionnaire (BPS): A questionnaire to measure the severity and impact&#xD;
      of pain on the patient's daily life and the perceived relief received from current&#xD;
      intervention. The short form is has nine-points relating to patients occurrence of pain,&#xD;
      areas of pain, rating pain at its worst in the last 24 hours, rating pain at its least in the&#xD;
      last 24 hours, average pain level, current pain level, treatments being used, percentage of&#xD;
      pain relief form medications used in the past 24 hours and specification of how pain has&#xD;
      interfered with life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): A questionnaire for measuring&#xD;
      self-reported depression. Patients are asked to rate over the last week how often they&#xD;
      experienced symptoms of depression. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher score indicating&#xD;
      more depression symptoms and lower scores indicating fewer symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Form Health Survey (SF-36): A health-related quality of life questionnaire that elicits&#xD;
      information about participants using eight health concepts: physical functioning, role&#xD;
      limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality,&#xD;
      social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health. Scores&#xD;
      range from 0 to 100, with lower scores relating to more disability and higher scores relating&#xD;
      to less disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI): A health questionnaire used to measure patient's functional&#xD;
      disability. The questionnaire comprises of ten sections: pain intensity, personal care,&#xD;
      lifting, walking, sitting, standing sleeping, sex life, social life and travelling. Index&#xD;
      scores range from 0% to 100%, with higher scores relating to more disability and lower scores&#xD;
      relating to less disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Medication Diary: Participants will be asked to record the number and doses of&#xD;
      medications they are taking to alleviate their pain. The type of medication will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCID-5: A structured assessment tool for DSM-5 disorders (exclusion criteria for the present&#xD;
      study). The diagnostic modules can assess somatic symptom disorders, mood disorders,&#xD;
      psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, obsessive compulsive and related disorders,&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, eating disorders, some sleeping disorders, externalizing disorders and&#xD;
      trauma and stress related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For six weeks and three and six-month assessment the investigators will follow up with the&#xD;
      patient, by phone or by in-person visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's Follow-up Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the initial treatment of either renal denervation (RDN) or the sham&#xD;
      procedure and be followed for 6 months. After this time has elapsed and the treatment&#xD;
      allocation is unblinded, participants who received the sham procedure will be given the RDN&#xD;
      procedure. Participants will initially have their baseline measurements taken (pain score&#xD;
      (MPQ, BPS), quality of life scores (EQ-5D, SF-36), mood (CES-D), and disability (ODI) and&#xD;
      then have follow-ups taken at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months post treatment. Participant's&#xD;
      demographic data (Age, gender and race), complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and serum&#xD;
      urea/creatinine and urine analysis, BMI and eGFR will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's Safety/Discontinuation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent safety committee will be formed to formatively assess risks to patient safety&#xD;
      throughout the study. The committee will consist of physicians, researchers and&#xD;
      administrators whom are not involved in the study, and have extensive nephrology and/or&#xD;
      research experience. The committee will meet before recruitment, upon randomization,&#xD;
      bi-weekly during the procedure period, and post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are allowed to withdraw from the study at any time without need to explain.&#xD;
      Should the independent safety committee report patient safety concerns, the decision will be&#xD;
      made as to whether the trial should be discontinued or whether the consent form must be&#xD;
      modified to incorporate any new findings, will be made. Should new findings about the&#xD;
      efficacy of this procedure for this indication emerge that would impact the premise for the&#xD;
      study, the appropriateness of continuing the study will be reviewed. Should an emergency&#xD;
      situation occur, the name, ID and treatment allocation of the participant involved in the&#xD;
      emergency condition will be given to the principal investigator. The principal investigator&#xD;
      will decide if there is an emergency with his experience as a physician. The research team&#xD;
      has received biomedical research ethics approval from the former Regina Qu'Appelle Health&#xD;
      Region (RQHR), Research Ethics Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis for the feasibility trial will be restricted to qualitative thematic analysis and&#xD;
      non-parametric analysis to compare the two small patient populations. No power or sample size&#xD;
      calculations will be reported as this is not necessary for the feasibility phase of this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
