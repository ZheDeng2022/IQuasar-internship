  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 50 million people in the U.S. experience tinnitus, of which about 20 million people&#xD;
      have burdensome chronic tinnitus. Tinnitus can be very debilitating as many aspects of daily&#xD;
      life can be affected, such as sleep, mood, and concentration. Currently, there is no cure for&#xD;
      tinnitus. Pharmacological or sound-therapy based interventions are sometimes provided but may&#xD;
      be of limited value to certain individuals. Research suggests that Cognitive Behavior Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) based approaches have the most evidence of effectiveness in the management of tinnitus.&#xD;
      However, CBT is rarely offered to tinnitus sufferers in the U.S. (less than 1%), partly&#xD;
      because of lack of trained professionals who can deliver CBT. To improve access to CBT for&#xD;
      tinnitus, an online CBT program has been developed which is also available in Spanish.&#xD;
      However, the outcomes of the Spanish version of the program has not been evaluated. The&#xD;
      purpose of the current study is to determine the feasibility of guided Spanish version of the&#xD;
      Internet-based CBT (ICBT) using audiological support on tinnitus distress and&#xD;
      tinnitus-related comorbidities.&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose of the current study is to determine the feasibility of guided Spanish&#xD;
      version of the Internet-based CBT (ICBT) using audiological support on tinnitus distress and&#xD;
      tinnitus-related comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that Spanish version of the ICBT will reduce the&#xD;
      tinnitus-related distress, decrease sleep disturbance, decrease anxiety and depression, and&#xD;
      improve health-related quality of life in Spanish speaking tinnitus suffers. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that these results will be stable in both short- and long-term&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A single group assignment, with a one-year follow-up design will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of Spanish version of the ICBT on tinnitus distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: This will be an Internet-based study for Spanish speaking tinnitus suffers living&#xD;
      across the globe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Eligible participants will include adults with tinnitus for a minimum period of&#xD;
      3 months with internet access and no major medical or psychiatric conditions. 50 Spanish&#xD;
      speaking participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention offered is a guided CTB-based internet intervention (ICBT),&#xD;
      providing an opportunity to learn about new ways of coping with tinnitus during everyday&#xD;
      life. It is 8-week long e-learning intervention, with new modules introduced weekly and&#xD;
      assignments are given to practice techniques learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures are the Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS), Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire&#xD;
      (TCQ), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia&#xD;
      Severity Index (ISI), and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L VAS.&#xD;

    <description>Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) is a 25-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of tinnitus distress. Total possible score ranges from 0-to-100 with higher scores suggesting more severe tinnitus distress (i.e., worse outcome). Scores &gt;25 indicate tinnitus is a significant problem requiring tinnitus intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>T0: Baseline, T1: Post-intervention (8-weeks from baseline), T2: 2-months post-intervention (16-weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire (TCQ) is a 26-item questionnaire that assesses positive and negative cognitions associated with tinnitus. The first 13 items refer to negative thoughts and the second 13 items refer to positive thoughts. Responses are marked on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4). The negative items (1-13) are scored 0-4, whereas the positive items (14-26) are reverse-scored: 4-0. The scoring procedure involves the simple addition of the number circled by the respondent for items 1-13 and the addition of reverse-scored items 14-26. The total score of the TCQ has a potential range from 0 to 104. A high score represents a greater tendency to engage in negative cognitions (i.e., worse outcome) in response to tinnitus and low engagement in positive cognitions.</description>

    <time_frame>T0: Baseline, T1: Post-intervention (8-weeks from baseline), T2: 2-months post-intervention (16-weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS) is a 10-item questionnaire that helps in determining how much of a patient's complaint about tinnitus is due to a hearing problem and how much is due specifically to the tinnitus. THS has three sections/subscales (A, B, and C). Section A consists of four items that address common tinnitus problems. Section B contains four items that address hearing. Section C, which includes two items, which focus on sound tolerance problem and ability to participate in group therapy. Responses for each item can range from 0 (not a problem) to 4 (very big problem). The total THS score can range from 0 to 40. However, the scores for this specific sub-scale can range from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating more tinnitus problem (i.e., worse outcome).</description>

        <title>Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire (TCQ); Measure of Tinnitus Cognition</title>
        <description>Tinnitus Cognition Questionnaire (TCQ) is a 26-item questionnaire that assesses positive and negative cognitions associated with tinnitus. The first 13 items refer to negative thoughts and the second 13 items refer to positive thoughts. Responses are marked on a five-point Likert scale (0 to 4). The negative items (1-13) are scored 0-4, whereas the positive items (14-26) are reverse-scored: 4-0. The scoring procedure involves the simple addition of the number circled by the respondent for items 1-13 and the addition of reverse-scored items 14-26. The total score of the TCQ has a potential range from 0 to 104. A high score represents a greater tendency to engage in negative cognitions (i.e., worse outcome) in response to tinnitus and low engagement in positive cognitions.</description>

        <title>Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS) - Tinnitus Sub-scale; Measure of Tinnitus Problem</title>
        <description>Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS) is a 10-item questionnaire that helps in determining how much of a patient's complaint about tinnitus is due to a hearing problem and how much is due specifically to the tinnitus. THS has three sections/subscales (A, B, and C). Section A consists of four items that address common tinnitus problems. Section B contains four items that address hearing. Section C, which includes two items, which focus on sound tolerance problem and ability to participate in group therapy. Responses for each item can range from 0 (not a problem) to 4 (very big problem). The total THS score can range from 0 to 40. However, the scores for this specific sub-scale can range from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating more tinnitus problem (i.e., worse outcome).</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was done during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, during a time where day-to-day living was disrupted for most people. This may have been one of the key reasons for poor engagement with the intervention and poor compliance with the completion of outcome measures.</limitations_and_caveats>
