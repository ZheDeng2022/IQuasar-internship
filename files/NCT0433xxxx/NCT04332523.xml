      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetc (PK) of a single oral dose of&#xD;
      JNJ-53718678 in participants with varying degrees of impaired hepatic function (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, and severe) when compared with participants with normal hepatic function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) test at screening and on Day -1 of the treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraceptive use by female participants or women should be consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participant participating&#xD;
             in clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a woman, must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted&#xD;
             reproduction during the study and for 30 days after receiving the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm for the purpose of reproduction from&#xD;
             Day -1 of the study and for a minimum of 90 days after receiving the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment: the participants&#xD;
             must have a total Child-Pugh score of 5 to 6, inclusive (mild); or 7 to 9, inclusive&#xD;
             (moderate); or 10-15, inclusive (severe). The Investigator will determine degree of&#xD;
             hepatic impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-53718678 or its excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donated blood or blood products or had substantial loss of blood (more than 500&#xD;
             milliliter [mL]) within 90 days before the administration of study drug or intention&#xD;
             to donate blood or blood products during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received an experimental drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an&#xD;
             experimental medical device within 30 days or within a period less than 5 times the&#xD;
             drug's half-life, whichever is longer, before the dose of the study drug is scheduled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not&#xD;
             be in the best interest of the participant or that could prevent, limit, or confound&#xD;
             the protocol-specified assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preplanned surgery or procedures that would interfere with the conduct of the study&#xD;
