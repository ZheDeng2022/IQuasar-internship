  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to depict the myocardial tissue characteristics in patients&#xD;
      with myocarditis by CMR and other cardiac imaging modalities and to assess the prognostic&#xD;
      value of imaging-derived indices. Information will be collected prospectively in about 200&#xD;
      patients with myocarditis in 5 sites. Subjects will be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of patients&#xD;
      with myocarditis that undergo CMR examination. Information of other cardiac imagings and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes are also prospectively collected in the database. This project will&#xD;
      establish a prospective registry of 200 patients with myocarditis in 5 sites with follow-ups&#xD;
      of up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project will be as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate myocardial tissue features and functional changes in patients with&#xD;
           myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify CMR-derived indices that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare CMR with other alternative cardiac imaging modalities (i.e., echocardiography&#xD;
           or SPECT) on prognostic prediction in patients with myocarditis.&#xD;

        [Inclusion Criteria]:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Definitive diagnosis of myocarditis - A definitive diagnosis of myocarditis is based&#xD;
             upon identification of diagnostic findings on EMB, including histology (Dallas&#xD;
             criteria) as well as immunohistochemical stains.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis - We adopted the 2013 European Society&#xD;
             of Cardiology (ESC) position statement criteria for &quot;clinically suspected&quot;&#xD;
             myocarditis, which require that a patient have at least one of the following clinical&#xD;
             presentations of myocarditis and at least one diagnostic criteria; if the patient is&#xD;
             asymptomatic at least two diagnostic criteria are required. A diagnosis of clinically&#xD;
             suspected myocarditis also generally requires the absence of other clinical conditions&#xD;
             that could explain the clinical findings such as cardiovascular disease (eg,&#xD;
             angiographically significant CAD [coronary stenosis ≥50%], valve disease, or&#xD;
             congenital heart disease), or an extra-cardiac condition (eg, hyperthyroidism). While&#xD;
             it is possible to make a diagnosis of &quot;clinically suspected&quot; myocarditis in a patient&#xD;
             with a concomitant condition such as CAD, clinical findings must be carefully reviewed&#xD;
             to determine whether findings can be explained by a single disease process or whether&#xD;
             the patient likely has at least two separate conditions. Clinical suspicion is higher&#xD;
             with greater numbers of fulfilled criteria unrelated to other conditions .&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinical presentations:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Acute chest pain (pericarditis or pseudo-ischemic)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  New-onset (days up to three months) or worsening of dyspnea at rest or&#xD;
                       exercise, and/or fatigue, with or without left and/or right HF signs&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Palpitation, and/or unexplained arrhythmia symptoms and/or syncope, and/or&#xD;
                       aborted sudden cardiac death&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Unexplained cardiogenic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  ECG/Holter stress test features - New 12-lead ECG and/or Holter and/or&#xD;
                       stress testing abnormalities with any of the following: first to third&#xD;
                       degree atrioventricular (AV) block or bundle branch block, ST/T wave change&#xD;
                       (ST elevation or T wave inversion), sinus arrest, ventricular tachycardia or&#xD;
                       fibrillation, asystole, atrial fibrillation, significantly reduced R wave&#xD;
                       height, intraventricular conduction delay (widened QRS complex), abnormal Q&#xD;
                       waves, low voltage, frequent premature beats, or supraventricular&#xD;
                       tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Elevated troponin T or troponin I.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Functional and structural abnormalities on cardiac imaging (echocardiogram,&#xD;
                       angiogram, or CMR) - New, otherwise unexplained abnormality of LV and/or RV&#xD;
                       function (regional wall motion abnormality or global systolic or diastolic&#xD;
                       dysfunction); such abnormality may occur with or without one or more of the&#xD;
                       following: ventricular dilatation, increased ventricular wall thickness,&#xD;
                       pericardial effusion or intracavitary thrombus.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tissue characterization by CMR - Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and/or&#xD;
                       findings consistent with edema in pattern suggestive of myocarditis. (See&#xD;
                       'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance' below.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The following ancillary features support the clinical suspicion of myocarditis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Fever ≥38.0 degrees C at presentation or during the preceding 30 days with&#xD;
                       our without associated symptoms (eg, chills, headache, myalgias, malaise,&#xD;
                       decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Prior clinical suspected or definite myocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Exposure to toxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Extra-cardiac autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        [Exclusion Criteria]:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient who is unable to comply with the follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient who has any medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigators will&#xD;
             not be appropriate to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 6 months due to any condition.&#xD;
