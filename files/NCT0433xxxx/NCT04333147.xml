  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease which requires treatment for a long&#xD;
      time period, hence it is important to study the long-term safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      continuous treatment with GSK3196165 over several years. This is a Phase 3, multicenter,&#xD;
      parallel group treatment and long-term extension study primarily to assess safety with&#xD;
      efficacy assessment as a secondary objective. Adult participants with RA who have completed&#xD;
      the treatment phase of a qualifying GSK3196165 clinical studies (Phase 3 studies contRAst 1&#xD;
      (201790: NCT03980483), contRAst 2 (201791: NCT03970837) and contRAst 3 (202018: NCT04134728)&#xD;
      and who, in investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with GSK3196165&#xD;
      will be included in this study (contRAst X [209564: NCT04333147]). Participants will continue&#xD;
      to receive the same background conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic&#xD;
      drug(s) [csDMARD(s)] treatment as they received in their qualifying study. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled to receive weekly GSK3196165 90 milligrams (mg) or 150 mg by&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) injection. The anticipated study duration is approximately 4 years which&#xD;
      will enable participants to receive treatment with GSK3196165 until it is expected to become&#xD;
      commercially available. Approximately 3000 participants from the qualifying studies will&#xD;
      participate in this long-term extension study.&#xD;
