  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a herpesvirus that causes two distinct clinical syndromes.&#xD;
      Primary infection is manifested as varicella (chickenpox) , whereas reactivation of latent&#xD;
      VZV results in a localized eruption known as herpes zoster. The investigational vaccine of&#xD;
      this study is produced by Changchun BCHT biotechnology Co. It's a live attenuated herpes&#xD;
      zoster vaccine based on the production process of live attenuated chickenpox vaccine.This&#xD;
      study plans to have 25000 adults aged 40 years or older and involves in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial . The primary outcome is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      the vaccine against herpes zoster 30 days after vaccination and the safety of the vaccine.&#xD;
