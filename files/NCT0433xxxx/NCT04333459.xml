  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized 4 cohort study that is comparing the data collected during the earlier phase&#xD;
      study and to determine if immunogenicity can be retained with a 1 mg dose of Hantaan DNA&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 4 randomized groups of 33 subjects each for a total of 132 subjects.&#xD;
      Every subject will receive a total of 4 vaccinations. Subjects and study personnel will be&#xD;
      blinded to the group that they are randomized to (double-blind). The study is intended to&#xD;
      substantiate the Phase 1 results with the 2 mg dose and to also determine if immunogenicity&#xD;
      can be retained with a 1 mg dose (for HTNV DNA vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 2 mg dose, each vaccination consists of 2 administrations of 1 mg (left and right&#xD;
      deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination. For the 1 mg dose, each vaccination consists of 2&#xD;
      administrations of 0.5 mg (left and right deltoid) for a total of 1 mg/vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will be vaccinated with the HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M(co) at the 2 mg/vaccination&#xD;
      dose. Group 2 will be vaccinated with the HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M(co) at the 1&#xD;
      mg/vaccination dose. Group 3 will be vaccinated with the PUUV DNA vaccine, pWRG/PUU-M(s2) at&#xD;
      the 2 mg/vaccination dose. Group 4 will be vaccinated with the PUUV DNA vaccine,&#xD;
      pWRG/PUU-M(s2) at the 1 mg/vaccination dose. Each group will be vaccinated on Days 1, 29, 57&#xD;
      and 169. All doses will be administered with the PharmaJet Stratis device, which is FDA&#xD;
      cleared for IM administration of vaccines. All subjects will be followed until 1 month after&#xD;
      the last vaccination with Day 197 being the final study visit. Subjects will complete&#xD;
      post-injection memory aids for 7 days after each vaccination.&#xD;

             military ID, or U.S. passport) &amp; be able to pass a background check in order to gain&#xD;
             access to the base &amp; participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Free of clinically significant health problems, as determined by pertinent medical&#xD;
             history and clinical examination with ECG and laboratory assessments prior to entry&#xD;
             into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Available and able to participate for all study visits and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females subjects must have had a hysterectomy or bilateral oopherectomy or must be&#xD;

&#xD;
             ** For this study, we define an effective contraceptive method as one that results in&#xD;
             a failure rate of less than 1% per year when it is used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
             This includes, but is not limited to, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a male&#xD;

             negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within&#xD;
             24 hours prior to each study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;

             Appendix A for range of acceptable laboratory values. Screening laboratory values that&#xD;
             are outside acceptable range but are thought to be due to an acute condition or due to&#xD;
