  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that TAK-071 will help people with Parkinson's disease to walk with better&#xD;
      balance. The main aim of the study is to check if there is a difference in how participants&#xD;
      walk after treatment with TAK-071. Another aim is to see if it improves how participants&#xD;
      think and remember.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants who can take&#xD;
      part will be picked for 1 of 2 groups by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will have 2 treatments but in a different order. The treatments are TAK-071&#xD;
      tablets or placebo. In this study, a placebo will look like the TAK-071 but will not have any&#xD;
      medicine in it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group will take TAK-071 for 6 weeks, have at least a 3-week break, then take a placebo&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. The other group will take a placebo for 6 weeks, have at least a 3-week break,&#xD;
      then take TAK-071 for 6 weeks. The participants will not know the order of their 2&#xD;
      treatments, nor will their study doctors. This is to help make sure the results are more&#xD;
      reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will visit the clinic at the beginning and end of each treatment for a&#xD;
      check-up. 14 days after the 2nd treatment, clinic staff will telephone the participants for a&#xD;
      final check-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is TAK-071. TAK-071 is being tested to treat people with&#xD;
      PD who have cognitive impairment and are at risk for falls and who are not concurrently&#xD;
      taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The study will look at the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      TAK-071 in participants with PD who take TAK-071 versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the PK of TAK-071 in healthy participants (sentinel cohort)&#xD;
      older than 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 74 participants. An initial sentinel cohort of 10 healthy&#xD;
      participants will be included to estimate age effects. Participants aged 56 to 75 years will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned in 3:1 ratio to one of the two treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sentinel Cohort: TAK-071 7.5 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sentinel Cohort: Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment for participants aged 40 to ≤ 85 years in the main study will start simultaneously&#xD;
      with sentinel cohort. Based on PK, safety, and physiologically based PK modelling data from&#xD;
      sentinel cohort, dosing will be decided for the remaining participants. Participants with&#xD;
      maximum age of 66 to 85 years, inclusive, will be enrolled at a dose of 5 mg, and the dose&#xD;
      for subjects aged 40 to 65 years, inclusive, will be 7.5 mg. All participants will be asked&#xD;
      to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining participants aged 40 years to &lt;=85 years will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to one of two treatment sequences in crossover design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-071 + Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo + TAK-071&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the United States. The minimum time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 15 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and&#xD;
      will have home assessments during the third Week of each 6-week treatment period, and will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone at 14 days after completion of the last period for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

             diagnostic criteria for PD. Participants with DLB (i.e., dementia diagnosed before&#xD;
             onset of motor symptoms or up to 1 year after onset of motor symptoms) are also&#xD;
             eligible, consistent with MDS clinical diagnostic criteria for PD.&#xD;

             before the screening visit based on the Fall History Assessment where in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator the falls were a consequence of PD and are at continued elevated&#xD;
             risk of falls per investigator judgment. Investigator judgment on fall risk may be&#xD;
             informed by information such as, but not limited to, history, physical examination&#xD;
             and/or a score ≥2 on item 3.10 on Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's&#xD;
             Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Is unwilling or unable to discontinue taking cholinesterase inhibitors and/or moderate&#xD;
             or strong cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors or inducers at least 30 days before&#xD;

          1. Participants has body mass index (BMI) less than 18 or greater than 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has significant risk factors for seizures (a history of seizures as an adult, a&#xD;
             history of brain injury, or other risk factors deemed relevant by the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant is unwilling or unable to discontinue taking cholinesterase inhibitors&#xD;
             and/or moderate or strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors or inducers at least 30 days before&#xD;
