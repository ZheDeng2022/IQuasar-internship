    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-HER2 therapy plus&#xD;
      Fulvestrant or Capecitabine in women with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), non-visceral metastases, stage IV breast cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 2-arm, multicenter study to compare the safety and&#xD;
      efficiency of anti-HER2 therapy (Trastuzumab ± Pertuzumab) plus fulvestrant versus anti-HER2&#xD;
      therapy (Trastuzumab ± Pertuzumab) plus capecitabine in women with hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+), non-visceral metastases,&#xD;
      stage IV breast cancer. Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm A&#xD;
      subjects will receive the anti-HER2 therapy plus fulvestrant. Arm B subjects will receive the&#xD;
      anti-HER2 therapy plus capecitabine. The use of Pertuzumab depends on patients' choices.&#xD;
