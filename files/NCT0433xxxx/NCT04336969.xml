  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 4Ts program encompasses: Teamwork, Targets, Technology, and Tight Control. These methods&#xD;
      will help patients better manage their condition of Type 1 Diabetes with improved patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the 4T study is to implement proven methods and emerging diabetes technology into&#xD;
      investigator's clinical practice to sustain tight glucose control from the onset of type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D) and optimize patient reported and psychosocial outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      will define a program (4T - Teamwork, Targets, Technology, and Tight Control) translatable to&#xD;
      Pediatric Diabetes clinics in the United States that reduces HbA1c and T1D burden and&#xD;
      improves patient well-being.&#xD;
