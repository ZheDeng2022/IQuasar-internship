  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the maximum dose per day of using mirror therapy for ankle&#xD;
      exercise after stroke. The design is a 3+3 rule based, dose- finding study. Each cohort will&#xD;
      consist of three participants. The first cohort will be assigned to do a dose of 15 minutes&#xD;
      each day for two weeks. The second and subsequent cohorts will exercise at target dose set&#xD;
      accordance to the nine preset rules and the modified Fibonacci sequence (mFBS).The study will&#xD;
      continue until the stopping rule is triggered. The last dose tested will be identified as the&#xD;
      maximum tolerable dose per day.&#xD;

      Procedure:a 3+3 rule-based, dose-escalation design (Colucci et al,2017). recruitment process:&#xD;
      the study will begin with a cohort of three participants (n=3). Each of the subsequent&#xD;
      cohorts will also be of three participants. The start dose will be set at 15 minutes (cohort&#xD;
      one). Participants will do ankle dorsiflexion exercise at the set dose with the mirror for&#xD;
      two weeks. The second and subsequent cohorts will exercise at dose set in accordance to the&#xD;
      nine preset rules and the modified Fibonacci sequence (mFBS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The target sample size is not usually predefined for a dose-finding study. The&#xD;
      final sample size will be determined by the response of consecutive cohorts to the set dose.&#xD;
      Usually, in pharmaceutical dose-finding studies, the sample size lies between 12 and 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis : The data for each cohort will be analysed using descriptive statistics. No&#xD;
      significance testing is involved.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants have had a stroke for six weeks or more before recruitment to this study,&#xD;
             and are discharged from NHS statutory stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be at least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to produce some voluntary contraction of paretic ankle ( motricity index between&#xD;
             9 and 19).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and follow simple verbal instructions (one-stage commands), i.e.&#xD;
             sufficient communication, orientation, and memory to participate in mirror therapy&#xD;
             ankle exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will have had no lower limb injury in the last six months and were able&#xD;
             to walk independently indoors before the index stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Foot or ankle contracture that prevents 50% of the passive range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that can be exaggerated by performing the therapy.&#xD;
