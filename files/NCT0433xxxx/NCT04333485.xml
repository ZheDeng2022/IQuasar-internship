  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      India is home to 1/3rd of the world's estimated three million annual undetected TB cases. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the investigators' Tuberculosis (TB) Aftermath study is to develop,&#xD;
      implement and measure feasible case finding strategies among recently treated TB patients in&#xD;
      India, a population known to be at high risk for recurrent disease. In a recent analysis of&#xD;
      the TB treatment cascade in Indian public-sector hospitals, of the 1.2 million patients who&#xD;
      successfully complete treatment each year, approximately 10% experience TB recurrence within&#xD;
      1 year, giving the patients a TB incidence rate 50 times higher than thae overall population.&#xD;
      Thus, active case finding (ACF) approaches targeting recently treated TB cases may be an&#xD;
      effective component of a combination strategy to reduce India's TB burden and help detect&#xD;
      many of the &quot;missing millions.&quot; The Indian National TB Control Program (RNTCP)'s new&#xD;
      strategic plan for TB elimination strongly recommends developing and implementing a scalable&#xD;
      surveillance system for recurrent TB. The investigators' formative discussions with the RNTCP&#xD;
      leadership revealed that a key knowledge gap is insufficient evidence on the yield and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of ACF strategies among treated TB patients. These discussions also&#xD;
      emphasized the RNTCP's strong interest in household (HH) follow-up screening for these&#xD;
      patients. The World Health Organization's Systematic Screening for Active TB guidelines&#xD;
      suggest that screening for recurrent TB in treated TB patients is a &quot;conditional&#xD;
      recommendation&quot;; conditional only because there is a lack of evidence. TB Aftermath will&#xD;
      compare effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of two ACF strategies that are&#xD;
      presently being considered by the RNTCP for detecting recurrent TB and provide evidence&#xD;
      needed to implement and scale the preferred intervention. While treated TB patients and&#xD;
      patients' HH contacts represent a high risk population for recurrent and incident TB, with&#xD;
      over 1 million TB cases diagnosed annually in India, it may not be feasible to intensively&#xD;
      follow all patients after TB treatment. Thus, lower-cost approaches such as telephone-based&#xD;
      outreach could increase the reach of ACF, and targeted implementation may be needed to&#xD;
      prioritize resources. Thus, the investigators will determine if visiting every HH of treated&#xD;
      TB patients or visiting just those identified as symptomatic through an initial telephonic&#xD;
      screening call will identify a similar yield of recurrent TB. The investigators' prior work&#xD;
      in India has shown higher risk of recurrent disease among TB patients who smoke, consume&#xD;
      alcohol, and those with untreated diabetes or respiratory impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will address this gap, through the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To conduct a non-inferiority randomized trial to measure the comparative effectiveness&#xD;
      of two potentially implementable ACF interventions within the RNTCP, conducted by existing&#xD;
      RNTCP &quot;home visitors&quot;: (i) Household ACF (HHACF) by symptom screen and sputum collection&#xD;
      among treated TB patients and patients' HH contacts and (ii) ACF by periodic telephonic&#xD;
      interviews (TACF) followed by HH screen for HHs reporting any symptomatic members among&#xD;
      treated TB patients and patients' HH contacts. The investigators will implement both&#xD;
      interventions at 6 and 12 months following treatment completion by the index TB patient, and&#xD;
      all HHs will have a final HH ACF visit 18 months post-treatment completion (&quot;mop up&quot;) for&#xD;
      comparison between arms. For both strategies, the investigators will calculate and compare&#xD;
      the number of TB cases (recurrent and new HH cases) detected per index patient in each study&#xD;
      Arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To characterize implementation processes of the ACF interventions using the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework to inform future scale-up and sustainability. The investigators will use the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework to: (1) understand barriers and facilitators to implementation of the two&#xD;
      interventions; (2) identify sub-populations that are best reached by the interventions and&#xD;
      sub-populations who may benefit the most from the interventions; and (3) contribute knowledge&#xD;
      to improve health services that span from the clinic to the community and home. The&#xD;
      investigators will enhance the RE-AIM approach, by exploring the acceptability of the&#xD;
      strategies in depth across three key stakeholder groups (TB patients, HH members, and health&#xD;
      care personnel) to optimize implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To model the impact and cost effectiveness of the ACF interventions evaluated in the&#xD;
      trial, and of potential alternative strategies for the targeting and timing of those&#xD;
      interventions: To better inform RNTCP decisions using locally-collected data, the&#xD;
      investigators will use data from the trial (on TB incidence and detection, targetable risk&#xD;
      heterogeneity, and intervention costs) to model and compare potential strategies for ACF in&#xD;
      terms of expected diagnostic yield, cost effectiveness, and impact on TB control in India. A&#xD;
      Markov model of the burden of new and recurrent TB at the HH level over time after index case&#xD;
      diagnosis will be used to model the lifetime impact of ACF interventions on HH TB morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, and time with infectious TB. The investigators will estimate cost-effectiveness by&#xD;
      calculating the incremental cost per Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) averted. Estimates&#xD;
      of the contributions of recurrent TB and HH transmission to population-wide TB incidence will&#xD;
      be used within a population-level transmission model to predict impact on India's TB&#xD;
      epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TB Aftermath will answer key questions in a population that is often ignored by the TB&#xD;
      community once treatment is complete, despite being at considerable risk for recurrent TB&#xD;
      disease. The investigators will provide evidence for an effective and scalable strategy&#xD;
      targeting HHs of treated TB cases, a high priority of the RNTCP. The investigators' high TB&#xD;
      burden setting, strong multidisciplinary team, communication with the RNTCP and state TB&#xD;
      program, and proven research infrastructure ensures successful implementation of TB&#xD;
      Aftermath.&#xD;
