  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electromyography (EMG) is a useful test for diagnosis and monitoring of lower motor neuron&#xD;
      disorders. It is mostly done in conjunction with a Nerve Conduction Study (NCS). Like other&#xD;
      invasive medical procedures; electrodiagnostic tests have been known to cause iatrogenic pain&#xD;
      for the patient, the intensity of which varies from person to person. Multiple modifiable as&#xD;
      well as non-modifiable risk factors associated with EMG pain have been described in&#xD;
      literature.Various approaches targeting different mechanisms of pain perception have been&#xD;
      tested to make this procedure comfortable for the patients. These approaches range from&#xD;
      simple distraction techniques to the use of topical and oral analgesics.Most of these studies&#xD;
      have looked at adult population which has, supposedly, better pain tolerance as compared to&#xD;
      children. Data on EMG associated pain in pediatric population is scant. This trial will&#xD;
      assess the effect of combined oral and topical analgesics to reduce pain perception during&#xD;
      NCS and EMG tests in the pediatric population.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of combined oral and topical analgesics (COTA) in reducing pain&#xD;
      perception during NCS and EMG tests among the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effect of COTA and only oral analgesics (OA) in reducing pain perception&#xD;
      during NCS and EMG tests among the pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: This study will be conducted at the neurophysiology lab at Aga Khan University&#xD;
      Hospital (AKUH)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a stratified (6 months - 6 years and 7 - 18 years with balanced&#xD;
      randomization), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study conducted at the&#xD;
      neurophysiology lab, AKUH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent Variables - Gender, age, weight (Kg), number of muscles sampled, distribution of&#xD;
      muscles sampled, end plate noise detection, type of needle used, duration of EMG and NCS&#xD;
      test, history of undergoing electrodiagnostic tests in the past, time duration between&#xD;
      analgesic intake / application and start of the NCS and EMG test, number of needle insertions&#xD;
      needed outside of applied cream area, number of times skin is pierced,result of&#xD;
      electrodiagnostic examination, patient in parents lap, electromyographer, study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent Variables - Pain Scores (MBPS and FPS-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions/Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guardians / patients who meet the inclusion criteria, as determined by the&#xD;
      neurophysiology fellow or attending, will be instructed to reach the neurophysiology lab on&#xD;
      the day of appointment one hour before the expected procedure time. All patients and/or their&#xD;
      guardians referred for NCS / EMG will be given a standard explanation regarding the procedure&#xD;
      and study details on the day of electrodiagnostic testing by the designated neurophysiology&#xD;
      technologist. NCS would be explained as a test that checks the responses of the nerves and&#xD;
      the subject will feel small zaps during the procedure. EMG would be explained as a procedure&#xD;
      where a thin small microphone will be inserted in multiple muscles of the arm, leg and / or&#xD;
      neck and back that will help us in identifying the problem. The word 'needle' and 'electric&#xD;
      current' would not be used during this explanation. The guardian and patient, if old enough&#xD;
      to understand, will also be explained the study protocol being carried out. Written Informed&#xD;
      consent for the procedure itself and the study will be taken at this point by the&#xD;
      neurophysiology fellow. Patients (older than 6 years) or their guardians will be instructed&#xD;
      on how to administer the FPS-R scale. In addition guardians would be instructed to make sure&#xD;
      that patients are not given sugary drinks or breastfeed during 1 hour prior to the procedure.&#xD;
      During the study distractions will be kept to a minimum and similar for all patients. Sites&#xD;
      of needle insertion will not be rubbed, stroked or tapped at the time of needle insertion.&#xD;
      These factors are known confounders in reducing intramuscular injection pain. Those who have&#xD;
      given consent will be assigned to one of the three arms of the study according to the&#xD;
      randomization schedule; COTA arm (Ibuprofen Syrup and EMLA Cream), OA arm (Ibuprofen Syrup&#xD;
      and Plain Cream) or Placebo arm (Plain Syrup and Plain Cream). All patients will be issued&#xD;
      their interventions labeled with an allocation sequence according to the randomization&#xD;
      schedule from the clinical trials unit (CTU), in a double blind manner, on the day of&#xD;
      appointment. The syrup will be given to patients orally (10mg/Kg body weight) at least 1 hour&#xD;
      prior to start of procedure. The electromyographer will demarcate all the possible muscle&#xD;
      sampling sites required as per study protocol with a non-toxic marker and leave the room. A&#xD;
      neurophysiology technologist will apply the cream on all demarcated sites. After application&#xD;
      of cream, the site would be covered by an occlusive dressing until NCS / EMG is carried out&#xD;
      so as to keep the applied cream in place and prevent accidental ingestion or application on&#xD;
      mucosal surfaces by the patient. The patient will be kept under observation for adverse&#xD;
      reactions including blanching and local erythema from application of cream till 15 minutes&#xD;
      after the NCS / EMG procedure. Observation would be done by Neurophysiology fellow or the&#xD;
      Neurophysiology attending. Neurophysiology technologists designated to carry out this&#xD;
      exercise would be given combined sessions regarding the application technique to achieve&#xD;
      consistency in results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMG will be performed by board certified faculty or neurophysiology fellows under their&#xD;
      supervision, each of them having a minimum of 6 months experience in doing electrodiagnostic&#xD;
      testing. This involves intramuscular insertion of needle (that has a microphone at its tip)&#xD;
      into multiple muscles. The occlusive dressing will be removed and area to be tested wiped&#xD;
      with alcohol swabs. Nerve conduction studies will be conducted first followed by the needle&#xD;
      procedures. During nerve conduction studies, patients feel an electric current like sensation&#xD;
      whenever a nerve is tested. Attempt will be made to keep the needle movements to minimum. The&#xD;
      guardian would accompany the child throughout the procedure. If the child wants, he/she would&#xD;
      be allowed to sit in the guardians lap during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Assessment &amp; Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children aged 6 months to 6 years pain will be assessed by scoring facial expression, cry&#xD;
      and body movements of the children using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS). For&#xD;
      children aged 7 years to 18 years the Face Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) version will be used.&#xD;
      Patients will be scored before NCS, after NCS and after EMG respectively on the data&#xD;
      collection form. Two observers blinded to the rest of the study and not involved with&#xD;
      carrying out NCS / EMG will be trained to administer these scores. The guardian, who would be&#xD;
      unaware of what the child scored, will also be shown the FPS-R and asked to score how much&#xD;
      pain patient seemed to feel during NCS and EMG respectively. Regarding FPS-R, the instruction&#xD;
      will be to choose the face that most closely resembles the amount of pain being felt. Patient&#xD;
      demographics, Clinical characteristics and NCS / EMG procedure characteristics will also be&#xD;
      recorded on the form. The data collected will then be entered into an excel sheet at the end&#xD;
      of each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a difference in means of 1.4 with a standard deviation of 1.73 in the control group&#xD;
      and 2.17 in the intervention group on the MBPS according to a study assessing effectiveness&#xD;
      of EMLA cream for reducing pain during Intramuscular injections in the pediatric population,&#xD;
      an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 80 % using a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with&#xD;
      3 pairwise comparisons; we will require 35 patients per group. Furthermore, assuming a 10 %&#xD;
      dropout rate we will enroll 39 patients per group to account for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve comparable groups, randomization will be performed as stratified blocked&#xD;
      randomization with random sizes in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Stratification will be done&#xD;
      according to the age groups: 6 months - 6 years and 7 - 18 years with varying random block&#xD;
      sizes. Allocation to intervention groups according to stratification will be carried out by a&#xD;
      computer generated randomization schedule which will list the allocation sequences assigned&#xD;
      to each of the three arms. The randomization schedule will only be available with the&#xD;
      pharmacist in charge of preparing interventions. Interventions will be prepared in&#xD;
      indistinguishable containers containing plain cream and EMLA cream and bottles containing&#xD;
      plain syrup and Ibuprofen syrup. The creams will be prepared to be similar in consistency,&#xD;
      texture and color. The syrups will also be similar in color and taste. Thirty Nine&#xD;
      Intervention packages will be made for each of the intervention arms; COTA arm, OA arm and&#xD;
      Placebo arm. Each intervention will be labelled with an allocation sequence according to the&#xD;
      randomization schedule by the pharmacist. The independent study officer not involved with the&#xD;
      preparation or packaging of interventions and blinded to the rest of the study will issue the&#xD;
      intervention for each patient reporting on the day of the appointment. The random allocation&#xD;
      sequence would be concealed from the rest of the study investigators / researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study the patients, the electromyographers, neurophysiology technologists /&#xD;
      observers administering the validated pain scales will be unaware of the intervention&#xD;
      assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs used in intervention arm have FDA approval as analgesics in the study population.&#xD;
      Moreover, no prior testing is recommended before administration of these over the counter&#xD;
      analgesics. Our study involves a single time use of these drugs only. Possible side effects&#xD;
      (1-10%) with Ibuprofen include dizziness, epigastric pain, heart burn, nausea, rash, vomiting&#xD;
      and renal failure (&lt;1%). Possible side effects (&gt;10%) with EMLA application include&#xD;
      application site pallor/blanching, erythema/pain and application site oedema (1-10%),&#xD;
      itching. Rare adverse effects (&lt;1%) include methemoglobinemia and myocardial dysfunction.&#xD;
      Patients will be observed for 15 minutes post study for the development of any side effects.&#xD;
      If any side effect is observed, patients would be referred to consult respective speciality&#xD;
      as deemed appropriate, as per the severity of adverse event. The patient or his/her guardian&#xD;
      will bear the expenses. This would be mentioned at the time of taking informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling &amp; Storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient related data would be kept safe in the custody of designated study officer who&#xD;
      would be part of the neurophysiology lab. Informed consent forms would be signed in a&#xD;
      separate room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be assessed for normality. We will use descriptive statistics for patient&#xD;
      demographics, clinical characteristics and NCS / EMG test characteristics, including measures&#xD;
      of central tendency and dispersion. Comparisons between three groups on pain perception will&#xD;
      be performed using ANOVA. Differences in proportions will be assessed using chi-square test&#xD;
      or Fischer exact test where appropriate. Logistic and Linear regression models will be used&#xD;
      to assess the effect of patient demographics, clinical characteristics and NCS / EMG test&#xD;
      characteristics on patient pain reduction within and across intervention groups. All p-values&#xD;
      will be two sided and considered as statistically significant if &lt; 0.05. All analyses will be&#xD;
      conducted by using the Statistical package for social science SPSS (Release 19.0, standard&#xD;
      version, copyright © SPSS; 1989-02).&#xD;
