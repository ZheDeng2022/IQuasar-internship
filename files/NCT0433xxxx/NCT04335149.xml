      Since the first case described in 2002, TAVI (transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation)&#xD;
      revolutionized the management of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Initially reserved for&#xD;
      patients with prohibitive surgical risk, transfemoral TAVI in now indicated according to&#xD;
      European Guidelines for patients at intermediate surgical risk and those &gt; 75 ans.&#xD;
      Post-procedure intensive care admission (ICU), initially considered as the rule regarding the&#xD;
      risk of complications, (particularly conductive disorders), may be avoided in 1/3 of patients&#xD;
      regarding drastic reduction in serious complications and growing experience of operators as&#xD;
      the investigator shown in a previous prospective study. Predictive criteria for low-risk of&#xD;
      complications were therefore established by our team and may be used in routine to select&#xD;
      patients that might avoid ICU. However, long-term impact of this triage strategy remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess 1-year outcomes according to unit admission&#xD;
      selection (ICU or conventional care unit (CCU)) in patients undergoing TAVI.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since the first case described in 2002, indications of TAVI (transcatheter Aortic Valve&#xD;
      Implantation) procedures increased in the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.&#xD;
      Initially reserved for inoperable patients or at high surgical risk, the indication for TAVI&#xD;
      was recently extended to patients at intermediate surgical risk. Post-procedure intensive&#xD;
      care admission (ICU) was initially considered the rule for all patients regarding the risk of&#xD;
      high-grade conductive disorders, vascular or neurological complications. However, given the&#xD;
      drastic reduction in serious complications and the increasing number of procedures,&#xD;
      systematic ICU admission may be safely avoided. Selection criteria for ICU admission were&#xD;
      established by our team in a previous study. The use of these low risk criteria, the growing&#xD;
      experience of operators as well as technological improvements allow to safely avoid ICU&#xD;
      admission in 1/3 of patients. However, long-term impact of this triage strategy remains&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess 1-year outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI&#xD;
      according to unit admission (ICU or conventional care unit (CCU)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This monocentric observational study retrospectively includes all patients undergoing&#xD;
      TAVI at the Montpellier University Hospital from 2017. TAVI is indicated in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic severe aortic stenosis with a life expectancy &gt; 1year and contra-indicated for&#xD;
      conventional surgery, at high risk or intermediate surgical risk&gt; 75 years after &quot;heart team&quot;&#xD;
      decision. Exclusion criteria are patients who died before unit admission or referred a&#xD;
      non-cardiological unit after the procedure. Two groups of patients are defined: (1) patients&#xD;
      referred to the ICU and (2) patients referred to the CCU after the procedure according to&#xD;
      risk-stratification criteria. Low-risk of complications criteria were defined as the absence&#xD;
      of major comorbidities, hemodynamic stability, absence of pre-procedure right bundle branch&#xD;
      block, LVEF&gt; 40% and absence of procedural complications, particularly the absence of any new&#xD;
      conductive disorder after 2 hours monitoring. The primary endpoint is 1-year major events&#xD;
      (all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular event and rehospitalization for cardiac causes)&#xD;
      according to the VARC-2 criteria. The secondary endpoints include hospitalization duration,&#xD;
      1-month major events and all-cause mortality during follow-up &gt; 1 year depending on the&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessment Data on patients' baseline characteristics, procedural details and&#xD;
      in-hospital outcomes is collected from a prospective TAVI database. No additional testing or&#xD;
      biological samples were specifically required for this study&#xD;
