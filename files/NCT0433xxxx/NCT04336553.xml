      Loneliness among older adults has become an issue of public concern, as it is associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. Yet, despite the urgency, there is little information on&#xD;
      how to reduce or prevent loneliness. The focus of this project is using experiences from the&#xD;
      United Kingdom's initiative social prescribing, which gives General Practitioners the option&#xD;
      of referring clients in need to a coordinator, who in dialogue with the client finds&#xD;
      activities for the client to engage in within the local community. Until now, social&#xD;
      prescribing has not been tested in Sweden. Therefore, with the overarching goal of reducing&#xD;
      loneliness and improving health and wellbeing, the aim of the project is to develop and test&#xD;
      a Swedish social prescribing program in order to explore circumstances under which the&#xD;
      program can reduce loneliness and improve wellbeing in older adults. The project will be&#xD;
      carried out in collaboration between researchers, a primary healthcare center, and a&#xD;
      community activity initiative. In the first phase, the research group will bring potential&#xD;
      end-users and stakeholders together in workshops to discuss, develop, and design a Swedish&#xD;
      program for social prescribing. Workshops will be audio-recorded, and the data subjected to&#xD;
      cultural analysis to gain perspectives on the social and cultural embeddedness of social&#xD;
      prescribing. In a second phase, the Swedish program will be implemented for a period of ten&#xD;
      months, followed by realist evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data from the overall&#xD;
      use of the program, as well as self-reporting from the older adults referred to the program&#xD;
      will be collected. The realist evaluation will develop knowledge regarding what in the&#xD;
      intervention is working, for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects, and why. Based on&#xD;
      the results of this study, there will be new knowledge gained concerning if and how social&#xD;
      prescribing can be used among older adults in a Swedish context.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loneliness among older adults has become an issue of public concern. There seems to be a high&#xD;
      and stable prevalence of reported loneliness, with as many as 50% of older adults reporting&#xD;
      serious or moderate loneliness. There is also growing evidence on the significant harmful&#xD;
      effects of loneliness in older adults . Although the situation is urgent, no specific type of&#xD;
      intervention has demonstrated a robust evidence base for reducing loneliness. There are,&#xD;
      however, promising initiatives that manage to take the wider context in which the individual&#xD;
      lives into account. Initiatives such as Social Prescribing in the United Kingdom identify the&#xD;
      individual's needs, and guide them in getting involved with their community, by linking&#xD;
      people with local supportive social activities and opportunities. However, such initiatives&#xD;
      are sensitive to context, and may not be easily transferred between national contexts. The&#xD;
      focus of this project is to develop and implement Social Prescribing in a Swedish context, as&#xD;
      this has not yet been done. Our novel contribution to this field is: a) developing a Swedish&#xD;
      version of a social prescribing method together with potential end-users and stakeholders;&#xD;
      and b) evaluating the first test and implementation of this method. Thus, this project has&#xD;
      the potential to develop important knowledge regarding how to prevent and/or reduce an urgent&#xD;
      public health issue, loneliness among older adults, in a non-medical way via social&#xD;
      prescribing in a Swedish context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and point of departure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews show that social isolation and loneliness among older people is a&#xD;
      substantial problem (affecting 7-17% and 40% respectively), and that lack of social inclusion&#xD;
      and a feeling of loneliness negatively affects physical and mental health. These issues are&#xD;
      especially prevalent in older people with health problems, and are associated with&#xD;
      socio-demographic factors (gender) and social factors (e.g., civil status and meaningful&#xD;
      social contacts). The research findings call for attention to be given to the provision of&#xD;
      services for meeting societal ideals in caring for the older generation, confronting the&#xD;
      rising isolation and subjective loneliness which harms individual health and burdens national&#xD;
      and global economies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There might though be protective factors addressing loneliness as research demonstrates the&#xD;
      importance of social relations and social engagement in older people's health, well-being,&#xD;
      and cognitive health. Strong mortality effects also exist,148 longitudinal studies revealed a&#xD;
      50% mortality reduction in persons with strong social relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Societal services need to be developed that prevent loneliness and support social&#xD;
      participation. A social equivalent to the physical activity on prescription is the United&#xD;
      Kingdom initiative started in 2002 called social prescribing, which serves as a way of&#xD;
      linking patients in primary care with sources of support within their local community. Social&#xD;
      prescribing concerns expanding the options available to General Practitioners (GP) by&#xD;
      allowing them to forward a client with psychosocial issues to existing meaningful activities&#xD;
      in the community that meet these needs. There are no set standards in the procedures of&#xD;
      social prescribing, but it gives a GP the option of using a non-medical referral, either as a&#xD;
      stand-alone, or together with existing treatments. The sources of support in the community&#xD;
      can be either in the volunteer or community sectors. Challenges that have been described&#xD;
      include the multiplicity of options and the logistical difficulties although the idea is&#xD;
      simple, the implementation is complex. What is essential is that there is a direct referral&#xD;
      from primary care, and an identified coordinator who connects the person to local activities&#xD;
      that meet their needs and aspirations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no robust evidence, findings report that social prescribing is broadly supportive to&#xD;
      reducing demand on primary and secondary care, and has the potential to deliver cost savings,&#xD;
      improvements in wellbeing, reduction of mental and physical symptoms, as well as a reduction&#xD;
      in social isolation and loneliness. There is, in particular, a need to highlight research&#xD;
      questions such as; When, for whom, and how well does social prescribing work, and in&#xD;
      addition, what effect does it have?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social prescribing has not yet been tested in a Swedish context. There are reasons to believe&#xD;
      that perceptions will differ somewhat between the two countries, partly as a consequence of&#xD;
      their different ways of understanding relations between the citizen and the &quot;proper&quot; provider&#xD;
      of healthcare. With a high number of older adults reporting loneliness, and knowing the&#xD;
      harmful effects of this situation, initiatives need to be taken. Social prescribing developed&#xD;
      and implemented into a Swedish context is such an initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, the researchers will develop and design a social prescribing intervention&#xD;
      for a Swedish context (SPiS) and in the second phase, the theory will then be tested while&#xD;
      the intervention is implemented in a regular primary healthcare center to assess how the&#xD;
      program works. Finally, in a third phase, the program theory will be refined based on the&#xD;
      prior developed knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ethnographic approach will together with realist evaluation be used in order to understand&#xD;
      and reflect design and development of program for social prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both quantitative as well as qualitative data will be collected using different methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group interviews will be performed with representatives from our collaborating partners; a)&#xD;
      the health care center, b) the involved community-based activity initiative, and c) local and&#xD;
      societal representatives for older adults (65 years old or older) in order to gain knowledge&#xD;
      about factors important to address loneliness, health and well-being. Discussions about the&#xD;
      theoretical underpinnings of the model, the practical implementation of the model in the&#xD;
      regular day to day practice as well as the fidelity to the prescription will be important&#xD;
      topics to address. Social prescribing per se and its potential effective mechanisms,&#xD;
      moderating factors, as well as barriers in the procedure will also be discussed with the&#xD;
      profession and stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to enable the identification of important contextual factors and potentially&#xD;
      effective mechanisms in order to understand how the model works, for whom, and why,&#xD;
      qualitative interviews will be conducted with the participants who have received social&#xD;
      prescribing as well as the professionals who deliver the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative demographic data of the participants (older adults receiving the SPiS), age,&#xD;
      gender, education level, diagnosis affecting activity performance and interests, will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and follow-up followed by measurement of loneliness, self-rated health,&#xD;
      mapping of social networks and social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative data will generate evidence regarding the expected outcomes of loneliness,&#xD;
      health and activity engagement to address the issue of for whom, under which circumstances,&#xD;
      and in what respect the intervention is working. Descriptive statistics, as well as&#xD;
      parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis will be used to detect changes between&#xD;
      groups of older adults in the outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence generated through the qualitative work focusing particularly on contextual factors&#xD;
      and potential mechanisms will address the issue of what in the intervention is working and&#xD;
      why. Data will be analyzed thematically, with grounded theory approaches and/or other&#xD;
      relevant qualitative measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two phases, where in, the first phase, the theory is developed and in a second&#xD;
      phase tested, the researchers will according to the knowledge gained, in the third phase,&#xD;
      refine the theory and draw conclusions how a social prescribing program can be implemented in&#xD;
      a Swedish context.&#xD;

    <description>The UCLA loneliness scale used for studying changes in loneliness interventions, using this scale, participants' self-reported experiences of loneliness will be measured. The measurement includes 20 statements, rated on a four-step scale from never to always. The given scores are summarized into a total score, ranging from 20-80. Four levels of loneliness have been identified and preliminarily established, and the measurement has been used on groups of older people, and frequently in intervention studies.</description>
