      This study will evaluate the effects of cenicriviroc mesylate (CVC) on arterial inflammation&#xD;
      in people living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the CVC arm (Arm A) or placebo for CVC arm (Arm B).&#xD;
      CVC 150 mg or placebo for CVC will be added to the participants' pre-existing antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ARV) regimens once a day for at least 24 weeks. For participants who are on an efavirenz&#xD;
      (EFV)-based regimen, dosing will be 300 mg once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will remain on study treatment for approximately 24 weeks. Study visits&#xD;
      may include blood collection, physical examinations, and FDG-PET/CT imaging.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or&#xD;

                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid&#xD;
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or&#xD;
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot&#xD;
