      A Phase 1, first-in-human, SRF617 monotherapy and combination therapy, dose escalation,&#xD;
      safety, and tumor biopsy expansion study of SRF617, an antibody that inhibits CD39 activity,&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors. Inhibition of CD39 activity may improve the ability&#xD;

      A Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human, SRF617 monotherapy and combination therapy dose&#xD;
      escalation, safety, and tumor biopsy expansion study in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      The monotherapy dose escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 as monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The monotherapy tumor biopsy expansion portion of the&#xD;
      study will further evaluate the safety and intratumoral pharmacodynamics of SRF617&#xD;
      monotherapy. The combination therapy dose escalation portion of the study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
      + albumin-bound paclitaxel, or SRF617 in combination with pembrolizumab, in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The combination therapy dose escalation portion&#xD;
      of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617&#xD;
      in combination with gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel, or SRF617 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The combination&#xD;
      expansion will evaluate SRF617 in combination with pembrolizumab in PD-1 naive patients with&#xD;
      HER2 negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma and SRF617 in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&#xD;

    <description>SRF617 prevents CD39 mediated conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate, leading to an increase in extracellular ATP and a reduction in adenosine levels within the tumor microenvironment (TME). There is an important role for extracellular ATP and adenosine in cancer maintenance and progression, and maintaining high levels of ATP (and low levels of adenosine) in the TME may have anticancer therapeutic activity.</description>
