  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of the natural course of&#xD;
      postprandial hypoglycemia vs. a postprandial euglycaemic condition on driving performance in&#xD;
      individuals with confirmed postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia after gastric-bypass&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the increasing prevalence of postprandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (PHH),&#xD;
      clinical implications are still unclear. Anecdotal evidence from patients with PHH suggest a&#xD;
      high burden for these patients due to the recurrent hypoglycaemias with possibly debilitating&#xD;
      consequences. It is well established, that even mild hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose of&#xD;
      3.4mmol/l) in diabetic and non-diabetic significantly impairs cognitive-motor functioning. Of&#xD;
      note, some of the cognitive aspects remain impaired for up to 75min, even when the&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia is corrected. In addition to the hypoglycaemic blood glucose levels per se, the&#xD;
      dynamics of the hypoglycaemia occurrence appears to play a role. It was shown in individuals&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes, that cognitive functions are affected more during a fast-fall than slow&#xD;
      fall hypoglycaemia in the postprandial state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving is a frequent daily activity which integrates various mental function including&#xD;
      visual and auditory processing, motor skills, reasoning and problem solving. Due to the&#xD;
      potentially dangerous consequences, avoidance of hypoglycaemia-induced driving mishaps is of&#xD;
      uttermost importance. Several studies have evaluated the impact of induced, controlled&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes on driving performance using driving&#xD;
      simulators but data in PHH patients are currently lacking. Assessing the potential impact of&#xD;
      the natural course of postprandial hypoglycaemia on driving performance in PHH patients will&#xD;
      contribute to a better understanding of the consequences and relevance of this problem. The&#xD;
      investigator will test the hypothesis whether driving performance during the postprandial&#xD;
      glucose dynamics is impaired in patients with confirmed PHH.&#xD;
