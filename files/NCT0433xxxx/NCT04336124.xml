  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CVM-1118 Immediate-release (IR) Capsule and CVM-1118 Extended-release (ER) Capsule are&#xD;
      proprietary oncology products developed by TaiRx, Inc. for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      suffering from advanced cancer. Due to the short elimination half-life of CVM-1118 IR&#xD;
      capsules, the extended release (ER) formulation, containing mini-tablets in hard capsule, has&#xD;
      been developed to prolong the drug absorption and longer exposure after oral administration.&#xD;
      The designed dose of CVM-1118 ER was 200 mg per capsule to provide a more patient-compliant&#xD;
      and safe dosage of CVM-1118. The clinical study CVMEX-001 is therefore designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and pharmacokinetics of CVM-1118 extend release (ER) Capsule (200 mg/capsule) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CVM-1118 ER Capsule will be orally administered BID or TID before meal in 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles. Patients will receive 400, 600, 800 to 1,200 mg of CVM-1118 ER Capsule in&#xD;
      sequential cohort based on safety and dose tolerability. A single-patient cohort per dose&#xD;
      level (accelerated titration design) will be applied to the first two cohorts, 400 and 600 mg&#xD;
      daily, and followed by the conventional 3+3 dose escalation design from the dose level of 800&#xD;
      mg/day. Within the first two cohorts, if any Grade 2 or greater toxicity at least possibly&#xD;
      attributable to CVM-1118 ER capsule is reported in the first patient during first cycle, a&#xD;
      single-patient cohort will be converted to conventional 3+3 study design once and expand to a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of toxicity within the first cycle. Dose&#xD;
      escalation will occur until DLT occurs in 2 or more patients within a dose level. In any&#xD;
      cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled to that dose&#xD;
      level. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT, no further dose escalation will occur. Plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics samples will be collected at pre-determined time-points for all patients&#xD;
      participating in the dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be completed and closed once the MTD is determined for CVM-1118 ER capsules.&#xD;
      However, at the end of 4 cycles, it is recommended that some patients should continue&#xD;
      receiving the clinical benefit from CVM-1118 ER capsules. Thus, patients may be continuously&#xD;
      treated at the assigned dose level or next higher dose level provided it has been shown to be&#xD;
      safe in a previously treated cohort by safety committee, until the treating physician feels&#xD;
      the patient is no longer benefiting from the treatment, or CVM-1118 ER Capsule becomes&#xD;
      commercially available, as applicable in the country in which the patient lives. In the event&#xD;
      of unacceptable toxicity at a given dose, CVM-1118 can be reduced to the previous dose level&#xD;
      or suggested lower dose by PI. If unacceptable toxicity persists despite 2 dose reductions,&#xD;
      the patient should be removed from study.&#xD;

             of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically&#xD;
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The&#xD;
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or a designated associate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor,&#xD;
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
