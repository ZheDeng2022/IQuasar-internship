      The study will assess the diagnosis of cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) among infant and&#xD;
      children in assiut university children hospital using skin prick test and specific serum IgE&#xD;
      as well as their management.&#xD;

      Food allergy is a reproducible specific immune response to exposure to a given food. Cow's&#xD;
      milk protein allergy (CMPA) is clinically abnormal reaction to cow's milk protein (CMP) via&#xD;
      immune mechanisms triggered by milk protein (Boyce etal.,2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to European academy for allergy and clinical immunology (EAACI) and the world&#xD;
      allergy organization (wao) , a hypersensitivity reaction to cow's milk involving the immune&#xD;
      system can be called as CMPA. There is difference between CMPA and non-allergic cow's milk&#xD;
      intolerance (e.g lactose intolerance) which occurs as a result of lactase deficiency without&#xD;
      involvement of the immune system (Venter etal.,2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMPA is categorized into immunoglobulin IgE mediated , non -IgE mediated ,or mixed CMPA&#xD;
      (Sicherer etal.,2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.9% to 4.9% prevalence of CMPA among children with a peak in prevalence (2-3%) in the first&#xD;
      year of life and prevalence of &lt;1% in children aged &gt;=6 years (koletzko etal.,2012).&#xD;
