  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many older adults have urinary incontinence. They often seek treatments, such as diapers,&#xD;
      pads, or medications, from the community pharmacy. Pharmacists are trained to assist seniors&#xD;
      with therapies that treat urinary incontinence. Our study will determine how much benefit&#xD;
      there is if pharmacists try to provide more assistance for seniors with incontinence. Over a&#xD;
      period of months, half of the people who talk to the pharmacist about their incontinence will&#xD;
      be given general information about health and aging. The other half of the people will have a&#xD;
      longer assessment and complete a questionnaire with the pharmacist. Then the pharmacist will&#xD;
      call and have a follow-up visit to see how the incontinence symptoms have improved. We will&#xD;
      compare both groups to see whose symptoms were improved.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled trial is designed to determine the effect of a pharmacist&#xD;
      intervention to manage lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the community. The objectives&#xD;
      of the study are to determine the effect of the pharmacist as measured by the Patient&#xD;
      Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) (primary objective), the Bladder Self-Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire (B-SAQ), and the International Consultation on Incontinence Module&#xD;
      Questionnaire Short Form (ICI-Q-SF) (as secondary objectives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacists at community pharmacies will be recruited through the networks already&#xD;
      established within Alberta for pharmacy practice research, and the Pharmacists Association of&#xD;
      Alberta. The pharmacists must have advanced prescribing authorization with their professional&#xD;
      license.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited with the posting of shelf-talkers by the incontinence and&#xD;
      menstrual products section of the pharmacy and with leaflets in prescription bags. If a&#xD;
      patient obtains a LUTS product or if the patient presents him/herself in response to the&#xD;
      shelf-talker, the pharmacist will screen the patient to determine if LUTS are present.The&#xD;
      patients will be eligible to participate if they are at least 60 years of age, report LUTS,&#xD;
      can communicate in English, and provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be randomized to either a control or intervention. Those assigned to the&#xD;
      control group will be eligible to receive the intervention following the follow-up period.&#xD;
      Both the control and intervention group will have a baseline PPBC, B-SAQ, and ICI-Q-SF&#xD;
      questionnaires, in addition to demographics and a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive a healthy aging pamphlet and will be called back at 8 weeks to&#xD;
      have the questionnaires repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is based on the published guide for LUTS for pharmacists (Gabriel, et al.&#xD;
      2015). The pharmacist will assess the patient's LUTS and determine an appropriate&#xD;
      intervention plan, which may include education, lifestyle, behavioural, or medication&#xD;
      modification. The patient will be given a summary of the plan and the primary care provider&#xD;
      will also receive a summary. At 4 weeks the patient will be contacted by phone or in person&#xD;
      (per patient preference), with a review of the plan and repeated bladder questionnaires. At 8&#xD;
      weeks the patient will complete the final interaction with the pharmacist and will complete&#xD;
      the bladder questionnaires for the final time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the change in PPBC from baseline to 8 weeks, and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include the change from baseline until 8 weeks in the B-SAQ, ICI-Q, and health system use&#xD;
      (including referrals to physicians, specialists, and pharmacist billing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 100 patients (50 in each group). All analyses will be by intention to&#xD;
      treat.&#xD;
