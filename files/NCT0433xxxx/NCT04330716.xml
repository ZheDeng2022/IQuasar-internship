  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effect of two pre-test&#xD;
      education methods on the level of participation in genetic testing for hereditary cancer&#xD;
      risk. A prospective study examines outcomes before the development of a disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization and a&#xD;
           series of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomized, or assigned by chance, to one of two methods of&#xD;
           pre-genetic test education and after completing either pre-test education participants&#xD;
           will be offered the opportunity to have genetic testing performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two methods of pre-genetic test education:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  video education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in-person counseling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing will be performed by blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that 500 people will participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in the research study for up to 5 yrs after enrollment&#xD;

    <description>MICRA is a widely used validated 25-item measure that assesses psychosocial consequences associated with genetic testing for cancer. Section 1 contains 3 sub-scales: the Positive sub-scale (4 items), the Distress sub-scale (6 items), and the Uncertainty sub-scale (9 items) and two other items that do not fit into either sub-scale. Section 2 contains two items for participants who have children. Section 3 contains 2 items for participants who have/have had cancer. Responses are indicated on a 4 point scale for experiences in the past week. A higher score in the sub-scales or total scale indicated greater distress. The positive sub-scale is reverse scored to reflect this.</description>
