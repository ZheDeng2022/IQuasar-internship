    <textblock>
      Combined treatment of soft tissue sarcoma includes 3 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the first step patient undergoes preoperative stereotactic radiation therapy in&#xD;
           hypofractionation mode. Radiation therapy plan is based on topometric MRI and CT scans.&#xD;
           Radiation therapy plan are performed after MRI and CT fusion, contouring of the target&#xD;
           and surrounding normal tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At first step only tumor and, if necessary, the surrounding normal tissues, which will&#xD;
           be removed during surgery, are exposed to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           GTV - determined in with the boundaries of the tumor visualised by topometric MRI and CT&#xD;
           CTV1 - match GTV CTV2 - formed inward (to the tumor center) from GTV by 0.5-1 cm&#xD;
           (depending on the proximity of functionally significant normal tissues (neurovascular&#xD;
           bundles, bone tissue, skin and subcutaneous fat, etc.) PTV - 3-5 mm indent from CTV1,&#xD;
           taking into account the proximity of functionally significant normal tissues and the&#xD;
           planned surgery Preoperative radiation therapy is carried in 5 fractions with a single&#xD;
           dose on PTV - 5 Gy, a single dose on CTV2 - 7 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second step is surgery in 14-21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In 25-35 days after the surgery postoperative conformal radiation therapy is performed&#xD;
           according to the standard protocol GTV (tumor bed) - based on the volume of the primary&#xD;
           tumor, including the swelling zone (T2-weighted images on preoperative MRI) СTV - formed&#xD;
           with an indent of 4 cm from GTV (without going beyond the boundaries of the involved&#xD;
           compartment), in the transverse direction the indent could be reduced to 2 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTV - formed with an indent of 0.5-1cm from CTV An important condition for planning radiation&#xD;
      therapy is to limit the dose absorbed during both stages of radiation therapy in surrounding&#xD;
      normal tissues that are not removed during surgery.&#xD;
