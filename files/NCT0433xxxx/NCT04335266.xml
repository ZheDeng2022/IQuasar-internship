      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of high-fat diet on&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese male adult subjects after oral administration of SHR2554&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of single dose of SHR2554&#xD;
      orally in healthy subjects.&#xD;
