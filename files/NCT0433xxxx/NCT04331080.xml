      Participants that meet screening criteria will be eligible for randomization providing all&#xD;
      other criteria are met. Participants enrolled will receive study drug for 3 days. The&#xD;
      participants will have an additional follow-up period to assess scarring of both Granexin®&#xD;
      gel and Vehicle gel incisions through end of study at Month 12.&#xD;
