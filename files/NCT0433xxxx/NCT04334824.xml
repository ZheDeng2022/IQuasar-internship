  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of hydrochlorothiazide is&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of skin cancer compared with the use of&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. More specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      assess the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the use of hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer compared&#xD;
      with ACE inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will carry out separate population-based cohort studies using&#xD;
      administrative health databases from seven Canadian provinces and the United States. The&#xD;
      study cohort will be defined by the initiation of hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor,&#xD;
      with follow-up until an incident diagnosis of non-melanoma or melanoma skin cancer. The&#xD;
      results from the separate sites will be combined to provide an overall assessment of the risk&#xD;
      of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer in users of hydrochlorothiazide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to determine whether the use of hydrochlorothiazide is associated with&#xD;
      an increased risk of skin cancer compared with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitors. More specifically, the investigators will assess whether hydrochlorothiazide is&#xD;
      associated with the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common-protocol approach will be used to conduct retrospective cohort studies using&#xD;
      administrative health data from seven Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia,&#xD;
      Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) and the United States (US)&#xD;
      MarketScan database. Briefly, the Canadian databases include population-level data on&#xD;
      physician billing, diagnoses and procedures from hospital discharge abstracts, and&#xD;
      dispensations for prescription drugs. Prescription drug data are limited to those aged 65&#xD;
      years old and older in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. The US MarketScan database includes&#xD;
      individuals and their dependents covered by large US employer health insurance plans, and&#xD;
      government and public organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized mortality ratio weighted cohort analysis will be conducted. In each&#xD;
      jurisdiction, the investigators will assemble a study cohort that includes all patients aged&#xD;
      40 years or older (or 66 years or older in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Ontario) newly-treated&#xD;
      with hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor between April 1, 1995 and March 31, 2018 (or the&#xD;
      latest date of data availability at each site). The date of study cohort entry will be&#xD;
      defined by the dispensation date of the newly prescribed hydrochlorothiazide or ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor. Patients will be followed starting 366 days after study cohort entry until an&#xD;
      incident diagnosis of non-melanoma or melanoma, or censored upon switching to a study drug,&#xD;
      death, end of coverage or end of the study period (March 31, 2018), whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure will be defined as a prescription for hydrochlorothiazide or an ACE inhibitor on the&#xD;
      date of cohort entry. The exposures will be lagged by one year in order to consider a minimum&#xD;
      cancer latency period between treatment initiation and the diagnosis of skin cancer. Analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted using a modified intention-to-treat approach. The outcomes of interest will&#xD;
      be non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weighted Cox proportional hazards models with calendar year as a strata will be used to&#xD;
      estimate site-specific adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      (CI) for each outcome of interest among hydrochlorothiazide users compared to ACE inhibitor&#xD;
      users. In order to reflect the Canadian context, the primary analysis will be restricted to&#xD;
      Canadian data and the US MarketScan data will be used only in a secondary analysis. Secondary&#xD;
      analyses will be conducted for each outcome of interest. These will include the following: 1)&#xD;
      as-treated, 2) cumulative duration of use, 3) dose-response relation, 4) effect modification&#xD;
      by age (≤65, 66-74, and ≥75 years), sex and immunosuppressive status, and 5) time since&#xD;
      initiation of treatment (&lt;3, 3-5, and &gt;5 years). For non-melanoma, events will be further&#xD;
      classified into basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma sub-types in jurisdictions&#xD;
      where data is available. Four sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness&#xD;
      of study results and address some of the study limitations. Site-specific results from the&#xD;
      Canadian sites will be combined by random-effects meta-analysis to provide an overall&#xD;
      assessment of the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer in hydrochlorothiazide users&#xD;
      compared to ACE inhibitor users. Four additional analyses at the meta-analysis level will be&#xD;
      conducted. These will include the following: 1) using fixed-effects model, 2) pooling results&#xD;
      only from jurisdictions where non-melanoma sub-type differentiation is available, 3) pooling&#xD;
      results from all sites including the US MarketScan data, and 4) pooling results by&#xD;
      jurisdictions with and without cancer registry data.&#xD;
