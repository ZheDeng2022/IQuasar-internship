  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in the U.S. and a leading cause of&#xD;
      disability. Depression and obesity are highly comorbid among knee osteoarthritis patients,&#xD;
      and the combination of obesity and depression is associated with decreased physical activity,&#xD;
      higher pain and disability, and more rapid cartilage degradation. Depression, obesity and&#xD;
      osteoarthritis exacerbate one another and share a common pathophysiology involving systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, reflecting a complex mind-body interaction.&#xD;
      Current treatments for knee osteoarthritis offer little to no benefit over placebo, and do&#xD;
      not emphasize mind-body practices or physical activity to target the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology. Mind-body interventions to lessen depressive symptoms and increase physical&#xD;
      activity offer the ability to target biological, mechanical and psychological mechanisms of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis progression in this high-risk subset. The long-term goals are to evaluate the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) delivered via&#xD;
      telehealth, and adapted for patients with depression, obesity and knee OA (GetHealthy-OA)&#xD;
      promotes increases in physical activity and improved subjective and objective aspects of knee&#xD;
      health. The overarching hypothesis is that the synergistic interaction between mindfulness,&#xD;
      adaptive thinking, positive psychology and healthy living skills of the GetHealthy-OA will&#xD;
      reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine expression while also promoting optimal mechanical loading&#xD;
      of the cartilage thereby slowing the progression of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. This&#xD;
      study aims to adapt the 3RP for the needs of knee osteoarthritis patients with depression and&#xD;
      obesity with a focus of increasing physical activity, and iteratively establish the&#xD;
      feasibility, credibility and acceptability of the programs and research procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conceptual model of adaptation of the general 3RP to obese osteoarthritis patients with&#xD;
      depression that specifically target improved function through combining mind body skills with&#xD;
      physical activity, and recommendations of multimodal programs to improve outcomes in chronic&#xD;
      pain clinical trials. Adaptations of the multimodal general 3RP will be done consistent with&#xD;
      theoretical models of the fear-avoidance model of pain, cognitive model of pain and&#xD;
      depression, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness, and positive psychology. The goal&#xD;
      is to help patients engage in activities that are meaningful and mapped to each individual's&#xD;
      level of functioning and life circumstance through the use of quota-based pacing through&#xD;
      adaptation of skills to directly address improved mood, healthy lifestyle (sleep, diet),&#xD;
      correction of knee osteoarthritis misconceptions, and use of relaxation response elicitation&#xD;
      and positive psychology skills to promote awareness and calm during activities, even when&#xD;
      these are painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guiding hypothesis is that the synergistic interaction between mindfulness, adaptive&#xD;
      thinking, positive psychology, physical activity and healthy living skills of the&#xD;
      GetHealthy-OA reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression while also promoting optimal&#xD;
      mechanical loading of the cartilage thus slowing the progression of symptomatic knee OA. In&#xD;
      this project the 3RP will be iteratively adapted for the needs of knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      patients with depression and obesity with a focus on gradual increases in physical activity&#xD;
      measured with accelerometers and establish feasibility markers for the program and&#xD;
      procedures. A pilot randomized controlled trial of the GetHealthy-OA versus a time- and&#xD;
      attention-matched health enhancement control will be performed to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment procedures, feasibility and acceptability of the GetHealthy-OA and control, and&#xD;
      data collection procedures by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot randomized controlled trial (N=60 participants) of the GetHealthy-OA with a time and&#xD;
      attention matched health enhancement control will be performed. The end goal of the pilot RCT&#xD;
      is not to assess the efficacy of the GetHealthy-OA but rather to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      recruitment procedures (screening, eligibility, enrollment rates), feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the GetHealthy-OA and control intervention (adherence, retention, fidelity,&#xD;
      satisfaction, group telehealth delivery, and data collection procedures by group (adherence,&#xD;
      satisfaction, blood and urine biomarker data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single blind pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial with a time, dose and attention&#xD;
      matched health enhancement control will be conducted (N=60; approximately 5 GetHealthy-OA&#xD;
      groups and 5 control, 6-8 per group). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 design using a&#xD;
      randomization scheme developed by the statistician. Research procedures will be identical for&#xD;
      patients in GetHealthy-OA and control. The study will yield information on how participants&#xD;
      might engage differently with the intervention and control, definitive information on&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability and signal of improvement in the intervention before investment&#xD;
      of resources in the full randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GetHealthy-OA refined based on exit interviews and surveys. The control group will have&#xD;
      the same format as the GetHealthy-OA, and the control group follows the format of the Health&#xD;
      Enhancement Program. A pain specific adaptation of this program for chronic pain exists. This&#xD;
      program will be adapted for the specific needs of patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
