      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of cefiderocol after single-dose administration in&#xD;
           hospitalized paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 18 years of age with suspected or&#xD;
           confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cefiderocol after single-dose administration of&#xD;
           cefiderocol in hospitalized paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 18 years of age with&#xD;
           suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of cefiderocol after multiple-dose administration&#xD;
           in hospitalized paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 12 years of age with suspected or&#xD;
           confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the PK of cefiderocol after multiple-dose administration in hospitalized&#xD;
           paediatric patients 3 months to &lt; 12 years of age with suspected or confirmed aerobic&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, single- and multiple-dose study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of cefiderocol in hospitalized paediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single-dose phase will include 4 separate cohorts of patients, grouped according to age&#xD;
      range:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: 12 to &lt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: 6 to &lt; 12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: 2 to &lt; 6 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: 3 months to &lt; 2 years Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 in the single-dose phase will be&#xD;
           initiated in parallel. Cohort 4 will begin after safety and PK data from at least 6&#xD;
           participants from the single-dose Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 (with a minimum of 3 participants&#xD;
           from Cohort 3) have been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multiple-dose phase will include 3 cohorts according to age range (Cohorts 2, 3, and 4)&#xD;
      and will begin after safety and PK data from 6 participants in the corresponding single-dose&#xD;
      cohort have been assessed.&#xD;
