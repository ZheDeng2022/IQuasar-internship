    <textblock>
      In this research study, Cemiplimab is being evaluated as a treatment for advanced cutaneous&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma in participants who have previously received an allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This research study involves the following drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cemiplimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Everolimus or Sirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This an open-label, two cohort, phase I/II research study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
           effectiveness of Cemiplimab as a treatment for advanced cutaneous squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma in participants who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or kidney&#xD;
           transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment,&#xD;
           participant evaluations and safety follow-up visits. It is expected that about 12 people&#xD;
           will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be divided into two groups (cohorts) of allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
                stem cell recipients or kidney transplants recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell recipients will only receive the study treatment&#xD;
                drug of Cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Kidney transplant recipients will receive the study treatment drug of Cemiplimab&#xD;
                along with the immunosuppressant drugs of Everolimus or Sirolimus and Prednisone to&#xD;
                prevent kidney rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Cemiplimab as a treatment option for&#xD;
      patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell cancer, but the FDA has not approved the use&#xD;
      of Cemiplimab in participants who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplants or kidney transplants in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -- Cemiplimab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins&#xD;
      naturally found in your blood that fight infections. A monoclonal antibody is a special kind&#xD;
      of antibody that is manufactured as a medication to target specific proteins in the body that&#xD;
      may be involved this type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cemiplimab is a human monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody that works by blocking the programmed&#xD;
      death-1 (PD-1), a cell receptor on immune cells that is involved in preventing immune cells&#xD;
      from destroying other cells. Blocking the receptor is expected to help immune cells attack&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;

             form of contraception (refer to Appendix C for examples). WOCBP should plan to use an&#xD;
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for up to 7 months (30 days plus the time required&#xD;

             drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        &quot;Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)&quot; is defined as any female who has experienced&#xD;
        menarche, who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy), who is not postmenopausal, who is sexually active with a male partner.&#xD;
        Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the&#xD;
        absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55&#xD;
        must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.&#xD;

             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24&#xD;
             hours prior to the start of cemiplimab.&#xD;
&#xD;

             a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP will&#xD;
             be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose&#xD;
             of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential as defined&#xD;
             above, and azoospermic men) do not require contraception. See Appendix C for further&#xD;
             guidance on contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have unresolved&#xD;
             toxicities from prior anti-cancer therapy more than 4 weeks earlier, defined as not&#xD;
             resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
             Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), grade 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Cohort 1 allo-HSCT patients enrolling to the study, corticosteroid doses &gt; 10 mg&#xD;
             of prednisone daily or equivalent within 4 weeks of the first dose of PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
             are prohibited. For Cohort 2 renal transplant patients enrolling to the study,&#xD;
             corticosteroid use is permitted if used as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for&#xD;
             graft protection prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing significant autoimmune conditions. Patients with a history of Hashimoto&#xD;
             thyroiditis who are stable on replacement hormone therapy are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus carrier or a diagnosis of immunodeficiency. Any&#xD;
             positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating presence of&#xD;
             virus, e.g., Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, Australia antigen) positive, or&#xD;
             Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive (except if HCV-RNA negative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Kidney transplant recipients with active acute rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to cemiplimab or any of its components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior exposure to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor idelalisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who has been treated with immunotherapy. This includes prior treatment with&#xD;
             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways (including&#xD;
             chimeric antigen receptor [CAR] T cell therapies). Prior topical or intralesional&#xD;
             immunotherapies (e.g. imiquimod, talimogene laherparepvec) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with known and untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this&#xD;
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events. However, baseline brain imaging is not required prior to&#xD;
             enrollment in the study if patients are asymptomatic. Patients at least 4 weeks out&#xD;
             from metastatic central nervous system (CNS) treatment are permitted to enroll, if&#xD;
             they are asymptomatic, radiographically stable per the investigator, and on stable&#xD;
             doses of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and oral corticosteroids (for Cohort 1 only, the&#xD;
             patient must be on 10 mg of prednisone daily equivalent dosing or less, see 3.2.2) at&#xD;
             the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known non-infectious pneumonitis or any history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
