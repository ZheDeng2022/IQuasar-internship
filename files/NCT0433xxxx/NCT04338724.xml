      This is an open label, dose escalation phase I study to evaluate the clinical safety,&#xD;
      tolerability in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and to establish the Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD#, if any). This study is composed of two dose level: 1 and 3 mg/kg.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subjects must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             solid tumor(s) for which no effective standard therapy is available or tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with evaluable but non-measurable lesion are allowed to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject must have adequate organ function as indicated by laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Fertile men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method&#xD;
             of birth control from providing signed consent and for 180 days after last&#xD;
             investigational product administration. Women of childbearing potential include&#xD;
             pre-menopausal women and women within the first 2 years of the onset of menopause.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test ≤ 7 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subject must be excluded from participating in the study if the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known brain metastasis, primary central nervous system (CNS) or another CNS metastasis&#xD;
             that is either symptomatic or untreated. Central nervous system metastases that have&#xD;
             been treated by complete resection and/or radiotherapy demonstrating stability or&#xD;
             improvement are not an exclusion criterion provided they are stable as shown by&#xD;
             imaging for at least 4 weeks before Screening without evidence of cerebral edema and&#xD;
             no requirements for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with active autoimmune diseases or a history of autoimmune diseases should be&#xD;
             excluded; these include but are not limited to subjects with a history of&#xD;

             unstable angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia.): subjects who had&#xD;
             experienced such conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, apoplexia, or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day&#xD;
             1; subjects with congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association Grade ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Concurrent condition that in the investigator's opinion would jeopardize compliance&#xD;
             with the protocol.&#xD;
