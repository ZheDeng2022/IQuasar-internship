  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether giving the study drug pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      combination with the chemotherapy drugs melphalan and dactinomycin, delivered directly to the&#xD;
      affected arm or leg using a technique called isolated limb infusion (ILI), is a safe&#xD;
      treatment that can delay the time before your disease gets worse (progresses).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have any other malignancy that requires active treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of&#xD;
             progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 and return to&#xD;

             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.&#xD;
             This exception does not include sarcomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless&#xD;

                  However, in the setting of non-immune mediated indications for use,&#xD;

             drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in the past 2&#xD;
             years. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes&#xD;
             or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease.&#xD;

        definition of &quot;postmenopausal range&quot; for the laboratory involved] or who have had a&#xD;
        hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy.)&#xD;

             previously administered therapy. Patients with &lt;/= grade 2 neuropathy and alopecia are&#xD;
             an exception and may qualify for the study. If patients received major surgery, they&#xD;

             dose of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
