  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the impact of a 12-week remote dietitian supervised&#xD;
      dietary and physical activity weight loss intervention and mobile app for patients with&#xD;
      morbid obesity prior to undergoing total joint arthroplasty of the hip or knee. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that that the intervention will result in: 1) greater weight loss than usual&#xD;
      care, 2) a higher percentage of patients eligible to undergo surgery by having a body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) below the standard cutoff of 40 kg/m2, and 3) a higher percentage of patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery within six months of study enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recruitment: Patients of orthopaedic surgeons (e.g. Dr. Antonia Chen, Dr. Jeffrey Lange, Dr.&#xD;
      Vivek Shah, Dr. Richard Iorio and Dr. Wolfgang Fitz) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital or&#xD;
      Mass General Hospital orthopaedic clinics will be identified as potentially eligible for the&#xD;
      study based on 1) 40 &lt; body mass index (BMI) &lt; 47 kg/m2 in the last 6 months recorded in the&#xD;
      Partners electronic medical record, and 2) recommended unilateral total joint arthroplasty.&#xD;
      Study flyers will be posted in MGH orthopedics clinics to remind clinicians that their&#xD;
      patients may be eligible for the study, or patients may directly contact the research team by&#xD;
      emailing the contact person on the flyer. For patients identified as potentially eligible&#xD;
      while in clinic, an orthopaedic surgeon will introduce the patient to the study, and a member&#xD;
      of the research team (research assistant or trainee) will conduct an eligibility screening&#xD;
      (see eligibility criteria above) and obtain verbal consent either in-person or by phone. For&#xD;
      patients identified as potentially eligible outside of clinic, a member of the research team&#xD;
      will call the patient to introduce the study, and conduct eligibility screening and consent&#xD;
      on the phone. Research staff may also contact these patients by email or via Patient Gateway&#xD;
      to help coordinate a time convenient for staff to call the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested, eligible, and consented subjects will be provisionally enrolled and each subject&#xD;
      (both intervention and standard care participants) will be shipped a standard bathroom scale&#xD;
      that they will keep even after the study concludes. Subjects will be asked to verify their&#xD;
      enrollment BMI is 40 &lt; body mass index (BMI) &lt; 47 kg/m2. Subjects can verify weights by&#xD;
      either a) submitting a photo to the study team of the home scale during a weigh-in that&#xD;
      displays their body weight, or by b) recording a baseline weight at a Partners facility. For&#xD;
      option a) subjects will submit a photo of their weight displayed on the scale to the study&#xD;
      team either by email to a study team member's Partners email address, through the mobile app,&#xD;
      or via RedCap. Subjects who are not able to confirm their enrollment BMI is within this range&#xD;
      will be removed from the study. Subjects who can confirm their enrollment BMI is within this&#xD;
      range will then be randomized to a trial arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms: Intervention participants will download the Nutrimedy telemedicine online/smartphone&#xD;
      app and be connected at enrollment with a certified registered dietitian who will contact&#xD;
      intervention participants weekly or bi-weekly via video calls and unlimited in-app text&#xD;
      messaging for up to three months. The first week will include either one 55-minute video&#xD;
      session or two 25-minute sessions. Weeks 2-4 will have weekly 25-minute video calls, and&#xD;
      weeks 5-12 will have biweekly 25-minute sessions for a total of 8-9 sessions over 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Together, participants and dietitians will come up with goals for the 12 weeks, and&#xD;
      dietitians will check on progress toward these goals using in-app tools such as food logs and&#xD;
      messaging between video calls. All patients will be encouraged to lose at least 20 pounds&#xD;
      with a goal BMI&lt;40 kg/m2 after 12 weeks. Intervention participants will additionally be asked&#xD;
      if they would be interested in completing a brief 5-minute interview in-person or by phone at&#xD;
      the end of the study (10-14 weeks after enrollment) to discuss qualitative feedback about the&#xD;
      intervention. Responses will be transcribed verbatim during the interview for later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals randomized to the usual care group will receive standard care. This may include a&#xD;
      physical therapist and/or nutritionist referral. Brigham and Women's Hospital offers several&#xD;
      programs for patients interested in losing weight, including the Nutrition Wellness Service&#xD;
      (NWS) and Program for Weight Management (PWM).&#xD;
