      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment standard for acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is largely&#xD;
      supportive care: opioid analgesics, hydration, oxygen, and blood transfusion. Sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD) is a chronic condition associated with serious and disabling acute consequences&#xD;
      such as a vaso-occlusive (VOC) or pain crisis. Uncontrolled pain is the hallmark of a VOC,&#xD;
      and often results in acute unscheduled care in the patient's clinic or hospital emergency&#xD;
      department (ED). During these pain crises, patients sometimes require high doses of opioids&#xD;
      for analgesia. Opioid analgesics are fraught with challenges including the development of&#xD;
      tolerance, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (whereby the use of opioids actually&#xD;
      makes patients more sensitive to pain). Finding non-opioid alternatives for intravenous&#xD;
      analgesia is problematic based on the limited availability this class of drugs. Ketamine is a&#xD;
      potent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that even at low doses has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy as an adjunct to opioids for acute pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the comparative efficacy of low doses of ketamine as an&#xD;
      adjunct to opioids versus standard care (opioids alone) for the treatment of acute severe&#xD;
      pain in patients with sickle cell related pain crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of ketamine 0.3mg/kg vs. placebo for the treatment of acute pain&#xD;
      crisis. The investigators will include all eligible emergency department â‰¥18 years. The&#xD;
      investigators will stratify 42 patients by location, 21 patients per site. Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS) will be recorded as a part of the study log at 0, 1, 2 and 3hrs after the study&#xD;
      drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the ketamine will decrease overall pain intensity, visit&#xD;
      length of stay, and hospitalizations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current treatment standard for acute pain crisis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is largely&#xD;
      supportive care: opioid analgesics, hydration, oxygen, and blood transfusion. Sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD) is a chronic condition associated with serious and disabling acute consequences&#xD;
      such as a vaso-occlusive (VOC) or pain crisis. Uncontrolled pain is the hallmark of a VOC,&#xD;
      and often results in acute unscheduled care in the patient's clinic or hospital emergency&#xD;
      department (ED). The pain associated with acute VOC in sickle cell disease is caused by the&#xD;
      change in the structure of red blood cells. This change leads to microvascular obstruction, a&#xD;
      decrease in laminar blood flow, diminished tissue oxygen exchange, and ultimately&#xD;
      microenvironmental changes resulting in severe pain.1 During these pain crises, patients&#xD;
      sometimes require high doses of opioids for analgesia. Poor pain control, in the setting of&#xD;
      high dose opioid administration, is the most common reason for a patient to be hospitalized&#xD;
      with acute VOC. Opioid analgesics are fraught with challenges including the development of&#xD;
      tolerance, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (whereby the use of opioids actually&#xD;
      makes patients more sensitive to pain). Finding non-opioid alternatives for intravenous&#xD;
      analgesia is problematic based on limited availability and poor side-effect profile. One&#xD;
      alternative suggested for use in patients with VOC is ketamine, a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate&#xD;
      (NMDA) antagonist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current evidence suggests that the counterintuitive effects of opioids are related to&#xD;
      activation of NMDA receptors. These effects may be more pronounced in patients with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease, as approximately half of these patients have chronic pain and are on long term&#xD;
      opioids. The NMDA receptor is activated in response to injury of inflammation, precipitating&#xD;
      heightening pain perception, and is therefore an important analgesic target for patients&#xD;
      receiving opioids. Ketamine is a potent NMDA receptor antagonist that even at low doses has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy as an adjunct to opioids for acute pain control. Multiple emergency&#xD;
      department studies have shown that low doses of ketamine, &lt;1mg/kg, provides analgesic&#xD;
      effects, decreases pain scores, and decreases total opioid use.2-4 While these studies do not&#xD;
      focus specifically on adult patients with SCD, ketamine has shown promise in similar&#xD;
      pediatric populations. Unfortunately, there are no high-quality studies examining ketamine&#xD;
      usage in adult patients with SCD, making highly addictive opioid medications the standard for&#xD;
      pain relief during a crisis. The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of one&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesic, ketamine, in the treatment of acute pain in a vulnerable patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIM: The investigators will determine the comparative efficacy of low doses of&#xD;
      ketamine as an adjunct to opioids versus standard care (opioids alone) for the treatment of&#xD;
      acute severe pain in patients with sickle cell related pain crisis. The investigators propose&#xD;
      a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed by patient-reported pain intensity and use of rescue opioid analgesia. Adverse&#xD;
      events, length of the encounter, and hospitalization will be evaluated as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that the ketamine will decrease overall pain intensity, visit&#xD;
      length of stay, and hospitalizations. The investigators will enroll patients at both a&#xD;
      community hospital emergency department and a tertiary care, academic center. Both locations&#xD;
      evaluate and treat patients with acute VOC and will provide an adequate volume for this pilot&#xD;
      trial. At the end of this study the investigators expect to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ketamine in the treatment of acute pain in patients with SCD presenting after a VOC. Our team&#xD;
      is composed of physician-scientists, competent and confident in conducting both clinical and&#xD;
      methodological aspects of the trial.&#xD;
