  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TMW Center is launching a community-wide demonstration project in partnership with the&#xD;
      Children's Services Council of Palm Beach County, Florida, in which the TMW interventions&#xD;
      will be delivered at scale through partners who work with families across health, education,&#xD;
      and social service systems. The goal of this partnership is to reach 60% of all families with&#xD;
      children age birth through three with at least one TMW intervention over the five-year&#xD;
      partnership, with a significant percentage of families receiving more than one intervention.&#xD;
      The TMW Center will evaluate the efficacy of the multiple intervention approach in impacting&#xD;
      parent knowledge, beliefs, and behavior and child developmental outcomes, and develop an&#xD;
      implementation model that can be used in other communities.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment community will consist of all participants enrolled in one or more of the 3Ts&#xD;
      Interventions (3Ts-Newborn, 3Ts-Well Baby, 3Ts-Let's Talk!) The 3Ts interventions, the&#xD;
      educational curricula designed by the TMW Center) were named for the three easy to use&#xD;
      strategies that are shared with parents to support their child's development: Tune In, Talk&#xD;
      More, and Take Turns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare outcomes and evaluate effectiveness of the interventions, a comparison community&#xD;
      will be selected beginning in 2021. To define the sample of comparison families, the TMW&#xD;
      Center and CSC will work to find a comparison hospital with similar socioeconomic&#xD;
      characteristics and child developmental outcomes as the treated community. Then within this&#xD;
      comparison group, the researchers will define a sample of comparison families who have&#xD;
      similar individual characteristics as the treated families (based on data shared by CSC and&#xD;
      baseline data the researchers will collect). They will complete the same surveys as the&#xD;
      treatment community but will not be offered the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following describes the ideal progression through the full intervention and study&#xD;
      timeline. However, participants are able to join during any intervention time point (e.g.&#xD;
      3Ts-Newborn, or the third 3Ts-Well Baby video time point, etc), even if they have not&#xD;
      completed previous study measures. Whenever a participant engages 3Ts interventions for the&#xD;
      first time, they will complete the eConsent module prior to receiving any intervention&#xD;
      content. They will complete only the surveys applicable to the time point of their enrollment&#xD;
      and beyond, according to the study timeline. Similarly, if they choose to skip certain&#xD;
      interventions or survey time points, they will still be able to complete the later time&#xD;
      points. The researchers will not ask participants to complete any missed intervention or&#xD;
      survey time points or require them to complete any skipped interventions or surveys.&#xD;
      Participants selected in the comparison group will complete only the activities here labeled&#xD;
      'Data Collection.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Baseline These measures will be collected at the parent's first interaction&#xD;
      with the TMW study, regardless of intervention time point. Following the eConsent,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to provide contact information and basic demographic information&#xD;
      (parent name, parent DOB, child DOB). Then participants will be asked to fill out one survey,&#xD;
      the Survey of Parental Expectations and Knowledge about Language Learning (SPEAK) that assess&#xD;
      their knowledge and beliefs of child language and cognitive development. The version of the&#xD;
      SPEAK to be used will depend on the child's age and at which intervention they are completing&#xD;
      the baseline measures. If the participant's baseline is at the 3Ts-Newborn Intervention, the&#xD;
      parent will complete SPEAK-20. If done at the start of the 3Ts-Well Baby Intervention,&#xD;
      participants will complete the Baby SPEAK-10. eConsent and surveys will be collected&#xD;
      digitally through the secure online platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1: 3Ts-Newborn This intervention is completed with parents of newborns in the&#xD;
      postpartum mother-baby unit in the hospital. Participants will complete the 3Ts-Newborn&#xD;
      educational intervention as part of Florida's Universal Infant Screen. After completing the&#xD;
      eConsent module and filling out the demographics survey, parents will complete the SPEAK-20&#xD;
      survey using the tablet. After this, they will watch the 12 minute education intervention&#xD;
      video, also on the tablet. Finally, parents will complete the Baby SPEAK-10 survey using the&#xD;
      tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2: 3Ts-Well Baby The 3Ts-Well Baby Intervention will take place in&#xD;
      pediatricians' offices during regularly scheduled well child immunization appointments. All&#xD;
      parents with a child under 7 months of age who are receiving care at participating locations&#xD;
      will be offered the opportunity to complete a video intervention module at their child's&#xD;
      appointment from the ages of 1 to 6 months. This intervention will take place entirely on a&#xD;
      tablet. If a participant did not complete the 3Ts-Newborn intervention, they will complete&#xD;
      the eConsent module, demographics survey, and the Baby SPEAK-10 survey prior to viewing the&#xD;
      first educational module. Parents who return for multiple well-child appointments while the&#xD;
      child is 6 months or younger may complete up to a total of 4 educational video modules, one&#xD;
      per visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: 6 months At age six months participants will be asked to fill out the Baby&#xD;
      SPEAK-10 and PACOTIS surveys, either onsite at their pediatric visit via the tablet provided&#xD;
      by CSC partners or at home by logging into the TMW Tech Platform. The PACOTIS is a&#xD;
      self-report measure of the respondent's perceived impact on their child's development.&#xD;
      Participants in the treatment community will have access to the surveys upon completion of&#xD;
      the fourth 3Ts-Well Baby Intervention Video, while participants in the comparison group will&#xD;
      receive a notification from the TMW Tech Platform that it is time to complete the surveys.&#xD;
      These surveys will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: 9 months At age nine months, all participants will be asked to fill out two&#xD;
      surveys, the Baby SPEAK-10 and the PACOTIS. All participants will receive a notification from&#xD;
      the TMW Tech Platform that it is time to complete the surveys. These surveys, which are&#xD;
      completed through the TMW Tech Platform, will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 3: 3Ts-Let's Talk! Beginning in 2021, the 3Ts-Let's Talk! intervention will be&#xD;
      offered to parents who engage in CSC community-based programming at any time their child is&#xD;
      0-3 years old. Participants need not have completed previous interventions to be part of this&#xD;
      intervention, and if this is their first interaction with TMW, will complete the eConsent&#xD;
      module, demographics survey, and SPEAK-10. 3Ts-Let's Talk! will take place at partnering&#xD;
      community organizations and participants will review educational modules with other parents&#xD;
      in a group setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: 12 months Two weeks before the child turns 12 months, participants will be&#xD;
      receive a notification from the TMW Tech Platform that it is time to complete their next&#xD;
      surveys. They will be asked to complete the Baby SPEAK - 10 and the StimQ-Reading Subscale.&#xD;
      The StimQ is a parent report measuring parental verbal responsivity and involvement in their&#xD;
      child's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the child turns 12 months, participants will receive another notification&#xD;
      from the TMW Tech Platform asking them to complete a second set of surveys, consisting of the&#xD;
      MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Short Form Level 1 (MCDI I-SF) and the&#xD;
      PACOTIS. The MCDI I-SF is a parent report assessing children's vocabulary comprehension and&#xD;
      production, appropriate for children 8-18 months. These surveys, which are again completed&#xD;
      through the TMW Tech Platform, will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: 24 months Two weeks before the child turns 24 months, participants will&#xD;
      receive a notification from the TMW Tech Platform that it is time to complete their next&#xD;
      surveys. They will be asked to complete the SPEAK-10 and the StimQ-Reading Subscale. These&#xD;
      surveys, which are completed through the TMW Tech Platform, will take approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the child turns 24 months, participants will receive another notification&#xD;
      from the TMW Tech Platform asking them to complete a second set of surveys, consisting of the&#xD;
      MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Short Form Level 2 (MCDI II-SF) and&#xD;
      the PACOTIS. The MCDI II-SF is an extension of the MCDI-I-SF and is appropriate for ages&#xD;
      16-30 months. These surveys, which are completed through the TMW Tech Platform, will take&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: 36 months Two weeks before the child turns 36 months, participants will&#xD;
      receive a notification from the TMW Tech Platform that it is time to complete their next&#xD;
      surveys. They will be asked to complete the SPEAK-10 and the StimQ-Reading Subscale. These&#xD;
      surveys, which are completed through the TMW Tech Platform, will take approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after the child turns 36 months, parents will receive another notification from the&#xD;
      TMW Tech Platform asking them to complete a second set of surveys, consisting of the&#xD;
      MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories: Short Form Level 2 (MCDI II-SF) and&#xD;
      the PACOTIS. Spanish speaking participants will not complete the MCDI II-SF at 36 months,&#xD;
      because the Spanish version does not go beyond 30 months, while an extension to 37 months has&#xD;
      recently been developed in in English. These surveys, which are completed through the TMW&#xD;
      Tech Platform, will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between study activities, participants will receive text messages to the phone number they&#xD;
      provide. These text messages will be content nudges to remind participants of ways they can&#xD;
      use the strategies learned throughout the interventions in their day to day life. For&#xD;
      example, &quot;remember to use the 3Ts to build baby's brain while driving to school!&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have online access to additional educational videos and resources.&#xD;
      These resources are optional and parents can view as many or as few as they wish throughout&#xD;
      the course of the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 3-years of age</time_frame>
    <description>Measures parental knowledge and expectations of how their children learn language at different ages. Some items about beliefs of appropriate age of exposure are rated on a 6-point scale ranging from: 1 &quot;As an infant (0 to 6 moths)&quot; to 6 &quot;In elementary school (6 years and up)&quot; Other items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (definitely true), 2 (probably true), 3 (probably not true) to 4 (definitely not true). Scores range from 0 to 71, and scoring of each item is based a criterion scale, with 0 points given to the most incorrect response and 1 additional point given to each progressively more correct response. A higher score correlates to a better outcome and indicates a higher parental knowledge.</description>
