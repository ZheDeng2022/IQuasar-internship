      The investigators propose to investigate the effect of intraoperative FICB and&#xD;
      intrafragmentary fracture blockade on postoperative pain and opiate consumption using a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial study design. There will be three treatment groups: (1) fascia&#xD;
      iliaca compartment blockade administered after surgical fixation using the loss of resistance&#xD;
      technique with 30cc 0.25% marcaine (2) intrafragmentary fracture block using fluoroscopy&#xD;
      guidance after surgical fixation with 30cc 0.25% marcaine and (3) placebo group, with no&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of fragility hip fractures in elderly patients is increasing steadily in the&#xD;
      United States and worldwide, and the mortality, morbidity and economic impact of this injury&#xD;
      is staggering. The injury itself can result in severe pain, both preoperatively and&#xD;
      throughout the perioperative course. These patients are also at increased risk for delirium.&#xD;
      They are by definition elderly, and often have multiple comorbidities in addition to&#xD;
      underlying cognitive dysfunction. Current studies estimate that the incidence of delirium&#xD;
      after a hip fracture approaches 30%, and there is a well-established though not completely&#xD;
      understood interaction between opioid use in elderly patients and delirium. Pain and delirium&#xD;
      are not only poor outcomes in themselves, but they can also interfere with the rehabilitation&#xD;
      necessary for a successful outcome after hip fracture surgery. For this reason, the topic of&#xD;
      multimodal pain management in hip fracture patients has gained considerable traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One popular &quot;opioid-sparing&quot; strategy in these patients is regional pain blockades,&#xD;
      administered by an anesthesia block team or by emergency room physicians. Due to the&#xD;
      neuroanatomy of the hip region, which has sensory innervations from the sciatic, femoral, and&#xD;
      obturator nerve, with lesser contributions from the nerve to quadratus femoris and superior&#xD;
      gluteal nerve, effective regional blockade of the hip joint with existing methods can be a&#xD;
      challenge. One commonly employed and researched block is the fascia iliaca compartment block&#xD;
      (FICB), a regional block administered under ultrasound guidance or anatomical landmarks that&#xD;
      targets the femoral nerve, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and to a lesser extent, the&#xD;
      obturator nerve. Various studies of FICB and the closely related femoral nerve block have&#xD;
      demonstrated benefits in pain control, ease of positioning, and reduction in opiate use, and&#xD;
      systematic reviews have concluded that the fascia iliaca compartment block is a useful and&#xD;
      safe method to enhance preoperative pain control in hip fracture patients. However, prior&#xD;
      research has focused on the preoperative period, with blocks placed by an anesthesia team or&#xD;
      emergency room physicians shortly after presentation and diagnosis of a hip fracture.&#xD;
      Additionally, no distinction is made between intracapsular or extracapsular hip fractures,&#xD;
      except in scattered post-hoc analyses. Our project aims to investigate the efficacy of a FICB&#xD;
      administered intraoperatively by the operating surgeon on extracapsular hip fracture&#xD;
      patients. In addition, the investigators propose investigating intrafragmentary blockade at&#xD;
      the fracture site itself. Fracture hematoma blocks are used extensively in orthopedics, and&#xD;
      have demonstrated pain control equivalent to conscious sedation for the manipulation of ankle&#xD;
      and distal radius fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to investigate the effect of intraoperative FICB and&#xD;
      intrafragmentary fracture blockade on postoperative pain and opiate consumption using a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial study design. There will be three treatment groups: (1) fascia&#xD;
      iliaca compartment blockade administered after surgical fixation using the loss of resistance&#xD;
      technique with 30cc 0.25% marcaine (2) intrafragmentary fracture block using fluoroscopy&#xD;
      guidance after surgical fixation with 30cc 0.25% marcaine and (3) placebo group, with no&#xD;
      intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur at time of enrollment using unmarked envelopes. After consent,&#xD;
      patients will be assigned a study ID that will be transcribed on the opaque envelope. The&#xD;
      envelope will be unsealed in the operating room at time of surgery to determine the planned&#xD;
      intervention, and it's contents will not be made available to the study personnel gathering&#xD;
      postoperative pain data. The envelopes and randomization assignments will be kept in a&#xD;
      locked, secured location. The only study personnel who will be unblinded are the operating&#xD;
      surgeon and residents and physican assistants assisting in the operating room. Study&#xD;
      personnel who participate in the case will not collect postoperative pain data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will monitor various safety outcomes, including perioperative cardiac or&#xD;
      respiratory events, mortality, and escalation of care (i.e. SICU transfer). Each adverse&#xD;
      event will be analyzed by the senior operating surgeons to determine if the study&#xD;
      intervention could have had a role in the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our outcome measurements are pain visual analogue scores and narcotic use postoperatively.&#xD;
      Calculations of narcotic use will be standardized to IV morphine equivalents. The associated&#xD;
      primary and secondary hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary: There is a statistically significant difference in pain visual analogue scale&#xD;
           (VAS) between extracapsular hip fracture patients treated intraoperatively with fascia&#xD;
           iliaca block, fracture block, or conventional analgesia in the first 24 hours&#xD;
           postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary: There is a statistically significant difference in opioid consumption&#xD;
           (measured in IV morphine equivalents / time) between extracapsular hip fracture patients&#xD;
           treated intraoperatively with fascia iliaca block, fracture block, or conventional&#xD;
           analgesia in the first 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will be focused on elderly patients with low energy extracapsular&#xD;
      (intertrochonteric, subtrochanteric) hip fractures. Inclusion criteria will include age 60&#xD;
      years or older, low energy mechanism (i.e. mechanical or syncopal fall from ground level),&#xD;
      and extracapsular location as defined on AP and lateral radiographs of the hip. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria includes polytrauma patients with multiple injuries, high energy mechanisms (i.e.&#xD;
      pedestrian struck, motor vehicle collision, fall from height), inability for the patient to&#xD;
      consent for themselves, pathologic fracture types (secondary to tumor or atypical fractures&#xD;
      due to bisphosphonate use), and intolerance or allergies to opioids or local anethestics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size projections target a sample of 105 patients, 35 in each group. This is based on&#xD;
      calculation of 80% power to detect a 10mm difference in the VAS score using means and&#xD;
      standard deviations from previous publications with measurements of pain scores in hip&#xD;
      fracture patients. Since the duration of followup is limited to the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period, the investigators do not anticipate a significant drop out or loss-to-follow up rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will occur in the emergency department by study personnel. After diagnosis of an&#xD;
      extracapsular hip fracture is made, the exclusion and inclusion criteria will be reviewed,&#xD;
      and eligible patients will be approached for voluntary participation in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study personnel will obtain consent in the emergency room or shortly after admission to the&#xD;
      floor. Please find attached the planned consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention, marcaine for regional blockade, has been studied extensively, and&#xD;
      has been demonstrated to be safe. The risk of intravascular introduction of lidocaine is&#xD;
      possible, but exceedingly rare. Per standarad procedure, the investigators will plan to&#xD;
      aspirate the syringe before injection to confirm extravascular targeting. Another known risk&#xD;
      of regional blockade is muscle weakness in the immediate postoperative period due to blockade&#xD;
      of motor nerves. If not appropriately managed, this could create a risk of falling. Patients&#xD;
      are routinely assessed by physical therapy for strength and muscle control before attempting&#xD;
      ambulation postoperatively, and this will continue to be the practice. Furthermore,&#xD;
      postoperative hip fracture patients, if they do ambulate post operative day 0, are closely&#xD;
      assisted by physical therapists, reducing the risk of fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between study groups in regards to their baseline characteristics and outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed using two-sided Fisher's exact tests, chi-square tests for categorical&#xD;
      variables, and independent samples student T-tests for continuous variables. The&#xD;
      investigators will plan to undertake a multivariable analyses as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality and Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use a REDCap database for data collection and monitoring. Patient&#xD;
      specific data will be entered by study personnel into the REDCap database after completion of&#xD;
      the patient's intervention and postoperative followup. This will avoid disrupting the&#xD;
      blinding of study personnel gathering postoperative pain data. Postoperative narcotic use&#xD;
      will be gathered from a chart review of ordered and administered medications.&#xD;
