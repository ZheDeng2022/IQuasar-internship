  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only 59% of Alaska Native people have been adequately screened for colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      despite having the highest reported incidence of CRC in the world. A new at-home multi-target&#xD;
      stool DNA screening test (MT-sDNA; CologuardÂ®) with high sensitivity for pre-cancerous polyps&#xD;
      and CRC is now available. MT-sDNA has not been tested for feasibility or acceptability within&#xD;
      the Alaska tribal health care delivery system, and it is unknown whether use of this new test&#xD;
      will increase Alaska Native CRC screening rates. The long-term study goal is to improve&#xD;
      screening and reduce CRC-attributable mortality. The objective of this application is to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of MT-sDNA for increasing CRC screening in Alaska Native communities using&#xD;
      a mixed methods, community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in collaboration with regional Tribal health organizations responsible for&#xD;
      providing health care to geographically remote Alaska Native communities. Although the&#xD;
      proposed implementation strategy is evidence-informed and promising, it is novel in that&#xD;
      MT-sDNA has not been evaluated in the tribal health setting or among rural/remote&#xD;
      populations. Using the Social Ecological Model, the research will be multi-level, examining&#xD;
      influence on patients, providers, and tribal health organizations (THOs). This research study&#xD;
      will pursue two specific aims: (1) Identify patient-, provider-, and system-level factors&#xD;
      associated with CRC screening preferences, uptake, and follow-up; and (2) test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of graded intensity MT-sDNA intervention in the Alaska Native community&#xD;
      setting. For the first aim, focus groups with Alaska Native people who are not adherent to&#xD;
      CRC screening guidelines and interviews with healthcare providers will be used to identify&#xD;
      factors for future intervention. For the second aim, a three-arm cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (high intensity with patient navigation, medium intensity with mailed&#xD;
      reminders, usual care) will provide evidence on the MT-sDNA usefulness (MT-sDNA sample&#xD;
      quality and neoplastic yield) as well as the first data on MT-sDNA follow up adherence rates&#xD;
      in the Alaska Native population, which will inform plans to scale-up the intervention model.&#xD;
      This research has the potential to sustainably improve public health by increasing CRC&#xD;
      screening rates among a rural/remote tribal population as well as provide a model for other&#xD;
      integrated health systems that provide care to high-risk or underserved populations in the&#xD;
      U.S. and worldwide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will employ a cluster-randomized design, in which twelve communities within 1-2&#xD;
      Tribal health regions will be randomized to one of the two study intervention conditions (6&#xD;
      communities per intervention), matched by community size. All Alaska Native adults aged 45-75&#xD;
      due for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening within each community will be offered the same&#xD;
      intervention. A total of 770 participants will be recruited in at least six communities per&#xD;
      study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High Intensity Intervention: Participants will receive navigated tribal health worker&#xD;
           outreach, a mailed MT-sDNA kit, mailed culturally appropriate educational material&#xD;
           describing CRC screening options available and follow-up reminders&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medium Intensity Intervention: Participants will receive mailed culturally appropriate&#xD;
           educational material describing CRC screening options available, including MT-sDNA, and&#xD;
           navigated follow-up outreach reminders&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Usual Care (Control arm): All other communities in the participating Tribal health&#xD;
           region will serve as the reference group receiving usual care (i.e., screening&#xD;
           recommendation at a clinic visit) Participants receiving the high intensity intervention&#xD;
           are expected to have a 20% increase in screening uptake while those receiving medium&#xD;
           intensity intervention will have a 10% increase in screening uptake over those receiving&#xD;
           usual care. The study will also measure MT-sDNA sample quality and neoplastic yield in&#xD;
           these remote Alaska Native communities. The investigators anticipate that the proportion&#xD;
           of MT-sDNA tests meeting quality control standards will be the same as in the general US&#xD;
           population (96%) and that pre-cancerous polyp detection rates at diagnostic post-MT-sDNA&#xD;
           colonoscopy will exceed routine clinical practice rates in the general US population&#xD;
           (52%-67%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During and following the graded intensity intervention, the investigators will survey samples&#xD;
      of patients to evaluate their awareness and response to the CRC screening intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess their perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived&#xD;
      benefits, perceived barriers, and self-efficacy relevant to CRC screening as well as measure&#xD;
      the time-to-respond and screening method used. The study will use focus groups and key&#xD;
      informant interviews to learn about factors associated with screening response. For the focus&#xD;
      groups, AN people ages 45-75 who are unscreened or non-adherent to screening guidelines&#xD;
      (colonoscopy within 10 years, sigmoidoscopy within five years, or fecal occult blood testing&#xD;
      within preceding 12 months) will be invited to provide their views on barriers to and&#xD;
      facilitators of screening, including barriers described in the literature and identified in&#xD;
      the investigators previous work. Non-adherence will be identified through tribal medical&#xD;
      records. Each focus group will last up to two hours, and will include 6-8 participants. All&#xD;
      focus groups will be stratified by gender, and focus groups will be balanced so that&#xD;
      approximately equal numbers of men and women are included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also conduct a brief survey and key informant interviews (6-8&#xD;
      clinician interviews at each location) among community health aides, providers, and tribal&#xD;
      health system administrators using validated measures of intervention feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and appropriateness to characterize provider- and system-level barriers and&#xD;
      promotors to MT-sDNA implementation.&#xD;
