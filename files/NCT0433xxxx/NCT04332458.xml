    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate motivators and barriers for physical activity in&#xD;
      patients discharged from hospital for a minor stroke or TIA. The study has a qualitative&#xD;
      research design and will be conducted by focus group interviews.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about motivators and barriers for physical activity after hospital discharge&#xD;
      for patients with a minor stroke or TIA. These patients have few and temporary symptoms and&#xD;
      are therefore discharged early from the hospital or seen in a outpatient TIA clinic. Standard&#xD;
      treatment are preventive medication and advice on self-managed lifestyle changes. Occurrence&#xD;
      of one ischemic stroke or TIA predisposes to further ischemic strokes and patients are at&#xD;
      risk of developing cognitive deficits or vascular dementia over time unless multiple&#xD;
      preventive measures are taken including physical activity. The purpose is to investigate&#xD;
      motivators and barriers for physical activity after hospital discharge by focus-group&#xD;
      interviewing this potential fragile group of patients. The research team want to facilitate&#xD;
      the patients to be physically active and thereby prevent a recurrent stroke and slow the&#xD;
      progression of vascular diseases.&#xD;
