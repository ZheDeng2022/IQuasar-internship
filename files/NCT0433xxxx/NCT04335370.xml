  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF&#xD;
      patients and is punctuated by episodes of acute exacerbation that require antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant bacterial pathogen isolated in patients&#xD;
      with acute exacerbations, and practice guidelines recommend combination antibiotics directed&#xD;
      against this pathogen as initial therapy. Such therapy traditionally consists of an&#xD;
      antipseudomonal beta-lactam with either an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone or an&#xD;
      aminoglycoside. With growing P. aeruginosa multi-drug resistance, more adult patients present&#xD;
      with isolates resistant to these traditional options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polymyxins are a class of cyclic peptide antibiotics that exert bactericidal activity&#xD;
      through binding to the lipopolysaccharide component of gram-negative bacterial membranes and&#xD;
      include colistin and polymyxin B (PMB). In recent years, there is growing evidence of&#xD;
      increased rates of acute kidney injury associated with colistin in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      Additionally, population pharmacokinetic (PK) studies suggest that fixed drug dosing may&#xD;
      yield an improved therapeutic index over the traditional weight-based dosing of this agent.&#xD;
      Thus there is growing interest in use of PMB as an alternative in CF acute exacerbations but&#xD;
      the optimal dosage regimen is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-interventional study to characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety of fixed-dose PMB in adult patients with CF by measuring serum&#xD;
      concentrations in patients receiving IV therapy as a part of routine care. This study will&#xD;
      help to validate existing population PK models and allow for adjustment of patient specific&#xD;
      covariates (i.e. weight, renal function) unique to adult patients with CF. The study will&#xD;
      also monitor for nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity to determine if PMB has an acceptable&#xD;
      margin of safety in this patient population. This investigation is the first to prospectively&#xD;
      validate the pharmacokinetics and toxicities of fixed-dose PMB in CF and will guide optimal&#xD;
      use of this compound in the management of acute pulmonary exacerbations.&#xD;
