  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment of peri-implantitis can be regenerative or resective, depending on defect&#xD;
      configuration. The aim of resective therapy of peri-implantitis is to reduce the severity of&#xD;
      soft tissue inflammation and stabilize crestal bone levels whilst reducing probing&#xD;
      depths.This will be a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which two resective&#xD;
      peri-implantitis protocols will be assessed. The aim of this trial is to compare a resective&#xD;
      approach in the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis (decontamination performed with&#xD;
      titanium brushes and sterile saline) with a resective approach combined with implantoplasty.&#xD;

      The aim of the present multicenter randomized controlled trial is to compare a resective&#xD;
      approach in the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis (decontamination performed with&#xD;
      titanium brushes and sterile saline) with a resective approach combined with implantoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probing depth (PD) dicrease is defined as the primary pitcome of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis Based upon previous evidence, our research hypothesis is that the test&#xD;
      group (implantoplasty + resective approach) will perform better than the control group&#xD;
      (resective surgery alone), namely the alternative hypothesis, in terms of defect resolution&#xD;
      (probing depth decrease, absence of bleeding and/or suppuration and absence of progressive&#xD;
      bone loss), 18 months after the surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods The present study has a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial design in which subjects will be consecutively enrolled according to defined&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two centers participating in this study are: Department of&#xD;
      Periodontics and Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade and&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology and Protshodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, Policlinico Umberto&#xD;
      I, Rome, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 patients diagnosed with severe peri-implantitis and requiring surgical treatment of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 patients with peri-implantitis will be treated in each center. The subjects willing to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be given a detailed description of the procedure and follow-up&#xD;
      appointments, and will sign a written informed consent form. CONSORT (Consolidated Standards&#xD;
      of Reporting Trials) guidelines for clinical trials will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group: resective surgery with bone recontouring + implantoplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: resective surgery with bone recontouring+ decontamination protocol (Ti&#xD;
           brush and sterile saline) The randomization- and therefore the group assignment of the&#xD;
           patient- will be disclosed after flap reflection. The randomization sequence will be&#xD;
           generated by a computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: due to the nature of the implantoplasty procedure, it is not possible to blind the&#xD;
      outcome assessors because the plastied surface is easily recognizable compared to a rough,&#xD;
      non-plastied surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent followed by clinical examination, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the patient is included, diagnosis, radiographic and photographic documentation&#xD;
           collection. Diagnosis will be assigned after a complete periodontal chart of all teeth&#xD;
           and implants is performed. This will be executed once the prosthetic restoration is&#xD;
           removed. Once the clinical visit is concluded the prosthesis will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline examination with clinical parameters' recording. Clinical parameters will be&#xD;
           recorded by a single examiner, different from the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis by means of professional cleaning of teeth&#xD;
           and implants, scaling and root planing, and CHX mouth rinse, to decrease inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of clinical parameters and evaluation of the study defect. Initially the&#xD;
           defect will be evaluated pre-surgically. If the surgical inspection of the defect&#xD;
           reveals that it does not have the desired characteristics (Class II, eventually Class&#xD;
           IIIa and Class IIIb), the defect will be treated according to a regenerative surgical&#xD;
           protocol, (the patient will therefore be excluded from the study and exempted from all&#xD;
           future study procedures). In alternative, if deemed hopeless the implant may also be&#xD;
           removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Removal of prosthesis and placement of healing abutments, to be kept after the surgical&#xD;
           procedure unless the implant is visible, and it is esthetically mandatory to deliver the&#xD;
           prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following local anesthesia application, intrasulcular incisions will be performed, and&#xD;
      full-thickness flaps shall be reflected on the buccal and lingual aspects of the affected&#xD;
      implants. After the exposure of the implants, thorough degranulation of the defect by means&#xD;
      of titanium and carbon curettes will be performed, followed by sterile saline rinses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group implants will be treated by means of implantoplasty. Exposed threads of the&#xD;
      implant will be removed by the protocol proposed by Ramel et al: diamond burs (106-, 40-,&#xD;
      15-mm) followed by Arkansas stone. Copious sterile saline irrigation will follow. Following&#xD;
      the implantoplasty procedure, CHX gel 0.2% will be applied for 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, a decontamination protocol containing mechanical debridement with&#xD;
      Ti-brush, followed by sterile saline solution on cotton pellets and CHX gel 0.2% for 2&#xD;
      minutes, followed by thorough rinsing with saline will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Think about local antimicrobial application, there is a product called GelCide, we started&#xD;
      using it here at the Department The suprabony component in both groups will be removed and&#xD;
      bone recontouring will be performed, when indicated. Mucoperiosteal flaps will be adjusted&#xD;
      and closed with single interrupted sutures. Prosthetic constructions will be reconnected.&#xD;
      Patients will be prescribed systemic antibiotic (Augmentin 1 g twice per day) for 1 week and&#xD;
      0.2% CHX rinse, twice daily, for 14 d following surgery. If the patient is allergic to&#xD;
      penicillins, clindamycin 300 mg TID will be used instead). The duration of the surgery (time&#xD;
      in minutes) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, as well as 6, and 12, and 18 months following the surgical treatment, following&#xD;
      data will be acquired:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical attachment level (CAL), distance in millimeters from:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the case of bone-level implants implant-abutment connection to the deepest probing&#xD;
           point (mm). In the case of tissue level implants, CAL will be measured as the distance&#xD;
           between the smooth-rough surface interface to the deepest probing point (mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probing depth (PD), measured as distance from the mucosal margin to the bottom of the&#xD;
           probeable pocket (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bleeding on probing (BOP), evaluated as present if bleeding was evident within 30 s&#xD;
           after probing, or absent, if no bleeding was noticed with- in 30 s after probing.&#xD;
           Profuse bleeding will be recorded based upon recent evidence that many implant have&#xD;
           pinpoint bleeding even if healthy, which could possibly be due to tissue trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Plaque index by Silness and Loe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mucosal recession on buccal aspect of the implant; bone level implants: distance from&#xD;
           the implant platform to the gingival margin; Tissue level implants: distance between the&#xD;
           smooth-rough surface interface to the gingival margin (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Keratinized tissue width (KTW), as the distance from mucosal margin to the mucogingival&#xD;
           line at the buccal and lingual aspect of each implant, 4 sites per implant (mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Keratinized tissue thickness (KTT). This will be measured clinically, with an endodontic&#xD;
           file with silicon disc stop and a digital caliper. The measurement will be conducted in&#xD;
           the mesial line angle (m), distal line angle (d) and mid-buccal (b), in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic analysis: radiographs will be conducted at baseline/ pre-surgical, 6 months, 12&#xD;
      months, 18 months, 24 months. Intraoral radiographs will be performed with a standardized&#xD;
      technique to ensure that the periapicals are comparable for each patient between consecutive&#xD;
      time-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographic documentation: photographs will be conducted at baseline/ pre-surgical, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes - Success criteria The resolution of peri-implant disease, treatment&#xD;
      success, will be defined as probing pocket depth ≤5 mm, absence of bleeding and/or&#xD;
      suppuration on probing, and no additional bone loss (when comparing the 2 week radiograph and&#xD;
      the 6-, 12- and 18-month radiograph).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success criteria proposed by Buser et al. and Cochran et al. will be followed as well at&#xD;
      each recall after the treatment. An implant will be considered successful if shows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. absence of clinically detectable mobility ii. absence of pain or any other subjective&#xD;
      sensation iii. absence of recurrent peri-implant infection iv. absence of continuous&#xD;
      peri-implant radiolucency.&#xD;
