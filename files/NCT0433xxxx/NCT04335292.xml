  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II single-armed study will examine the clinical utility of retreating patients&#xD;
      with osimertinib, in the third-line, following first-line treatment with osimertinib and&#xD;
      second-line treatment with platinum and pemetrexed chemotherapy. The current standard of care&#xD;
      for first-line Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung&#xD;
      Cancer (aNSCLC) is osimertinib, followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The repeat of osimertinib following previous treatment failure is investigational, although&#xD;
      supported by scientific rationale. The dosing and scheduling of osimertinib follows its use&#xD;
      in approved settings. The investigators examine its tolerability and efficacy in this setting&#xD;
      to ensure osimertinib is a safe third-line option for patients with Epidermal Growth Factor&#xD;
      Receptor mutated (EGFR+) Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(aNSCLC).&#xD;
