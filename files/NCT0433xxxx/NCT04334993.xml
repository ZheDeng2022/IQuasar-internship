  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent therapeutic advancements, the outcome of young adults with&#xD;
      Philadelphia-negative (Ph-neg) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma&#xD;
      (LBL) remains unsatisfactory, especially in those patients with high-risk disease features.&#xD;
      In young adults pediatric-based chemotherapy approaches improve outcome. Furthermore, there&#xD;
      is evidence that pre-transplant antibody-based therapy may render patients with positive&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD+) to an MRD-negative status (MRD-) and that this may be&#xD;
      associated with improved post-transplant outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is prospective study to evaluate the potential benefit of a modified pediatric-based&#xD;
      approach in young adults with Ph-neg ALL. Safety and efficacy of pre-transplant&#xD;
      antibody-based consolidation in high-risk patients with Ph-neg ALL will be performed.&#xD;

      This is a national, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the potential benefit of&#xD;
      a modified pediatric-based approach in young adults with Ph-neg ALL. Safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      pre-transplant antibody-based consolidation in high-risk patients with Ph-neg ALL will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young-adult patients eligible with Ph-neg ALL, LBL and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)&#xD;
      will undergo risk stratification and started on the pediatric Italian Association of&#xD;
      Pediatric Hematology Oncology-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (AIEOP-BFM) 2009 protocol. Patients&#xD;
      defined as having non-high-risk disease features (non-HR) as defined by MRD and/or&#xD;
      cytogenetic criteria will complete the non-HR chemotherapy arm per protocol. Patients&#xD;
      designated as having HR disease features after 2 induction blocks will be treated with CNS&#xD;
      directed block followed by up to 2 cycles of blinatumomab (for B-cell ALL) followed by&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All patients will be centrally assessed for MRD and for&#xD;
      Ph-like status.&#xD;
