  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a robust body of research suggesting that the use of pre-surgical orthopedic devices&#xD;
      prior to definitive cleft lip/nose repair results in significant improvement of facial&#xD;
      aesthetics with long term follow up. However, in recent surveys of the cleft centers in the&#xD;
      US, only 30% of cleft centers offer PSIOs, and only 13% routinely report its use.&#xD;
      Accordingly, thirty percent of centers utilize a two-stage cleft lip/nose repair in the&#xD;
      centers' algorithm (1st: lip adhesion; 2nd: final lip repair). The major drawback to a&#xD;
      two-stage cleft procedure is the administration of two general anesthetics to an infant&#xD;
      before the age of one year. There is a growing amount of evidence that multiple anesthetic&#xD;
      experiences before a certain age could affect brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is difficult to make inferences as to why clinicians are not utilizing surgical aids to&#xD;
      decrease the size of the cleft width, but even when PSIO is offered, caregivers experience&#xD;
      additional, potentially prohibitive challenges. In one study, caregivers traveled an average&#xD;
      of 70 miles to visit the nearest cleft center offering pre-surgical orthopedic devices. As&#xD;
      these devices are created by hand every 1-2 weeks after seeing the child in clinic, parents&#xD;
      are required to travel to clinic multiple times per month. Not surprisingly, infants who were&#xD;
      first-born and those who did not have other siblings were more likely to receive pre-surgical&#xD;
      orthopedic treatment than infants who were residing with other siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the benefits of PSIOs and the barriers both to healthcare systems and patients'&#xD;
      families associated with PSIOs in its current form, a new form of pre-surgical clinical&#xD;
      management is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate JHH's current clinical performance in addressing unilateral cleft lip and nasal&#xD;
           deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elucidate the difference in preoperative cleft size and in surgical management/outcomes&#xD;
           for patients who received PSIOs through 3D-printed devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using the above maxillofacial growth data with and without PSIOs, the investigators aim&#xD;
           to create an algorithm to predict maxillofacial growth for each individual patient to&#xD;
           design pre-sequenced custom PSIO devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 7000 babies are born with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate in the United States&#xD;
      per year. Globally, this defect is staggeringly common, with 100,000 new cases per year. This&#xD;
      defect is due to a failure of normal fusion between facial structures, causing a full&#xD;
      thickness gap of the upper lip involving skin, muscle, and other connective tissue. Due to&#xD;
      aberrant insertion of the muscle underlying the lip as well as abnormal formation of deeper&#xD;
      facial structures, the nose is also displaced inferiorly, laterally, and posteriorly. The&#xD;
      wider the cleft, the more challenging the repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current best practice in treating unilateral cleft lip and nose deformity involves&#xD;
      presurgical infant orthopedics (PSIOs). PSIOs involves presurgically treating the deformity&#xD;
      using custom orthodontics to gradually bring the two halves of the cleft together, reducing&#xD;
      defect size and enabling complete repair with one surgery during early infancy. However,&#xD;
      creation of these molds is time consuming and requires the expertise of a cleft orthodontist&#xD;
      and weekly visits to the hospital for device advancement. As not all cleft centers have a&#xD;
      specialized cleft orthodontist-including Johns Hopkins Hospital-many are unable to provide&#xD;
      presurgical infant orthopedics. Weekly travel to cleft centers can also pose a significant&#xD;
      temporal and financial burden to families, as the average patient is located over 60 miles&#xD;
      from the nearest cleft center. In a recent survey of cleft centers in the United States, only&#xD;
      30% of these centers are able to provide presurgical orthopedic molding devices in treatment&#xD;
      protocols. These centers therefore correct wide clefts with a staged, two-surgery approach.&#xD;
      This approach is often less successful in both adequately aligning the gum and in repairing&#xD;
      nasal defects, and usually requires intensive orthodontics and additional surgeries in&#xD;
      adolescence. As the defect is not fully corrected in infancy, children are additionally&#xD;
      subjected to the emotional and psychological difficulty and damage to self-esteem associated&#xD;
      with the persistent defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of 3D printing technology, the investigators are now in the planning stages&#xD;
      of implementing a new clinical protocol to bring PSIOs to Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH). A&#xD;
      cleft orthodontist at an equipped center will remotely design these orthodontic molds, which&#xD;
      will then be 3D printed using dental acrylic (the same material currently used in&#xD;
      hand-fabricated orthodontic models) and given to patients in the investigators' clinic. As&#xD;
      planning these devices for 3D printing can be done remotely in a fraction of the time it&#xD;
      would take to create each one by hand, this change in clinical practice will eliminate the&#xD;
      need for an in-person specialized craniofacial orthodontist on faculty where one does not&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study seeks to elucidate both the investigators' current standard of cleft&#xD;
      practice and the benefits the investigators hope to see after implementing this change in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The investigators expect that although the investigators will initially&#xD;
      create each new mold after a weekly hospital visit with in-person measurements, the&#xD;
      investigators ultimately aim to develop an algorithm to predict early growth and development&#xD;
      of the newborn's facial skeleton and soft tissue. This will allow the fabrication of&#xD;
      sequential pre-surgical orthopedic molding devices based of the infant's predicted facial&#xD;
      growth, which can be delivered en bloc to the infants home, thereby eliminating the need for&#xD;
      frequent visits to geographically inconvenient centers. After 4-5 months of using these&#xD;
      devices, the bony cleft gap will be closed, the nose straightened, and the child be ready for&#xD;
      the definitive cleft lip and nose repair in a single surgery. These devices will not only&#xD;
      physically close the gap of the cleft lip deformity, but will also close the gap in access to&#xD;
      the necessary specialists for the ideal management of cleft deformities across the country.&#xD;
      With this technology, any cleft center can offer naso-alveolar molding to every child born&#xD;
      with cleft lip and palate in the country.&#xD;
