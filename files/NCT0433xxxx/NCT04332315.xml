      Introduction and Hypothesis: Vaginally assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (VALS), which is&#xD;
      a combined surgical approach where a vaginal hysterectomy is initially performed, followed by&#xD;
      transvaginal placement of synthetic mesh and laparoscopic suspension, can be an alternative&#xD;
      to overcome the dissection, suturing limitations of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. The aim of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the middle term anatomic outcomes, complication rates, and&#xD;
      operative times of patients with uterovaginal prolapse undergoing VALS with those of women&#xD;
      undergoing abdominal sacrocolpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective cohort study that evaluates operation times, anesthesia times,&#xD;
      estimated blood loss, middle term outcomes, perioperative and postoperative complications. We&#xD;
      compared the results of 47 women who had the VALS to that of 32 abdominal sacrocolpopexy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study comparing VALS method to AS with concurrent hysterectomy&#xD;
      in patients advanced symptomatic utero vaginal prolapse stage 3 or 4 according to Pelvic&#xD;
      Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system. This study was carried out from July 2015 to&#xD;
      December 2018. Women suffering from prolapse and who desired surgical correction of their&#xD;
      prolapse were included to trial. Fertile women who have not completed their family and women&#xD;
      with previous POP surgery, POP stage ≤ 2 and women who prefer conservative management or&#xD;
      uterus sparing surgery were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      from all patients before enrolment. This study was approved by the institutional review&#xD;
      board. Demographic data including age at surgery, parity, menopausal status, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), previous pelvic surgeries (hysterectomy, pelvic floor repair, etc.), and comorbidities&#xD;
      were obtained from the patient's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VALS procedure consists of two steps. First, vaginal hysterectomy or laparoscopically&#xD;
      assisted vaginal hysterectomy performed, anterior vaginal wall dissected up to bladder neck&#xD;
      starting from initial vaginal incision, posterior vaginal wall dissected from rectum starting&#xD;
      from initial vaginal incision up to distal third of posterior vaginal wall. At this step,&#xD;
      eversion of the vaginal walls with the aid of surgeon's fingers would facilitate dissection&#xD;
      sharply or bluntly. Two hand-sewn, 15 cm long, 3 cm width type 1 polypropylene meshes&#xD;
      transfixed to anterior and posterior vaginal wall with 4-6 polyglactin suture to each wall.&#xD;
      The free arms of fixed meshes are introduced to the peritoneal cavity and the vaginal vault&#xD;
      is closed with absorbable polyglactin suture. Mid urethral sling and/or perineoplasty were&#xD;
      performed vaginally before laparoscopy. After changing gloves of surgery team and setting of&#xD;
      endoscopy unit, laparoscopy phase was performed with one intraumbilical (10 mm), 3 lateral&#xD;
      abdominal (5 mm) trocars. The sacral promontory is identified and the overlying peritoneum is&#xD;
      opened up to vaginal cuff laterally to the rectum and medially to the right uterosacral&#xD;
      ligament. Two mesh strips fixated to anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum with two&#xD;
      separate no: 1 polypropylene sutures without tension. The mesh was then peritonealized with&#xD;
      absorbable interrupted extracorporeal sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS was performed via Pfannenstiel incision after total or subtotal abdominal hysterectomy was&#xD;
      performed regarding the surgeon's choice or presence of cervical pathology. Sacrocolpopexy&#xD;
      was performed similar to laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. The rectosigmoid colon was reflected to&#xD;
      the left of the midline to expose the presacral area. The sacral promontory is identified and&#xD;
      the overlying peritoneum is opened vertically with scissors by sharp dissection up to vaginal&#xD;
      cuff laterally to the rectum and medially to the right uterosacral ligament. After placing a&#xD;
      sponge stick or sizer to vagina for manipulation and easy identification of dissection plane,&#xD;
      anterior vaginal wall dissected from bladder and posterior vaginal wall dissected from&#xD;
      rectum. The surgeon has decided the limit of anterior and posterior vaginal wall dissection.&#xD;
      The type 1 polyprolene mesh cut and attached with polyprolpelene suture in a Y formation,&#xD;
      typically with 5 cm arm length, 3 cm width and 15-18 cm total length. The appropriate length&#xD;
      for each patient is determined intraoperatively. The arms of mesh transfixed to anterior and&#xD;
      posterior vaginal wall with 4-6 polyglactin suture to each wall starting from distally. Long&#xD;
      arm of mesh fixated to anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum with two separate no: 1&#xD;
      polypropylene sutures without tension. The excess mesh parts were trimmed over the sacral&#xD;
      promontory after the fixation. The mesh was then reperitonealized with absorbable sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recorded operation times, anesthesia time, additional procedures time, estimated blood&#xD;
      loss, outcomes, perioperative and postoperative complications. Anesthesia time began with the&#xD;
      anesthetic induction and ended with recovering from anesthesia and transfer of patient to&#xD;
      recovery room, including positioning, skin preparation, covering and surgical equipment set&#xD;
      up. The total operating time began with the first skin incision and ended with the last&#xD;
      closure of an incision. Exclusive operation time of index procedures was calculated by&#xD;
      subtracting the additional surgery time from the total operation time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early complications were defined as any complication that occurred during surgery or within 4&#xD;
      weeks postoperatively including injury to the bladder, bowel, vagina, ureters, or vessels;&#xD;
      wound complications; hematoma, abscess, urinary tract infection, gluteal pain, ileus, blood&#xD;
      transfusion, and mesh infection. Late complications described any complications occurred&#xD;
      during the entire follow-up period after 4 weeks such as; mesh exposition, mesh extrusion&#xD;
      mesh perforation, ileus, dyspareunia, vesicovaginal fistul, rectovaginal fistul, ureter&#xD;
      obstruction or fistulization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, subjects were evaluated for subjective and anatomic outcomes of the&#xD;
      operations by vaginal examination at 1 week and 1, 3, and 12months, every years after&#xD;
      surgery. Recurrence was defined as stage II or greater apical prolapse, with the leading edge&#xD;
      of the C point to 1 cm on either side of the introitus that requires surgical treatment.&#xD;
      Objective failure was defined as stage II or greater pelvic organ prolapse, with the leading&#xD;
      edge of the prolapse to 1 cm on either side of the introitus. Subjective failure defined as,&#xD;
      if the patients responses were &quot;no change&quot; and &quot;minimally/much worse&quot; in Patient Global&#xD;
      Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) which used to assess the outcome of surgical treatment&#xD;
      [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed after normality testing (histogram analysis and/or&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing) using IBM SPSS, version 21 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY). The student's&#xD;
      t-test was used for comparisons of normally distributed variables, the Mann-Whitney U-test&#xD;
      was used for non parametric variables, χ2 test and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare&#xD;
      categorical variables. A sample size calculation was performed by using data from von&#xD;
      Pechman's pilot study assuming that expected difference in means 0.0, standart deviation is&#xD;
      1.3 from LAS study which compares laparoscopic and open sacrocolpopexy [9, 11]. A sample size&#xD;
      of 27 for each group was calculated based on these data, 0.05, one-sided t test was estimated&#xD;
      to have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the VALS and AS techniques are not&#xD;
      equivalent.&#xD;
