  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of virtual reality technology in a telerehabilitation service is not well established&#xD;
      in Singapore. This feasibility trial aims to evaluate the benefits of using Jintronix to&#xD;
      deliver a clinic-to-home, caregiver-supervised and individualised exercise telerehabilitation&#xD;
      program to complement outpatient services and improve clinical outcomes for post-stroke&#xD;
      users.&#xD;

B. Additional comments with regards to participants' experiences in the study, if any, were also collected.</description>

    <description>2 consecutive phases of intervention for all participants using Jintronix virtual reality telerehabilitation software.&#xD;
Phase 1 consisted of 9 (3/week for 3 weeks) 45-min/session clinic-based sessions conducted by study team therapist, with concurrent caregiver training.&#xD;
Phase 2 consisted of 20 (5/week for 4 weeks) 45min/session home-based sessions supervised by trained caregiver, with telemonitoring by study team therapist.</description>

    <intervention_name>Jintronix Virtual Reality Telerehabilitation System</intervention_name>
    <description>System consists of an internet-based rehabilitation software linked to a Microsoft Kinect camera for motion detection.&#xD;
Study team therapist prescribed a list of guided exercises and therapeutic activities (games) for training of whole body, lower and upper extremities. These can be done in sitting or standing, depending on individual participant's capacity.&#xD;
Telemonitoring is done by study team therapist during each of the training day (Mondays-Fridays) of the home-based training phase. Training performance results are reviewed and training games are adjusted or changed to optimise home training.</description>
