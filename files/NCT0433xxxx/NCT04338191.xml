  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer is still fluorouracil-based&#xD;
      neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by TME surgery, followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Fluorouracil single-agent simultaneous sensitization of radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy has a pCR of about 15-20% and a tumor downgrade (ypStage 0-I) rate of about 35%.&#xD;
      However, about 30% of patients still have distant metastasis, which is the main obstacle&#xD;
      affecting the survival prognosis of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 50% -65% of patients was still stage II-III after neoadjuvant therapy. The long-term&#xD;
      follow-up shows that for patients with ypT4 after surgery, the 3-year DFS is about 50%. For&#xD;
      patients with ypN2, the 3-year DFS is less than 40%. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy to improve the survival prognosis for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FOLFOX adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival benefit than 5FU as adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment in ypStage II-III patients after neoadjuvant treatment in ADORE trial. However,&#xD;
      with the progress of neoadjuvant therapy research, more and more studies have proposed to&#xD;
      move part or all of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy to preoperative neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      due to low compliance of adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During neoadjuvant treatment, induction chemotherapy with FOLFOX / CAPEOX or consolidation&#xD;
      therapy after CRT with FOLFOX / CAPEOX had been investigated a lot. The pCR rate was 19%&#xD;
      -38%, and the tumor downstaging rate was about 50%. Another 50% of patients still had ypstage&#xD;
      II-III postoperatively. The 3-year DFS for ypStage III was only 55% even with FOLFOX as&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy. And for ypT4N0 patients with ypstage IIB-IIC, there is also a higher&#xD;
      risk of recurrence and metastasis. And it is urgent to explore new treatment strategies to&#xD;
      improve this part of patients Survival prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For locally advanced colon cancer, surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      is currently the standard treatment mode for stage II-III colon cancer. About 30% of patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced disease will relapse within 3 years, of which distant metastases are&#xD;
      more common and eventually become the main cause of death of patients. For locally advanced&#xD;
      colon cancer with a preoperative staging of T4b, the NCCN guidelines recommend surgery after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX or CAPOX regimens. In the FOxTROT study of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced colon cancer, for patients with T3&gt; 5mm or T4, after 4 courses&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen, 20.5% of patients still have T4 after&#xD;
      surgery, and 15.2% of patients had N2 disease. For this part of patients, new postoperative&#xD;
      treatment options should also be explored to improve patient survival and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the high efficiency of the three-agent FOLFOXIRI regimen in advanced colorectal&#xD;
      cancer and the success in adjuvant chemotherapy after pancreatic cancer surgery, 5FU,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin combined with irinotecan may have a synergistic effect. At present, a phase III&#xD;
      randomized controlled study (IROCAS study) in Europe is underway. For high-risk phase III&#xD;
      patients, the mFOLFOXIRI regimen is compared with mFOLFOX6 regimen adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above reasons, our center plans to further carry out &quot;multi-center, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled phase III clinical study of mFOLFOXIRI versus mFOLFOX6 adjuvant chemotherapy after&#xD;
      neoadjuvant oxaliplatin in locally advanced colorectal cancer.&quot; Improve the survival&#xD;
      prognosis of postoperative high-risk colorectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;

      This trial is a two-arm, multicenter, open labelled, prospective, randomized phase III&#xD;
      studies. Eligible patients with locally advnaced colorectal cancer receiving oxlipaltin-based&#xD;
      (less than 3 months) noeadjuvant treatment, the postoperative stage was high-risk stage II&#xD;
      (ypT4N0M0) or stage III (ypTanyN1-2M0). These high risk patients will be randomly assigned,&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either mFOLFOXIRI or FOLFOX for 3 months as adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
