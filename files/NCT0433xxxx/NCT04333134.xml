&#xD;
          2. Male body weight ≥50 kg, female body weight ≥45 kg, body mass index (BMI) between&#xD;
             ≥18.0 and ≤29.0 kg/m2, inclusive;&#xD;

             screening to 90 days after trial completion:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  rate (ie, less than 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly. Females&#xD;
                  of non-childbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Females&#xD;
                  of non-child bearing potential are defined as permanently sterile (eg, due to&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months following&#xD;
                  cessation of menses without an alternative medical cause and serum FSH levels &gt;25&#xD;
                  IU/L).&#xD;
