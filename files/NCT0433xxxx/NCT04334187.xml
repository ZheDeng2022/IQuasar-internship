    <description>The intervention is comprised of 8 weekly group MBAT sessions. Two weekly groups of about 10 participants each will be conducted. All participants will also have the option to receive nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges for four weeks as part of their time in the study. Participants will complete surveys at enrollment (baseline), immediately after their last MBAT session (around 2 months after enrollment) and one month after completing treatment (3 months post-enrollment). Surveys will assess primary and secondary outcomes and satisfaction with the intervention.</description>
