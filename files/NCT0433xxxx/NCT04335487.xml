    <textblock>
      This study evaluates two Internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT)&#xD;
      interventions: one for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and one for symptoms&#xD;
      of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Both interventions have been tailored for Canadian public&#xD;
      safety personnel (PSP). Outcomes of interest include preference for disorder-specific or&#xD;
      transdiagnostic care, engagement with the interventions, changes in symptoms and functioning,&#xD;
      and strengths and limitations of implementing ICBT with Canadian PSP.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public Safety Personnel (PSP) is a term that broadly encompasses personnel who ensure the&#xD;
      safety and security of Canadians across jurisdictions, including, but not necessarily limited&#xD;
      to, border services personnel, correctional employees, firefighters (career and volunteer),&#xD;
      operational and intelligence personnel, paramedics, police officers, public safety&#xD;
      communications officials (e.g., call centre operators/dispatchers), and search and rescue&#xD;
      personnel. As a function of their vocations, PSP are frequently exposed to potentially&#xD;
      psychologically traumatic events (e.g., threatened or actual physical assaults, sexual&#xD;
      violence, fires, and explosions) and are at risk of posttraumatic stress injuries. Results&#xD;
      from a recent survey with a large Canadian PSP sample showed 44.5% screened positive for one&#xD;
      or more mental health disorders, which is much higher than the 10.1% diagnostic rate among&#xD;
      the Canadian general public. The study showed that 23.2% of Canadian PSP screened positive&#xD;
      for PTSD, and 25.7% screened positive for two or more mental disorders. For many Canadian&#xD;
      PSP, access to in-person evidence-based care is impeded for several logistical reasons,&#xD;
      including distance from services, long waiting lists, difficulty navigating services, and the&#xD;
      cost of treatment. PSP also face attitudinal barriers, including concerns about stigma,&#xD;
      discomfort admitting to needing help, distrust of service providers, and lack of awareness of&#xD;
      their need for help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) represents a convenient method for PSP&#xD;
      to access care for mental health concerns, such as posttraumatic stress. In ICBT, clients&#xD;
      receive access to standardized lessons that provide the same information and skills as&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face CBT. In addition to weekly lessons, clients are encouraged to&#xD;
      complete homework assignments to facilitate learning. Research shows that ICBT is effective&#xD;
      at reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and there is also evidence that the findings of&#xD;
      research trials translate into routine clinic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research project is designed to compare preference for disorder-specific program&#xD;
      for PTSD (PSP PTSD Course) versus a transdiagnostic program for depression, anxiety, and PTSD&#xD;
      (PSP Wellbeing Course); both courses have been adapted to be specific to PSP (e.g., case&#xD;
      examples are relevant to PSP). The study will also examine engagement and outcomes of the&#xD;
      courses. The current study outcome variables will include: 1) usage of both courses among PSP&#xD;
      from Saskatchewan who are informed about the courses (e.g., # enrolling, completion rates,&#xD;
      use of e-therapist support); 2) symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures (e.g., treatment satisfaction, disability) from PSP participants&#xD;
      measured at 8, 26, and 52 week follow-up (and at 16 weeks for clients still engaged in&#xD;
      treatment at that time); and 3) strengths and challenges of both courses when offered to PSP.&#xD;
      In order to take part, PSP will first complete an online questionnaire and telephone&#xD;
      screening to assess whether they meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older; 2) Saskatchewan resident; 3) endorsing symptoms of posttraumatic stress, but not high&#xD;
      suicide risk or recent suicide attempts in the past year; 4) able to access and comfortable&#xD;
      using computers and the internet; 5) not seeking help primarily for alcohol and or drugs,&#xD;
      bipolar disorder, or psychotic symptoms; and 6) willing to provide an emergency contact.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be invited to choose either of the two courses. Both courses will&#xD;
      be delivered by trained providers with graduate training in psychology or social work or&#xD;
      graduate students under supervision. The programs will first be offered in Saskatchewan, and&#xD;
      should there be sufficient uptake, materials will be translated to French and the program&#xD;
      will also be offered to PSP who reside in Quebec. The primary research questions to be&#xD;
      answered include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ENGAGEMENT: How many PSP will enroll in and complete each course? How often will PSP&#xD;
           engage with therapists? How often will PSP extend support beyond 8 weeks?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OUTCOMES: What will be the impact of the each course on symptom improvement and&#xD;
           functioning at 8, 26, and 52 weeks post-enrollment (and at 16 weeks for clients still&#xD;
           engaged in treatment at that time)? What factors will predict outcomes (e.g., symptom&#xD;
           severity, demographics, engagement)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IMPLEMENTATION: What are stakeholder experiences, positive and negative, with each&#xD;
           course? What are the suggested improvements to ICBT to meet the needs of PSP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide information that will inform future use of ICBT to assist PSP with&#xD;
      symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD.&#xD;
