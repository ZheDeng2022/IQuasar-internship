    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a safe and tolerable way to improve engraftment after&#xD;
      transplant. Research studies have shown that adding nicotinamide riboside to donor cells has&#xD;
      the potential to increase blood stem cell numbers and potentially decrease the time to&#xD;
      engraftment. Also, nicotinamide riboside, TRU NIAGEN (the study drug) is a type of vitamin B&#xD;
      supplement that the general public can get without a prescription and is well tolerated.&#xD;

      This is a single-center, pilot feasibility study of NR supplementation in allogeneic (donor)&#xD;
      HCT in which the study team is seeking to obtain preliminary data on any beneficial effect of&#xD;
      increasing NAD+ levels in-vivo to facilitate engraftment. Engraftment is defined as the&#xD;
      process during which transplanted stem cells begin to grow in the bone marrow and produce new&#xD;
      white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It takes about 14 to 24 days for donor&#xD;
      cells to engraft after infusion, and the time between which blood counts fall to the time&#xD;
      when they recover is a very critical period. Transfusions are frequently required to prevent&#xD;
      bleeding and antibiotics are needed to prevent infections during this critical time period.&#xD;
      Shortening the time of engraftment decreases these risks and can improve long-term health&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of NR&#xD;
      supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate neutrophil and platelet recovery after&#xD;
      HCT&#xD;
