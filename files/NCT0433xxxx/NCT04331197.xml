  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increased prevalence of high Body mass index (BMI) all over the world.High BMI is&#xD;
      shown to have an impact on the female reproductive system.It can contribute to both ovulatory&#xD;
      and anovulatory subfertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clomiphene citrate and Letrozole have been used for treatment of infertility.Both are used&#xD;
      for induction of ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clomiphene citrate is an estrogen receptor antagonist .It increases serum FSH and it has its&#xD;
      limitation due to his antiestrogenic effect,it has an ovulation rate 70-80% but pregnancy&#xD;
      rate is only 22% because of its anti-estrogenic effect on endometrium and poor cervical mucus&#xD;
      (Legro RS et al.,2007) Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor which inhibits the production of&#xD;
      estrogen, which influences the action of the brain's hypothalamus and pituitary on the&#xD;
      functioning of the ovaries by increasing FSH.Due to the antiestrogenic effect of clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate,Letrozole can be used as an alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are comparing the effect of both medications on the outcome of the&#xD;
      induction of ovulation in women with high BMI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized controlled trial .The researchers include160 women with BMI more than 30&#xD;
      who were suffering from subfertility for more than 2 years. The investigators will randomise&#xD;
      them into 2 groups. Group A:They were prescribed 100 mg of clomiphene citrate from day 2-5 of&#xD;
      the cycle for 5 days. Group B : They were prescribed 5 mg of Letrozole from day 2-5 of the&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal ultrasound was performed on day 11 of the cycle, After at least one follicle reached&#xD;
      15 mm, The patient was encouraged to have sexual intercourse every other day for few days.The&#xD;
      patients will have a midluteal progesterone level to confirm ovulation and will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test in 2 weeks if missed period. The researchers will compare the number of mature&#xD;
      follicles, endometrial thickness on the day when there are mature follicles, occurrence of&#xD;
      pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, and miscarriages .&#xD;
