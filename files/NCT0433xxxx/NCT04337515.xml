  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in need of an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) are at risk of&#xD;
      developing graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). In certain clinical situations, the optimal&#xD;
      approach to minimize the risk of GVHD is to perform ex vivo alpha-beta T-cell depletion of&#xD;
      the donor cells. However, the CliniMACS® Device is FDA-approved only for a narrow indication.&#xD;
      All other uses of ex vivo processed cells must be done under a feasibility study protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The original CliniMACS® device (CD34 Reagent System) employs a reagent consisting of an&#xD;
      antibody that specifically binds to blood cells that express the CD34+ surface marker&#xD;
      (hematopoietic stem cells or blood stem cells). The CD34 antibody is conjugated to an&#xD;
      iron-containing particle that is only nanometers in size and safe for infusion. The&#xD;
      enrichment of CD34+ cells is accomplished by passing the antibody/magnetically-labeled cell&#xD;
      suspension through a magnetic separation column, which is provided as part of a single-use&#xD;
      disposable tubing set. Magnetically-labeled CD34+ target cells are retained within the&#xD;
      separation column, while the unlabeled cells flow through. Recovery of CD34+ cells is&#xD;
      achieved by removing the magnetic field and eluting the targeted CD34+ stem cells into a&#xD;
      collection bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On January 24, 2014, the FDA approved the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System as a Humanitarian Use&#xD;
      Device for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) in first complete remission undergoing allogeneic HCT from a matched related&#xD;
      donor. Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) is a device that is intended to benefit patients by&#xD;
      treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than&#xD;
      4,000 individuals in the United States per year. The CliniMACS® CD34 Reagent System is now&#xD;
      indicated for processing hematopoietic progenitor cells collected by apheresis (PBSC) from an&#xD;
      allogeneic, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-identical matched sibling donor (MSD) to obtain a&#xD;
      CD34+ cell-enriched population for hematopoietic reconstitution following a myeloablative&#xD;
      preparative regimen without the need for additional GVHD prophylaxis in patients with AML in&#xD;
      first morphologic complete remission (CR1). The approval as an HUD, however, asserts that&#xD;
      there was sufficient information for the FDA to determine that the device does not pose an&#xD;
      unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury. Furthermore, the clinical data&#xD;
      supported the premise of a &quot;probable benefit&quot;; in that the risk to health outweighs the risk&#xD;
      of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of&#xD;
      currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment.19 The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent&#xD;
      System was shown to meet these requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uses of the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System beyond MSD PBSC HCT for AML in CR1 are currently&#xD;
      not FDA approved and therefore considered research, even though CD34-selection is widely&#xD;
      considered to be a standard-of-care option for haploidentical HCT. In Europe, the European&#xD;
      Medicines Agency (EMA) has made the CliniMACs System components available as Conformité&#xD;
      Européene (CE) marked medical devices, and &quot;any clinical application of the target cells is&#xD;
      exclusively within the responsibility of the user of a CliniMACS System.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CD34-selection system has been widely used in haploidentical HCTs, with the first patient&#xD;
      treated at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 2002. Since then, CD34-selection&#xD;
      has facilitated over 70 HCTs at UCSF on 2 successive protocols (#01151 and #10082). However,&#xD;
      the removal of almost all cells beyond those which are CD34+ leads to minimal passive&#xD;
      transfer of immunity. It is therefore complicated by a slow recovery of immunity, with high&#xD;
      rates of life-threatening viral infections, and an appreciable degree of transplant-related&#xD;
      mortality (TRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in 2014, a new approach to ex vivo processing of stem cells was developed with a&#xD;
      goal of mainly replacing the older CD34-selection technology. This technique utilizes&#xD;
      negative depletion of the cells thought to be most responsible for the development of aGVHD,&#xD;
      the alpha-beta T-cell Receptor positive T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trials of alpha-beta T-cell depleted have included simultaneous depletion of CD19+ B&#xD;
      cells from the donor graft. All references to &quot;alpha-beta T-cell depletion&quot; herein implies&#xD;
      simultaneous Cluster of Differentiation antigen (CD)19+ depletion as well.&#xD;
