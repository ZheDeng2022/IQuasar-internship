  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence is growing on the health benefits of herbs/spices. The study is&#xD;
      interested in understanding how various herb and spice blends influence the function of blood&#xD;
      vessels. The study is also interested in how blood sugar, the insulin hormone and immune&#xD;
      cells may be related to how well the blood vessels function. Herbs and spices have components&#xD;
      called phytochemicals that may be related to how well blood vessels function. The study is&#xD;
      planned to investigate these relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After qualifying to participate in the research study, participants will be asked to come to&#xD;
      the Clinical Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) for four on-site Study Days, each lasting for&#xD;
      about 8 hours with a 40 min followup to measure vessels' function the next morning. On each&#xD;
      Study Day, different amounts of herbs/spices will be included in a breakfast meal. The herbs&#xD;
      and spices are purchased in the grocery store and are Italian herbs, cinnamon, and a mix of&#xD;
      pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, ginger, clove, nutmeg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All meals will be prepared in the CNRC's kitchen using foods and ingredients purchased at the&#xD;
      local grocery store. Blood collection and blood vessel function tests will be performed&#xD;
      during the Study Day using typical procedures used in hospitals, doctor offices, and clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a single-center randomized, blinded, multi-arm, within subjects, cross&#xD;
      over design and features a repeated postprandial sampling paradigm to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      herbs/spices on vascular function in individuals who are overweight or moderately obese after&#xD;
      consuming a standardized challenge meal. Subjects will undergo 4 Study Days at least 3 days&#xD;
      apart. On each Study Day subject will receive a standardized meal made with: salt and pepper&#xD;
      only (Control condition) or the same meal with up to 6 gram herbs/spice mix or Italian herb&#xD;
      mix or cinnamon.Each Study Day will last about 8 h with a 40 min follow up the following&#xD;
      morning to complete a 24 h set of procedures. The 24 h assessment allows for assessment of&#xD;
      clinical effects over an extended time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interested subjects will be asked to come to the Clinical Nutrition Research Center&#xD;
           (CNRC) on the IIT (Illinois Tech) Campus, Chicago, IL, where the study will take place&#xD;
           for all in person visits. The screening visit is the first visit and will be used to&#xD;
           determine if an interested person is eligible to participate in the study. The screening&#xD;
           visit will take 2 hours. Prospective subjects must read, sign and date a written&#xD;
           Institutional Review Board approved Informed Consent Form prior to performing any study&#xD;
           procedure. One of our Study investigators will go through the inform consent (ICF) with&#xD;
           subject comprehensively to explain all study related activities as mentioned in the ICF&#xD;
           form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the on-site screening visit, subject will be asked to arrive after overnight fasting&#xD;
           for 10-14 hours and be well-hydrated. Subjects will be instructed to drink plenty of&#xD;
           water the 24 hours before the screening visit to ensure they are well hydrated (ie., aim&#xD;
           for intake of at least 8-10 cups over 24 h). They will also be asked to abstain from&#xD;
           vigorous exercise 12 h before the visit. Light activity is acceptable. A series of&#xD;
           procedures will be conducted to determine eligibility to participate in the study,&#xD;
           including venous or capillary blood sampling (by finger prick) to test blood glucose (to&#xD;
           ensure fasting status and inclusion criteria), anthropometric measurements (height,&#xD;
           weight, waist circumference, body composition), Body Mass Index (BMI, calculated from&#xD;
           height and weight) calculation, vital sign measurements (blood pressure and heart rate),&#xD;
           body temperature measurement (by ear thermometer), and completion of a series of&#xD;
           questionnaires relating to their general health and lifestyle. For vital sign&#xD;
           measurements, subjects will sit in a comfortable chair, feet uncrossed and on the floor&#xD;
           and will be asked to rest quietly for 5 minutes before measuring blood pressure and&#xD;
           heart rate. Arm vein will be assessed using a vein access scale test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the results of fasting blood glucose concentration, the questionnaires, and&#xD;
           health evaluation, subjects who meet the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
           will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects who are eligible and accept the invitation to participate will be counseled on&#xD;
           following a limited polyphenolic diet throughout the duration of their participation,&#xD;
           although more strict guidelines will be imposed during the 3 days prior to each study&#xD;
           visit. Shopping lists and meal plans will be provided to subjects, along with counseling&#xD;
           by our staff, to help subjects adhere to the limited polyphenolic diet. Subjects will be&#xD;
           asked not to take any allergy medications and/or any pain medications such as Aspirin,&#xD;
           Excedrin, Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin), Naproxen, Aleve within 48 hours of each&#xD;
           scheduled study days. Tylenol is allowed. The visit will be rescheduled when&#xD;
           allergy/pain medication is needed within 48 hours prior to study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before leaving the CNRC, subjects will be provided instructions for &quot;How to prepare for&#xD;
           study day&quot;, which will include avoidance of vigorous physical activity and alcoholic&#xD;
           beverages, and caffeinated beverages at least 24 hours preceding a Study Day. Usual&#xD;
           coffee and tea can be consumed up to noon time the day before and water encouraged&#xD;
           thereafter. Subjects will also be encouraged to get a usual night of sleep and maintain&#xD;
           usual dietary patterns, except for the guidance provided for limited polyphenol foods&#xD;
           and beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Day Three days prior to each Study Day, subjects will be instructed NOT to consume&#xD;
           berry containing foods, or dark chocolate and record 3-consecutive days of food intake.&#xD;
           Subjects will be instructed to consume a usual dinner meal the night before the Study&#xD;
           Day and be required to repeat the same dinner and afternoon snacks the night before the&#xD;
           second, third and fourth Study Days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each Study Day, subjects will arrive at the clinic after fasting for 10-14 hours and in a&#xD;
      well-hydrated and well-rested state. If they are taking any medication(s) on regular basis,&#xD;
      they will be asked not to take the medication(s) at home and instead bring to the CNRC to be&#xD;
      taken in the presence of the study investigator so the medications(s) is taken at the same&#xD;
      time before each Study Day visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the Study Day, after confirming compliance with the pre-study day procedures,&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and ear temperature) and&#xD;
      capillary blood sampling (finger prick, confirmation of fasting state) will be taken. A&#xD;
      licensed healthcare professional (LHCP) will evaluate and place an intravenous catheter at&#xD;
      the antecubital site of subject's arm. An intravenous catheter is a thin flexible tube that&#xD;
      allows sampling of blood through one port throughout the Study Day. Once the catheter is&#xD;
      placed, a baseline blood sample will be taken (Time point t=0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing a baseline blood draw, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) procedure will be&#xD;
      measured. Afterwards, subjects will receive a breakfast meal along with a drink beverage&#xD;
      (Control meal, Control meal +Active-Herbs/Spice mix, or + Italian herbs mix, or +Cinnamon).&#xD;
      The first blood sample will be collected at 0h, with FMD and additional blood samples&#xD;
      conducted/collected at 0.5h, 1 h, 2h, 4h, 5.5h, and 7h. After completion of the 7h blood&#xD;
      collection and FMD procedure, the catheter will be removed and subjects will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety and/or discomfort/symptoms and they will be given a take-home snack. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to return the next morning for completion of 24 h procedures. All dinner and afternoon&#xD;
      snacks consumed on Study Day will be asked to be repeated for future Study Days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection: There will be a total of 8 times of blood collection for each Study Day. At&#xD;
      the 0h, 2h, 4h, and 7h time points, blood will be collected a total of 64 milliliters (mL)&#xD;
      (16 mL per each time point) of blood. At the 0.5 h, 1 h, 5.5 h and 24h time points, a total&#xD;
      of 32 mL (8 mL per each time point) of blood will be collected. The total amount of blood&#xD;
      collection per test day 96 mL. . During the whole study, total amount of 384 mL of blood will&#xD;
      be collected which is less than the amount allowed for one time blood donation(550mL).&#xD;
