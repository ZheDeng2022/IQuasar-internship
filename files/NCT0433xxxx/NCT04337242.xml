  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a severe mental disorder that affects 5-7% of Belgians each year.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, many individuals with depression do not seek professional help, and if they do&#xD;
      seek professional help, waiting lists for psychotherapy are typically very long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help resolve this problem, this study aims to investigate whether blended therapies, i.e.&#xD;
      therapies that consist of a mixture of face-to-face sessions and online sessions, are&#xD;
      (cost-)effective as a treatment for depression, and whether they are as (cost-)effective as&#xD;
      traditional treatments which consist of face-to-face sessions alone. Should this be the case,&#xD;
      then blended therapy can be implemented on a large scale in mental health care, as it could&#xD;
      provide a more cost-effective means of helping individuals with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also aims to investigate whether certain patient features, such as the severity of&#xD;
      depression and personality traits, may influence the efficacy of (blended) psychotherapy for&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we will also investigate patients' attitudes towards and experience of blended&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a highly prevalent disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 15-25%, and is&#xD;
      associated with high psychosocial and economic costs (e.g, suicide, absenteeism, long-term&#xD;
      disability). Epidemiological research shows that depression is underrecognized and&#xD;
      underdiagnosed in Belgium, resulting in very high unmet needs, with more than 50% of patients&#xD;
      not seeking professional help in the first year after onset and often taking patients up to&#xD;
      10 years and more to effectively seek professional help (Bruffaerts et al., 2007, 2008). The&#xD;
      current lack of capacity of mental health services in Belgium is a major obstacle in attempts&#xD;
      to increase access to effective psychotherapy for depression. Centers for Mental Health Care&#xD;
      ('Centra Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg', CGGs) in particular are faced with a growing number of&#xD;
      patients (+3% per year). Despite their efforts (e.g., by offering more group-based&#xD;
      psychotherapy and interventions), CGGs in Belgium are faced with increasingly longer waiting&#xD;
      lists. There is therefore an urgent need for (cost-)effective, time-saving interventions in&#xD;
      the mental health care system in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy alone or in combination have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of depression, and meta-analyses have shown no substantial&#xD;
      differences in the efficacy of two of the empirically most validated types of brief&#xD;
      face-to-face (FTF) psychotherapy in major depression, i.e., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) and Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) (Cuijpers et al., 2013; Cuijpers, Van Straten, Van&#xD;
      Oppen, &amp; Andersson, 2008; Driessen et al., 2015; Luyten &amp; Blatt, 2012; Munder et al., 2018).&#xD;
      Moreover, meta-analyses and qualitative reviews converge to suggest that internet-based&#xD;
      interventions, particularly offered as blended care (combining face-to-face sessions with&#xD;
      internet-based modules), may be equally effective as FTF psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in&#xD;
      major depression both at treatment termination and at follow-up in the medium to long-term,&#xD;
      suggesting non-inferiority (Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, &amp; Hedman, 2014). Extant&#xD;
      research in this domain also suggests that both CBT and PDT delivered through the internet&#xD;
      may be effective in depression. Moreover, the available evidence suggests that internet-based&#xD;
      psychotherapy if combined with therapist support may be more cost-effective as it typically&#xD;
      reduces the number of face-to-face contacts, without compromising the effectiveness of&#xD;
      psychotherapy (Andersson, Titov, Dear, Rozental, &amp; Carlbring, 2019). Hence, the&#xD;
      implementation of blended care may lead to increased availability of psychotherapy for&#xD;
      depression and a more effective use of resources in mental health care, at least for a&#xD;
      subsample of depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is therefore to investigate the non-inferiority (defined&#xD;
      as a small-sized difference in effect size (Cohen's d= .20) of blended PDT and CBT for&#xD;
      depression compared to FTF PDT and CBT in adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder&#xD;
      (n=504) in the context of a pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of four conditions (i.e., blended PDT, blended CBT, FTF PDT, or FTF&#xD;
      CBT). The primary outcome is changes in the severity of depression as measured by the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996) at 6 months follow-up&#xD;
      (approximately 12 months after the start of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will investigate the comparative efficacy of blended care versus FTF&#xD;
      psychotherapy on the following secondary outcomes: severity of depression as measured with&#xD;
      the BDI-II at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up;&#xD;
      recovery from depression as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM 5&#xD;
      disorders - Clinical Trials Version (SCID-5-CT; American Psychiatric Association) and the&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and&#xD;
      two-year follow-up; and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L; Herdman&#xD;
      et al., 2011) at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study will also examine possible predictors of treatment response in&#xD;
      blended care versus FTF therapy, such as severity of depression (BDI-II, PHQ-9), psychiatric&#xD;
      co-morbidity (SCID-5-CT), and patients' experience of both types of treatment as assessed&#xD;
      with the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly &amp; Borkovec, 2000). In&#xD;
      addition, the feasibility of implementing blended care in mental health care centers in&#xD;
      Flanders, Belgium, will be investigated. To this end, we will record recruitment rate,&#xD;
      retention in treatment, treatment adherence, and adherence to the research protocol.&#xD;
      Acceptability will be indicated by the number of sessions attended, including the number of&#xD;
      individuals who refuse treatment, and feasibility by the number of patients failing to comply&#xD;
      with the full clinical and research protocol. Patients will also complete very brief measures&#xD;
      of credibility of the treatments and satisfaction with the treatments. Treatment integrity of&#xD;
      therapists will be assessed on the basis of independent ratings of audio or video recorded&#xD;
      psychotherapy sessions, applying a treatment integrity instrument developed in the UK&#xD;
      specifically for the treatments used in this study (Lemma, Target, &amp; Fonagy, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, provided blended care is non-inferior to FTF therapy, the cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      blended care versus FTF psychotherapy will be investigated from a societal perspective, i.e.,&#xD;
      taking all relevant costs and effects into account (intervention costs, direct and indirect&#xD;
      medical costs, as well as productivity losses and costs made elsewhere in the health care&#xD;
      system). To this end, patients will complete the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology&#xD;
      Assessment (iMTA) Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TIC-P; Bouwmans&#xD;
      et al., 2013). Moreover, health care use data for all patients will be provided by the&#xD;
      Rijksinstituut voor Ziekte- en Invaliditeitsverzekering (RIZIV).&#xD;
