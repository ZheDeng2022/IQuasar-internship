  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to investigate the acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of an&#xD;
      innovative NICU rehabilitation program that will include six multimodal, gestational age (GA)&#xD;
      appropriate, parent-administered interventions (vocal soothing, scent exchange, comforting&#xD;
      touch, kangaroo care, infant massage and physical therapy). Using the general movement&#xD;
      assessment (GMA) instrument, the investigators will determine the effects of this program on&#xD;
      short-term motor outcomes (general movements (GMs), cranial nerves, posture, movements, tone,&#xD;
      and reflexes) in premature infants (≤32 week's gestation and/or ≤1500 grams birthweight)&#xD;
      identified as at-risk for CP. The short-term motor outcomes will be measured using the GMA,&#xD;
      the Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological&#xD;
      Examination (HINE) instruments. This novel program will be applied during the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization when the brain is highly plastic and actively&#xD;
      developing with the goal to mitigate severity of brain injury and its impact on development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two following specific aims will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Enroll 60 preterm infants (&lt;32 weeks' gestation and/or ≤1500 grams) with abnormal GMA&#xD;
      into a pilot randomized control trial to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility&#xD;
      (practicality) and fidelity (adherence, exposure and engagement) of a multimodal GA&#xD;
      appropriate rehabilitation program during NICU hospitalization compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability using recruitment, refusal, retention, and follow-up rates as well as&#xD;
           weekly interviews with parental participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility (practicality) using direct observations and weekly interviews with parental&#xD;
           participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fidelity (adherence, exposure and engagement) using visitation data, activity logs,&#xD;
           direct observations, and weekly interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the effect of a multimodal NICU-based rehabilitation program on short-term&#xD;
      motor outcomes (general movements, cranial nerves, posture, movements, tone, and reflexes) of&#xD;
      premature infants at risk for cerebral palsy (CP) at discharge from the NICU and at 3 months&#xD;
      corrected age. The investigators hypothesize that this type of GA appropriate multimodal&#xD;
      NICU-based rehabilitation program will positively impact short-term motor outcomes by&#xD;
      normalizing general movements and improving TIMP and HINE scores.&#xD;

    <measure>Impact of the NeoRehab bundle on neurologic function as assessed by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic function will be assessed at NICU discharge and at 3 months postmenstrual age using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) instrument. The HINE is a 26 items scale that evaluates cranial nerve function, posture, quality and quantity of movements, muscle tone, and reflexes and reactions. Lower the score the poorer the motor function. The HINE has a sensitivity of 90% for prediction of motor outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of the NeoRehab bundle on infants' general movements.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of the intervention on the infants' general movement will be assessed at NICU discharge and at 3 months postmenstrual age using the general movement assessment (GMA) tool. The GMA has been shown to reliably identify infants at high risk for CP and can be implemented shortly after birth making it an ideal screening tool for preterm infants. Cramped-synchronized writhing general movements followed by absent fidgety general movements is a movement pattern that has been shown to be highly specific of later development of cerebral palsy.</description>
