      compared to Sham Comparator 3x per week and SOC&#xD;
&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>LifeCuff device includes a controller attached to a standard inflatable cuff used for blood pressure measurements.The controller includes a controller electronics board connected to a pneumatic assembly designed to automatically inflate and deflate the cuff to desired air pressures while monitoring and analyzing the oscillometric pulsations modulating the cuff pressure as captured by the system's pressure transducer. LifeCuff can be battery-powered or connected by an adaptor to a house electrical outlet.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The subject and principle investigator will remain blinded throughout the trial. Every site will have a designated unblinded study coordinator. The unblinded coordinator will choose the appropriately labeled device for the subject during the weekly SOC visits. The patient will place the cuff and operate the device under the direction of the unblinded coordinator. The principle investigator is prohibited from entering the room during the treatment. The unblinded coordinator will place a sign on the outside of the study room door stating, &quot;Do not enter. Study in Progress.&quot;</masking_description>
