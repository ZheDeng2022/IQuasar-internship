  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research study is to examine the effectiveness of the use of&#xD;
      CGM vs. SMBG in persons with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes on glycemic variables and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes on treatment satisfaction, health behavior and wellbeing. The&#xD;
      independent effect of peer-support will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing. Although medical treatment options have&#xD;
      increased, still less than a third obtain their optimal glycemic goal. The use of continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM) in persons with type 1 diabetes has shown to be the most important&#xD;
      driver for improvement in glycemic control-even more than insulin-pump therapy-but the use of&#xD;
      technology in type 2 diabetes are not yet reimbursed and has been investigated in very few&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a single center, prospective, randomized, open-labelled, three-armed study&#xD;
      with the randomization 2:1:2 in group A with CGM, group B with CGM and peer-support, group C&#xD;
      as a control group with SMBG. The study will run for 12 months and will include 100 adult&#xD;
      participants with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, treated at the outpatient clinic at Steno&#xD;
      Diabetes Center Copenhagen. Recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in July 2021. Final&#xD;
      12-month follow-up is anticipated to be in August 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is investor-initiated. The primary investigator (Nanna Lind, PhD. Student) will be&#xD;
      responsible for execution of this study under guidance by the sponsor Kirsten Nørgaard.&#xD;
      Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the use of CGM in the treatment for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, potentially shaping clinical guidelines for SMBG frequency and timing as&#xD;
      well as use of technology in type 2 diabetes with an impact on both healthcare and healthcare&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;

The participants will participate in a training course that will include the influence of different food items and exercise on glucose levels, how to measure SMBG correctly. Furthermore, participants in group A (intervention) will, in similarity to the HCPs, receive a CGM-education and training session led by the study investigator and will be interactive and hands-on, using case studies. The training session will include spoken and written instructions on how to insert and wear the CGM device and how to interpret the CGM information to better understand the relation between participants blood glucose and their diabetes self-management.</description>

Furthermore, participants in group B (intervention incl. peer-support) will, in similarity to group A, receive a CGM-education and training session. The training and CGM-course for participants in group B are similar to the course for group A with the addition of three peer-support sessions. The approach will be participatory and adaptable to allow flexibility in the content of the peer-support sessions and involving customized use of participatory methods i.e. dialogue tools and exercises.</description>
