      To build a registry of diabetic volunteers by inviting them to get a LiverMultiScan and&#xD;
      collecting their contact information to seek interest in participating in future research&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Perspectum's LiverMultiScan is a quantitative multiparametric MRI method, FDA-cleared and&#xD;
      CE-marked, that is used to detect and stage early liver disease.It is already widely used&#xD;
      internally in both research and within the clinical setting. LiverMultiScan has been adopted&#xD;
      as the only liver scan in whole-population long term studies. The LiverMultiScan is more cost&#xD;
      efficient, short in duration(&lt;15mins), non-invasive and safe(no IV or oral contrast required,&#xD;
      no ionizing radiation and no venipuncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a registry where there will be no intervention to the standard of care. Registry&#xD;
      volunteers will be required to attend a single visit that will involve having a&#xD;
      multi-parametric MRI at no cost to them. In addition, the investigators will collect contact&#xD;
      information of the volunteers including their email address, phone number and home address so&#xD;
      that they can be contacted to discuss possible participation in future studies which may be&#xD;
      sponsored by Perspectum or third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies.The volunteer's&#xD;
      personal information shall never be shared with these third parties. Additionally, the&#xD;
      contact information of the volunteers' medical providers shall also be collected so that the&#xD;
      LiverMultiScan reports can be delivered to them.&#xD;
