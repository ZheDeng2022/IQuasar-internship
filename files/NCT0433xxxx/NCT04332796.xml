      Introduction Pitted keratolysis is a common skin disease, caused by various gram-positive&#xD;
      bacteria including Corynebacterium species, Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermophilus congolensis&#xD;
      and Actinomyces species. These bacteria create small tunnels in the stratum corneum, causing&#xD;
      pitted lesions at plantar areas. This condition is frequent accompanied by feet malodor and&#xD;
      is commonly found in young male adults, especially in soldiers, miners and athletes. The&#xD;
      reported prevalence of pitted keratolysis among naval cadets in Thailand was 38.7%.&#xD;
      Predisposing factors related to pitted keratolysis are pedal hyperhidrosis and prolonged feet&#xD;
      occlusion. Although this condition is generally not painful, our previous study in 2018&#xD;
      revealed adversely affects patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding treatment modalities of pitted keratolysis, various medications and life-style&#xD;
      modification have been recommended. Previous studies revealed efficacy of topical choices,&#xD;
      including benzoyl peroxide gel, clindamycin-benzoyl peroxide gel, glycopyrrolate cream,&#xD;
      erythromycin gel, clindamycin solution, chlorhexidine scrub and mupirocin ointment. Oral&#xD;
      antibiotics and botulinum toxin injection were also beneficial in pitted keratolysis. As to&#xD;
      life-style modification, wearing cotton socks and opened footwear, and proper hygiene, have&#xD;
      also been suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been demonstrated to exhibit antimicrobial activities against many&#xD;
      microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa&#xD;
      and fungal infections including dermatophytosis. It has been proposed that the mechanism is&#xD;
      the generation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, on microorganism cell&#xD;
      surfaces, thereby causing membrane dysfunction. The antimicrobial activities have been&#xD;
      observed to vary with changes in the physical and chemical properties of ZnO, for instance,&#xD;
      its particle size, porosity and specific surface area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nanobiotechnology , which is the integration of biotechnology and nanotechnology, is&#xD;
      currently being used in drug delivery systems. The bactericidal efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles&#xD;
      (ZnO-NPs) has been shown to improves with a decrease in their particle size. ZnO has also&#xD;
      been shown to be is safe and compatible with human skin, which makes it a suitable additive&#xD;
      for textiles. Research by Choopong and Sarayut established that ZnO-NP-coated socks exhibited&#xD;
      antimicrobial activities against gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (Klebsiella&#xD;
      pneumoniae) bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study aimed to study the efficacy of chlorhexidine scrub, zinc oxide&#xD;
      nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) socks and the combination of chlorhexidine scrub and ZnO-NPs socks in&#xD;
      treatment of pitted keratolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods First-year naval rating cadets, who had pitted keratolysis were invited&#xD;
      to enroll in this study. The cadets who previously received any topical treatment including&#xD;
      topical antibiotic, antiperspirant or aluminum chloride within 6 months prior to the study&#xD;
      were excluded. Consent was informed and obtained from all participants. Participants were&#xD;
      assessed for behavioral risk factors and level of foot odor measured by a self-assessed&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS), using questionnaires. Clinically examination of feet was done in&#xD;
      all subjects by treatment-blinded dermatologists. Subjects were randomly assigned either&#xD;
      chlorhexidine scrub, ZnO-NPs socks and the combination of chlorhexidine scrub and ZnO-NPs&#xD;
      socks for 2 weeks. During the study, using of other topical treatment such as topical&#xD;
      antibiotics, antiperspirant or aluminum chloride was not allowed. Participants who received&#xD;
      chlorhexidine scrub were advised to wash their both soles with chlorhexidine scrub two times&#xD;
      per day in the morning and evening. Participants who received ZnO-NPs socks were asked to&#xD;
      wear these socks everyday and at least 8 hours per day. All were able to regularly&#xD;
      participate in physical military training during the study. Two weeks after the treatment,&#xD;
      clinical examinations by dermatologists and the cadets' self-assessment questionnaires,&#xD;
      including feet odor by using VAS, treatment satisfaction and adverse effects, were used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness. Pitted lesions improvement at plantar areas, evaluated by&#xD;
      dermatologists, was divided into no improvement, slight improvement (decrease of pitted&#xD;
      lesions at feet for 1 level) and much improvement (decrease of pitted lesions at feet for at&#xD;
      least 2 level). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 18 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
