  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) that the study medicine&#xD;
      called &quot;liposomal bupivacaine&quot; has on subjects that are undergoing a sternotomy. Liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine solution, is a drug that the doctor will inject before they make the cut through&#xD;
      patient's breastbone (sternotomy). Normally pain medicine like this is given right before the&#xD;
      surgeon closes up the patient's breastbone, at the end of the surgery. For this study, they&#xD;
      want to see if giving the medicine before they make the cut into the patient's breastbone&#xD;
      helps their pain. They also want to find out if patients feel less pain after surgery with&#xD;
      the study drug than they do with saline and possibly decrease the need for pain medicine.&#xD;
      Subjects will be in the study for about 72 hours or until they are discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged and excessive narcotic usage in the postoperative setting has been linked to&#xD;
      multiple complications. Use of complimentary pain management techniques such as regional&#xD;
      analgesia can reduce postoperative pain and narcotic usage. This can enhance patient recovery&#xD;
      and improve quality of life in the immediate postoperative period. Previous research&#xD;
      investigating the benefits of local analgesia during cardiac surgery have been limited by the&#xD;
      sparse amount of single-center randomized controlled trials, particularly evaluating the use&#xD;
      of para-sternal injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the available studies, the use of local analgesia injections compared to controls has led&#xD;
      to improved pain scores and overall decreased perioperative opioid usage. Studies have shown&#xD;
      this efficacy using 0.2% ropivacaine, 0.75% ropivacaine, and 0.53% liposomal bupivacaine all&#xD;
      compared to control groups receiving normal saline injections in the para-sternal area. These&#xD;
      studies all used injections just prior to sternal closure and no significant evidence is&#xD;
      available for the use of ultrasound-guided regional block of the sternum prior to surgical&#xD;
      incision. Injection of analgesia prior to surgical incision has been shown to decrease&#xD;
      postoperative pain compared to injection after surgical closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that injection of 1.3% liposomal bupivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine (20mL dose)&#xD;
      as a sternal block prior to surgical incision will lead to decreased pain and opioid usage in&#xD;
      the intraoperative and postoperative setting for patients undergoing upper mini- and median&#xD;
      sternotomy compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator-initiated prospective randomized study with an 18-month patient&#xD;
      accrual period and patient follow-up period dependent on postoperative length of stay&#xD;
      following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional Block: Liposomal Bupivacaine (1.3%) solution (20 mL dose) is proposed for use during&#xD;
      this study. This solution has demonstrated increased efficacy in prolonged analgesia&#xD;
      following injection. This solution will be injected as an ultrasound-guided subpectoral&#xD;
      interfacial plane block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Saline: Normal saline (0.9%) will be used as the control solution for patients not&#xD;
      receiving the liposomal bupivacaine solution. Injection procedure of this solution will be&#xD;
      identical to that of the liposomal bupivacaine solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Patients undergoing a surgical procedure through mini- or full sternotomy will be&#xD;
      considered for inclusion in this study. There will be no deviation from routine surgical&#xD;
      procedures following injection of para-sternal solution prior to surgical incision.&#xD;

&#xD;
       11. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Chronic home non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (excluding acetylsalicylic&#xD;
           acid (ASA))&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of procedure being performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior procedures performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to extubation, time to ambulation, time to oral diet, return of bowel function,&#xD;
      postoperative atrial fibrillation incidence, post op nausea incidence, and intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) and overall LOS. Maximum incentive spirometer maximum volume&#xD;
      at 24, 48 and 72 hours, Confusion assessment method (CAM) at 24, 48 and 72 hours, post op&#xD;
      opioid usage up to 72 hours post op. If additional days of post-op opioid usage is documented&#xD;
      in the existing medical record, this may be used also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores (Scale 0-10) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12,24,36,48, 60, and 72 hours after ICU arrival for&#xD;
      extubated patients and Clinical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT)scores (Scale 0-8) for&#xD;
      intubated patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events: Allergic reaction, pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, vascular injury,&#xD;
      hematoma, intravascular injection, wound infection, paresthesia, persistent numbness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Deviations: If certain data elements are not in the existing medical record and were&#xD;
      not collected, this is not a protocol deviation. Nevertheless, all effort will be made to&#xD;
      collect these data points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: The risks are the same as the Standard of Care surgery performed outside this study.&#xD;
      This is discussed in the ICF. A confidentiality breach is a risk associated with research.&#xD;
      However, all data collection protocols follow HIPAA guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: If participants receive the drug, they could experience less pain than those that&#xD;
      don't receive the drug. However, not all participants are likely to benefit from the proposed&#xD;
      research. The investigators will benefit from the knowledge gained, as it will provide&#xD;
      deepened insight on the main challenges, advantages and disadvantages of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analytic Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile ranges of narcotic usage (in morphine&#xD;
      equivalent units) will be reported for each group. The difference of narcotic usage between&#xD;
      the two groups will be reported as a single value. Additional variables analyzed in this&#xD;
      study include the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
       12. Post op opioid usage up to 72 hours post op&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard descriptive statistics will be used throughout (mean, range, standard deviation, and&#xD;
      median, IQR), with comparative statistics for normally and non-normally distributed data with&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 considered as significant. For categorical variables, 2 Sample t-test or chi-squared&#xD;
      test will be used to determine statistical significance. For continuous variables, logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used to determine the value of significance to variables with&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes. Depending on the enrollment rate, the stratification of data based on&#xD;
      the type of sternotomy (full or mini) could be performed and analyzed respectively.&#xD;
