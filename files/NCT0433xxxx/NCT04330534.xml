  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part Phase 1 dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single (Part 1) and multiple (Part 2) ascending&#xD;
      doses of BCX9930 in healthy subjects and in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&#xD;
      (PNH; Part 3). Pharmacokinetics is an analysis of how the body handles the study drug BCX9930&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics is an analysis of the activity that the study drug BCX9930 may have in&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 6 sequential ascending dose cohorts are planned to be dosed in a sequential manner in&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study. Eight subjects will be treated with a single dose of the study drug per&#xD;
      dose cohort (6 subjects per cohort will receive BCX9930 and 2 subjects per cohort will&#xD;
      receive matching placebo). Escalation to the next higher dose level will occur only after&#xD;
      completion of a review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetics by the Sponsor and PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 7 ascending, multiple dose cohorts will be enrolled in a sequential manner in Part 2 of&#xD;
      the study. In Cohorts 1 through 3, twelve subjects will be treated with either a 7-day or&#xD;
      14-day course of study drug (10 subjects per cohort will receive BCX9930 and 2 subjects per&#xD;
      cohort will receive matching placebo) administered orally. In Cohorts 4 through 7, twelve&#xD;
      subjects will be treated with a 3-day course of study drug (10 subjects per cohort will&#xD;
      receive BCX9930 and 2 subjects per cohort will receive matching placebo) administered orally.&#xD;
      The daily dose may be split into 2 times daily (BID) or 3 times daily (TID) dosing for the&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose part as needed. Escalation to the next higher dose level in Part 2&#xD;
      will occur only after completion of a review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetics by the&#xD;
      Sponsor and PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of the study consists of up to 2 sequential ascending multiple dose cohorts of up to 8&#xD;
      subjects; each cohort may enroll up to 4 subjects with PNH who are naïve to both eculizumab&#xD;
      and ravulizumab and up to 4 subjects with PNH who are currently being treated with either&#xD;
      eculizumab or ravulizumab. In each cohort, subjects will receive one daily dose of BCX9930 on&#xD;
      Days 1 to 14 and a higher daily dose on Days 15 to 28. Cohort 2 will start after independent&#xD;
      data monitoring committee (DMC) review of Cohort 1 data and communication of their evaluation&#xD;
      to Part 3 investigators. In South Africa, subjects that have clinical benefit from BCX9930&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue dosing for up to 48 weeks.&#xD;
