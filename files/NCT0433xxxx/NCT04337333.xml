    <textblock>
      Endoscopic placement of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) is the principle method for&#xD;
      palliation of inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction. As the survival time for those&#xD;
      patients has improved due mainly in part to development of chemotherapeutic intervention, it&#xD;
      is becoming important to prevent recurrent cholangitis and liver failure by prolonging the&#xD;
      SEMS patency, leading to continuation of chemotherapy and better prognosis. Therefore,&#xD;
      one-time stent insertion before disease-progression-related death is an ultimate goal of&#xD;
      developing an ideal biliary stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEMSs have been found to be superior to plastic stents in terms of the stent patency, because&#xD;
      it prevent accumulation of biliary sludge owing to larger diameter. The ideal designs of&#xD;
      biliary SEMSs for prolongation of the stent patency include 1) bare metal mesh for tissue&#xD;
      embedding to prevent stent migration, 2) covering material to counteract neoplastic tumor&#xD;
      ingrowth, and 3) anti-reflux structure to reduce enteric biliary reflux. However, none of&#xD;
      bare, covered, and anti-reflux metal stent alone constantly demonstrated superiority over the&#xD;
      others in the stent patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compensate for the limitations of each stent, a double stent system in which both covered&#xD;
      and bare SEMSs are integrated into one stent system was introduced in the field of the&#xD;
      interventional radiology, but further data accumulation is needed to assess the comparability&#xD;
      with various conventional SEMS types in terms of stent patency, reintervention efficacy, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes following reintervention, because in this system two metal stents are&#xD;
      implanted at once exclusively via percutaneous route and clogged inner covered stent cannot&#xD;
      be removed at the time of the reintervention. Recently a new covered and uncovered SEMS in&#xD;
      which the clogged inner stent can be endoscopically removed leaving the outer stent in place,&#xD;
      was introduced. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this&#xD;
      stent in patients with inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction.&#xD;
