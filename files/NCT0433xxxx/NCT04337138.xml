  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to describe treatment patterns and effectiveness&#xD;
      outcomes in a sample of oncology patients treated for AML with Mylotarg through up to two&#xD;
      additional relapsed/refractory (R/R)-based lines of therapy (through third-line therapy). The&#xD;
      study will use United States oncology electronic medical record (EMR) data. All study data&#xD;
      are secondary data and will have been collected retrospectively from existing clinical data&#xD;
      originally collected as part of routine care.&#xD;

    <measure>Real-World Event-Free Survival (rwEFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment initiation date to date of TF, relapse from CR or better, death from any cause, whichever came first (maximum duration of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>rwEFS defined as time from treatment initiation date (for first line of Mylotarg-containing therapy) to date of treatment failure (TF), relapse from complete response (CR) or better, death from any cause, whichever came first. TF defined as failure to achieve CR or better following up to 3 cycles of Mylotarg. Time origin for rwEFS was start of Mylotarg in first line of therapy in which it was used. Terminal event for analysis of rwEFS was earlier of treatment failure, relapse from CR or better, death. CR is defined as having less than (&lt;) 5% blasts in the bone marrow and 0% blasts in the peripheral blood. Real-world setting signifies participants treated in clinical practice and in a non-trial setting.</description>

    <time_frame>From the treatment initiation date (during the first line of Mylotarg-containing therapy) to the date of a relapse event, or death from any cause, whichever came first (maximum duration of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>rwRFS was defined as the time from the treatment initiation date (during the first line of Mylotarg-containing therapy) to the date of a relapse event, or death from any cause, whichever came first.

    <measure>Real-World Overall Survival (rwOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of the first Mylotarg use till death (maximum duration of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>rwOS was defined as the time from the start of the first Mylotarg use till the date of death. Participants who were not indicated to be deceased in clinical records or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) records were censored for rwOS analysis as of the later of 1) the latest date known alive within the clinical record, 2) 4 months prior to the date of most recent SSDI update. Real-world setting signifies participants treated in clinical practice and in a non-trial setting.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With First Positive Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first qualifying Mylotarg-containing line of therapy to the end of the third line of therapy or the end of record, whichever occurs first (maximum duration of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>First positive response was assessed by physician as first response from any of the following: CR, partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). CR is defined as having &lt; 5% blasts in the bone marrow and 0% blasts in the peripheral blood. PR is defined as having 5 to 25% bone marrow blasts with &gt; 50% reduction in blasts and peripheral blood count recovery. SD is defined as having no change in bone marrow blasts. PD is defined as having relapse following response. Participant for whom record did not indicate one of these classification classed as not evaluable (NE).</description>

    <measure>Duration of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From the initiation of Mylotarg to the last date of Mylotarg therapy (maximum duration of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of therapy was time from the initiation of Mylotarg to the last date of Mylotarg therapy, regardless of line of therapy (duration could continue into subsequent lines of therapy), study end date, or death, whichever came first.</description>

Cytogenetic/FISH testing included: t(6;9)(p23:q34.1), t(v;11q23.3), t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2), -5 or del(5q); -7; -17/abn(17p), complex karyotype, monosomal karyotype, t(8;21)(q22;q22.1), inv(16)(p13.1q22) and t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) tests.</description>

        <description>rwEFS defined as time from treatment initiation date (for first line of Mylotarg-containing therapy) to date of treatment failure (TF), relapse from complete response (CR) or better, death from any cause, whichever came first. TF defined as failure to achieve CR or better following up to 3 cycles of Mylotarg. Time origin for rwEFS was start of Mylotarg in first line of therapy in which it was used. Terminal event for analysis of rwEFS was earlier of treatment failure, relapse from CR or better, death. CR is defined as having less than (&lt;) 5% blasts in the bone marrow and 0% blasts in the peripheral blood. Real-world setting signifies participants treated in clinical practice and in a non-trial setting.</description>

      <time_frame>Not applicable as adverse events not collected during the study</time_frame>
      <desc>This study involved data that existed as structured data by the time of study start. In these data sources, individual participant data were not retrieved or validated, and it was not possible to link a particular product and medical event for any individual. Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (i.e., identifiable participant, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) was not met, hence, safety data was not planned to be collected and reported.</desc>

          <description>Participants with confirmed diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) on or after 01 December 2014, who received Mylotarg (Gemtuzumab ozogamicin [mean number of doses of gemtuzumab administered = 1 per participant]) from 2017 to 2020 in real-world clinical setting (i.e. treated in clinical practice and in a non-trial setting) were included in this retrospective study and their data from definitive oncology dataset was retrospectively assessed in this study of up to 4 months.</description>
