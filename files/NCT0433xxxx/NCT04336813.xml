      Methodology :A cross-over randomised controlled trial comparing two teaching methods Duration&#xD;
      :Start date 6th December 2017 to 29st May 2018 Objective : To evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      phone-based audience response system (PB-ARS) on knowledge retention and performance in&#xD;
      teaching orthodontics for dental undergraduate students in a Saudi Dental School Number:The&#xD;
      cohort of the trial includes 34 fourth-year dental students that represents whole fourth-year&#xD;
      undergraduate class Main Inclusion criteria : whole fourth-year undergraduate class in a&#xD;
      Saudi Dental college.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis : The normal distribution will be tested. The Mann-Whitney U test will&#xD;
      used to compare the median score for each answer that would be given by students in the&#xD;
      questionnaires. Scores will be analyzed and compared to assess knowledge retention using&#xD;
      cross-over analysis with Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was designed as a cross-over clustered randomized control trial (each group was a&#xD;
      cluster), so that each group acted as their own control for their knowledge's retention and&#xD;
      perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and consent: College of Dentistry, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University/Alkharj/&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia. Written consents were obtained from students before commencing the trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants : The cohort of the trial included the whole fourth-year undergraduate class (34&#xD;
      undergraduate dental students) in order to eliminate selection bias. Participants in this&#xD;
      study had no prior orthodontic teaching, hence, no bias associated with increased knowledge&#xD;
      in any orthodontic field was anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Students were allocated to one of two even groups (G1 or G2) using computer&#xD;
      generated randomization. each group (G1 and G2) consisted of 17 male students with a mean age&#xD;
      of (23.27 years Â± 0.86).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lectures : Simultaneously, G1 and G2 attended two lectures (L1&amp;L2): L1 was titled &quot;Management&#xD;
      of Class III malocclusion&quot;, L2 was titled &quot;Management of open bite and cross-bite&quot;. Both&#xD;
      lectures were presented at the main campus of Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz College of&#xD;
      Dentistry and they were conducted in an identical manner in all aspects including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presentation in PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both lectures were delivered by the same registered specialist orthodontist (FA),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learning outcomes of the delivered lectures (T1 and T2) were based on teaching outcomes&#xD;
           specified by the National Commission for Academic Accreditation and Assessment in Saudi&#xD;
           Arabia, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both lectures delivered over the same period of time. Prior to lectures, students were&#xD;
           instructed to register with the audience response system (ARS) and download its&#xD;
           application (Poll Everywhere, San Francisco, California, USA,&#xD;
           https://www.polleverywhere.com). Additional smart phones were available to students who&#xD;
           do not have smart phones at the time of the lecture. Students were unaware of their&#xD;
           allocation until the beginning of the first lecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lecture hall, G1 was separated from G2, and both groups completed an assessment of&#xD;
      written multiple-choice questions (MCQs) scored out of 20, before the lecture. During L1,&#xD;
      phone based (ARS) questions (PB-ARS) secretly displayed on the smart phones of the students&#xD;
      in G1, and they were allowed to read the question and answer it, while those in parallel arm&#xD;
      of the trial (G2) were blinded to those questions and answers. At the end of L1, both groups&#xD;
      completed the same written MCQs assessment . A similar protocol was undertaken during L2 a&#xD;
      week later, except that the groups were crossed-over, hence, the group which has had ARS&#xD;
      integrated lecture in the previous week, has received in a non-ARS integrated lecture, and&#xD;
      vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative exam:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCQs formative tests consisted of 20 questions related to the taught topics during L1 and L2&#xD;
      was undertaken. In order to reduce the carry over effect, the PB-ARS questions during the&#xD;
      lectures were not similar to the MCQs sheet. The used MCQs were piloted between authors to&#xD;
      ensure its content validity and reliability. Contents validity was tested using test matrix&#xD;
      and expert judgment. The test reliability was estimated using inter-rater reliability, a&#xD;
      correlation of more than 0.7 was considered acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summative exam:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups attended their final written summative exams. L1 was undertaken 11 weeks prior to&#xD;
      final exam while L2 was undertaken 10 weeks before the exam. The final exam was in MCQs&#xD;
      format and included questions from all subjects taught in the second semester of the year&#xD;
      including five questions relevant to the subjects taught in L1 and L2. The exam questions&#xD;
      were identical for all students and were delivered at the same time under controlled&#xD;
      conditions. Students who failed to attend the final summative exam were excluded to reduce&#xD;
      the effect of time factor as confounding factors. The final exam scores of all student to&#xD;
      questions related to TL1 and TL2 were anonymously collated using an excel sheet by&#xD;
      independent tutor to reduce reporting bias. The maximum achievable score for the five&#xD;
      questions relevant to the subjects taught in L1 and L2 was 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students' perception:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of L1, both groups were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding their experience&#xD;
      with the lecture and intervention group participants were asked specific questions about&#xD;
      their experience with PA-ARS . The used questionnaire was modified version from a previously&#xD;
      used questionnaire to assess students experience with ARS in a recent trial . Students'&#xD;
      responses were saved in an excel sheet after each lecture (L1, L2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students' scores were saved in an excel sheet after each test. A specialized statistical&#xD;
      analysis software was used (IBM SPSS statistics 22, version 22) The statistician was blinded&#xD;
      to the allocation group. Scores were analyzed and compared to assess knowledge retention&#xD;
      using cross-over analysis with Mann-Whitney U test for pre and post lecture quiz and t-test&#xD;
      for summative test.&#xD;
