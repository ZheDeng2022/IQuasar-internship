      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cushing s disease is caused by excess ACTH hormone release by a benign tumor of the pituitary&#xD;
      gland. It can lead to decreased quality of life and early death. The current best treatment&#xD;
      for Cushing s disease is surgery. If surgery does not work or if the tumor returns, there are&#xD;
      no more good treatment options. Vorinostat, which is approved to treat a type of lymphoma,&#xD;
      might be a treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test vorinostat to see if it can kill tumor cells and change the number of hormones&#xD;
      released in people with Cushing s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have Cushing s disease and are scheduled for surgery under&#xD;
      protocol 03-N-0164 to remove a tumor in their pituitary gland&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 03-N-0164.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital for 8 days before their surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests. They will have&#xD;
      their urine collected for testing all day. They will have an ECG: For this, small metal disks&#xD;
      or sticky electrode pads will be placed on their chest to record heart activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the next 7 days, participants will have blood tests and all-day urine collection. They&#xD;
      will drink at least 2 liters of fluid per day. They will take the study drug by mouth each&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the eighth day, participants will have their surgery. Leftover tissue will be collected&#xD;
      for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day they are discharged from the hospital, participants will have a physical exam and&#xD;
      blood tests.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cushing s disease is caused by excess ACTH hormone release by a benign tumor of the pituitary&#xD;
      gland. The resulting increase in cortisol levels caused by increased ACTH causes a severe&#xD;
      condition that leads to decreased quality of life and early death. The current best first&#xD;
      treatment for Cushing s disease is surgery. However, if surgery is unsuccessful or if the&#xD;
      tumor returns, there are no good treatment options for patients. In laboratory studies, we&#xD;
      discovered that a previously FDA approved oral medication Vorinostat was able to kill tumors&#xD;
      cells and reduce ACTH secretion. We want to test whether this drug can be used in patients&#xD;
      with Cushing s disease to reduce ACTH levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult (&gt; 18 years old) patients with a diagnosis of Cushing s disease that qualify for&#xD;
      surgery through a different NIH protocol (#03-N-0164).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit patients with Cushing s disease who have surgery planned for removal of the&#xD;
      pituitary tumor. If they consent, we will admit them as inpatients for 8 days before surgery.&#xD;
      After a thorough laboratory investigation, we will administer Vorinostat by mouth daily for 7&#xD;
      days. During this time, we will measure the levels of ACTH and glucocorticoid hormones in the&#xD;
      blood and urine daily. On the 8th day, we will perform the surgery as planned. We also will&#xD;
      test tissue obtained during surgery to evaluate the drug s effect on the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure is the midnight plasma ACTH level on the last day of drug&#xD;
      administration. A secondary outcome measure is the serum cortisol change during drug&#xD;
      administration.-&#xD;
