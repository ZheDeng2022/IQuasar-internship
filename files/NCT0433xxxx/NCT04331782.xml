  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integration of mental health in HIV clinics is needed in order to accelerate fast track&#xD;
      90-90-90 for controlling HIV. Symptoms of depression are sometimes difficult to recognize. In&#xD;
      people living with HIV (PLWHA), depression that fails to be recognized and uncontrolled&#xD;
      increases the risk of unsuccessful antiretroviral treatment and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of depressive disorders in&#xD;
      people living with HIV. The study included adult HIV patients aged ≥18 years, both men and&#xD;
      women, who had received ARV treatment for at least six months, with no history of being&#xD;
      diagnosed with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study was a cross-sectional, non-intervention and multicenter in adults with HIV-AIDS&#xD;
      (PLWHA) who were treated at a hospital who had received ARV treatment for at least six&#xD;
      months, without a history of being diagnosed with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from HIV outpatient clinics in each research hospital were briefed on the study and&#xD;
      offered to participate. Furthermore, based on the assessment of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, PLWHA who meet the requirements were recruited and data were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic data, HIV risk factors, risk behaviors, clinical characteristics such as&#xD;
      duration of HIV, family history of mental illness, AIDS-related illnesses, other serious&#xD;
      non-AIDS-related illnesses, treatment (antiretroviral (ARV) and non-ARV) and history ARV&#xD;
      treatment response (HIV and CD4 viral load) were collected from each participant. In&#xD;
      addition, a rapid screening for depressive disorders was carried out using the Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) which was translated and validated in Indonesian. The PHQ-9&#xD;
      questionnaire was filled in by the patient with the assistance of health personnel. The total&#xD;
      PHQ-9 questionnaire score were added up and the severity of depression associated with the&#xD;
      score was reported to the patient's physician for further management.&#xD;
