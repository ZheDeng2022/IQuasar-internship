      Electrical stimulation has a wide range of clinical applications in rehabilitation, being&#xD;
      used for activities such as strengthening, pain control, management of edema, or control of&#xD;
      inflammation after injury or surgery. One of the most classic forms of electrotherapy is&#xD;
      direct current (DC), which stands out for its particular effects and which are not achieved&#xD;
      with other forms of electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new therapeutic alternative through DC is Percutaneous Microelectrolysis (MEP), which began&#xD;
      to have a significant boom in Latin America a couple of years ago. MEP is a minimally&#xD;
      invasive procedure in which a low intensity DC is used. MEP has been proposed as a&#xD;
      therapeutic resource to reduce muscle contractions and shortenings, thus favoring&#xD;
      flexibility, although research to support this effect is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle flexibility is an important component in rehabilitation and training programs. In&#xD;
      lower limbs, tightness hamstring muscles is a common condition that limits flexibility and&#xD;
      affects sedentary and athletic people. Loss of flexibility of hamstrings has been reported&#xD;
      for different sports disciplines, showing a decrease in a high percentage with the exception&#xD;
      of sports such as rhythmic gymnastics and dance where flexibility is essential for good&#xD;
      performance. Loss of hamstring extensibility has been associated with a higher incidence of&#xD;
      muscle tears, patellar tendinopathy, low back pain and alterations in lumbopelvic rhythm&#xD;
      associated with compensatory biomechanical changes such as limb shortening, pelvic&#xD;
      retroversion, and increased thoracic kyphosis, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is interesting to investigate the effectiveness of MEP in hamstring tightness. A increase&#xD;
      in hamstring flexibility can contribute to increased joint range, muscle strength, and lower&#xD;
      limb agility.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Electrotherapy is a valuable therapeutic resource used by physiotherapists for different&#xD;
           purposes, among which are the reduction of pain, control of edema, muscle strengthening,&#xD;
           control of the inflammatory process and promotion of tissue repair processes.[1,2]&#xD;
           Within the The most widely used electrotherapy modalities are Sensory Transcutaneous&#xD;
           Electrical Stimulation (TENS) and Burst Modulated Medium Frequency Alternating Currents&#xD;
           (BMAC) commonly applied for analgesic purposes or for neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
           stimulation (NMES).[2,3,4] Electromedicine also offers a variety of unidirectional&#xD;
           currents such as direct (DC) or galvanic current and other low-frequency variants with a&#xD;
           galvanic component such as diadynamic currents, 2-5 (Träbert), or faradic applications.&#xD;
           [2,5 ] Direct current, described by Alexander Volta at the end of the 18th century,&#xD;
           constitutes one of the first therapeutic currents, and has gained popularity in the last&#xD;
           decade due to its use in percutaneous electrical applications that seek to promote&#xD;
           tissue repair and decrease pain in musculoskeletal conditions. [5-10] DC is&#xD;
           characterized by a unidirectional charge flow, of low voltage (60 to 80 volts) and&#xD;
           constant intensity, and is produced from batteries or the rectification of alternating&#xD;
           current from the electrical network. DC has particular physiological effects that are&#xD;
           not achieved with other types of currents due to their physical characteristics. Its&#xD;
           effects are based on the electrolysis process, a chemical decomposition phenomenon of&#xD;
           some substances in solution subjected to a direct current and which results in&#xD;
           electrophoresis (ion migration) and the formation of acidic or basic substances.&#xD;
           [1,11-14] DC favors the accumulation of ions and charged molecules in the biological&#xD;
           tissues that underlie the electrodes where it is applied. The deposition of charges&#xD;
           occurs as a result of the electric forces of attraction and repulsion that are triggered&#xD;
           by molecular dissociation, ionic migration, and accumulation of positive or negative&#xD;
           charge depending on the electrode. All unidirectional currents are capable of greater or&#xD;
           Less measure of producing electrophoresis and electrolysis under its poles (anode and&#xD;
           cathode), triggering a series of physiological effects under the electrodes known as&#xD;
           polar effects. These effects occur due to the modification of the local tissue pH and&#xD;
           are directly related to the intensity of the current (mA) and its application time&#xD;
           (minutes). Acidification of the medium by the production of substances such as&#xD;
           hydrochloric acid (HCl) or carbonic acid (H2CO3), in addition to arteriolar&#xD;
           vasoconstriction, hyperpolarization of neurons and coagulation, while alkalinization,&#xD;
           caustic reactions due to the production of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), vasodilation,&#xD;
           facilitation, depolarization and blood liquefaction occur at the cathode. [5,11-15] Due&#xD;
           to its electrolytic effects, DC can cause chemical burns if its dosage is inadequate.&#xD;
           This is how DC applications use intensities of the order of 0.05 µA/cm2 at 1mA/cm2, and&#xD;
           treatment times between 12 to 15 minutes, although for iontophoresis applications,&#xD;
           application of drugs loaded with tr Ascutaneous by means of DC, times of up to 30 or 40&#xD;
           minutes can be reached, although with maximum current intensities between 2 to 4mA. This&#xD;
           dosage follows the recommendations of the literature to avoid potential adverse effects&#xD;
           such as acid or alkaline burns. [5,12,15,19] The stratum corneum of human skin, on the&#xD;
           other hand, constitutes an important barrier for bidirectional electric currents,&#xD;
           offering a high impedance. although this response is dependent on intensity and time. It&#xD;
           is the changes in skin impedance that ensure a depth of 4 to 5 cm for CD, a phenomenon&#xD;
           that supports iontophoresis applications or electroporation treatments for drug&#xD;
           delivery.[16,20,21]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Percutaneous Microelectrolysis (MEP) In the last decade, different percutaneous&#xD;
           procedures have emerged through DC that seek to induce electrolysis in deep&#xD;
           musculoskeletal tissues.[6-9,24-26] An example of these percutaneous modalities is&#xD;
           percutaneous microelectrolysis (MEP), which consists of the application of a&#xD;
           microgalvanic current through acupuncture needles and where high current densities are&#xD;
           achieved in the tissues due to the smaller surface area of the needle (2.5 to 3.8&#xD;
           mA/cm2). Unlike other electrolysis treatments, MEP has reported less discomfort in&#xD;
           patients because microgalvanic currents (intensities less than 1 mA) are used in it. MEP&#xD;
           uses the acupuncture needle (active electrode) as a cathode to induce in the tissues the&#xD;
           synthesis of caustic substances such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide&#xD;
           (KOH) resulting from the interaction of sodium (Na+2) and potassium (K+) ions with water&#xD;
           (H2O) molecules. This promotes a controlled acute inflammatory response coupled with the&#xD;
           release of molecular hydrogen or dihydrogen (H2) that inhibits free radicals that are&#xD;
           concentrated in damaged musculoskeletal tissues. The analgesic effects of MEP are&#xD;
           explained by the destruction of local free nerve endings as a consequence of the caustic&#xD;
           response of the cathode. On the other hand, the needle's own mechanical stimulation&#xD;
           promotes tissue micro-rupture that enhances the proinflammatory physiological effects of&#xD;
           galvanism. Controlled inflammation induced by MEP promotes collagen genesis and&#xD;
           increased circulation, initiating a new repair process Tissue. MEP is currently used as&#xD;
           a treatment for acute and chronic tendon injuries, muscle injuries, and in the&#xD;
           dermatofunctional area for the management of wrinkles, stretch marks, fibrosis and&#xD;
           neuropathic scars. MEP has been proposed as a resource Therapeutic to reduce muscle&#xD;
           contractions and shortenings, thus favoring flexibility, although there is a lack of&#xD;
           research to support this effect.[24-30]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Muscle flexibility Muscle flexibility is an important component in rehabilitation and&#xD;
           training programs. In the lower limb, hamstring muscle shortening is a recurrent&#xD;
           condition, a common condition that limits flexibility and affects sedentary, physically&#xD;
           active, and athletic people. Hamstring flexibility is frequently evaluated in clinical&#xD;
           tests and sports training, and is considered a component Basic physical abilities. Loss&#xD;
           of flexibility of the hamstrings is associated with short-run sports and those in which&#xD;
           knee flexion is favored, such as skiing, soccer, rugby, basketball, tennis, judo and&#xD;
           volleyball.[31,32,33] Loss of hamstring flexibility has been reported for different&#xD;
           sports disciplines, showing a decrease in a high percentage except for sports such as&#xD;
           rhythmic gymnastics and dance where flexibility is essential for good performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hamstring tightness is characterized by a length-tension alteration compromising the&#xD;
           articular range of hip flexion and knee extension, also associated with imbalances of&#xD;
           muscular strength of the quadriceps-hamstring complex, which has been reported in soccer&#xD;
           players. [31-35] Loss hamstring extensibility has been associated with a higher&#xD;
           incidence of muscle tears, patellar tendinopathy, low back pain, and alterations in the&#xD;
           lumbar-pelvic rhythm associated with compensatory biomechanical changes such as limb&#xD;
           shortening, pelvic retroversion, and increased thoracic kyphosis. In addition, studies&#xD;
           in soccer players have documented that a limitation in hamstring flexibility can&#xD;
           compromise vertical jump, kick speed, short stroke and agility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Among the clinical tests used to evaluate hamstring tightness, the tests of straight leg&#xD;
           elevation (Straight Leg Raising or SLR) and active knee extension (Active Knee Extension&#xD;
           or AKE) stand out, the former demonstrating an intraclass reliability of 0.94 and the&#xD;
           second an inter-examiner reliability of 0.99 (r). SLR is also used as a neurodynamic&#xD;
           maneuver and as a test for clinical diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy, lumbar hernia or&#xD;
           sciatica, demonstrating a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.26. [31,34,40,41]&#xD;
           Loss of hamstring extensibility is considered a modifiable risk variable and can be&#xD;
           treated to prevent muscle injuries, especially if hamstring tear is considered to be one&#xD;
           of the most frequent injuries in the athlete population and physically active people. In&#xD;
           this sense, physical therapy has different intervention strategies to recover or improve&#xD;
           flexibility, highlighting stretching exercises, soft tissue mobilization techniques,&#xD;
           muscle energy techniques (PNF), neurodynamic sliding, electrical muscle elongation, dry&#xD;
           puncture or thermotherapy modalities, although most of them have a short-lasting effect&#xD;
           if they are not maintained over time. However, the static stretching strategy is the&#xD;
           most used by physical therapists, sports trainers and physical educators, demonstrated&#xD;
           good results in short and long or term.[31,49,50-52]&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Type of study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Experimental study, randomized clinical trial (RCT). Participants will be divided&#xD;
           through a simple randomization process into three study groups; group 1 (application of&#xD;
           microelectrolysis in the muscular belly), group 2 (application of microelectrolysis at&#xD;
           the tendon level in the hamstrings) and group 3 (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Ethical considerations of research&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be presented to the Ethics Committee of the Eastern Metropolitan Health&#xD;
           Service (SSMO) following the protocol of the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
           An informed consent will be applied to the participants in which the protocol and all&#xD;
           the procedures of intervention. It will be made explicit in writing and verbally that&#xD;
           the confidentiality of the data will be kept absolute, that participation will be&#xD;
           voluntary and that the participants are free to leave the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3. Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.1 Conceptual definition of the variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agility: Precise acceleration and deceleration movements and direction changes in&#xD;
                the shortest possible time in seconds (sec) for the Agility T-Test. The test will&#xD;
                consist of two attempts recording the shortest of the times obtained as the final&#xD;
                value.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Muscular strength: Maximum isometric strength (FIMáx) of shortened hamstrings and&#xD;
                ipsilateral femoral quadriceps developed over 4 to 6 seconds, obtained from the&#xD;
                best of three attempts in a voluntary maximum contraction. Hamstring and quadriceps&#xD;
                strength will be assessed with electromechanical dynamometry on a quadriceps table&#xD;
                with the participant seated keeping his knee flexed 90° and anchoring the&#xD;
                dynamometer pulley at the distal end of the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knee joint range: Maximum active range of knee extension performed with the limb&#xD;
                shortened in the supine position from a 90° hip flexion and 90° knee flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percutaneous microelectrolysis (MEP): Direct current application percutaneously&#xD;
                using an acupuncture needle with intensities in microamps (µA) at the level of the&#xD;
                muscular belly or hamstring tendon. The acupuncture needle will correspond to the&#xD;
                negative electrode or cathode.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stretching exercise: Passive assisted stretching performed by a physical therapist&#xD;
                on the shortened hamstrings. The stretch will be performed with the participant in&#xD;
                the supine position through the straight leg extension test (SLR), perceiving the&#xD;
                point of maximum hamstring tension and keeping the limb at that point for 30&#xD;
                seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.2. Operational definition of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agility: Agility will be quantified as the minimum time in seconds (sec) that the&#xD;
                participant takes to complete the circuit for the Agility T-Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Muscular strength: The strength of the hamstrings and femoral quads will be&#xD;
                evaluated with the Dynasystem functional electromechanical dynamometer (DEMF) from&#xD;
                the company Symotech (Madrid, Spain). The maximum isometric force shall be recorded&#xD;
                in newtons (N).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knee joint range: The active range of knee extension will be evaluated in degrees&#xD;
                of extension using the Active Knee Extension Test (AKE) with a manual goniometer&#xD;
                (APPENDIX 7). The lateral condyle of the femur will be taken as a fixed point, the&#xD;
                fixed arm will remain parallel to the axis of the thigh and the mobile arm will&#xD;
                project to the ipsilateral lateral malleolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percutaneous microelectrolysis (MEP): CD will be applied with the SVELTIA® electro&#xD;
                stimulator. The current dose (mA * min) applied to each participant will be&#xD;
                recorded based on the current intensity (mA) and total therapeutic time (minutes).&#xD;
                The protocol will include three 600 µA direct current applications interrupted by&#xD;
                30 second intervals between applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stretching exercise: 5 sets of passive static hamstring stretches will be performed&#xD;
                using the straight leg extension test (SLR) for a time of 30 seconds and an&#xD;
                interval of 30 seconds for each series.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.3.3. Variable type definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Agility: Dependent, quantitative, ratio variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Muscular strength: Dependent, quantitative, ratio variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knee joint range: Dependent, quantitative, interval variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percutaneous microelectrolysis (MEP): Independent, quantitative, interval variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stretching exercise: Independent variable, quantitative, ratio variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. MATERIALS AND METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the study, the athletes from the Andrés Bello University belonging to the rugby,&#xD;
           soccer, basketball or tennis teams will be considered as participants. An invitation&#xD;
           will be made to all athletes through the institution's National Director of Sports,&#xD;
           making it clear that participation is completely voluntary. Those interested will be&#xD;
           contacted via email or telephone and will be summoned in person to explain the&#xD;
           characteristics and objectives of the study. Subsequently, they will be asked to sign a&#xD;
           consent, making explicit the voluntary participation and the withdrawal to continue at&#xD;
           the time they determine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Aletorization and sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants will be evaluated according to the selection criteria (inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion) through a survey with closed questions and a clinical examination in which&#xD;
           the presence or absence of hamstring shortening will be determined, as well as its&#xD;
           laterality. . Participants will be divided through a simple randomization process (table&#xD;
           of random numbers) into three study groups; group 1 (application of microelectrolysis in&#xD;
           the muscular belly), group 2 (application of microelectrolysis at the tendon level in&#xD;
           the hamstrings) and group 3 (control). All groups will be called twice a week to carry&#xD;
           out the assigned treatment. All groups will receive as a basic treatment a therapeutic&#xD;
           exercise plan for static hamstring stretching of 5 series for 30 seconds twice a week,&#xD;
           and groups 1 and 2 will receive in addition to the exercise plan an intervention of&#xD;
           differentiated microelectrolysis (in the muscle belly or tendon).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size was determined from the effect size obtained by evidence reported for&#xD;
           static stretching. Therefore the sample size is calculated as 10 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Process&#xD;
&#xD;
           Joint range of knee extension, maximum isometric muscle strength of quadriceps and&#xD;
           hamstrings, and agility will be evaluated in all groups once a week. The study will last&#xD;
           4 weeks, so all groups will complete a total of 8 treatment sessions and 4 evaluation&#xD;
           sessions. Joint range differences (ΔROM), maximum isometric muscle strength difference&#xD;
           (ΔFImax) and agility difference (ΔAg) between the 4 sessions will be considered as main&#xD;
           variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4. Phases of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three phases have been designated for the investigation; 1. Sampling phase, 2.&#xD;
           Evaluation phase and 3. Intervention phase. The sampling phase will consist of applying&#xD;
           the selection survey to all athletes interested in participating in the study. The&#xD;
           survey will be applied to those selected for rugby, soccer, basketball and tennis at&#xD;
           Andrés Bello University through the Google Drive® system. All those who meet the survey&#xD;
           selection criteria will be invited to participate in the research. This stage will last&#xD;
           two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The evaluation phase will last two weeks and will determine a second filter of the&#xD;
           population. The athletes selected by the survey and who gave their written consent will&#xD;
           participate in it. At this stage, a clinical examination will be performed to determine&#xD;
           the presence of hypermobility using the Beighton hypermobility test and the presence of&#xD;
           hamstring shortening through the Straight Leg Raising (SLR) test. An examiner will&#xD;
           assess the presence of hypermobility in athletes to later assess the presence or absence&#xD;
           of hamstring shortening. In relation to the Beighton test, a score greater than 5 will&#xD;
           indicate the presence of hypermobility and will exclude the study participant. The SLR&#xD;
           test will be performed using an inclinometer and will be considered a positive test when&#xD;
           the participant reports tightness or tension in the back of the thigh when raising the&#xD;
           limb with an angle less than 80° of hip flexion.If Both extremities have an elevation of&#xD;
           less than 80°. The one with the lowest value will be considered short. Participants with&#xD;
           a negative physical examination (-), that is, without the presence of hamstring&#xD;
           shortening according to the protocol, will be excluded, while those with a positive&#xD;
           physical examination (+) will become the definitive sample. The evaluator will record&#xD;
           the laterality of the limb with the shortening in a Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The intervention phase will take place over a period of 10 weeks. The sample will be&#xD;
           randomized into three working groups; group 1 (application of microelectrolysis in the&#xD;
           muscular belly), group 2 (application of microelectrolysis at the tendon level in the&#xD;
           hamstrings) and group 3 (control). The randomization of the sample will be performed by&#xD;
           the study director using the simple random sampling process through a table of random&#xD;
           numbers taken from the tables proposed by the RAND Corporation®. The study director will&#xD;
           be the only one with access to the randomization table. Demographic variables (secondary&#xD;
           variables) for each group, including age, sex and body mass index (BMI) will be&#xD;
           tabulated in a Microsoft Excel® program spreadsheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants in each group will be evaluated by three evaluators to determine knee&#xD;
           extension basal joint range (ROMEXT), maximum isometric muscle strength for hamstrings&#xD;
           and ipsilateral femoral quadriceps (FIImax and FICmax), and agility in (Ag). The range&#xD;
           will be measured through goniometry, muscle strength will be evaluated by&#xD;
           electromechanical dynamometry and agility will be determined through the T agility test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ROMEXT, FImax and Ag values will be evaluated in degrees (°), Newtons (N) and seconds&#xD;
           (sec) respectively, and will be considered as primary variables of the study. ROMEXT,&#xD;
           FImax and Ag will be tabulated in an Excel® spreadsheet for each evaluator. The&#xD;
           evaluations will last 4 weeks, with one evaluation per week. Said evaluation will be&#xD;
           carried out before and after the intervention assigned to each group. Participants will&#xD;
           be called twice a week to carry out their corresponding treatments, making one of these&#xD;
           visits coincide with the corresponding evaluation session for the current week.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The descriptive statistics for the primary variables ROMEXT, FImax and Ag will use as&#xD;
           analysis measures, means and standard deviation (x, DS), or median and interquartile&#xD;
           range (med, RIC). For secondary variables such as sex, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
           frequencies and averages or medians, respectively, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regarding inferential statistics, the SHAPIRO WILK (S-WILK) normality test will be used&#xD;
           to determine if the distribution of data obtained for the primary and secondary&#xD;
           variables is normal or not, and according to this, the statistical test atingente, test&#xD;
           ANOVA if the data distributes normally or Kruskal Wallis test if the data does not&#xD;
           distribute normal. The SPSS v.24.0 program will be used for the statistical calculation.&#xD;
           Once the analysis is done, a month will be considered for the analysis of the results&#xD;
           obtained, discussion approach and conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EVALUATION PROTOCOLS&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1. Hypermobility Assessment - Beighton Hypermobility Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Beighton test is a clinical test for the detection of ligament hypermobility or excessive&#xD;
      joint range (joint hypermobility). The test requires having a score equal to 5 or higher of a&#xD;
      total of 9 to be considered positive (+). Participants are evaluated on a 9-point scale,&#xD;
      considering 1 point for each hypermobile site, performed bilaterally. The test includes the&#xD;
      following points;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperextension of the elbows (greater than 10°), with the subject sitting on a stool and&#xD;
           with the arm explored by the extension examiner (bilateral evaluation, 2 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passively touch the forearm with the thumb, holding the wrist in flexion, with the&#xD;
           individual in the same position as the previous point (bilateral evaluation, 2 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Passive extension of the index finger to more than 90°, with the participant sitting and&#xD;
           with the palm of the hand fully resting on the table (bilateral evaluation, 2 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hyperextension of the knees (more than 100°), with the participant in supine position&#xD;
           (bilateral evaluation, 2 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forward trunk flexion touching the ground with the palms of the hands when bending over&#xD;
           without bending the knees (1 point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who give a positive Beighton test (+) will be excluded from the study this&#xD;
      because joint hypermobility can generate false negative short hamstrings for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Hamstring Shortening Assessment - Straight Leg Hip Flexion Test (SLR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be performed using the straight leg hip flexion test (SLR). The straight&#xD;
      leg lift is a passive test testing each limb individually. The participant will lie supine&#xD;
      without a pillow under his head, while the examiner will stand on the side of the table. The&#xD;
      evaluator will take the ankle and passively flex one of the hips keeping the knee in&#xD;
      extension while the point of tension is perceived, accompanied by a sensation of tightness&#xD;
      reported by the user. The angle formed between the surface of the stretcher and the axis of&#xD;
      the lower limb will be measured. It will be considered as a positive test (+) if the degree&#xD;
      of tension referred to with the test is less than 80°, while if the tension appears above 80°&#xD;
      the negative test (-) will be considered. The test is compared with the contralateral side to&#xD;
      determine the predominance of hamstring shortening. Possible findings when performing the&#xD;
      test may include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neither limb has short hamstrings; SLR negative (-) bilaterally. The participant will be&#xD;
           excluded by not completing the selection criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One of the extremities has short hamstrings; Positive SLR (+) for one of the two&#xD;
           extremities. The participant will be included in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Both limbs drop short hamstrings; SLR positive bilaterally. The participant will be&#xD;
           included in the research and the limb with the least degrees of elevation will be&#xD;
           considered as the side with short hamstrings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. Joint Knee Range Assessment - Active Knee Extension Test (AKE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Active Knee Extension Test (AKE) is used to assess the length of the hamstrings and the&#xD;
      range of active knee extension in the 90 ° hip flexion position. The participant will be&#xD;
      placed in a supine position on a stretcher while maintaining one hip in 90° flexion and the&#xD;
      knee in 90 ° flexion while the contralateral lower extremity is fully supported. The&#xD;
      participant is instructed to perform an active maximum knee extension. The evaluator will&#xD;
      measure the angle of extension from the knee flexion position of 90°, which will be&#xD;
      considered as the 0 ° articular position from which the measurement will be recorded. The&#xD;
      degrees of knee extension will be recorded using a manual goniometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4. Evaluation of muscular strength of hamstrings and femoral quadriceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum voluntary isometric contraction of the knee flexor and extensor muscles will be&#xD;
      assessed. Strength will be assessed through a functional electromechanical dynamometer (DEMF)&#xD;
      on the side that was recorded with short hamstrings. For the evaluation, the participant will&#xD;
      be placed on a quadriceps table keeping the knee in 90° flexion while fixing the thigh in its&#xD;
      anterior distal part with a belt to avoid lifting the thigh during the test. The participant&#xD;
      must keep his back supported during the test. For the record, the pulley will be anchored to&#xD;
      the distal end of the leg, maintaining a 90° angle between the pulley and the leg. To record&#xD;
      the hamstring strength, the pulley will be placed in front of the leg so that the participant&#xD;
      flexes the knee and the rope perceives the degree of tension generated. To record the&#xD;
      quadriceps force, the pulley will be anchored behind the leg so that when performing the knee&#xD;
      extension the rope perceives the tension generated. Before the test, each subject will&#xD;
      perform an adequate warm-up, consisting of 2 to 3 submaximal contractions to become familiar&#xD;
      with the test procedure. Each subject will perform a maximum voluntary isometric contraction&#xD;
      for hamstrings and femoral quads for 4 to 6 seconds in three series. 1 minute rest between&#xD;
      attempts will be considered to avoid the effects of fatigue. During the test the subject will&#xD;
      be instructed to exert as much force as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5. Agility assessment - T Agility test (T Agility test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Agility T-Test is reliable and valid to measure the ability to quickly change directions&#xD;
      and speed based on stops and agility. The test consists of various multidirectional&#xD;
      displacements, running forward, laterally to the right and left. For the test, 4 cones (a, b,&#xD;
      c and d) are used simulating the letter t. Three of them are placed at a lateral distance of&#xD;
      5 meters and another is placed 10 meters from the central cone. The participant will be&#xD;
      instructed to run as fast as possible from the first cone (cone a) forward (cone b), then&#xD;
      move laterally to the right (cone c), then laterally to the left (cone d), to return&#xD;
      laterally to the cone b and run to the starting cone (cone a). Agility will be quantified as&#xD;
      the minimum time in seconds (sec) that the participant takes to complete the circuit for the&#xD;
      test. The test will be carried out in two attempts taking, registering the least of the times&#xD;
      as the final value. A 2-minute break will be considered between attempts to avoid the effects&#xD;
      of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before performing the agility test, a five-minute pre-heating will be carried out on a cycle&#xD;
      ergometer (MONARK 915E®) at a power of 80 watts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. TREATMENT PROTOCOLS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1. Application of electrotherapy Percutaneous Microelectrolysis (MEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the application of microelectrolysis, the SVELTIA® Direct Current equipment will be used.&#xD;
      Acupuncture needles 0.3 millimeters thick and 25 millimeters long will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed with latex gloves to avoid any contact with the skin. The&#xD;
      acupuncture needle will be inserted into the point of the muscular belly or hamstring tendon.&#xD;
      It will work with an intensity of 0.6 milliamps (mA). It will be entered perpendicularly with&#xD;
      the acupuncture needle mounted on the device's pointer with an emission of 100 microamps&#xD;
      (µA). When it has been entered, the intensity will be increased to 600 µA and the participant&#xD;
      will be told that when burning, pain or oppression appears, and that these discomforts become&#xD;
      uncomfortable, notify the provider. The time of emission until the appearance of symptoms&#xD;
      will be designated as T1. At that time the broadcast will be paused for 30 seconds. A second&#xD;
      emission will be carried out maintaining the 600 µA until the participant again manifests a&#xD;
      burning sensation or discomfort. The current application time will be recorded as T2. The 30&#xD;
      second pause will repeat. The third emission or T3 will be performed at the same time as the&#xD;
      emission registered for T2 or until the person reports discomfort by withdrawing the needle&#xD;
      to later finish the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After MEP, a reevaluation of the knee extension range (AKE test), hamstring and femoral&#xD;
      quadriceps (functional electromechanical dynamometry) and agility test (T-Test) will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Passive static stretching application (group 1, 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three groups will receive as a base treatment a hamstring stretching protocol for the&#xD;
      limb evaluated with shortening. The stretch will be performed using the straight leg hip&#xD;
      flexion test (SLR). The handler will raise the shortened lower limb to the point of maximum&#xD;
      tension reported by the participant to keep it in that position. The stretches will consist&#xD;
      of 5 sets of 30 seconds with a break between sets of 30 seconds, thus completing a 1-minute&#xD;
      work cycle (stretching and resting). The time will begin to count after locating the stress&#xD;
      angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention with stretching exercises for group 3 (control group), a reevaluation&#xD;
      of the knee extension range (AKE test), hamstring and femoral quadriceps (functional&#xD;
      electromechanical dynamometry) and agility test (T-Test) will be performed). On the other&#xD;
      hand, once the stretching exercises for group 1 and 2 (muscular and tendon microelectrolysis)&#xD;
      have been completed, a reevaluation of the knee extension range (AKE test), hamstring muscle&#xD;
      strength and femoral quadriceps (functional electromechanical dynamometry) and agility test&#xD;
      will be performed. (T-Test).&#xD;
