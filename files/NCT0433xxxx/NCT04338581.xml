  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 714 for the treatment of adult&#xD;
      participants with vitiligo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy of interleukin-15 (IL-15)&#xD;
      inhibition with AMG 714 at inducing facial repigmentation in vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 714 in vitiligo- -Determine the efficacy of&#xD;
      IL-15 inhibition with AMG 714 at inducing total body skin repigmentation in vitiligo-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the durability of the skin repigmentation achieved by AMG 714 in vitiligo, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the efficacy of AMG 714 followed by narrow band UVB (nbUVB) phototherapy.&#xD;
