  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center expanded access program designed to provide access to&#xD;
      Copper Cu 64 Dotatate for the detection, localization, and monitoring of NETs to patients&#xD;
      that did not have access during the Phase 3 Trial.&#xD;

      The objective of this trial is to provide patients with confirmed or suspicion of NET access&#xD;
      to Copper Cu 64 Dotatate for the detection, localization, and monitoring of SSTR expressing&#xD;
      NETs, bridging the gap between investigational product availability in clinical studies and&#xD;
      marketed product availability following US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.&#xD;
