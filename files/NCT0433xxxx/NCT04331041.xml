  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced pancreas adenocarcinoma will be randomized on a 6:1 basis to receive&#xD;
      standard of care chemotherapy followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with&#xD;
      concurrent and adjuvant FAK inhibitor defactinib (experimental arm) or standard of care&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by SBRT (control arm). Patients enrolled to the experimental arm will&#xD;
      be assessed for clinical outcomes such as progression free survival (PFS), local control,&#xD;
      distant control, and toxicity. The first 6 patients randomized to the experimental arm will&#xD;
      be considered the safety lead-in and will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).&#xD;
      The 6 patients randomized to the control arm will be evaluated for correlatives but will not&#xD;
      be included in the analysis for primary and secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: locally advanced pancreas cancer patients treated with SBRT and concurrent plus&#xD;
      adjuvant defactinib will have increased PFS compared to historical rates for patients&#xD;
      receiving SBRT alone.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this study will receive 5 fractions of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and seventeen 21-day cycles of defactinib (beginning on Day 2 of radiation).&#xD;
Participants who are candidates for surgical resection will undergo standard of care surgery at 2 weeks post-end of SBRT (+/- 1 weeks) or 12 weeks post-end of SBRT (+/- 1 week). These participants will discontinue defactinib the day prior to the operation and will resume taking it for the remainder of the 17 cycles 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Participants who are not candidates for surgical resection will continue to receive defactinib uninterrupted. All participants should receive 17 cycles of defactinib unless they experience disease progression or intolerable toxicity.</description>
