  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter phase II randomized controlled trial. The purpose is to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemoradiation&#xD;
      for patients with high-risk resectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will recruit 92 patients, and they will be randomized (1:1) into two groups&#xD;
      (chemoradiation+immunotherapy group, observation group) after operation. Patients in&#xD;
      chemoradiation+immunotherapy group will receive camrelizumab 200mg intravenously every 3&#xD;
      weeks until clinical or radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death,&#xD;
      termination of the study or withdrawal. After 1 or 2 courses of camrelizumab, patients went&#xD;
      on to receive capecitabine (1,330 mg/m2 per day, in divided doses twice daily, 7 days per&#xD;
      week) concurrent with radiotherapy (45 Gy to regional lymph nodes and 54 to 59.4 Gy to&#xD;
      preoperative tumor bed). Patients in observation group will not receive any anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
