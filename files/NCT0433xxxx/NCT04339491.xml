    <measure>Exercise Habit and Factors Affecting Exercise Attendance</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment will be made once at baseline, data collection will be completed up to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It was created by the researchers due to the fact that the existing surveys could not meet the pandemic period. It will be questioned whether the participants had exercise habits in the times before the pandemic. Possible reasons will be questioned according to the positive and negative answers. The answers of the questions are yes / no and they will not be scored. Frequency evaluation will be made according to the results obtained.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>The assessment will be made once at baseline, data collection will be completed up to 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>IPAQ-SF provides information on walking, moderate and vigorous activities and time spent sitting, within a week. There are two forms of output from scoring the IPAQ. Results can be reported in categories (low activity levels, moderate activity levels or high activity levels) or as a continuous variable (MET minutes a week). MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity.</description>
