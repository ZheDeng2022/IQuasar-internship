      This study is an in-house feasibility study of penicillin biosensor technology linked with&#xD;
      closed-loop control for the automated delivery of penicillin antibiotics.&#xD;

      Outline of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place at the Imperial Clinical Research Facility (ICRF). Twenty healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will be recruited to take part in three visits to the ICRF. These will each last&#xD;
      8-12 hours. During these visits participants will receive penicillin via infusion following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Routine (intermittent or continuous) dosing protocols. (ii) Intermittent dosing directed&#xD;
      by a closed-loop control system. (iii) Continuous dosing directed by a closed-loop control&#xD;
      system. Participants will have up to 15 blood samples and tissue microdialysis performed. A&#xD;
      biosensor will also be used to provide real-time antibiotic concentration data. This will be&#xD;
      used to drive the closed-loop control system. Outcome measures will be PK-PD target&#xD;
      attainment between visits. This target will be 50% time &gt; MIC and 100% time &gt; MIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited from a healthy volunteer database held within Imperial&#xD;
      College London and via identification of participants within the College. An initial&#xD;
      advertisement e-mail will be sent by the Healthy Volunteer Database Administrator and&#xD;
      individuals responding will then followed up by telephone or e-mail and invited to attend a&#xD;
      screening visit at the ICRF. They will be sent the participant information leaflet via email&#xD;
      in advance of this meeting to give them time to consider the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty healthy volunteers will be invited to participate in an exploratory study of the&#xD;
           biosensor device and closed-loop control systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy status will be confirmed with the participant at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study days will follow the same format. The only deviation will be the method of&#xD;
           penicillin delivery (this will either be by routine infusion, closed-loop intermittent&#xD;
           infusion, or closed-loop continuous infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the night before study visits, participants will be asked to refrain from drinking&#xD;
           alcohol. On the study day they will be invited to bring a laptop / tablet device for&#xD;
           their entertainment. Alternatively, one will be provided on the study day by the ICRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On arrival at the study center the participant will have a microneedle biosensor sited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have two cannulae inserted, ideally one in each arm. One of these will be for&#xD;
           taking blood during the study. The other will be for penicillin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will also have a microdialysis fibre inserted in the same arm as the microneedle&#xD;
           array.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A baseline blood sample will be taken (full blood count, renal function, liver function,&#xD;
           and C-reactive protein) on each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The microneedle biosensor will be sited peripherally (on the non-dominant arm). These&#xD;
           sensors are connected to potentiostat devices that record data, which can then be&#xD;
           downloaded onto a computer for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will then commence at time = 0 when the first infusion of penicillin will be&#xD;
           given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In total, the study will run for 3 benzylpenicillin dosing intervals (8-12 hours). For&#xD;
           intermittent, routine care benzylpenicillin doses will be given at time = 0, 4, and 8&#xD;
           hours. During closed-loop control visits the controller will be allowed to determine the&#xD;
           dosing interval / period. The controller will be limited to deliver a MAXIMUM dose&#xD;
           equivalent to 2.4g every 4-hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study interval the participant will undergo rich blood and microdialysis drug&#xD;
           concentration sampling. For blood sampling, up to 15 beta-lactam drug levels will be&#xD;
           taken during the study visit period. Each blood test will involve the collection of 5mLs&#xD;
           of blood (1 teaspoon). Microdialysis will be performed continuously for the study&#xD;
           period. The collection vial will be changed every 15-30 minutes during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, a blood spot will be used from the blood samples taken as part of the PK&#xD;
           sampling to test point-of-care penicillin sensors at the time-points described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A visual analogue scale will be completed by the participant every hour to evaluate&#xD;
           their level of discomfort due to the microneedle sensor device. The device and site will&#xD;
           also be checked by researchers every hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time points for the blood sampling are planned to initially be taken at pre, 6, 10, 15,&#xD;
           30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 246, 250, 300, 480, 486, 600 minutes. However, following initial&#xD;
           PK analysis a D-optimal design will be employed using Pmetrics and BestDose&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic software to determine the optimal time points for blood PK analysis.&#xD;
