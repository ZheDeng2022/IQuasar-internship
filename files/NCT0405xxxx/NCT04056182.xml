      This is an open-label pilot trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine in&#xD;
      the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms while initiating outpatient treatment with&#xD;
      naltrexone. The initiation procedure will be a flexible detoxification lasting 2 to 10 days&#xD;
      concluding with the injection of XR-Naltrexone (Vivitrol). Vivitrol is a long-acting&#xD;
      injection that contains enough medicine to last for one month blocking the effects of&#xD;
      opioids.&#xD;

      This is an open-label pilot trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lofexidine in&#xD;
      the management of opioid withdrawal symptoms while initiating outpatient treatment with&#xD;
      naltrexone. Lofexidine is a nonopioid prescription medicine used in adults to help with the&#xD;
      symptoms of opioid withdrawal that may happen when a person stops taking an opioid suddenly.&#xD;
      The initiation procedure will be a flexible detoxification lasting 2 to 10 days concluding&#xD;
      with the injection of XR-Naltrexone (Vivitrol). Vivitrol is a long-acting injection that&#xD;
      contains enough medicine to last for one month blocking the effects of opioids. Lofexidine&#xD;
      will be fixed-flexible dosing started on day 1 with maximum dose being three 0.18mg tablets&#xD;
      taken orally 4 times daily at 4-to 6-hour intervals. Lofexidine treatment will continue&#xD;
      throughout the detoxification, up to 10 days, and will be discontinued with a gradual dose&#xD;
      reduction over 2 to 4 days. Precipitated withdrawal symptoms are treated with lofexidine,&#xD;
      clonazepam, and other comfort medications. After the induction patients will be seen at the&#xD;
      clinic for 8 weeks. Twice weekly for the first month and weekly for weeks 5-8. A second&#xD;
      Vivitrol injection will be provided at week 4.&#xD;
