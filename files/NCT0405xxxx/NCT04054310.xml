  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NASH trials will often use the criteria proposed by the NASH Clinical Research Network&#xD;
      (NASH-CRN), the NAS scoring system, to classify patients as suitable for study enrolment. NAS&#xD;
      is a summation of the histology scores for fat (0-3), inflammation (0-3), and ballooning&#xD;
      (0-2) with a score of 4 or 5 or higher regarded as NASH. Whilst the score doesn't include&#xD;
      fibrosis, the rapidly evolving clinical trials landscape in NASH has seen a shift in emphasis&#xD;
      from drugs proposed to target liver fat to the targeting of fibrosis. This was due to&#xD;
      observations contrary to the previously held belief that fibrosis could not improve, and the&#xD;
      data to support fibrosis being predictive of clinical outcomes. As a result, many clinical&#xD;
      trials now require patients to have a NAS ≥4 or 5, with the regulatory accepted criteria&#xD;
      requirement for at least a score of 1 for inflammation and 1 for ballooning, and evidence of&#xD;
      fibrosis of stage 2 or more (scored using the Kleiner-Brunt (0-4) scale). The route by which&#xD;
      a liver biopsy is indicated for inclusion to a clinical trial is usually based on patient&#xD;
      presentation and clinical work-up. In the Primary care patient presents with clinical risk&#xD;
      factors for NASH like metabolic syndrome. Blood biomarkers will be checked and if raised&#xD;
      patient will be referred to the hepatology. In the secondary care patient might have a&#xD;
      transient elastography and if CAP is equal or more than 280 and LSM is equal or more than 7&#xD;
      kPa, patient will have biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However clinical risk factors are often not sensitive enough, and NASH trials often suffer&#xD;
      from high levels of screen fails at biopsy, meaning a large proportion are unnecessarily&#xD;
      biopsied. Screening strategies are becoming increasingly more popular in order to reduce the&#xD;
      number that fail screening and metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as&#xD;
      T1-mapping and PDFF are emerging as promising diagnostic screening biomarkers in NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI exploits the magnetic properties of hydrogen nuclei protons within a determined magnetic&#xD;
      field. T1 mapping measures longitudinal relaxation time, a measure of how long it takes for&#xD;
      protons to re-equilibrate their spins to the magnetic field after being excited by a&#xD;
      radiofrequency pulse, and thus is an indicator of regional tissue water (proton) content. T1&#xD;
      mapping has shown promise as an effective biomarker of liver inflammation and fibrosis, as T1&#xD;
      relaxation time lengthens with increases in extracellular fluid (which may be caused by&#xD;
      fibrosis and/or inflammation). The presence of iron however, which can be accurately measured&#xD;
      from MRI-T2star (T2*) relaxation time, shortens the T1, and thus must be accounted for. An&#xD;
      algorithm has been created (Perspectum Diagnostics) that allows for the bias introduced by&#xD;
      elevated iron to be removed from the T1 measurements, yielding the iron corrected T1 (cT1).&#xD;
      Iron corrected T1 (cT1) has been shown to correlate with fibro-inflammatory disease and can&#xD;
      effectively stratify patients with NASH and cirrhosis (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI-PDFF is a ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the fraction of the MRI-visible protons&#xD;
      attributable to fat divided by all MRI-visible protons in that region of the liver&#xD;
      attributable to fat and water. Taking advantage of the chemical shift between fat and water,&#xD;
      pulse sequences including fast spin echo and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequences can be&#xD;
      used to acquire images at multiple echo times at which fat and water signals have different&#xD;
      phases relative to each other. PDFF has been shown to have excellent correlation between&#xD;
      histologically graded steatosis across the clinical range seen in NASH and high diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy in stratification of all grades of liver steatosis, although it is weaker in the&#xD;
      presence of advanced fibrosis. Whilst PDFF does not correlate with other features of NASH, it&#xD;
      has been reported that NAFLD patients with grade one steatosis are more likely to have&#xD;
      characteristics of advanced liver disease such as fibrosis and ballooning, and changes in&#xD;
      hepatic steatosis may be correlated with changes in other histological endpoints. Thus whilst&#xD;
      some authors advise caution about using PDFF as a biomarker of NASH it has been well accepted&#xD;
      by the NASH community as a biomarker for both enrolment and as an endpoint in NASH clinical&#xD;
      trials (e.g. MOZART: NCT01766713; FLINT: NCT01265498).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where cT1 appears to have an advantage over PDFF as a non-invasive biomarker for NASH, is in&#xD;
      detection of patients with both disease activity (ballooning and inflammation) and fibrosis&#xD;
      as cT1 has been reported to be correlated with ballooning, fibrosis and NAFLD activity score,&#xD;
      and has been shown to predict clinical outcomes. As such it is emerging as a promising&#xD;
      biomarker for both screening and as an endpoint in NASH clinical trials (NCT02421094;&#xD;
      NCT02912260) particularly those investigating mechanisms of action of fibro-inflammation, or&#xD;
      for distinguishing those with more advanced NASH with fibrosis. Both cT1 and PDFF can be&#xD;
      acquired as part of the LiverMultiScan™ (LMS) imaging protocol (Perspectum Diagnostics Ltd,&#xD;
      UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data reported in the literature, and from our preliminary analysis of N=109&#xD;
      biopsy-confirmed NAFL patients recruited from the two UK studies, both cT1 and PDFF appear to&#xD;
      have potential to become diagnostic biomarkers, that may have utility for clinical trial&#xD;
      population enrichment when used in conjunction with clinical risk factors. Specifically, for&#xD;
      PDFF to identify participants who are more likely to have histopathologic findings of&#xD;
      steatosis, and cT1 to identify participants who are more likely to have histopathologic&#xD;
      findings of NASH, and NASH with fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate cT1 (Corrected T1) as a diagnostic&#xD;
      biomarker that can be used, in conjunction with clinical risk factors, to identify patients&#xD;
      who are more likely to have liver histopathologic findings of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis&#xD;
      (NASH). Ideally, this biomarker should identify patients with a non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease activity score (NAS) ≥ 4 and liver fibrosis (NASH/CRN Brunt/Kleiner scale) ≥ stage 2&#xD;
      on histopathologic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our observations from earlier trials, our hypothesis is that we expect cT1 to have&#xD;
      good diagnostic accuracy for discriminating those with NAS≥4 &amp; F≥2 from those without&#xD;
