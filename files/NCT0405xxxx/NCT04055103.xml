  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Test whether an intervention, consisting of frequently feedback of performance outcomes and&#xD;
      education will improve patient care, expressed in better functional outcomes, fewer&#xD;
      complications and more quality improving interventions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted where hospitals will be randomized to an&#xD;
      early versus late group, stratified by teaching status as this might influence the time&#xD;
      available for quality improvement. Randomization will be done using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization table in a 1:1 ratio. During the study only orthopedic surgeons performing THA&#xD;
      and TKA will receive monthly feedback by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly feedback of performance outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education on how to use joint registry data for quality improvement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create awareness by sending monthly feedback about performance; education and by asking&#xD;
           what improvement activities have been introduced;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitals will be linked to hospital with opposite performance outcomes to exchange&#xD;
           information and find areas for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, the investigators will conduct monthly measurement on intermediate outcomes&#xD;
      showing whether the intervention reaches the target group (process evaluation). The following&#xD;
      measurements will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge among orthopaedic surgeons on their recent performance and how that relates to&#xD;
           others;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of quality improvement activities undertaken with the aim to improve the quality&#xD;
           of care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned improvement activities (e.g. record review to figure out why performance is not&#xD;
           as good as in other centers) together with who is responsible and by which time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of people attending the meetings, number of times a specific account has accessed&#xD;
           the LROI site to ensure that information has reached the target group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey among orthopaedic surgeons at the end of the intervention period on knowledge&#xD;
           learned and the extent to which they think this is sustainable in daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will compare the outcomes between the early and the late group&#xD;
      to test the effectiveness of the intervention, using the appropriate regression techniques.&#xD;
      In the second period the investigators will test the sustainability of this approach in daily&#xD;
      practice by comparing the outcomes within the early group with the first period, and compare&#xD;
      with the late group to test whether outcomes in the sustainability phase are similar as when&#xD;
      actively supported.&#xD;

This will be send monthly by email to the intervention group. Further, hospitals with worse performance for a certain outcome will be linked to hospitals with good performance for this outcome.</description>
