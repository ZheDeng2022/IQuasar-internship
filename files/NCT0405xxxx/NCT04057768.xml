      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of fractional RF for the&#xD;
      treatment and reduction of acne scarring or facial wrinkles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind, split face study of the efficacy of fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and reduction of acne scarring and facial wrinkles. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate the progress of 15 subjects requesting treatment of scarring or facial&#xD;
      wrinkles. The study will involve three treatments on both sides of the face with 3-5 week&#xD;
      intervals between each treatment. Subjects will be followed at 6 and 12 weeks after their&#xD;
      last treatment. Analysis will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Wrinkle Improvement Assessed by the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWES) at 12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of overall facial wrinkles improvement assessed live by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWES).&#xD;
The FWES is a 9 point scale.&#xD;
Three independent evaluators evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were: a score of 1 - 3 (Mild) indicates fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines, a score of 4 - 6 (Moderate) indicates distinct papular elastosis ([indvidual papules with yellow translucency under direct lighting] and dyschromia and a score of 7 - 9 (Severe) indicates multipapular and confluent elastosis [thickened yellow and pallid] approaching or consistent with cutis rhomboidalis. A lower class and a lower score means a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Overall Acne Scar Improvement Assessed by the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at 12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of overall facial acne scar improvement assessed live by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).&#xD;
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a seven-grade subjective test.&#xD;
Three independent evaluators evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were (3) Very Much Improved, (2) Much Improved, (1) Improved, (0) No Change, (-1) Worse, (-2) Much Worse, and (-3) Very Much Worse. For reporting of outcomes, the higher the GAIS value, the greater the improvement (Range -3 to 3).</description>

    <description>Subjects' assessment of satisfaction with the treatment using a 5 point Subject Satisfaction Scale at 6 Weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
The Subject Satisfaction Scale is a five-grade subjective test.&#xD;
Participant were asked their satisfaction level post treatment.&#xD;
Possible responses were (4) Very Satisfied, (3) Satisfied, (2) Having No Opinion, (1) Unsatisfied, and (0) Very Unsatisfied.</description>

The Wong-Baker FACES pain scoring system is a subject-reported instrument using a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most pain).&#xD;
Possible responses, 9 to 10 shows Hurts Worst, 7 to 8 shows Hurts Whole Lot, 5 to 6 shows Hurts Even More, 3 to 4 shows Hurts Little More, 1 to 2 shows Hurts Little Bit, 0 shows No Hurt.</description>

        <title>Overall Wrinkle Improvement Assessed by the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWES) at 12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</title>
        <description>Evaluate the efficacy of overall facial wrinkles improvement assessed live by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWES).&#xD;
The FWES is a 9 point scale.&#xD;
Three independent evaluators evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were: a score of 1 - 3 (Mild) indicates fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines, a score of 4 - 6 (Moderate) indicates distinct papular elastosis ([indvidual papules with yellow translucency under direct lighting] and dyschromia and a score of 7 - 9 (Severe) indicates multipapular and confluent elastosis [thickened yellow and pallid] approaching or consistent with cutis rhomboidalis. A lower class and a lower score means a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Overall Wrinkle Improvement Assessed by the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWES) at 12 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</title>
          <description>Evaluate the efficacy of overall facial wrinkles improvement assessed live by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis Scale (FWES).&#xD;
The FWES is a 9 point scale.&#xD;
Three independent evaluators evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were: a score of 1 - 3 (Mild) indicates fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines, a score of 4 - 6 (Moderate) indicates distinct papular elastosis ([indvidual papules with yellow translucency under direct lighting] and dyschromia and a score of 7 - 9 (Severe) indicates multipapular and confluent elastosis [thickened yellow and pallid] approaching or consistent with cutis rhomboidalis. A lower class and a lower score means a better outcome.</description>
