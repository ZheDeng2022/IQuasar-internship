  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can induce&#xD;
      change in cortical excitability and thus modulate brain plasticity in the human brain. tDCS&#xD;
      has been used in neurorehabilitation to benefit ischemic stroke patients at different stages&#xD;
      of stroke especially during acute, subacute, and chronic phase with positive and safety&#xD;
      reports. After a unilateral stroke, the excitability of the affected hemisphere is decreased,&#xD;
      an increase in the excitability of the unaffected hemisphere and an abnormally high&#xD;
      interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) drive from the intact to lesioned hemisphere have been&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These neuronal reorganizations and plasticity begin in the very early stages after stroke.&#xD;
      Prevent the abnormal IHI and thus increase the excitability of the affected hemisphere in the&#xD;
      early phase would be beneficial for stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the polarity-specific effects, anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability and&#xD;
      cathodal tDCS decreases cortical excitability. tDCS can be applied in two distinct montages:&#xD;
      monocephalic and bi-hemispheric/dual-tDCS (applying two electrodes over both cerebral&#xD;
      hemispheres at the same time). To induce post-stroke motor recovery, two different&#xD;
      monocephalic montages are typically used: i) to restore excitability in the ipsilesional&#xD;
      hemisphere: anode over the ipsilesional hemisphere and the cathode as the reference electrode&#xD;
      placed over the contra-orbital area ii) to down-regulate excitability of the contralesional&#xD;
      hemisphere and rebalance IHI: cathode over the contralesional hemisphere and the anode as the&#xD;
      reference electrode. Dual-tDCS can be also applied, permitting simultaneous coupling of&#xD;
      excitatory and inhibitory effects on both cortices. In the acute phase, there is few evidence&#xD;
      regarding the effect of tDCS on upper or lower limbs motor functions. However no evidence for&#xD;
      tDCS combined with training in the acute phase. Some previous studies reported a positive&#xD;
      effect on upper or lower limbs performance of tDCS with physical therapy in subacute to&#xD;
      chronic stroke. The immediate and long-term effectiveness of each tDCS montage (monocephalic&#xD;
      and bi-hemispheric/dual-tDCS) without physical rehabilitation in acute stroke also has been&#xD;
      reported. However, there is still unclear evidence regarding the best tDCS montage with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy for stroke recovery, especially for the early phase The&#xD;
      mechanism underlying cortical excitability changes after tDCS is still elusive. However, one&#xD;
      possible mechanism indicating a change in cortical activity is the subsequent variation in&#xD;
      hemodynamic response. Since different montages of tDCS can induce different responses on&#xD;
      brain excitability. Different methods have been developed for cerebral hemodynamic&#xD;
      evaluations i.e. cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). Transcranial color-coded duplex&#xD;
      ultrasonography (TCCD) has been used to measure CBFV through the major intracranial vessels&#xD;
      through relatively thin bone windows. It is a non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, safe, and&#xD;
      portable allowing bedside monitoring of CBFV that is convenient in the intensive care&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five consecutive days for tDCS over the M1 appeared to be safe in acute stroke patient and&#xD;
      tDCS over the M1 have been reported to improve motor functions and balance performance.&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes that have been using in the clinical setting such as Fugl-Meyer Assessment&#xD;
      for motor functions, strength assessed by hand-held dynamometer, Time up and go for dynamic&#xD;
      balance and mobility, Five times sit to stand the test for dynamic balance and muscle&#xD;
      strength will be used as a secondary motor outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate hemodynamic response and motor performance&#xD;
      following difference montages of 5 tDCS sessions over the primary motor cortex (M1) applied&#xD;
      before conventional physical therapy, at immediate after of 5-sessions and then follow up at&#xD;
      1 month.&#xD;
