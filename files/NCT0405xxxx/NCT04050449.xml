  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/dolutegravir (TLD) is being used more widely across&#xD;
      the world to treat HIV. This is an observational study (a type of study in which participants&#xD;
      are observed and certain outcomes are measured). The aim of this study is to observe how&#xD;
      successful TLD is at treating HIV, in the following groups of people:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People switching to TLD, after taking anti-HIV medication that contains a nonnucleoside&#xD;
           reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug (such as Efavirenz or Nevirapine) (Group&#xD;
           1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People switching to TLD, after taking anti-HIV medication that contains a boosted&#xD;
           protease inhibitor (PI) drug (such as Lopinavir or Atazanavir) (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People taking TLD and receiving medication for TB that includes the drug rifampicin&#xD;
           (RIF) (Group 3). These people must be starting one or both of these medications when&#xD;
           they enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People starting TLD who have not taken anti-HIV medication before (Group 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal of this study is to use genetic testing of the virus (HIV) to see how often HIV&#xD;
      is resistant to TLD. Genetic testing of the virus is one way to see if the TLD medication is&#xD;
      not working to treat a person's HIV infection.&#xD;
