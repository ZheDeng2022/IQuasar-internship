  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose&#xD;
      (SAD), sequential group study. It is a SAD study in healthy Non-Asian subjects (Part 1) and&#xD;
      healthy Japanese subjects (Part 2) to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD6615 and to&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD6615.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study part is planned to consist of 3 cohorts of Non-Asian subjects (Part 1) and 2&#xD;
      cohorts of Japanese subjects (Part 2). Part 2 will be initiated no earlier than after&#xD;
      completion of the last Safety Review Committee (SRC) review in Part 1. Healthy male and/or&#xD;
      female subjects aged 20 to 60 years will be included in both Parts 1 and 2 of the study.&#xD;
      Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. Study Part 1 is planned to be&#xD;
      conducted in 24 subjects but may be conducted in up to 40 subjects. Study Part 2 is planned&#xD;
      to be conducted in 16 subjects but may be conducted in up to 32 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cohort of Parts 1 and 2, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive AZD6615 and 2&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Dosing and food intake should be supervised&#xD;
      and documented by study staff when subjects are in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Dosing Session during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the&#xD;
           day before IMP administration (Day -1) until at least 78 hours after Investigational&#xD;
           medicinal product (IMP) administration; discharged on Day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-Up Period of 12 weeks that will consist of 6 Follow-Up Visits, for which the&#xD;
           subjects will return to the Clinical Unit at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each cohort, site personnel remain blinded until the SRC meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following review of the data, the SRC may also decide to adjust the following for subsequent&#xD;
      cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The time window between the sentinel dose group and the main dose group in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of the stay at the study site, the timing and number of assessments and/or&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The length of the data collection period for the SRC review.&#xD;
