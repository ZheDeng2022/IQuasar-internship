      The Connected Catheter is a fully internal, urethral indwelling urinary prosthesis designed&#xD;
      for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders requiring&#xD;
      catheterization. It is a sterile, extended-use device that resides fully internally to the&#xD;
      male lower urinary tract for an intended use life of up to 7 days per catheter.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal Singularity has developed the Connected Catheter System to address several drawbacks&#xD;
      of urinary catheters. The Connected Catheter is fully internal, indwelling urinary prosthesis&#xD;
      designed for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders requiring&#xD;
      catheterization. Each subject will use the Connected Catheter for up to 35-40 days. This&#xD;
      includes five device exchange appointments. The appointments are spaced 7 days apart and at&#xD;
      each appointment the catheter will be replaced with a new one. Additionally, weekly follow-up&#xD;
      will occur for 14 days following the final appointment after the subject discontinues use of&#xD;
      study device and reverts to his original catheter.&#xD;
