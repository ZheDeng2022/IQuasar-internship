      A phase I, single-site, open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-way crossover study to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This food-effect study plans to enroll 16 (at least 12 to complete the study) subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing sequences (fasted or standard high-fat&#xD;
      breakfast) at a 1:1 ratio generated from a computer. Each dosing sequence will consist of 2&#xD;
      cycles, with 1 dose in each cycle of the study and a washout period of at least 7 days&#xD;
      between each dose. Study drug will be administered to subjects in the morning of each&#xD;
      administration day of each cycle. PK, ECG, vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be performed as specified in the protocol. Tolerability and safety of the&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events.&#xD;

             positive result in alcohol breath test (baseline period), or patients who cannot&#xD;

             drug; If the half-life of other investigational drugs is longer, the time interval&#xD;
             required will be longer, suggesting 5 half-lives of the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood donation including blood components or massive blood loss (≥ 200 mL) within 3&#xD;
             months prior to screening; patients who had blood transfusion or have used blood&#xD;

             remedy within 14 days prior to the first dose of investigational drug. If the&#xD;
             half-life of the concomitant drug is longer, the time interval required will be&#xD;
             longer, which is suggested as 5 half-lives of the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any abnormal result in laboratory tests and other examination, which is judged as&#xD;
             clinical significance by the investigator.&#xD;

             reference to normal range (including boundary value): blood pressure 90-139/60-89&#xD;
             mmHg; pulse 60-100 bpm; body temperature (ear temperature) 35.4-37.7℃, the specific&#xD;
             conditions would be comprehensively determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. At screening, corrected QT interval (corrected by Fridericia's formula, QTcF =&#xD;
             QT/RR1/3) &gt; 450 msec or QRS complex &gt; 120 msec in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
             resting on supine. If QTc exceeds 450 msec or QRS exceeds 120 msec, 2 additional ECG&#xD;
             measurements should be repeated, and the subject's eligibility will be determined by&#xD;
             using the average value of the 3 QTc or QRS measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Unwilling or unable to follow the lifestyle guideline described in the study protocol&#xD;
             (e.g. dietary restrictions, activity and contraceptive requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Have other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric disease that, in the judgment of&#xD;
             the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable or increase the risk associated&#xD;
             with participating in this study, or would interfere with interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Have consumed chocolate, any caffeine-containing, xanthine-containing foods or&#xD;
             beverages, and other special diets affecting the absorption, distribution, metabolism,&#xD;
             and excretion of the drug during the admission period from screening to Day -2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Inability to keep abstinence from grapefruit or grapefruit-related citrus (e.g.&#xD;
             pomelo) fruits or juices within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug and for&#xD;
             the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Other subjects, judged by investigators, to be unsuitable for participation in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
