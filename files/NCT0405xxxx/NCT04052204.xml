  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 of the treatment period (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs were graded according to NCI- CTCAE version 4.03 and coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term (PT) as event category and MedDRA primary system organ class (SOC) body term as Body System category.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 months (246 days).</time_frame>
    <description>DR was defined, for participants with a confirmed Objective Response (OR), as the time from the first documentation of OR to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. The documentation of PD was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. If a subject had not had an event (PD or death), DR was censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.&#xD;
As there were no objective responses in the study, no participant met the definition of analysis population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tumor Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 months (246 days).</time_frame>
    <description>TTR was defined, for participants with objective response, as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective response (Complete Response or Partial Response) which was subsequently confirmed.&#xD;
As there were no objective responses in the study, no participant met the definition of analysis population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 months (246 days).</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS data were censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for participants who did not have an event (PD or death), for participants who started new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event, or for participants with an event after two or more missing tumor assessments. Participants who did not have an adequate baseline tumor assessment or who did not have any adequate post-baseline tumor assessments were censored on the date of first dose of study treatment unless death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment, in which case the death was considered an event. PFS time was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8 months (246 days).</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact.&#xD;
OS time was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters - Cmax and Ctrough for Avelumab and NKTR-214</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples were collected on Day 1 and Day 15 in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 for avelumab. Blood samples were collected on Day 1, Day 3, Day 4 and Day 8 in Cycle 1, Day1 and Day 8 in Cycle 2 for NKTR-214.</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax was defined as the maximum observed plasma concentration at the end of infusion. Ctrough was defined as the predose concentration at the end of dosing interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2 and end of treatment (EOT).</time_frame>
    <description>ADA against avelumab and NKTR-214 in serum samples was determined and reported separately for ADA never-positive, ADA ever-positive participants, baseline ADA positive, treatment-boosted ADA, treatment-induced ADA, transient ADA response, persistent ADA response. For all participants, blood for ADA samples was drawn from the contralateral arm of the avelumab and NKTR-214 infusion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Positive Neutralizing Antibody (nAb) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2 and EOT</time_frame>
    <description>nAb in serum samples was determined and reported separately for nAb never-positive, nAb ever-positive, baseline nAb positive, treatment-induced nAb, transient nAb response, persistent nAb response.</description>

    <measure>PD-L1 Expression Level in Baseline and On-treatment Tumor Tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>On-treatment biopsy is required to be collected on Cycle 1 between Days 9 and 14 for participants in Combination A.</time_frame>
    <description>PD-L1 expression level in baseline tumor tissue, and in on-treatment tumor tissue was defined as the number of PD-L1 positive cells and/or qualitative assessment of PD-L1 staining on tumor and/or inflammatory cells in regions of interest. PD-L1 expression level in baseline tumor tissue and in on-treatment tumor tissue were under pathological analyses, assisted by image analysis. Participants were classified as positive or negative according to scoring algorithms and cut-offs established from internal or external sources.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events(TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Death and Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs) During On-treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 6 months (190 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were any untoward medical occurrences in a participant or clinical study participants, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were those events with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period. On-treatment period was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment through minimum (30 days + last dose of study treatment). A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death, b. Was life-threatening, c. Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, d. Resulted in persistent disability/incapacity, e. Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

          <description>NKTR-214 was administered prior to avelumab. NKTR-214 0.006 mg/kg was administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W). Avelumab 800 mg as a 1-hour IV infusion was administered after the NKTR-214 Q2W, at the investigational site on an outpatient basis on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle. Within the 2-day window, avelumab and NKTR-214 were administered on the same day. Dose reduction of NKTR-214 to 0.003 mg/kg Q2W was triggered if higher than expected toxicity is observed at the higher dose (risk of excessive toxicity ≥ 0.25).</description>

          <description>The dose level for avelumab was fixed at 800 mg Q2W. The starting dose level for NKTR-214 and talazoparib was determined at the completion of the dose finding for Combination A based on available clinical data. The lowest allowed dose for NKTR-214 was 0.003 mg/kg and the lowest allowed dose for talazoparib was 0.5 mg once daily, in which case participants with moderate renal impairment cannot be enrolled. NKTR-214 was administered prior to avelumab. Talazoparib was taken at the clinic after all procedures/assessments completed, before or after the NKTR-214 and avelumab infusions.&#xD;

        <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS data were censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment for participants who did not have an event (PD or death), for participants who started new anti-cancer therapy prior to an event, or for participants with an event after two or more missing tumor assessments. Participants who did not have an adequate baseline tumor assessment or who did not have any adequate post-baseline tumor assessments were censored on the date of first dose of study treatment unless death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment, in which case the death was considered an event. PFS time was summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>Adverse events (AEs) were any untoward medical occurrences in a participant or clinical study participants, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were those events with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period. On-treatment period was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment through minimum (30 days + last dose of study treatment). A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death, b. Was life-threatening, c. Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, d. Resulted in persistent disability/incapacity, e. Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>

          <description>Adverse events (AEs) were any untoward medical occurrences in a participant or clinical study participants, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were those events with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period. On-treatment period was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment through minimum (30 days + last dose of study treatment). A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death, b. Was life-threatening, c. Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, d. Resulted in persistent disability/incapacity, e. Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator.</description>
