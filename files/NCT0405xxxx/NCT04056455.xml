  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that mobocertinib will eventually help people with cancer with severely reduced&#xD;
      kidney function. The main aim of this study is to learn about the levels of mobocertinib in&#xD;
      the blood and urine of participants with severely reduced kidney function and participants&#xD;
      with healthy kidneys. These participants do not have cancer. The information from this study&#xD;
      will be used to work out the best dose of mobocertinib for people with cancer with severely&#xD;
      reduced kidney function in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants who can take&#xD;
      part will be placed into 1 of 2 treatment groups. Participants with severely reduced kidney&#xD;
      function will be in 1 group. Participants with healthy kidneys will be in the other group.&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will receive the same treatment and the group results will be&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from both groups will take 1 capsule of mobocertinib. They will stay in the&#xD;
      clinic for 10 days so the study doctors can check the amount of mobocertinib in the blood and&#xD;
      urine of these participants over time. The study doctors will also check if the participants&#xD;
      have any side effects from this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic will call the participants 30 days after they took mobocertinib to check if they&#xD;
      have any more side effects from their treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called mobocertinib. This study is to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) of mobocertinib and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) in&#xD;
      participants with severe RI compared to matched-healthy participants with normal renal&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      the following 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe RI: Mobocertinib 80 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal Renal Function: Mobocertinib 80 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants with normal renal function will be recruited to match severe RI by age&#xD;
      (mean plus or minus [+-] 10 years), gender (+-2 participants per gender), and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), (mean +- 10 percent [%]). All participants will be asked to take single dose of&#xD;
      mobocertinib on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is 51 days. Participants will be contacted by telephone 30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

             equivalent/day from the 7 days prior to dose of mobocertinib and throughout the period&#xD;
             of PK sample collection.&#xD;

             screening divided by standard BSA value of 1.73 m^2. For participants with&#xD;
             non-standard BSA, the eGFR value calculated by MDRD formula will be multiplied by the&#xD;
             individual's BSA calculated using appropriate formula and divided by 1.73 m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a diagnosis of chronic (greater than [&gt;] 6 months), stable (no significant changes&#xD;

             function) renal insufficiency. Participants with RI may have related medical&#xD;
             conditions consistent with their disease (example, mild diabetes) that are stable for&#xD;

             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Seated blood pressure is less than 90/40 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or greater than&#xD;
             180/100 mmHg at screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. RI participants: QTcF interval is &gt;500 msec or has ECG findings deemed abnormal with&#xD;
             clinical significance by the Investigator or designee at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of any medication or substance&#xD;

             prohibited time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
