  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes including aerobic exercise training have strong evidence&#xD;
      of effectiveness in improving exercise capacity, dyspnoea and HRQL in patients with COPD.&#xD;
      Therefore, current guidelines recommend pulmonary rehabilitation, including exercise&#xD;
      training, in these patients. Non-invasive ventilation(NIV) is increasingly used during&#xD;
      exercise training programmes in order to train patients at intensity levels higher than&#xD;
      allowed by their clinical and pathophysiological conditions. Patient-ventilator asynchrony&#xD;
      (PVA) describes the poor interaction between the patient and the ventilator and is the&#xD;
      consequence of the respiratory muscle activity of the patient being opposed to the action of&#xD;
      the ventilator.PVA have unfavourable clinical impace on gas exchange, dyspnoea perception,&#xD;
      patient comfort and tolerance and reduced adherence to NIV. This study is going to detect&#xD;
      whether the PVA will increase when COPD patients exercise with NIV supporingt&#xD;

    <description>Asynchrony index is defined as the number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles (triggered or not) and of wasted efforts: asynchrony Index (expressed in percentage) = number of asynchrony events/total respiratory rate (ventilator cycles +wasted efforts) Ã— 100</description>
