      For patients with certain types of bladder cancer, the removal of the bladder and the&#xD;
      construction of an artificial bladder or reservoir are the only treatment options. Both&#xD;
      before and after treatment, patients and caregivers face profound challenges preparing for&#xD;
      surgery and planning for tasks during their recovery. To aid in recovery and enhance quality&#xD;
      of life this program of research will develop and evaluate a multi-stage intervention geared&#xD;
      towards patients and their caregivers. Part 1 of this program will have a nurse or trained&#xD;
      health professional prepare both patients and their caregivers before treatment about the&#xD;
      upcoming surgery. During this time the nurse will also demonstrate the necessary tools and&#xD;
      techniques for stoma care. In addition, patients and their caregivers will receive access to&#xD;
      a recovery website, specifically designed for bladder cancer patients to be used as a&#xD;
      resource for after treatment. The website will be part 2 of this research and will contain&#xD;
      important recovery information, videos about post-surgical care, testimonials by other&#xD;
      patients and physicians and a variety of other resources. Patients and caregivers in the&#xD;
      control group will receive the Facing Forward brochures from the National Cancer Institute in&#xD;
      part 2. This research has been funded by the National Cancer Institute and will be the first&#xD;
      study to address the needs of bladder cancer patients and their caregivers. The ultimate goal&#xD;
      of the study is to reduce infections and unplanned nurse/ER visits and improve quality of&#xD;
      life for both patients and their caregivers. This new program will be evaluated over the&#xD;
      course of 12-months and if found successful, has the potential to be disseminated throughout&#xD;
      the health care systems of the two study sites.&#xD;

      Treatment for certain types of bladder cancer (BC) involves the removal of the bladder and&#xD;
      construction of a new voiding system and is physically and psychologically profoundly&#xD;
      challenging for patients and caregivers. Based on investigators' published literature and&#xD;
      extensive pilot data, patients and caregivers have extensive unmet informational, social,&#xD;
      psychological, instrumental, and medical needs from the time of diagnosis, through treatment&#xD;
      and recovery which are not adequately addressed by health care professionals. Investigators&#xD;
      propose to address these unmet needs through the refinement and evaluation of a&#xD;
      comprehensive, 2-part (in-person and web-based) intervention, geared towards the patient and&#xD;
      caregiver. Specifically, during Aim 1, the formative phase, investigators propose to further&#xD;
      refine the newly developed intervention components with the help of an established&#xD;
      patient/caregiver advisory board. The intervention, Recovery Support for Bladder Cancer&#xD;
      (RSBC), consists of a pre-treatment, in-person preparatory instructional session with a&#xD;
      trained health care professional (Module 1) to equip patients and caregivers with the skills&#xD;
      to adjust to the upcoming treatment and recovery period. This is followed by a&#xD;
      post-treatment, interactive web-based program (Module 2) to provide further support for both&#xD;
      patients and caregivers to enhance quality of life (QOL) and reduce infections and nurse/ER&#xD;
      visits. The RSBC intervention will be evaluated in a 12-month randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (Aim 2) among patients and caregiver dyads (N=287 initial; 238 final sample) against a time&#xD;
      and attention comparison condition (the Facing Forward brochures). Primary outcomes for both&#xD;
      patients and caregivers will be improved QOL, which is hypothesized to be significantly&#xD;
      higher among participants randomized into RSBC. Secondary outcomes will be fewer infections&#xD;
      and nurse-ER visits for patients randomized into RSBC. Aim 3 proposes moderator (i.e., age,&#xD;
      gender, surgical diversion type) and mediator (i.e., patient activation, distress) analyses&#xD;
      of intervention efficacy. Investigators hypothesize that RSBC will be significantly more&#xD;
      successful among (a) older, (b) female participants, and (c) patients with a conduit&#xD;
      diversion type. Elevated levels of patient activation (i.e., higher self-care knowledge,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, lower distress) will mediate the intervention effects. Exploratory Aim 4 will&#xD;
      examine the costs and potential savings associated with developing and implementing the RSBC&#xD;
      intervention. Investigators hypothesize that initial development and implementation costs of&#xD;
      RSBC will be offset by reduced nurse/ER visits. The scientific premise is strong and&#xD;
      supported by an established theoretical framework, extensive pilot data and a rigorous&#xD;
      application of clinical research methods. The proposed study is highly innovative, as it&#xD;
      comprehensively addresses unmet needs of both patients and caregivers from pre- and&#xD;
      (immediate) post-treatment to recovery. This is achieved through an innovative combination of&#xD;
      in-person preparation and skill-building and web-based technology. If successful, RSBC has&#xD;
      the potential to significantly change clinical care for patients and caregivers with BC.&#xD;
