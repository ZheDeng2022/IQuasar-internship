      Objective: The aim of the present study is to analyze the immediate effect of a single&#xD;
      cervical spinal manipulation on cervical movement pattern. Further, To perform the sample&#xD;
      size calculation, the investigators took into consideration that the investigators pretend to&#xD;
      achieve a medium effect size (d=0.5) of the differences with two groups (EG and CG) and two&#xD;
      aimed to explore the impact on pain, disability and patient's improvement-perceived&#xD;
      sensation, comparing with a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study design is experimental and purposive sampling was used to select the study&#xD;
      participants. The grouping allocation was randomized. The people volunteer to participate in&#xD;
      the study, are assigned to the experimental group (EG) that will receive a single&#xD;
      manipulation, to the control group (CG) that will receive a single placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be assessed twice, one before the treatment and the other, after the&#xD;
      end. Head movement is recorded by means of a video-photogrammetry system from the coordinates&#xD;
      of a set of eight reflective markers located on a helmet. The movements will be record at 200&#xD;
      fps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each evaluation, the perceived pain and the neck disability index are also recorded. And&#xD;
      the impression of change is evaluated only in the second evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. Pain, Disability of the neck, Impression of Change, Range of motion (RoM), Maximum&#xD;
      angular velocity (MAV), Maximum angular acceleration (MAA) and Harmonicity (HARM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention, in both groups, it includes only one session that lasted 15&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Non-specific neck pain is defined as pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of&#xD;
      the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic&#xD;
      vertebra with no signs or symptoms of major structural pathology. It is a common&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorder that leads to substantial disability, discomfort, and reduced&#xD;
      cervical mobility, resulting in enormous health costs in terms of treatment and work&#xD;
      absenteeism. The American Physical Therapy Association's guidelines on neck pain recommends&#xD;
      utilizing cervical manipulation (CM) and mobilization procedures to reduce neck pain based on&#xD;
      strong evidence. Spinal manipulation is defined as &quot;a passive, high velocity, low amplitude&#xD;
      thrust applied to a joint complex within its anatomical limit with the intent to restore&#xD;
      optimal motion, function, and/or to reduce pain&quot; and its effectiveness, concretely of a&#xD;
      continuous program of cervical manipulations (CM), on neck pain has been largely studied. A&#xD;
      previous systematic review concluded that treatments based on CM are effective both alone and&#xD;
      in combination with exercises whilst other systematic reviews and an evidence-based guideline&#xD;
      showed that CM, combined with exercises, resulted to be more effective for neck pain,&#xD;
      function, and global perceived effect, than a therapeutic program based, exclusively, on CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of the pain decrease with this therapeutic approach&#xD;
      are not completely understood. A recent study aimed at analyzing the biomechanics of a single&#xD;
      CM, used a complex system of synchronized biplane radiographs to measure the facet gapping&#xD;
      during a single manipulation. Authors demonstrated that target and adjacent motion segments&#xD;
      undergo facet joint gapping during a manipulation and that segmental and global range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM) increases in all three planes of motion immediately after one manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting, the best of our knowledge, only one previous clinical trial have&#xD;
      analyzed the effectiveness of a single cervical manipulation on cervical range of motion,&#xD;
      comparing with placebo, demonstrating an improvement in all the global maximum cervical&#xD;
      movements, measured with the goniometer. However, pain may affect other movement'&#xD;
      characteristics beside the maximum range of motion (ROM), as velocity, variability or&#xD;
      movement harmony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, no previous study has analyzed the characteristics of the patients' cervical&#xD;
      motion pattern after a single manipulation which could provide information about functional&#xD;
      changes in cervical movements. People with neck pain, has shown more slow movements, less&#xD;
      harmonic movements in the points close to pain and exponential trend at the ends of the&#xD;
      range, even when cervical spine motion ranges remain within normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that functional assessment of the cervical spine based on the&#xD;
      analysis of the motion pattern, will let us know if a single manipulation is effective in the&#xD;
      improvement of those variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to analyze the immediate effect of a single cervical spinal&#xD;
      manipulation on cervical movement pattern. Further, the investigators aimed to explore the&#xD;
      impact on pain, disability and patient's improvement-perceived sensation, comparing with a&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Participants The study design is experimental and purposive sampling was used to&#xD;
      select the study participants. The grouping allocation was randomized. The people volunteer&#xD;
      to participate in the study, are assigned to the experimental group (EG) that will receive a&#xD;
      single CM, to the control group (CG) that will receive a single placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants should meet the following inclusion criteria: perceived pain scored 3 or&#xD;
      above, in a visual analogue scale, and neck functional status revealing a mild disability.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients had symptoms duration less than 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the exclusion criteria include an inflammatory rheumatic disease or an inner&#xD;
      ear disorder, the use of antidepressant opioid or sedative drugs, current vertigo or&#xD;
      dizziness, visual loss, neurological disorder, and trunk or shoulder surgery within the past&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size To perform the sample size calculation, the investigators took into consideration&#xD;
      to achieve a medium effect size (d=0.5) of the differences with two groups (EG and CG) and&#xD;
      two assessments (pre and post-treatment). Further, the investigators set a type I error of&#xD;
      5%, and a type II error of 20%. This power calculation resulted in 17 patients on each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment procedures The participants will be assessed twice, one before the treatment and&#xD;
      the other, after the end. Head movement is recorded by means of a video-photogrammetry system&#xD;
      from the coordinates of a set of eight reflective markers located on a helmet. The movements&#xD;
      will be record at 200 fps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants sit in a chair with the trunk fixed at the back by means of belts. In each&#xD;
      session, they perform three movements: flexion-extension (FE), lateral flexion (LB) and axial&#xD;
      rotation (AR) whose order was randomized. Each movement will be perform seven consecutive&#xD;
      times without stopping and achieving a continuous and smooth cyclic movement with the maximum&#xD;
      achievable range at their preferred speed. The participants are encouraged to practice the&#xD;
      three movements before the test begins, to avoid the learning effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each evaluation, the perceived pain and the neck disability index are also recorded. And&#xD;
      the impression of change is evaluated only in the second evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Pain, with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), in which the patients marked their level&#xD;
      of pain intensity on a 10-cm horizontal line (0= no pain to 10= maximum pain) at the time the&#xD;
      assessment was carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disability of the neck, with the 'Neck Disability Index', a self-report questionnaire used to&#xD;
      determine how neck pain affects a patient's daily life. Scoring is reported on a 0-50 scale,&#xD;
      0 being the best possible score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression of Change, with the self-reported measure 'Patient Global Impression of Change'&#xD;
      that reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of motion (RoM): angular excursion of the cervical motion. Maximum angular&#xD;
      velocity(MAV), it is measured as percentile 95 of angular velocity during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum angular acceleration(MAA), it is measas percentile 95 of angular acceleration during&#xD;
      the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harmonicity (HARM): is the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between two motion.&#xD;
      Thus HARM quantifies the fit between the actual movement and the simple harmonic motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention, in both groups, it includes only one session that lasted 15&#xD;
      minutes approximately. Participants should wear a sleeveless shirt that allows the&#xD;
      physiotherapist to treat the neck region. Evaluations and manipulations are performed by the&#xD;
      same experienced physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical manipulation intervention Prior to intervention, a screened for any signs of&#xD;
      vertebrobasilar insufficiency is performed by means of the vertebral artery compromise test,&#xD;
      as well as the root compression test using the Jackson test, and the screening for upper&#xD;
      cervical spine ligamentous instability through Sharp-Purser test, alar ligament stress test&#xD;
      and transverse ligament test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the evaluation and detect the cervical vertebral level with mobility restriction,&#xD;
      with the patient in supine position, a cervical examination is carried out to determine the&#xD;
      mobility restriction, both in flexo-extension, as in inclination and rotation. To check the&#xD;
      level of restriction, the post-anterior sliding test is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the vertebral levels with restriction have been detected, high speed and low amplitude&#xD;
      manipulation is carried out based on the location of the pain and the detection of the&#xD;
      perceived joint hypomobility, using the clinical criterion for this, with a maximum of 2&#xD;
      manipulative attempts by vertebral level, regardless of having achieved joint cavitation. The&#xD;
      manipulation is performed following the criteria of thrust manipulations. A maximum of 3&#xD;
      manipulations are applied in total per subject, one for each level (high level C1-C2, medium&#xD;
      level C3-C6, and low level C7), if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo intervention This group will receive 15 minutes of sham techniques in a supine&#xD;
      position over the stretcher. First, a series of short-time and no pressure contact with&#xD;
      physiotherapist´s hands is performed in several points of head and shoulders for 10 minutes.&#xD;
      Subsequently, light touch is applied on standardized anatomic areas, equal to those treated&#xD;
      with manipulative intervention, for 2 minutes each time, adding a total duration of&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes, similar to the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Standard statistical methods will be use to obtain the mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      of the mean (SD). For the inferential analysis of the data, a mixed two-factor multivariate&#xD;
      analysis of variance (MANOVA) with a between-subject factor 'group' (i.e. CG and EG) ant a&#xD;
      within-subject factor 'time' with two groups (pre and post-intervention). Multiple comparison&#xD;
      techniques are performed using Bonferroni correction. The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      assumption of homoscedasticity and it will be assumed in each variable. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will compare the perceived changes after treatment between the two groups with&#xD;
      an independent Student T test. Type I error will be set as &lt;5% (p &lt;.05).&#xD;
