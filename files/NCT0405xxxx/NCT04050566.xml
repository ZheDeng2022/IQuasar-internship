  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a major health threat worldwide with an estimated 229 million cases and 409,000&#xD;
      deaths in 2019 (WHO, World Malaria Report 2019). Vulnerable are young children and pregnant&#xD;
      women. The study aims to investigate immunity development against malaria with regard to&#xD;
      parasite, human, and socioeconomic factors and possible correlations with pathology or&#xD;
      protection in a prospective birth cohort.&#xD;

      Malaria during pregnancy poses substantial risks for the mother and her foetus. Due to the&#xD;
      risk of malaria during early childhood, the study addresses the high malaria morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in young children. Though recognised as a public health issue, it has still not&#xD;
      been well understood how clinical immunity against malaria parasites develops, which parasite&#xD;
      and host factors play a role in infection susceptibility, and why some infections proceed to&#xD;
      develop severe complications while others resolve after a mild disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify interactions between parasite and host, a longitudinal study is&#xD;
      performed starting with the recruitment of pregnant women. The study is conducted in Agogo in&#xD;
      Ghana, an area with high malaria endemicity. The study design allows to analyse the neonatal&#xD;
      immune status at birth, after potential in-utero exposure, and follows the development of&#xD;
      immunity over the first 36 months of life. The current paradigm is that time points and&#xD;
      frequency of infection as well as the type of variant surface antigen expressed have an&#xD;
      impact on the cellular and humoral immune response to malaria, the development of clinical&#xD;
      immunity, as well as the risk for future complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting point of the study is the antenatal care visit of mothers at Agogo Presbyterian&#xD;
      Hospital (APH) during pregnancy. During recruitment, the mother will be asked to read and&#xD;
      sign an informed consent form approved by the local ethical committee. After consent has been&#xD;
      obtained from the mother, biological samples are taken, and a case report form is filled. An&#xD;
      identification card with a unique code number is handed out. The first follow-up visit occurs&#xD;
      at the birth of the child. At this time point, samples are taken from the mothers and the&#xD;
      child. Mothers/primary caregivers are invited to observe the EPI visits offered at their&#xD;
      nearest health post for further follow-ups. In the first year after birth, the EPI schedule&#xD;
      includes visits at six weeks, ten weeks, 14 weeks, six months, and nine months. During these&#xD;
      visits, questionnaires are completed and stool samples are taken. In the first six weeks&#xD;
      after birth, the household is visited to complete a household questionnaire including housing&#xD;
      characteristics and household assets. Additionally, a women's questionnaire is administered,&#xD;
      which collects demographic and socioeconomic background characteristics as well as health and&#xD;
      related behavioural data. At 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after birth, mothers/primary&#xD;
      caregivers are encouraged to bring their children to the study hospital (APH) for a medical&#xD;
      check-up. For the period of 36 months after birth, mothers/primary caregivers are strongly&#xD;
      encouraged to visit the study hospital (APH) every time the child experiences a febrile&#xD;
      illness or a history of fever in the last week during the observation period.&#xD;
