  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial, the investigators intend to measure the health impact of&#xD;
      TRE in patients with metabolic syndrome (with three or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
      increased waist circumference, abnormal cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, or&#xD;
      elevated blood sugar), who habitually eat for more than 14 hours every day. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a control group of behavioral nutrition counseling (standard of care) or&#xD;
      the intervention group of behavioral nutrition counseling with the addition of adopting a 10&#xD;
      hour eating window for 12 weeks (TRE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circadian rhythms optimize nutrient homeostasis by orchestrating catabolic and anabolic&#xD;
      metabolism to appropriate times of the 24 hour day. Chronic circadian rhythm disruption&#xD;
      predisposes individuals to metabolic diseases including obesity and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Conversely, maintaining a daily rhythm of feeding and fasting cycles sustains a robust&#xD;
      circadian rhythm which improves cellular bioenergetics and results in improved metabolism.&#xD;
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a specific feeding-fasting pattern in which feeding is&#xD;
      restricted to 8-12 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning and end of the study (which will be three months in duration), the following&#xD;
      parameters will be measured: height, weight, body mass index, percent body fat, waist/hip&#xD;
      circumference and blood pressure. Blood sugar levels will be monitored continuously for 2&#xD;
      weeks at a time at the beginning and end of the study using a continuous glucose monitor.&#xD;
      Additionally, a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be used to collect&#xD;
      information about body composition. Information will be collected about the mitochondria with&#xD;
      a muscle biopsy. Participants will use a smartphone application (called myCircadianClock&#xD;
      (mCC), developed by the Salk Institute) to keep track of food/beverage intake and will wear a&#xD;
      wrist-worn actigraphy device to monitor physical activity levels and sleep.&#xD;
