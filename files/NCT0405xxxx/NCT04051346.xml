  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether oxalate stimulates urinary crystals and impacts the immune&#xD;
      system in healthy subjects using two controlled diets (low and high oxalate).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxalate is a small molecule found in plants and plant-derived food. It has been shown that&#xD;
      meals containing high amounts of oxalate can increase urinary oxalate excretion, which is a&#xD;
      risk factor for calcium oxalate kidney stones (CaOx KS). Small increases in oxalate can&#xD;
      stimulate urinary crystals to form which can elicit an immune response. This study consists&#xD;
      of having healthy subjects consume both low and oxalate enriched diets to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of oxalate on urinary crystals and immune responses. Participants will receive a low or high&#xD;
      oxalate diet for 4 days prior to having a wash out period for 6 days. Participants will then&#xD;
      crossover to the opposite oxalate diet for four more days.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will consume a low oxalate diet for four days, with blood and 24-hour urine collections occurring at baseline and post diet. A ten day wash out period will follow, during which the subject will consume a self-selected diet. Subjects will then consume the high oxalate diet for the final four days, with blood and 24-hour urine collections once again occurring at baseline and post diet.</description>
