  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single ventricular (SV) heart was a uniformly fatal condition before the advances in surgical&#xD;
      treatment in 1980. In the present era, 5-year survival rate with SV is 75%, with some&#xD;
      centers, including the Stollery Children's Hospital reporting higher survival. Although&#xD;
      mortality remains a major concern, the research focus has shifted to management of late&#xD;
      complications as well as improving patient physical and mental health related quality of life&#xD;
      issues. Children with SV have reduced exercise tolerance and this is progressive through&#xD;
      adulthood. Recent advances in remote health assessment and telehealth systems have allowed&#xD;
      the development of medically supervised home graduated physical training for adult cardiac&#xD;
      patient rehabilitation. To our knowledge, the application of these technologies has not been&#xD;
      applied to SV patients. The long term goal is to use this technology to improve patient&#xD;
      exercise capacity and to positively influence parental and patient perceptions of the&#xD;
      patient's physical ability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children with single ventricular (SV) heart were a uniformly fatal condition prior to&#xD;
      descriptions of surgical palliation in 1980 that results in a Fontan circulation with single&#xD;
      ventricle physiology. In the present era, 5-year survival is 75% in multicenter studies, with&#xD;
      some centers including the Stollery Children's Hospital reporting higher survival. Although&#xD;
      mortality remains a challenge for this population, the research focus has shifted towards&#xD;
      optimizing management of late complications as well as improving patient physical and mental&#xD;
      health-related quality of life issues. Children with SV have decreased exercise tolerance and&#xD;
      the reduction is progressive through adolescence and into adulthood. Physical factors&#xD;
      contributing to decreased exercise tolerance in the Fontan patient include cardiovascular&#xD;
      inefficiencies and the loss of peripheral lean muscle mass and efficiency from&#xD;
      deconditioning. Recently, Cordina et al. has shown that an intensive exercise regiment can&#xD;
      improve muscle strength and mass, cardiac output and exercise capacity in adults with Fontan&#xD;
      circulation. The majority of published outcomes from exercise training in patients with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease (CHD) have resulted in increased measured exercise capacity with no&#xD;
      apparent negative effect. Although the link between improved exercise capacity and improved&#xD;
      patient quality of life remains controversial, participation in an aerobic exercise regimen&#xD;
      leads to improved health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from physical limitations to their exercise capacity, Fontan patient self-confidence&#xD;
      toward physical activity is low, as is exercise participation. Studies indicate that amongst&#xD;
      youth with CHD, low self-confidence may be a more important predictor of participation than&#xD;
      the severity of the disease. Parental overprotection is a common finding in children with CHD&#xD;
      with a lasting impact on patient self-confidence and anxieties toward physical activity well&#xD;
      into adulthood. Alteration of patient and parental perception and anxieties toward&#xD;
      participation in physical activity may improve compliance to exercise training and encourage&#xD;
      more positive patient perceptions toward healthy lifestyle habits, including frequent&#xD;
      physical activity participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent technological advances in remote health assessment capabilities and telehealth systems&#xD;
      have allowed the development of medically supervised home graduated physical training for&#xD;
      adult cardiac patient rehabilitation. The application of such technologies to pediatric&#xD;
      congenital heart patients has not been tested. In collaboration with Prof. Boulanger at the&#xD;
      Advanced Man Machine Interface Laboratory at the University of Alberta, a custom pediatric&#xD;
      remote bike ergometer (MedBike) was developed. This technology provides the medical&#xD;
      supervisor with a live-feed of patient video/audio, electrocardiograph (ECG), blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) and blood oximetry signals while enabling remote determination of patient work load&#xD;
      through the bike ergometer. The long-term goal is to use this technology to improve patient&#xD;
      exercise capacity and to positively influence patient and parental perceptions of the&#xD;
      patient's physical ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 (HIIT exercise program): The investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      an 8-week, 3 times per week supervised HIIT exercise program in patients with SV physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients will undergo a full cardio pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and&#xD;
      anthropometry assessment of lean muscle mass prior to exercise training and at the end of the&#xD;
      training period. Understanding that a patient's CPET results may change over time, subjects&#xD;
      who participated in Stage 1 of the study will be invited back to undergo a new baseline CPET&#xD;
      to ensure the reliability of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A MedBike will be installed in the participant's home. Members of the MedBike team at the&#xD;
      University of Alberta will be responsible for installation, set-up, and training with regards&#xD;
      to participant use of the MedBike. Installation, set-up, and training will occur at a time&#xD;
      that is convenient for the participant and their caregivers. The patients will exercise in&#xD;
      the convenience of their home with tele-health link that includes a live video and audio feed&#xD;
      to the supervisor workstation at the University of Alberta. The HIIT program described above&#xD;
      will be applied. The supervisor will have the ability to modify the program intensity during&#xD;
      each session based on the perceived difficulty or ease of it and the results of the baseline&#xD;
      CPET. The exercise sessions in their home will be also be supervised in-person by the&#xD;
      patient's caregiver. Given that no adverse events or safety concerns arose in Stage 1B of the&#xD;
      study, the patient will be supervised remotely by a member of the MedBike team capable of&#xD;
      reading ECG data. The investigators will document any adverse effects from the 240 training&#xD;
      sessions during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise sessions will be based on standardized guidelines for aerobic exercise (ACSM's&#xD;
      guidelines for exercise testing and prescription 2013). Heart rate, ECG, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and rating of perceived exertion will be monitored during each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events such as profound desaturation (oxygen saturations fall of &gt; 10% points for&#xD;
      greater than 1 min, chest pain and ECG changes consistent with ischemia (ST depression or&#xD;
      elevation in 2 consecutive leads), development of tachyarrhythmia (atrial or ventricular) and&#xD;
      any bike injury, will result in immediate stoppage of exercise regimen and evaluation by the&#xD;
      remote supervisor with access to medical personnel..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the exercise program on patient and parental perceptions of the patient's&#xD;
      physical capacity will be evaluated using qualitative methods, as well as health related&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires. Patient and parents will be interviewed prior to, and at the&#xD;
      end of, the exercise training as to their perceptions of the influence of physical activity&#xD;
      in the presence of complex CHD.&#xD;
