    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of ONC201 and paclitaxel and how well they work&#xD;
      in treating patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent), or that does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). ONC201 is the first in its class of drugs that antagonize some specific cell&#xD;
      receptors on cancer cells, leading to their destruction. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ONC201 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer compared to paclitaxel alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of Akt/ERK inhibitor ONC 201&#xD;
      (ONC201) and paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or resistant epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. (Part 1) II. To evaluate the objective response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or&#xD;
      resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. (Part 2) III. To&#xD;
      evaluate progression free survival (PFS) of ONC201 in combination with weekly paclitaxel in&#xD;
      patients with platinum refractory or resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cancer. (Part 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the durability/duration of response (DOR) of ONC201 in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and patient reported tolerability of ONC201 in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel. (Part 2) III. To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of ONC201 in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and/or human epididymis factor 4 (HE-4)&#xD;
      response of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel in those patients with one or both of these&#xD;
      tumor markers upregulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ONC201 in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To obtain preliminary estimates of overall survival (OS) of ONC201 in combination with&#xD;
      weekly paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the immune response (specifically natural killer [NK] cell and cytokine&#xD;
      profile) of ONC201 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with platinum refractory or&#xD;
      resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ONC201 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15, and paclitaxel intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. If paclitaxel must be stopped for any reason, patients&#xD;
      may continue on ONC201 alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.&#xD;
