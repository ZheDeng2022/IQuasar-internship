      Introduction. The phenomena of biological adaptation and overtraining are closely related&#xD;
      terms, that is why in sport it is possible to identify two types of overtraining. The first&#xD;
      of these is known as short-term overtraining, which is required as a state of peripheral&#xD;
      fatigue induced by repeated sessions of physical activity in short periods of time that are&#xD;
      related to mechanisms of metabolic type (e.g. low levels of glycogen), is considered&#xD;
      desirable and normal, by allowing mechanisms of adaptation to be activated depending on the&#xD;
      nature and administration of the loads, which allow reaching higher yield quotas. The second,&#xD;
      long-term overtraining, is characterized by a series of signs and symptoms of exhaustion and&#xD;
      persistent fatigue that take place at the level of the central nervous system and that are&#xD;
      produced by the imbalance between demanding physical work and recovery periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This type of condition is also known as, general syndrome of overtraining (GSO), unexplained&#xD;
      low performance syndrome, staleness or burnout, which is propitiated by the need to achieve&#xD;
      maximum physical performance and the performance of physical activities in a uncontrolled&#xD;
      that cause an interruption to the processes of biological recovery that attenuate the&#xD;
      obtaining of the physical form wished, reason why the sportsman experiences a decrease of the&#xD;
      physical and mental performance, manifested in a clinical picture that reflects muscular&#xD;
      inflammation, headache, elevation sudden blood pressure, loss of functional capacity,&#xD;
      alterations of the central nervous system (CNS), metabolic, endocrine and immune systems. The&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor derived from the brain (BDNF) influences different types of neurons in&#xD;
      the CNS, promoting their differentiation, growth, survival, and neuroprotection by activating&#xD;
      the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDNF decreases when performing specific physical exercises with intensities under the&#xD;
      interval (mixed) and high-intensity method; as those who are employed in competitive cycles.&#xD;
      For its part, stretching is commonly used as a method of physical rehabilitation in patients&#xD;
      with musculoskeletal injuries of various origins. Its effect reflects the restoration of&#xD;
      motor control by interacting with the intervention and order centers that are located in&#xD;
      different parts of the CNS that are associated with the modulation of the discharge of the&#xD;
      motor neurons involved in the activation of the muscle spindle, which allow the reflex for&#xD;
      the execution of the movement and the control of postures. The information regarding the&#xD;
      relationship with the GSO, the stretching and the expression of BDNF in the regenerative&#xD;
      capacity in those over-trained subjects and their compensatory mechanisms during the&#xD;
      different cycles of physical exercise, is null, making necessary the investigation of the&#xD;
      effects that can produce in the decrease of factors that indicate GSO and, consequently,&#xD;
      build support systems for the athlete with the purpose of returning it to a level of adequate&#xD;
      physical performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem Statement. The training cycles are configured with the purpose of achieving a greater&#xD;
      adaptation to the physical activity that is performed. However, those closest to the&#xD;
      competition have more intensity and physical demands. However, the achievement of maximum&#xD;
      performance and the GSO are phenomena deeply related to the adaptability of the organism. The&#xD;
      strategies commonly used to recover an athlete with GSO, are directed to the care of diet and&#xD;
      rest, however, do not make clear by what methods and means it is possible to perform a&#xD;
      restoration of regenerative processes and muscle contraction to decrease of chronic fatigue&#xD;
      and in turn the maintenance of physical performance achieved in previous cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question. What are the effects of a stretching training program on BDNF expression&#xD;
      and its relationship with biochemical and physiological markers that indicate GSO?&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective. To analyze the effects of a stretching training program on the expression&#xD;
      of BDNF and decrease of biochemical and physiological markers that indicate GSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. A clinical trial, with simple blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of sampling. Probabilistic, simple random (tombola).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size. 72 subjects, 36 subjects per group, which was estimated through the equation for&#xD;
      comparison of means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria. To be a university student, males from 18 to 25 years of age, to lead a&#xD;
      moderately active or sedentary lifestyle, to sign an informed consent form, to take the&#xD;
      physical fitness level test and to have been diagnosed as healthy in the clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention to adverse effects. These will be classified into three types, milder, will be&#xD;
      those muscular discomforts present but tolerable, e.g. delayed muscle pain (stiffness),&#xD;
      edema, localized fatigue, loss of mobility, loss of strength. Moderate, physical damage that&#xD;
      interferes with physical activities, such as, first or second-degree sprain and first-degree&#xD;
      muscle tear. Severe, those injuries and/or physical damage that incapacitates the subject to&#xD;
      perform physical activities of any kind, such as ruptures, severe muscular, ligamentous and&#xD;
      cartilaginous of the third degree, dislocations and fractures. If one of the two previous&#xD;
      cases are presented, the subjects will be assisted by the sports doctor who is part of the&#xD;
      research protocol and channeled to the corresponding family medical clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments. Questionnaire PAR Q &amp; YOU used to know the state of health and habits of&#xD;
      physical activity. The biochemical tests will be carried out with a blood sample of 5 ml&#xD;
      using a BD Vacutainer yellow tube model 368159 with gel separator and coagulation activator,&#xD;
      which will estimate the concentrations of creatine phosphokinase, testosterone, cortisol, and&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which will be quantified with the ELISA method. The&#xD;
      physiological determinants will be measured with the general stretching index test (GSI),&#xD;
      which is calculated by the sum of the stretching in sitting, standing and lying down&#xD;
      multiplied by the body surface. The level of physical fitness will be assessed with the&#xD;
      Tecumseh step test and the VO2max with the Astrand-Rhyming test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical training program. The study subjects will perform a physical exercise for 12 weeks&#xD;
      divided into three blocks of 4 periods, organized in 3 weeks of training, plus 1 rest, which&#xD;
      simulate physical loads similar to the periods of competition used in high-performance&#xD;
      sports. The evaluations will be made prior to the training (basal measurement) and at the end&#xD;
      of each of the blocks during the rest period. The physical load will be organized as follows:&#xD;
      The control group (CG) will perform muscle strength exercises with intensities of 45 to 90%&#xD;
      of 1RM, as well as aerobic resistance with efforts of 60 to 90% of the theoretical maximum&#xD;
      heart rate, which will be controlled with a Polar brand heart rate monitor model FT7. Like&#xD;
      the CG, the experimental group (EG) will perform the same physical load of muscular strength&#xD;
      and aerobic resistance in combination with specific stretching exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Kolmogorov Smirnov test to check the normality of the data, in case of&#xD;
      presenting a normal distribution (p &lt;0.05) the repeated measures ANOVA test will be applied,&#xD;
      otherwise the Kruskal Wallis test will be applied. The correlation level will be established&#xD;
      with the Pearson or RhO Spearman test. Factorial analysis of the relationship between&#xD;
      variables and individuals will be applied through Hj-biplot. The analysis of variables will&#xD;
      be carried out with the SPSS v 20.0 program, establishing a level of p &lt;0.05 as the level of&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations. The protocol was approved by the Research and Ethics in Research&#xD;
      Committee of the State Institute of Cancerology, with registration number&#xD;
      CICC-090218-BDNFMRS-05. Financing. $ 94,764.76. At the moment there are two ELISA kits for&#xD;
      BDNF analysis and $ 44,286.76 are being managed with the Movimiento es Salud Foundation for&#xD;
      the purchase and/or maquila of the testosterone, cortisol and CPK samples.&#xD;
