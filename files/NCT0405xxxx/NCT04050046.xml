  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study explores the feasibility of pairing computer-based cognitive training&#xD;
      (CBCT) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation, in order to enhance and preserve mental skills in older adults. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to enhance participants ability to perform tasks of memory, attention,&#xD;
      processing speed and other areas of cognition. Additionally, researchers are interested in&#xD;
      the ability of the brain to adapt to change-neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is thought to&#xD;
      impact how individuals respond to cognitive training and tDCS. In order to look at individual&#xD;
      differences in neuroplasticity transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation technique, will be used. Individual responses to TMS can be used as a marker of&#xD;
      neuroplastic changes in brain function, in order to reveal the relationship between brain&#xD;
      plasticity and tDCS-induced changes in cognitive ability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Promising evidence suggests that cognitive training regimens may have some beneficial effects&#xD;
      on cognition in older adults. However, the improvement from computer-based cognitive training&#xD;
      (CBCT) diminish over time which highlights a fundamental challenge for CBCT interventions.&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance certain cognitive skills,&#xD;
      particularly when stimulation is combined with rehearsal of relevant behaviors. Importantly,&#xD;
      these benefits have been shown to persist up to 2 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will lay the groundwork for larger scale studies that will combine CBCT with&#xD;
      neuromodulation, potentially leading to the development of a persistent, transferrable,&#xD;
      multimodal technique to preserve cognition in older adults. In this study, participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either real or sham tDCS for 5 consecutive days in&#xD;
      conjunction with CBCT. The participant's cognition will be assessed with a neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessment at baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 2 months in order to determine any changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to characterize the&#xD;
      relationship between baseline differences in brain plasticity and cognitive changes induced&#xD;
      by tDCS+CBCT. The effects of TMS on cortical activity have been shown to depend on a variety&#xD;
      of neuroplasticity-related mechanisms. In this study, changes in motor physiology (called&#xD;
      motor evoked potentials (MEPs)) induced by TMS will be used. Stimulation of the motor cortex&#xD;
      with TMS induces robust, transient, and readily quantifiable changes in motor excitability,&#xD;
      which are sensitive to changes in the mechanisms of neuroplasticity. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that individual variability in brain plasticity, measured by changes in MEP&#xD;
      response to TMS, will predict the degree of cognitive benefit afforded by tDCS+CBCT.&#xD;

    <description>tDCS is a neuromodulatory technique that delivers a small electric current (about the equivalent of a 9V battery) to the head. A fixed current between 1 and 2 mA is typically applied. tDCS works by applying a positive (anodal) or negative (cathodal) current via electrodes to an area, facilitating the depolarization or hyperpolarization of neurons, respectively.</description>
