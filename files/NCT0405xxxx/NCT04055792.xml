  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of lung cancer. More than 70% of SCLC&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed with advanced stage initially. SCLC is highly chemo-sensitive, the&#xD;
      first-line treatment is platinum-containing double-drug chemotherapy. Although the objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) of first-line chemotherapy is as high as 60-80%, the duration of response&#xD;
      is very short, and there is little effective follow-up treatment. The outcome of SCLC&#xD;
      patients is poor with an overall survival (OS) of about 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In August 2018, the FDA approved Nivolumab as a third-line treatment for advanced SCLC&#xD;
      patients, which is the only immunotherapeutic drug approved for SCLC till now. Sintilimab is&#xD;
      another PD-1 inhibitor produced by China and has been approved by cFDA for lymphoma.&#xD;
      Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with effect of anti-tumor&#xD;
      angiogenesis and tumor growth inhibition. The results of ALTER1202 show that compared with&#xD;
      placebo, Anlotinib single-agent as three-line treatment in advanced SCLC was effective, the&#xD;
      median progression free survival (PFS) were 4.1 versus 0.7 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy has been proven effective and tolerable&#xD;
      in non-small cell lung caner (NSCLC), while its efficacy and safety in SCLC has not been&#xD;
      reported. Therefore, the investigators conduct this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of Sintilimab combined with Anlotinib versus Anlotinib alone in third line or beyond among&#xD;
      advanced SCLC patients.&#xD;
