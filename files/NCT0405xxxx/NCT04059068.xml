  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in one third of the population and due&#xD;
      to its potential to cause irreversible liver damage and liver cancer, it is a significant&#xD;
      health burden. There is a strong link between obesity and NALFD. As fat accumulates, the body&#xD;
      is unable to process it, leading to unhealthy fat metabolism. Currently, other than lifestyle&#xD;
      measures and better control of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with medication, there is no&#xD;
      drug that can prevent or reverse the liver damage. Furthermore, there is no easy way to&#xD;
      identify which person will go on to develop the liver damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mounting evidence suggests that inflammation in the fat has a key role in driving liver&#xD;
      damage, particularly by the immune cell called the macrophage. However, detailed mechanisms&#xD;
      are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to study obese patients with NAFLD to&#xD;
      better understand the link between unhealthy fat metabolism and liver damage, focusing on&#xD;
      identifying macrophage-derived drug targets which can potentially reverse the liver disease.&#xD;
      Samples of fat and liver from patients who are having bariatric surgery at Imperial College&#xD;
      Healthcare NHS Trust will be analysed to identify and target the inflammatory markers of&#xD;
      unhealthy fat and NAFLD using genetic profiling techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NAFLD is a huge health burden and can lead to liver damage,scarring and cancer, therefore&#xD;
      gaining a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in causing liver damage is&#xD;
      particularly important to identify drug targets that could reverse this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White adipose tissue (WAT) or fat fails to respond normally in obesity which leads to fat&#xD;
      deposition in other organs, particularly the liver, and the fat tissue becomes inflamed. The&#xD;
      inflammation in the fat is lead by specific immune cells called macrophages. This&#xD;
      inflammatory state in the fat tissue is thought to be a precursor to liver inflammation and&#xD;
      liver damage. This has been demonstrated in mouse models where the fat inflammatory cells&#xD;
      contributed to liver inflammation and worsened liver damage, emphasising the importance of&#xD;
      the relationship between fat tissue and the liver in NAFLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver damage or liver fibrosis is also the result of activation of these inflammatory cells,&#xD;
      the macrophages, in the liver which drive scarring through cells called fibroblasts that lay&#xD;
      down collagen. Therefore, understanding the interaction between the cells involved in&#xD;
      inflammation (macrophages) and scarring (fibroblasts) in both the fat and the liver is key to&#xD;
      identifying potential drug targets for reversal of this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our lab demonstrated, using an obese animal model, that the release of pro-fibrotic compounds&#xD;
      called prostagladins from the fat macrophages is linked to NAFLD and liver inflammation.&#xD;
      Based on these results the investigators aim to deepen the understanding of the link between&#xD;
      fat and liver inflammation and damage specifically looking at cell interactions (the&#xD;
      macrophage and fibroblast) by using genetic tests on liver and fat samples in obese patients.&#xD;
