  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pars plana vitrectomy is minimally invasive endoscopic procedure which is usually performed&#xD;
      in moderate analgo-sedation given by anesthesiologist combined with topical anesthesia and&#xD;
      retrobulbar or Subtenon block performed by surgeon. Intravenously applied anesthetics can&#xD;
      often lead to slower breathing rate or cessation of breathing which introduces risk of low&#xD;
      blood oxygen level despite careful adjustment of anesthetics' dose and application of&#xD;
      standard low-flow nasal oxygenation (LFNO). Respiratory instability is often accompanied by&#xD;
      circulatory instability manifested by disturbances of heart rate and blood pressure. LFNO&#xD;
      provides maximally 40% inspired fraction of oxygen and can cause discomfort of a patient due&#xD;
      to coldness and dryness of inspired gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) can bring up to 100% of inspired oxygen&#xD;
      fraction to patient, providing noninvasive pressure support of 3-7 cmH2O in patients' upper&#xD;
      airway which ensures better oxygenation especially in higher anesthesia risk patients.&#xD;
      Because of carrying warmed and humidified air/oxygen mixture via soft nasal cannula, HFNO is&#xD;
      better tolerated by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial investigators will compare effect of HFNO to LFNO during intravenously applied&#xD;
      standardized analgo-sedation given for vitrectomy in normal weight patients of low and high&#xD;
      anesthesia risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that normal weight patients of low and high anesthesia risk, whose&#xD;
      breathing pattern is preserved, receiving HFNO vs. LFNO during standardized analgo-sedation&#xD;
      for vitrectomy will be more respiratory and circulatory stable, preserving normal blood O2&#xD;
      and CO2 level, breathing pattern, heart rate and blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is minimally invasive micro-endoscopic surgery of posterior eye&#xD;
      chamber. Most often patients receive combination of loco-regional anesthesia (topical&#xD;
      anesthetic plus retrobulbar or Subtenon block), performed by a surgeon, and moderate&#xD;
      analgo-sedation, performed by an anesthesiologist. Although applied intravenous anesthetics&#xD;
      are short-acting, carefully titrated and continuously infused, anesthesia can lead to&#xD;
      cessation of adequate spontaneous patients' breathing detected as bradypnoea, hypoxia and&#xD;
      hypercapnia reflecting respiratory instability of patient. Respiratory instability is&#xD;
      accompanied by circulatory one, reflected in heart rate and blood pressure deflections from&#xD;
      baseline values. Usually, before, during and after analgo-sedation until patient is awaken,&#xD;
      low-flow nasal oxygenation (LFNO) of 2-6 L/min O2 is applied through nasal catheter providing&#xD;
      maximum inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Beside coldness and dryness of LFNO&#xD;
      (therefore causing discomfort to patient), LFNO is often inadequate to prevent respiratory&#xD;
      instability manifested as hypoxia and hypercapnia and subsequent circulatory disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia risk is classified by American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status&#xD;
      Classification System (ASA classification system) where patients of ASA class I anesthesia&#xD;
      risk are generally healthy without systemic disease, patients deployed to ASA class II group&#xD;
      have mild disease, having no functional impairment, higher risk ASA III patients have one or&#xD;
      more significant organ function impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) delivers to patient high flow heated and humidified&#xD;
      oxygen/air mixture (up to 70 L/min, up to 100% FiO2) using soft nasal cannula. HFNO produces&#xD;
      3-7 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure therefore supporting patients breathing effort&#xD;
      and providing apnoeic oxygenation, decreasing pharyngeal airway dead space and resistance.&#xD;
      The patients find HFNO more comfortable as delivered gas is heated and humidified. HFNO is&#xD;
      usually used for oxygenation of patients with predicted difficult oroendotrachial intubation&#xD;
      prior to anesthesia, in process of awakening from anesthesia in postanesthesia care units and&#xD;
      during process of weaning from mechanical respiratory support in intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of this trial is to compare effect of HFNO and LFNO on oxygenation maintenance during&#xD;
      standardized procedure of intravenous analgo-sedation in normal weight ASA I, II and III risk&#xD;
      class patients for elective PPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that application of HFNO compared to LFNO in patients with&#xD;
      preserved spontaneous breathing during procedural analgo-sedation for PPV contributes to&#xD;
      maintaining adequate oxygenation, consequently adding to greater patients periprocedural&#xD;
      respiratory and circulatory stability. Investigators expect that HFNO will provide reduced&#xD;
      bradypnoea intervals (bradypnoea &lt;12 breaths/min, FoB 1/min), longer maintenance of adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation, shorter intervals of desaturation (peripheral blood oxygen saturation -&#xD;
      SpO2≤92%), reducing hypercapnia (expiratory carbon-dioxide - expCO2≥45 mmHg) and less airway&#xD;
      opening maneuvers performed by attending anesthesiologist (AOM). These will prevent partial&#xD;
      respiratory insufficiency detected by low SpO2 accompanied by low or normal expiratory&#xD;
      carbon-dioxide level (expCO2), and global respiratory insufficiency detected by decreased&#xD;
      SpO2≤92% and increased expCO2≥45 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to conduct prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Trial will be managed according to principles of Declaration of Helsinki for&#xD;
      scientific clinical research and will be planned and guided according to CONSORT guidelines&#xD;
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). The trial has been approved by Hospital's Ethic&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source of information are going to be 126 adult patients scheduled for PPV under&#xD;
      analgo-sedation. Eligible participants will be interviewed and examined ambulatory by&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, their ASA status, difficulty of airway management and body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      evaluated. After initial examination inclusive and exclusive criteria will be distinguished.&#xD;
      Eligible participants who give voluntarily their written consent of participation will be&#xD;
      included in this study. After that, participants will be assigned to equal ASA I, II and III&#xD;
      risk class group. Each group will be randomized to intervention (HFNO) and control (LFNO)&#xD;
      subgroup by computer random numbers generator. Randomization will be used until adequate&#xD;
      number of participants in every subgroup is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: intervention subgroups participants will be oxygenated via nasal cannula using&#xD;
      high flow (40 L/min) of humidified and heated oxygen in air mixture (FiO2 40%). HFNO will be&#xD;
      applied by oxygenator (AirVO™2, Fisher and Paykell, New Zealand, Technomedika, Croatia&#xD;
      d.o.o.) during procedural analgo-sedation for PPV maintaining spontaneous breathing. In&#xD;
      control subgroups, LFNO will be applied via nasal catheter (Bauerfeind d.o.o. Zagreb,&#xD;
      Croatia) using standard low-flow oxygen (5 L/min, FiO2 40%). In both groups concentration of&#xD;
      oxygen delivered depends on oxygen flow which is regulated by standard flow-regulator&#xD;
      (flowmeter). Oxygen is delivered through pipelines from central hospital gas supply or from&#xD;
      portable cylinder gas supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia procedure will be uniformed for all participants. Integrated noninvasive&#xD;
      monitoring of circulatory function (heart rate - EKG, intermittent mean arterial pressure -&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer) will be set (Compact 7; Medical Econet GmbH, Germany). Respiratory vital&#xD;
      functions: oxygenation (pulse oximeter), heart rate and expCO2 by using capnometer&#xD;
      (Capnostream™35 Portable Respiratory Monitor, Medtronic, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will have established intravenous infusion of 250 ml NaCl 0.9% via&#xD;
      intravenous cannula regulated by continuous flow (Extension set/CONTROL-A-FLO Regulator 19&#xD;
      &quot;Male Luer Lock Adapter&quot;, Baxter/Agmar d.o.o. United States of America/ Croatia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygenation (HFNO or LFNO) will be continuously administered before institution of&#xD;
      analgo-sedation until patients' awakening. It will be started 3 minutes before&#xD;
      analgo-sedation (preoxygenation), continued during analgo-sedation and procedure of PPV&#xD;
      (perioperative oxygenation) and up to 5 minutes after PPV and until patient is awake&#xD;
      (postprocedural oxygenation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of analgo-sedation will be instituted by droperidol 1.25 -2.5 mg bolus accompanied&#xD;
      by continuous infusion of target remifentanyl concentration up to 0.05 mcg/kg/min. Intensity&#xD;
      of sedation will be measured by Ramsay's sedation scale (RSS). Moderate sedation (RSS 4) is&#xD;
      characterized by: purposeful response to verbal or tactile stimulation, no intervention&#xD;
      required for airway patency maintenance, adequate spontaneous ventilation and sufficient&#xD;
      cardiovascular function. Surgeon will apply topical local anesthetic on conjunctiva which is&#xD;
      followed by regional anesthesia (Subtenon or retrobulbar block). Intravenous analgo-sedation&#xD;
      will be administered via perfusor (B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Analgo-sedation will be&#xD;
      discontinued immediately after end of PPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of nasopharyngeal airway is achieved by using oropharyngeal airway, if necessary.&#xD;
      Oropharyngeal airway (Airway; Vigon-Medicpro d.o.o.) will be inserted after achieving&#xD;
      moderate analgo-sedation and only if base of tongue is closing airway by dropping on&#xD;
      posterior pharyngeal wall. Every manipulation of patients airway by anesthesiologist will be&#xD;
      documented (insertion of airway, jaw thrust maneuver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpO2, expCO2, heart rate (fC) and respiratory rate (fD) will be measured continuously, and&#xD;
      simultaneously continuously noted in 5 minutes intervals - T0=before oxygenation, T1=15&#xD;
      minutes after instituting LFNO or HFNO after beginning of analgo-sedation, T2=when patient is&#xD;
      awake after oxygenation ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive measurement SpO2 will be performed by indirect method using a pulse oximeter on&#xD;
      the index finger of the left hand (Compact 7, Medical ECONET GmbH, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measuring and mean arterial pressure calculation will be repeated&#xD;
      intermittently in 5 minutes intervals prior to-, during analgo-sedation and after patient is&#xD;
      awaken. All measured parameters will be noted in identical intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected uniformly by three researchers: an anesthesiologist who interviews&#xD;
      and examines patients ambulatory, an anesthesiologist designated for procedural&#xD;
      analgo-sedation and an anesthesiologist who will collect the data after the completion of the&#xD;
      analgo-sedation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator in charge of the data collection will collect it from the pre-operative&#xD;
      ambulatory list and the anesthesiologist list. The anesthesiology sheet will include all data&#xD;
      from the trend table of the monitored vital parameters and from the simultaneously noted&#xD;
      respiratory rate (fD) per minute and the expCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected through non-invasive measurements: peripheral blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), heart rate (fC), respiratory rate (fD), blood pressure (mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure - MAP), carbon dioxide exhaled values before, in the stabilization and at the end of&#xD;
      the analgo-sedation, i.e. 5 minutes after awakening of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fourth researcher will be in charge of entering the collected data into the database. The&#xD;
      statistician will analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic data analyses will be performed by statistician. Sample size is determined by statistic&#xD;
      computing web program: http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize used statistic test&#xD;
      Inference for Proportions:Comparing Two Independent Samples. Assessment of sample size is&#xD;
      computed for two independent samples with assumption of clinically significant difference in&#xD;
      patients' oxygenation: ≤88 and ≥99%. Statistical significance of difference will be inferred&#xD;
      with 5% α-error, 50% β-error and study power 0.80.calculated size of sample is: 21&#xD;
      participant pro subgroup (total of 126 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible biases and confounding variables could be caused by hypothermia of the participant&#xD;
      and by sphygmomanometer pressure on the same arm where peripheral oxygenation level is&#xD;
      measured. These difficulties can be bypassed by: adjustment of room temperature where&#xD;
      analgo-sedation for PPV is performed and blood pressure measuring cuff placed on right arm&#xD;
      (pulse oximeter placed on left index-finger).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any possible event that may occur during analgo-sedation that causes deviation from the study&#xD;
      protocol will be the reason for exclusion of the subjects from the study and the PPV will be&#xD;
      continued under anesthesia according to the rules of good clinical practice.&#xD;
