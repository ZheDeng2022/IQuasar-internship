  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication side effects and interactions between medications are very common in older adults&#xD;
      and are related to negative health outcomes. In this study, the investigators will test a new&#xD;
      process aimed at reducing unnecessary medication use and drug side effects in seniors using&#xD;
      the best medical evidence and patient preferences for treatment. This study will assess how&#xD;
      feasible the implementation of this intervention is within a long-term care facility as well&#xD;
      as if it is possible. Participants in two long-term care facilities will participate in this&#xD;
      study. Measures will include feasibility outcomes regarding the logistics of the intervention&#xD;
      as well as patients outcomes (falls, hospitalizations, and medications) collected before and&#xD;
      after implementation. This trial will be a randomized control trial with an adaptive trial&#xD;
      design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are substantial associations between polypharmacy and reduced function from older&#xD;
      adults and this is likely to be important in frail older adults both in long term care and in&#xD;
      the community. The reversibility of drug-induced mobility impairment is unclear therefore the&#xD;
      investigators plan to investigate signals of any impact of reducing polypharmacy on mobility.&#xD;
      The investigators chose the long-term care setting given the presence of complete medication&#xD;
      administration records and this patient population's high prevalence of polypharmacy and risk&#xD;
      of adverse drug events. TaperMD is an electronic tool for systematic medication reduction&#xD;
      that incorporates patient priorities, electronic screening for potentially harmful&#xD;
      medicines,supporting evidence tools and a monitoring pathway to support medication reduction.&#xD;
      This study will examine the feasibility of this tool in a long-term care setting as well as&#xD;
      examine. Participants in two long-term care facilities will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Measures will include feasibility outcomes regarding the logistics of the intervention as&#xD;
      well as patients outcomes (falls, hospitalizations, and medications) collected before and&#xD;
      after implementation. The study will be an adaptive trial design with two phases. Phase 1&#xD;
      will be an internal pilot. This will allow the investigators to re-evaluate and modify&#xD;
      outcome measures and processes as necessary. Phase 2 of this trial will allow for&#xD;
      continuation after adjustments to the process or design has been made in a larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
