  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dietary carbohydrate supplements&#xD;
      (prebiotics) on cognition, behavior and physiology in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be separated into one pre-study visit + three consecutive weeks: Baseline&#xD;
      (week 1), Intervention (week 2) and Assessment (week 3). For these three weeks, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to take diet surveys and make in-person visits to complete online cognitive&#xD;
      assessments and provide samples of blood and saliva to assess levels of serotonin and&#xD;
      cortisol in addition to other basic metabolites. During the Intervention week, participants&#xD;
      will be given snack bars that they will be asked to eat twice a day, for five days in a row.&#xD;
      There will be two treatment groups that participants will be randomly assigned to, which vary&#xD;
      according to the carbohydrate makeup of snack bars. For the entire three-week study period,&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to collect samples of their stool at home every Tuesday and&#xD;
      Friday. They will also be provided with wearable devices (a watch) to track their daily heart&#xD;
      rate and activity level (including sleep) for the entirety of the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      compensated for their time for each stage of the study, once in-person visits begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greatest risks of this study include the possibility of infection while sampling your own&#xD;
      stool, and momentary discomfort and/or bruising associated with blood draws. Discomfort as a&#xD;
      result of consuming the bars is possible in the form of flatulence, bloating, constipation,&#xD;
      diarrhea, or borborygmi (stomach rumbling). Participants weighing less than 140 pounds may be&#xD;
      more likely to develop diarrhea than those weighing more. Should any such discomfort occur,&#xD;
      it can be alleviated simply by discontinuing consumption of the prebiotic. Infection,&#xD;
      fainting, and excess bleeding/clotting, though highly unlikely, are also possible.&#xD;
      Participants also face risks associated with the loss of confidentiality.&#xD;
