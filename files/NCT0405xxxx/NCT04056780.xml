  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a major clinical challenge. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of PJI is based on a composition of clinical judgment, serologic test from&#xD;
      peripheral blood, synovial fluid cytology and biomarkers, radiography, microbiology,&#xD;
      histopathologic evaluation of periprosthetic tissue, and intraoperative findings. The&#xD;
      importance of PJI diagnosis give the subsequent treatment options, like the removal of&#xD;
      prosthesis, debridement and prosthesis retention and the time of reimplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, The Second International Consensus Meeting (ICM) has announced its criteria for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of PJI. The preoperative diagnosis includes serologic tests (C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, D-dimer, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and synovial fluid biomarkers (white&#xD;
      blood cell and differential, leukocyte esterase and ⍺-defensin). The intraoperative diagnosis&#xD;
      includes a single positive culture, positive histology, and positive intraoperative&#xD;
      purulence. However, some of the markers used in the 2018 ICM criteria, such as ⍺-defensin,&#xD;
      leukocyte esterase, and synovial fluid C-reactive protein, are not available in every&#xD;
      hospital and cannot be immediately available to clinicians in decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microfluidic technologies have made a notable impact on the evolution of diagnostic tools&#xD;
      by providing a rapid and cost-effective platform for the application of immunoassay&#xD;
      techniques. The microfluidic system integrates the complex processing steps of the laboratory&#xD;
      protocols into a single chip through logical integration and optimization of processes. Chang&#xD;
      Gung Memorial Hospital and National Tsing Hua University have conducted preliminary research&#xD;
      to confirm the feasibility of their microfluidic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the project will develop a &quot;microfluidic biomarker detection chip&quot; to detect the&#xD;
      concentrations three important biomarkers for PJI, including ⍺-defensin, leukocyte esterase&#xD;
      and C-reactive protein in synovial fluids. This will be a three-year project. In the 1st&#xD;
      year, 50 patients who will be scheduled to undergo unilateral revision total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty (RTJA) will be collected with the synovial fluid and tested on a laboratory&#xD;
      platform. In the 2nd year, based on laboratory results, 50 patients undergoing RTJAs will be&#xD;
      recruited to develop a microfluidic chip system, and their on-chip performance will be&#xD;
      fine-tuned and optimized. In the 3rd year, 50 patients undergoing RTJA will be collected, and&#xD;
      the verification of the microfluidic system will be realized. This system will be validated&#xD;
      in PJIs cohorts in the first stage of debridement and implant removal, in the interim period,&#xD;
      and the second stage of reimplantation. It is expected that biomarker detection chip will&#xD;
      improve medical distress and bring important information to clinical decision-making.&#xD;
