  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the scalp bacterial and fungal&#xD;
      microbiota in subjects afflicted with a scalp seborrheic dermatitis (SSD) during a 2%&#xD;
      ketoconazole-based treatment followed by a maintenance phase (1% Selenium Disulfide (SeS2)/1%&#xD;
      salicylic acid-based shampoo versus its vehicle).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic, recurrent, cutaneous inflammatory condition that causes&#xD;
      erythema and skin flaking, sometimes appearing as macules or plaques with dry white or moist&#xD;
      oily scales. In general, this condition affects patients in good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults, it commonly occurs in areas with high concentrations of sebaceous glands. The&#xD;
      scalp is the most frequently affected area (80-90 percent of the cases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These plaques are usually masked by the hair but covered by abundant dandruff, very visible&#xD;
      on the head and even on the clothes. In the severe forms, the dandruff plaques develop into&#xD;
      &quot;helmets&quot;: they then cover tufts of hair and can cause them to fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the scalp, the lesions may range from mild desquamation to brownish crusts affixed to the&#xD;
      skin and hair. Some patients report pruritus, particularly if the scalp is affected.&#xD;
      Secondary bacterial infection may occur, aggravating erythema and exudate and causing local&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dandruff is regarded as a mild non-inflammatory form of seborrheic dermatitis. The cause of&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis is not well understood, but its occurrence appears to be related to the&#xD;
      proliferation of commensal Malassezia species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seborrheic dermatitis often has a substantial negative impact on quality of life and is&#xD;
      associated with direct and indirect medical costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goals of therapy for seborrheic dermatitis are to clear the visible signs of&#xD;
      disease and reduce bothersome symptoms, especially pruritus. Seborrheic dermatitis of the&#xD;
      scalp is most conveniently treated with shampoos containing antifungal agents,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, or keratolytic agent. They have been shown to be effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of seborrheic dermatitis, but recurrence is common and that ongoing treatment may be&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the choice of the treatment against seborrheic dermatitis was set to&#xD;
      ketoconazole, which is a common treatment that shows efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find a way to ameliorate the quality of life of subjects with&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis. This trial will evaluate the antidandruff maintenance effect of a 1%&#xD;
      selenium sulfide/1% salicylic acid-based shampoo (cosmetic shampoo) versus its vehicle during&#xD;
      a 8 week application duration, after the subjects were treated with a classic antifungal&#xD;
      treatment for seborrheic dermatitis (in this study, the treatment will be a&#xD;
      ketoconazole-based antifungal treatment for 4 weeks in adults with light to moderate&#xD;
      seborrheic dermatitis).&#xD;
