  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the project is the development of a software for implementation of anesthesiology&#xD;
      guidelines in the preoperative evaluation. The software bases on the 2014 and 2018 guidelines&#xD;
      of the European Society of Anesthesiology (ESA) for the pre-operative evaluation of adults&#xD;
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional premedication is compared with the new software-guided premedication by using a&#xD;
      cross-over design. 200 patients are included in the study, 100 of which are first evaluated&#xD;
      the traditional way and then with the software, 100 patients are treated the other way round.&#xD;
      Results of the two premedication methods are compared according to the primary endpoint&#xD;
      &quot;correct approval for OP&quot; and the secondary endpoints number of missed apparative&#xD;
      examinations, number of unnecessary apparative examinations, time required for premedication,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, mortality and postoperative complications.&#xD;

      Type of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocentric, prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for informing and obtaining consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are prepared for surgery in the anesthetic outpatient department or enrolled in&#xD;
      the pre-medication list and who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      identified before the anesthesia consultation. The patients will be informed about the&#xD;
      purpose and the course of the study in oral and written form, after which the written consent&#xD;
      of the patient will be given before the study-relevant data and examinations are carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the data sources (medical records, questionnaires, etc.):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources: Patient's medical history, patient history and physical examination, data on&#xD;
      standardized Thieme Compliance anesthesia sheets, and existing findings, either external,&#xD;
      patient-brought or in-house findings from the SAP. These data are entered into the PDMS. The&#xD;
      name of the premedic anesthetist is not relevant for the evaluation and will not be&#xD;
      deposited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Listing / description of the data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the PDMS, all anesthesia-relevant data is collected. These include the history of the&#xD;
      patient, current complaints, medication history, physical examination and findings from&#xD;
      supplementary equipment examinations. The data of the anonymized control group are extracted&#xD;
      exclusively from the PDMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing (appointments) for the individual study participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient has been informed and has consented, after randomization either the&#xD;
      premedication as usual with the &quot;old PDMS module&quot; is performed and then a second time with&#xD;
      the new software module by another doctor or vice versa, first with the new software and then&#xD;
      in the traditional way. This type of cross-over design is done to avoid carry-over effects.&#xD;
      The conventional premedicating physician does not know about the patient's participation in&#xD;
      the study and makes the decision about the OP release as well as any necessary additional&#xD;
      examinations in the usual way and dismisses the patient with the usual pre-hospitalization&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premedication with the new software module is carried out by a doctor who has been&#xD;
      trained in it and does not know the result of the first premedication interview. With the&#xD;
      help of the new software, the decision on release and possible additional examinations is&#xD;
      also made here. The data from the two premedication interviews are stored in xml format in&#xD;
      the MRI Data Room and entered in a pseudonymized form in a database. This is done promptly on&#xD;
      the day of premedication. A specialist trained in the guidelines, who is blinded to the&#xD;
      premedication procedure, compares the results of both premedications. He decides whether the&#xD;
      release was correct in both of the above cases or not. If it turns out that the results of&#xD;
      both premedications differ and possibly a revision of the premedication document is&#xD;
      necessary, unblinding and, if necessary, correction of the premedication document takes&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the time required for the premedication interview is analyzed as well as the&#xD;
      correct arrangement of additional examinations. The secondary outcome parameters are&#xD;
      collected using the KIS (clinic information system) and PDMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a comparison population with respect to the secondary endpoints, a conventionally&#xD;
      premedicated patient collective, whose anonymized data is extracted from the existing PDMS&#xD;
      database, is used in the same period. The endpoint of the comparison is the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative complications corresponding to a clavia-dindo score of ≥ 3. This corresponds to&#xD;
      the events of re-intervention, admission to intensive care unit or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected end of data collection With hospital discharge, the data collection for the&#xD;
      individual patient is completed.&#xD;
