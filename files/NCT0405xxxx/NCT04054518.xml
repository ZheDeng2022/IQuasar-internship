  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single arm phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of durvalumab treatment in terms of&#xD;
      6-month progression-free survival. We will include 22 patients who will receive 1500 mg&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W &lt;&lt;for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13&#xD;
      doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;until confirmed disease&#xD;
      progression&gt;&gt; unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another&#xD;
      discontinuation criterion is met. If a patient's weight falls to 30 kg or below for 1 week or&#xD;
      longer ( ≥ 7 days) durvalumab will be permanently discontinued.&#xD;

      durvalumab (MEDI4736) via IV infusion Q4W &lt;&lt;for up to a maximum of 12 months (up to 13&#xD;
      doses/cycles) with the last administration on week 48 unless there is unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;

      patient's weight falls to 30 kg or below for 1 week or longer ( ≥ 7 days) durvalumab will be&#xD;
      permanently discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O) Study Assessments and Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      O.1) Safety Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will be performed in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria, version 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least every 4 weeks, during each visit, data on toxicity on treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis will also be performed at least every 4 weeks to assess toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O.2) Efficacy Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo tumor assessments with cross-sectional imaging at study site at start&#xD;
      and then 8 ± 1w until complete 12 months after first dose; Patients who have disease control&#xD;
      following completion of 12 months (13 cycles) of treatment will continue to have objective&#xD;
      tumor assessment q12w ± 1w for more 12 months or until disease progression (whichever comes&#xD;
      first); Patients who are withdrawn from durvalumab treatment for reasons other than confirmed&#xD;
      PD (e.g toxicity) will continue to have objective tumor assessments q8w ± 1w until complete&#xD;
      12 months after first dose. Then, they will have objective tumor assessments q12w ± 1w for&#xD;
      more 12 months (24 months after first dose) or until disease progression; Measurable target&#xD;
      and nontarget lesions will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      P) Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety analysis will be performed considering all enrolled patients who received at least one&#xD;
      dose of durvalumab; Efficacy analysis will be performed using intention-to-treat approach;&#xD;
      Will be used an alpha error of 0.05 (1-sided) and a power (1 - beta error) of 90%; Primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be 6-month progression free survival rate; Secondary endpoints will be overall&#xD;
      survival, incidence of locoregional progression and incidence of distant progression;&#xD;
      Locoregional progression is defined when an in-field lesion (primary tumor or lymph nodes) is&#xD;
      the first site of progression or in case of worsening dysphagia with an upper endoscopy&#xD;
      revealing an unequivocal local progression; Distant progression is defined when an out-field&#xD;
      lesion (lymph node, visceral, bone) is the first site of progression; We estimate 12 months&#xD;
      of recruitment, with 2 patients per month; Overall survival will be estimated using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q) Sample Size Determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm phase II trial; Will be estimated p0 (null-hypothesis 6-month PFS) as 10%; Will be&#xD;
      estimated p1 (alternative hypothesis 6-month PFS) as 35%; With an estimated dropout rate of&#xD;
      10%, our sample size will be 22 patients.&#xD;
