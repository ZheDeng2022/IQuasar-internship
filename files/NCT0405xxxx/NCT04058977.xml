  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients surviving critical illness experience significant skeletal muscle dysfunction and&#xD;
      weakness. Muscle atrophy suffered during critical illness has a long-term impact on the&#xD;
      functionality and mobility of these individuals. As a result, individuals surviving critical&#xD;
      illness have a significant reduction in quality of life, even up to 5 years post discharge.&#xD;
      Research including large randomized controls demonstrates that rehabilitation focused on&#xD;
      active mobilization may positively influence patient outcomes. Thus, early mobilization is an&#xD;
      important intervention that has many purported benefits. Current rehabilitation practice in&#xD;
      the intensive care unit (ICU) and recommendations from clinical practice guidelines such as&#xD;
      the Society of Critical Care Medicine, PADIS Guidelines support these interventions to reduce&#xD;
      the detrimental effects of immobilization during critical illness. Early mobilization is&#xD;
      routinely thought of as standard of care for patients admitted for acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome and sepsis. However, a significant number of recent randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      implementing early rehabilitation and mobilization interventions fail to demonstrate&#xD;
      immediate or long-term benefits.10,11,18,19 Interesting, active mobilization and&#xD;
      rehabilitation analyzed in systematic review had no impact on mortality and &quot;no consistent&#xD;
      effects of function, quality of life and ICU or hospital length of stay.&quot;18 There are a few&#xD;
      potential explanations for interventions not leading to reduction in impairment or functional&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Premise: From our preliminary data (Figure 1) and my clinical experience, a&#xD;
      significant cause of the physical impairments in these patients is reductions in muscular&#xD;
      power. Muscular power is a critical determinant of functional mobility.20 Preliminary data&#xD;
      demonstrate that lower extremity muscle power is significantly reduced in this population and&#xD;
      furthermore, these deficits are strongly correlated to physical function. Muscle power&#xD;
      training is a potential therapeutic intervention that could lead to more robust improvements&#xD;
      in physical function. This concept has been explored extensively in community-dwelling older&#xD;
      adults. A recent systematic review of controlled trials demonstrates that power training is&#xD;
      superior to traditional resistance training at improving functional performance when&#xD;
      comparing the two training modalities.21 Furthermore, power training is feasible for older&#xD;
      adults and clinical populations of Parkinson's Disease, Stroke, and frailty.22-27 Thus the&#xD;
      feasibility and pragmatic nature of power training is not a concern. Of interest, a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial was completed in institutionalized frail nonagenarians (&gt;85 years&#xD;
      or older).27 In this study, no patients drop-out of study due to power training and&#xD;
      significant benefits in function were achieved.27 Therefore, the investigators propose a&#xD;
      interventional trial to study the effect of a standardized muscle power training program for&#xD;
      patients admitted to the ICU for critical illness.&#xD;

    <measure>Short Performance Physical Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure is scored from 0-12 with lower scores representing disability and higher scores representing better physical function. This test has three components including balance, chair rise time, and habitual gait speed. There is a pre-defined scoring system with participants scoring 0-4 on each test, higher representing better function.&#xD;
These individual components can then be further analysed based on continuous variables of five repetitions of chair rise and habitual 4-meter gait speed. Faster times to complete the the chair-rise test and faster gait speed represents better physical function.</description>

    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Eq-5d is a validate quality of life questionnaire that the participant completes. It has five components each on a scale from 1 to 5, which higher scores representing poor or worse quality of life. A total score can be assessed out of possible 25.</description>

    <description>The 6-mwt is a test of physical function and strength in which participant walks as far as possible in six-minutes. Final distance is analysed as a continuous variable with higher distances being better.</description>
