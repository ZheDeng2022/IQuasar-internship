  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study evaluates short-term feasibility and safety of CardioRenal ExpHeart in&#xD;
      patients with worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to optimize&#xD;
      pharmacological heart failure treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remote monitoring of the biomarkers (5 days a week, between 7am - 12 midday). The&#xD;
      home-based monitoring of congestion by Hb and Hte, eGFR using the CKD EPI formula&#xD;
      (creatinine) and potassium variables will be measured with point of care devices, after&#xD;
      minimally invasive blood sampling operated by the healthcare professional who will manually&#xD;
      enter the data in the Information System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. ExpHeart is composed of an Information System (web application) and an algorithm, the&#xD;
      Expert System, embedded on the information system. The Information System is a&#xD;
      cyber-securised web application and the Expert System uses a proprietary therapeutic&#xD;
      algorithm to optimize pharmacological HF treatment. The Expert System is based on the&#xD;
      analysis of a continuously updated clinical database integrating the patient's electronic&#xD;
      medical record (managed by the Information System). The Expert System will generate&#xD;
      prescription recommendations directed to the treating investigator through the Information&#xD;
      System. The Expert System recommendations are based on ESC clinical guidelines (Annex II).&#xD;
      This evaluated solution Expheart is not CE marked yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Decision on treatment update and/or optimization will be operated by physicians and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals who will monitor compliance with the study protocol including the&#xD;
      smooth functioning of bilateral patientinvestigator communication, i.e. (i) receipt by the&#xD;
      investigator of recommendations from Expheart solution, (ii) adequate action/decision of the&#xD;
      investigator and (iii) implementation of the appropriate action at the patient level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will inform the patient's treating physician/General practitioner (by phone&#xD;
      and mail) about the participation of his/her patient to the study and will inform him that&#xD;
      any HF treatment prescription change will be performed by him/her during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in case of any technical difficulty, assistance will be provided by a dedicated&#xD;
      call center, serviced daily by the promotor (Monday to Friday, support@cardio-renal.com).&#xD;
