  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is commonly known that high eye pressure is associated with glaucoma. However, there is&#xD;
      also a theory that poor circulation to the eye is a contributing factor. Therefore, if we can&#xD;
      increase the flow of blood to the eye, we may be able to stop people losing vision from this&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (for example sildenafil, tadalafil, Viagra®, Cialis®) are drugs&#xD;
      used to improve blood flow to certain parts of the body. They are commonly used on an ad-hoc&#xD;
      basis to treat erectile dysfunction, in addition to problems with blood circulation to the&#xD;
      lungs, fingers and toes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of previous work in this field has been completed using insensitive, poorly&#xD;
      reproducible techniques such as colour doppler ultrasound. Since then, a new imaging modality&#xD;
      able to image blood flow in blood vessels without the need for the injection of contrast has&#xD;
      entered clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial pilot study is designed as a proof-of-concept study to investigate whether we&#xD;
      can measure detectable changes in the blood flow to the retina and choroid at the back of the&#xD;
      eye following ingestion of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor medication by healthy and&#xD;
      glaucomatous volunteers already taking this medication for erectile dysfunction.&#xD;

      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is examining the hypothesis that Phosphodiesterase inhibitors increase&#xD;
      chorio-retinal blood flow; in other words, we hypothesise that drugs like Viagra that have a&#xD;
      known effect of generally increasing circulation may also increase the blood flow in the back&#xD;
      of the eye -retina, with possible beneficial effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a small pilot study which is not expected to produce a definitive answer to our&#xD;
      question -however, if successful this study will enable us to progress to a larger study that&#xD;
      will have much more data to base our conclusions on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our present study will, therefore, examine both healthy and glaucomatous eyes with regards to&#xD;
      the level of blood flow in the retina - something that can be measured using optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT), a safe and non-invasive procedure which has been in use as part&#xD;
      of the standard of care for some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated Timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics assessment - April 2019 Patient recruitment - June to Sep 2019 Study period - May 2019&#xD;
      to Jan 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient encounters will take place at either the eye clinic, level 1, Charing Cross Hospital,&#xD;
      or the iCORG clinical trials unit, Western Eye Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encounter 1 - As part of the routine clinic visit potentially eligible patients will be&#xD;
      approached by the members of the regular care team and study discussed with those who are&#xD;
      interested. Patients who are comfortable to proceed (have discussed the study in detail with&#xD;
      the doctor and have had their questions answered satisfactorily)will provide consent which&#xD;
      will be documented in writing; those who wish to have more time will be afforded as much time&#xD;
      as they need to decide whether or not to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has consented to participate, the following study procedures will be done as&#xD;
      part of that visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment Medical history Baseline assessment Ophthalmic history Baseline&#xD;
      assessment Drug history Baseline assessment Allergy history - all of the above will be&#xD;
      assessed by the study doctor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment Visual acuity - patient reads letters from a chart 10 feet (3 meters)&#xD;
      away to ascertain the quality of vision Baseline assessment Visual field test -non-invasive&#xD;
      test where the study doctor examines how much 'side' vision patient has using a computerized&#xD;
      machine. Lights are flashed on, and patient has to press a button whenever they see the&#xD;
      light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment Colour vision/contrast sensitivity - patient reads letters /numbers from&#xD;
      a multi coloured picture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment Intraocular pressure (IOP)- Study Doctor places eye drops which numb the&#xD;
      eyes and measures the pressure in each eye by gently touching the instrument (called a&#xD;
      tonometer) to the front surface of the eye. This is a standard procedure and the numbing&#xD;
      eye-drops are safe and have been part of standard care pathway for some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment Slit-lamp examination- study doctor examines eyes using a special lens&#xD;
      and light Baseline assessment Blood pressure (BP)- standard procedure Baseline assessment OCT&#xD;
      and OCTA scan - OCT stands for optical coherence tomography which is a type of imaging&#xD;
      technique that is commonly used to image the eye in the clinic, using light to visualise the&#xD;
      layers of the back of the eye. There are no risks or discomforts associated with this type of&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure PDE-5 inhibitor dosing - participants take their drug as per protocol&#xD;
      (according to what drug they have been taking) Study procedure OCTA 30 minutes - as OCT but&#xD;
      done in different time intervals 30min, 60min, 120min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure Repeat BP, IOP at 50 minutes - as described above Study procedure OCTA 60&#xD;
      minutes - as described above Study procedure OCTA 120 minutes- as described above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the study, patients from both cohorts(glaucoma and andrology) will&#xD;
      continue their regular care in their usual clinics. The follow-up data routinely generated as&#xD;
      part of the glaucoma care pathway (only)which is stored within the hospital data system e.g&#xD;
      the central macular thickness, visual fields, IOP and other parameters will be accessed for 3&#xD;
      years following completion of participation with a view of correlating initial results with&#xD;
      possible disease progression and other related outcomes. This segment of the study is purely&#xD;
      data-based and does not require any active involvement from the patients; participation in&#xD;
      the data follow-up part of the study is optional and permission to access the relevant data&#xD;
      will be documented in the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analyses will take place as they are deemed not needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling /recruiting for this pilot study will be from consecutive eligible patients from&#xD;
      glaucoma and andrology clinics as well as patients recruited via the Western Eye Hospital&#xD;
      patient database and replies to poster adverts at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size target for this pilot study is 30 including 15 glaucoma subjects and 15&#xD;
      non-glaucoma subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No sample size or power calculations are necessary for this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment sources (aim: 15 non glaucoma participants, 15 glaucoma participants)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma clinics (Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust) Andrology clinics (Imperial Healthcare NHS&#xD;
      Trust) Western Eye Patient database - potential patients will be contacted by telephone by a&#xD;
      member of the usual care team and given the opportunity to receive more information about&#xD;
      research that we are undertaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poster (attached) advertisements will be strategically placed in andrology and glaucoma&#xD;
      waiting rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will also have the opportunity to be emailed/posted a patient information sheet and&#xD;
      given the opportunity to ask further questions.&#xD;
