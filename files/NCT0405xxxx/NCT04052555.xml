    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the best dose of berzosertib when given together with the usual&#xD;
      treatment (radiation therapy) in treating patients with triple negative or estrogen receptor&#xD;
      and/or progesterone receptor positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer. Berzosertib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving M6620 and&#xD;
      radiation therapy may kill tumor cells more effectively than radiation alone or shrink or&#xD;
      stabilize breast cancer for longer than radiation therapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose of twice weekly berzosertib administered&#xD;
      concurrently with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (RT) to the breast/chest wall&#xD;
      and regional nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the nature of toxicity that develops when an ATR inhibitor is administered&#xD;
      concurrently with RT for breast cancer using provider assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess long-term locoregional control, disease-free survival, distant disease-free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore symptomatic adverse events and tolerability of berzosertib being administered&#xD;
      concurrently with RT using patient-reported outcomes (PROs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess for germline and somatic alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage&#xD;
      response and repair genes, including effectors and regulators of homologous recombination&#xD;
      (HR), in pre-chemotherapy biopsy specimens and post-chemotherapy surgical resection specimens&#xD;
      using whole exome sequencing (WES), and to correlate HR deficiency with disease-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify somatic alterations in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) at baseline,&#xD;
      mid-treatment, end-of-treatment, and follow-up and to correlate cfDNA with disease-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the baseline and post-treatment skin microbiome and make exploratory&#xD;
      correlations with severe provider and patient-reported toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess for germline DNA repair alterations and correlate with severe provider and&#xD;
      patient-reported toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore dose-volume parameters associated with acute and late toxicity provider and&#xD;
      patient-reported toxicity following berzosertib administration concurrent with RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To identify circulating tumor cell (CTC) positivity at baseline, mid-treatment,&#xD;
      end-of-treatment, and follow-up and to correlate CTC positivity or the combination of CTC&#xD;
      positivity and cfDNA with disease-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate pre-treatment and post-treatment differential abundance of peripheral blood&#xD;
      immune cell populations identified by cytometry by time-of flight (CyTOF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate associations of the pre-treatment and post-treatment peripheral blood immune&#xD;
      phenotype (as assessed by CyTOF) with disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival&#xD;
      and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of berzosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive berzosertib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes twice weekly (BIW) for 5&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo&#xD;
      RT 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks depending on the type of surgery undergone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at 12&#xD;
      months, then yearly for up to 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for individuals of childbearing potential.&#xD;
             Note: The effects of berzosertib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason and because DNA-damage repair inhibitors as well as radiation used in this&#xD;
             trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and for&#xD;

             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of berzosertib&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior RT to the ipsilateral chest wall or ipsilateral breast or thorax. Individuals&#xD;
             with prior RT to the contralateral breast or chest wall are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia and grade&#xD;
             1-2 taxane-induced neuropathy which will be permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or concomitant&#xD;
             anti-neoplastic treatment, except endocrine therapies and bisphosphonates which are&#xD;
             permitted without restriction even during protocol treatment. Postoperative&#xD;
             chemotherapy is allowed but must be discontinued &gt;28 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to berzosertib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Berzosertib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration&#xD;
             with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,&#xD;
             ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g.,&#xD;
             rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided.&#xD;
             Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study and for 14 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
             are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is&#xD;
             important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness. This includes but is not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing uncontrolled serious infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
             registration, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             symptomatic/uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic lupus, scleroderma, or dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because berzosertib as a DNA damage repair&#xD;
             inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with berzosertib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with berzosertib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hereditary syndromes predisposing to radiosensitivity such as Li&#xD;
             Fraumeni syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia are excluded from the study. Patients with&#xD;
             mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2,&#xD;
             and ATM are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers&#xD;
             and non-invasive cancers whose natural history or treatment does not have the&#xD;
             potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational&#xD;
             regimen&#xD;
