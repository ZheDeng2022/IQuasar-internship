      This is a single-arm, open-label and exploratory clinical study of Anlotinib Hydrochloride&#xD;
      Capsules combined with Sintilimab injection in the treatment of advanced Hepatocellular&#xD;
      Carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In oder to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules&#xD;
      combined with Sintilimab injection. Subjects with pathological confirmed Hepatocellular&#xD;
      Carcinoma will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      21 days as a treatment cycle, Anlotinib 12mg/day(D1-D14 ) and Sintilimab injection 200mg Q3W&#xD;
      (D1). Sintilimab injection will be administered until disease progressioncor un-tolerable&#xD;
      toxicity. Anlotinib will be administered until disease progression. If anlotinib is not&#xD;
      tolerated, the dose can be reduced to 10mg or 8mg ,until un-tolerable toxicity again.&#xD;
