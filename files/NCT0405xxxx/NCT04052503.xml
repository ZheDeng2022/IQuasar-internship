    <textblock>
      Knowledge brokers can facilitate knowledge translation (KT) interventions to improve the use&#xD;
      of outcome measures by physical therapists. Following the Knowledge-to-Action cycle, a&#xD;
      knowledge broker (a researcher who facilitates the translation of knowledge in the local&#xD;
      context) will: (1) complete a barrier assessment, (2) develop and implement a tailored&#xD;
      multi-modal intervention and (3) determine the outcome. The KB will determine the barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators to using outcome measures by PTs who work in inpatient rehabilitation and&#xD;
      design a locally tailored KT intervention with input from the key stakeholders (PTs). This&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial will compare two active interventions with full or partial supported&#xD;
      implementation by a knowledge broker using a cluster randomized trial (randomization will&#xD;
      occur by site) to determine the impact on the PTs and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine if the KT intervention designed and implemented by a KB will increase PTs&#xD;
      the use of a selected standardized assessment as compared to an intervention that is designed&#xD;
      but not implemented by the KB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis1a: Physical therapists use (documented and self-reported) of a selected&#xD;
      standardized assessment will improve to a significantly greater extent immediately following&#xD;
      the intervention designed and implemented by a KB compared to the partially supported group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis1b: Physical therapists in the fully supported group will retain the use of the&#xD;
      standardized assessment to a significantly greater extent at 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Explore and compare both groups of physical therapists satisfaction and concerns with&#xD;
      each KT intervention on standardized assessment use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The physical therapists in the fully supported group will express greater&#xD;
      satisfaction with the KT intervention and identify fewer barriers for implementing the&#xD;
      standardized assessment in practice as compared to the partially supported group immediately&#xD;
      after and retained at 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Explore and compare the patients' experience who were seen by therapists in the fully&#xD;
      and partially supported group Hypothesis 3: Patients who were treated by clinicians in the&#xD;
      fully supported group will demonstrate an understanding of the patient standardized&#xD;
      assessment, why it's relevant to complete the test, and how the information gathered from the&#xD;
      standardized assessment can be used to guide the plan of care.&#xD;

      Purpose/Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design two locally tailored multi-modal knowledge translation interventions using a&#xD;
           mixed methods barrier assessment with input from the clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effectiveness of the interventions on physical therapists' use of&#xD;
           standardized assessments/outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The fully supported group will have the intervention designed and implemented by&#xD;
                the investigator (knowledge broker)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The partially supported group will have the intervention designed and only partial&#xD;
                implementation by the investigator (knowledge broker)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the impact of the intervention on patients who were evaluated by PTs in both&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the immediate and longer term (6 months following the intervention)&#xD;
           effectiveness of a theoretically informed multi-modal tailored intervention designed and&#xD;
           implemented by a knowledge broker as compared to a tailored intervention designed, but&#xD;
           only partially implemented by the knowledge broker on the use of a selected patient&#xD;
           standardized assessment by physical therapists who work in rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore and compare patients' experiences of being evaluated by PTs in the fully&#xD;
           supported and partially supported groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed study intends to compare two KT interventions designed by a KB using an&#xD;
           fully supported and partially supported implementation groups. The outcomes will be&#xD;
           measured through mixed methods to determine the immediate and 6 month retention of&#xD;
           behavior change, impact of the intervention, and investigate the impact of the&#xD;
           intervention on patients. Quantitative data analysis will be used through chart audit to&#xD;
           determine documentation of outcome measures and a self-reported survey (Goal Attainment&#xD;
           Scale). Qualitative analysis (focus groups) will be used to determine reasons for&#xD;
           behavior change which can be used to guide future interventions. Long term analysis also&#xD;
           helps investigators determine if the behavior was retained after the intervention was&#xD;
           completed. Finally, few studies have investigated the impact of the intervention on the&#xD;
           patients and an exploratory focus group will compare patients treated by physical&#xD;
           therapists in the experimental and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Design and Methods This is a mixed methods cluster randomized controlled trial&#xD;
           with 2 sites. Phase I: Barrier Assessment and Intervention Design The interventions will&#xD;
           be designed by the knowledge broker with input from the clinicians through a barrier&#xD;
           assessment. The barrier assessment will include a chart audit, a questionnaire and a&#xD;
           focus group. The chart audit will be used to determine current use of standardized&#xD;
           assessments. The questionnaire will be used assess current use, barriers, and&#xD;
           facilitators to evidence based practice and using standardized assessments. The&#xD;
           clinicians will be given a link to access and complete the barrier assessment survey&#xD;
           anonymously. The barriers and facilitators to evidence based practice (EBP) and using&#xD;
           outcome measures questionnaire was developed and validated in a previous study and&#xD;
           designed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The questionnaire contains a&#xD;
           question on which outcome measure the participants would like to use more frequently, to&#xD;
           help guide selection of the standardized assessment. The focus group will present chart&#xD;
           audit and questionnaire data, confirm barriers and facilitators, and determine the&#xD;
           strategies that will be used in the intervention based on the Theoretical Domains&#xD;
           Framework consensus matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized assessments will be selected by the groups through the following process:&#xD;
      Participants will complete a question on the questionnaire about which standardized&#xD;
      assessments they would like to use more frequently. Those results will be tallied and two&#xD;
      standardized assessment will be briefly presented to the experimental and active control&#xD;
      groups during the first focus group. The two standardized assessments presented must be&#xD;
      performance based, comprise of only a few steps, be easy to interpret and have at least&#xD;
      adequate psychometric properties (reliability and validity testing) Each group will select a&#xD;
      comparable outcome measure/standardized assessment based on the two standardized assessment&#xD;
      the investigators selects to present. The group will be asked to select one assessment based&#xD;
      on group consensus of 80%. Disagreement will be handled through discussion. Each group can&#xD;
      choose different standardized assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Intervention The trial will be conducted in two inpatient rehabilitation hospitals&#xD;
      within the same organization, Kessler (Chester and Saddle Brook locations). The fully&#xD;
      supported group (enhanced arm) will receive a theoretically informed tailored multi-modal&#xD;
      intervention designed and implemented by a knowledge broker (investigator) to increase the&#xD;
      use of a selected standardized assessment. A knowledge broker (KB) is a researcher who brings&#xD;
      evidence to the clinicians with the purpose to change practice. KBs are able to locally&#xD;
      tailor interventions for the clinicians. The partially supported arm will also receive a&#xD;
      theoretically informed tailored multimodal intervention that will be designed, and only&#xD;
      partially implemented by the KB. The groups will be randomization, by site, after the barrier&#xD;
      assessment is completed (Chester or Saddle Brook). Randomization by site was selected to&#xD;
      reduce contamination among the therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fully supported group will have 2 additional meetings with the Knowledge Broker (KB) to&#xD;
      assist with implementation and barrier assessment. The KB will meet with the fully supported&#xD;
      group six times to design and implement the intervention, and the KB will meet with the&#xD;
      partially supported group four times to design and partially implement the intervention. The&#xD;
      KB will encourage both groups to use the selected standardized assessment. The fully&#xD;
      supported group will have four educational outreach visits over a four month period. Two of&#xD;
      the four outreach visits will occur simultaneously with focus groups and provide feedback&#xD;
      from chart audit data on current use of the selected standardized assessment and design the&#xD;
      intervention by discussing an action plan to determine strategies to increase the use of the&#xD;
      selected assessment. The investigator will implement the intervention in the two additional&#xD;
      outreach visits. Strategies will be tailored to the group and may include: distribution of&#xD;
      educational materials, an interactive educational meeting, and reminders. The partially&#xD;
      supported arm will have two educational outreach visits where the intervention/action plan&#xD;
      will be designed but not implemented by the investigator. The partially supported arm will be&#xD;
      encouraged to self-implement the intervention during months 2 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Outcome Assessment Outcomes will be assessed to determine documented and&#xD;
      self-reported use of the selected standardized assessment through chart audit at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post intervention and 6 month follow-up. Focus groups will be conducted at post&#xD;
      intervention and follow-up to explore and compare the impact of the intervention on behavior&#xD;
      change, facilitators to change and barriers that remained among each group. In addition, four&#xD;
      focus groups will be held with patients of the therapists' in each group to explore and&#xD;
      compare their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Sample Size Justification Physical Therapist- up to 40 PTs, 20 at each location will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. The sample size is based on the number of PTs who work at Kessler and&#xD;
      a power calculation based on pilot research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated by the enrolled PTs- up to 24; 3-6 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.1 Power Calculation: A power calculation was completed using the pilot study data. Based&#xD;
      on the pilot study data, two groups of 6 will achieve an effect size of .7 and power of 81%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group equivalency at baseline will be analyzed using the following variables: age, gender,&#xD;
      years of experience, and educational level will be analyzed using either an unpaired t-test&#xD;
      or Mann-Whitney U test. Continuous data (age, years of experience, use of standardized&#xD;
      assessments) will be analyzed using an unpaired t-test if assumptions of normality are met&#xD;
      and Levene's test of homogeneity is not significant. Level of significance will be set at .1.&#xD;
      A Mann-Whitney U test will be used for ordinal data and data that are not normal. Variables&#xD;
      on which the groups differ at baseline will be considered for inclusion in the final models&#xD;
      as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barrier assessment questionnaire data will be analyzed descriptively to guide intervention&#xD;
      development. The baseline focus group will be transcribed, coded and themes will be created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documented use of the standardized assessment will be analyzed using a within-between,&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA, with time and group as factors. If data are non-normal attempts will&#xD;
      be made to transform the dependent variables to meet parametric standards. Another option&#xD;
      will be to explore statistical procedures that model non-Gaussian distributions. Level of&#xD;
      significance will be set at .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported use will be analyzed using the Goal Attainment Scale using the Friedman's test&#xD;
      because data are ordinal. The Friedman's test will used for within group analysis only.&#xD;
      Comparisons between groups will be reported descriptively or alternatively, a&#xD;
      post-intervention Mann-Whitney U may be used. Level of significance will be set at .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group: Each focus group will be recorded and transcribed and conventional content&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted. After the focus group is transcribed, open coding will occur by&#xD;
      coding notes, observations, and comments in the margins of potentially relevant information.&#xD;
      Similar notes, observations and comments will be grouped together into categories or themes.&#xD;
      Appropriate categories will be associated with Theoretical Domains Framework and the&#xD;
      Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) into codes and rated. Experiences&#xD;
      will be determined by satisfaction with the intervention, perceived facilitators for changing&#xD;
      their behavior and barriers that remain. Several steps will be taken to establish&#xD;
      trustworthiness of the qualitative data..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Realist Analysis: Chart audit data will be used as the Outcome and Qualitative codes from the&#xD;
      CFIR will be entered as Mechanisms (Interventions) or Context. Codes and ratings will be&#xD;
      compared with chart audit data to determine reasons for use or non-use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Focus group: The patient focus group, will be used to compare the experiences of&#xD;
      patients treated by therapists in the intervention and control groups. Each focus group will&#xD;
      be recorded and transcribed. Open coding will occur as I will write notes, observations, and&#xD;
      comments in the margins of potentially relevant information of the transcribed focus group.&#xD;
      Similar notes, observations and comments will be grouped together into categories or themes.&#xD;
      Categories will be compared across groups.&#xD;
