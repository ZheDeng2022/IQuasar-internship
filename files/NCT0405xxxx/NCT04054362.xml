  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II pilot trial of Paclitaxel Protein Bound and Gemcitabine based chemotherapy&#xD;
      and the addition of Paricalcitol upon attainment of stable or progressive disease in eligible&#xD;
      patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-highest cancer killer worldwide with an overall 5 year&#xD;
      survival of about 8%. The only potentially curative procedure, surgical excision, is feasible&#xD;
      in a minority of patients, but even in these patients the majority (~80%) die within 5 years.&#xD;
      This study aims to see if adding paricalcitol (a vitamin D analogue) to chemotherapy can slow&#xD;
      down tumour growth in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown vitamin D can change the pancreatic tumour microenvironment from an&#xD;
      immunologically suppressive (tumour growth promoting) to an immunologically hostile one,&#xD;
      slowing down tumour growth in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs and who have adequate hepatic&#xD;
      and renal function are eligible. Participants will receive chemotherapy (paclitaxel and&#xD;
      gemcitabine, with or without cisplatin). On development of stable disease or disease&#xD;
      progression, paricalcitol will be added to the chemotherapy regimen and participants will&#xD;
      continue on this treatment until their cancer stops responding to treatment. After that&#xD;
      participants will be followed up 3 monthly for the collection of disease status and survival&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to donate tumour and blood samples to allow the research team to&#xD;
      look at the effects on the tumour biology.&#xD;

             treatment. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 (preferably as close to the study&#xD;
             treatment day as possible). Both male and female patients of reproductive potential&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients must have received no previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or&#xD;
             investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior treatments in&#xD;
             the adjuvant setting with gemcitabine and/or 5-FU or gemcitabine administered as a&#xD;
             radiation sensitizer are allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since&#xD;
             completion of the last dose and no lingering toxicities are present. In exceptional&#xD;
             circumstances, if a patient has received paclitaxel protein bound and gemcitabine as&#xD;
             first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease in exactly the same way as mandated in&#xD;
             the current trial, they can be considered eligible to be enrolled directly to the add&#xD;
             on paricalcitol component of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Palliative surgery and/or radiation treatment less than 4 weeks prior to initiation of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;

             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (negative imaging study, if&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Active, clinically significant serious infection requiring treatment with antibiotics,&#xD;
             antivirals or anti-fungals (see Section 6.10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of symptomatic genitourinary stones (e.g. kidney stones) within 12months of&#xD;
             Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;

             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient is on prohibited concurrent medication (see Section 6.10). In particular,&#xD;
             vitamin D and calcium supplements must be stopped at the time of enrolment and for the&#xD;
             duration of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of&#xD;
             a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of study treatment, may affect the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment&#xD;
             complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
