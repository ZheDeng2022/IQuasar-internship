  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ExAMIN Youth SA study aims to generate new knowledge on the pathophysiology involved in&#xD;
      early vascular aging among South African children and to identify early novel biological&#xD;
      markers for predicting the subclinical development of hypertension and target organ damage&#xD;
      related to cardiovascular disease. This study further implements state-of-the-art biochemical&#xD;
      technology to measure a variety of biological markers including multiplex analyses and&#xD;
      metabolomics. With the increasing prevalence of childhood hypertension and obesity, this&#xD;
      study will be able to address especially behavioural contributors to hypertension development&#xD;
      and to subsequently provide a backdrop for school-based primary prevention interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The current global widespread incidence of obesity and early cardiovascular&#xD;
      deterioration are two of the most important future health care challenges. Physical&#xD;
      inactivity and its associated unhealthy dietary intake among adolescents are of great&#xD;
      concern, especially in a South African setting in which no current monitoring occurs to&#xD;
      describe the impact of this sedentary and unhealthy lifestyle on cardiovascular health. With&#xD;
      the estimated global prevalence of elevated blood pressure among children between 12-25%,&#xD;
      there is a definite need to contribute to the lack of population level data in South Africa&#xD;
      and how lifestyle behaviours impact on the burden of non-communicable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aim: Our current study aims to build on previous findings to identify potential&#xD;
      contributing factors that may adversely affect health outcomes in South African children.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will cross-compare data with international centres on these health outcomes,&#xD;
      and finally develop predictive models on target organ damage at 4-years follow-up from&#xD;
      baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methods: We phenotyped a cohort of 1065 primary school children (all sexes, all ethnic&#xD;
      groups and ages 5-9 years) according to their physical fitness and coordination, their&#xD;
      dietary behaviours, psychosocial behaviour and current cardiovascular state. Parents of&#xD;
      participating children provided information on socio-demographics including data on&#xD;
      education, employment, types of dwelling, household amenities and parents' marital status,&#xD;
      health habits, and lifestyle. The children will underwent the following measurements:&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements of height, weight, waist circumference, triceps and subscapular&#xD;
      skinfolds; stable isotope and bioelectric impedance analysis to measure body composition;&#xD;
      blood pressure along with pulse wave analysis and aortic pulse wave velocity, static retinal&#xD;
      vessel analysis (without mydriasis); accelerometry and a standardised physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire to measure physical activity. Physical fitness measures included motor skills,&#xD;
      coordination, flexibility and cardio-respiratory fitness. Urinalysis will include creatinine,&#xD;
      albumin, electrolytes, nitrates, nitrites, dimethylarginines, malondialdehyde, glucose,&#xD;
      cardiovascular and kidney multiplex panels, and targeted metabolomics. Salivary analyses will&#xD;
      include sex hormones and cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcomes for the baseline analysis include blood pressure, pulse wave&#xD;
      velocity and retinal vascular calibres to address micro- and macrovascular compromise in&#xD;
      relation to behavioural risk factors. In the follow-up phase of the study we will include&#xD;
      carotid intima media thickness and left ventricular mass as outcomes of baseline predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timetable: The project was approved and is endorsed by the District Director of the&#xD;
      Department of Education, and was approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      North-West University on 10 may 2017 (NWU-00091-16-A1). Data collection started in September&#xD;
      2017 and baseline measurements were concluded on 30 April 2019. Follow-up assessments will&#xD;
      commence immediately in subsequent years for the 4-year follow-up phase of the study.&#xD;

        The study population included 1103 children (at baseline) attending public primary schools&#xD;
        in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda district, North West province, South Africa aged between 5 and 9&#xD;
        years of age. However, with a few missing (n=38) values of basic variables of interest such&#xD;
        as sex, ethnicity or date of birth, we included a total 1065 children (mean age=7.44 years&#xD;
        or 89.3 months). The majority of the participants were of African (n=579) and white (n=463)&#xD;
        ethnicity, whereas only 2.2% (n=23) participants were of either Indian or mixed race. The&#xD;
        sex distribution was similar in the white group, whereas the study unintentionally included&#xD;
        more girls (58.5%) than boys (41.5%) in the black group.&#xD;
