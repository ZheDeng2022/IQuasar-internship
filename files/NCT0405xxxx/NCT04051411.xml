  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that&#xD;
      patients with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation be considered for mitral valve&#xD;
      surgery. There remains a debate within the cardiology community regarding the appropriate&#xD;
      management of patients who remain asymptomatic. In this study the investigators will perform&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up data with cardiac MRI to inform the prophylactic surgery vs. close&#xD;
      follow-up debate and to better define the natural history of this condition. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize, that in the majority of patients mitral regurgitation will not&#xD;
      worsen overtime, left ventricular hemodynamics will remain stable, exercise capacity will not&#xD;
      decline, and symptoms will not worsen during follow-up. This finding would have a significant&#xD;
      impact on the current recommendations for treatment in patients with mitral regurgitation by&#xD;
      supporting a conservative management approach.&#xD;

      Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that patients with severe degenerative mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation be considered for mitral valve surgery. There remains a debate within the&#xD;
      cardiology community regarding the appropriate management of patients who remain&#xD;
      asymptomatic. There are those who advocate for performing early &quot;prophylactic&quot; mitral valve&#xD;
      surgery while others advocate clinical follow-up until triggers emerge with echocardiography&#xD;
      historically being the method used for longitudinal assessment of cardiac anatomy and&#xD;
      function. Two studies showed that only ~30% of asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation made&#xD;
      endpoints that triggered. However, these studies were limited and did not perform rigorous&#xD;
      follow up assessment of regurgitant volume, left ventricular hemodynamics, exercise capacity,&#xD;
      or quality of life assessment. In addition, in these studies mitral regurgitation and left&#xD;
      ventricular size and function was assessed by echocardiography. Echocardiography has known&#xD;
      limitations in assessing ventricular size and, as recent studies have shown, may not be the&#xD;
      optimal modality to assess mitral regurgitant severity. MRI is the gold standard for&#xD;
      non-invasive quantification of the left and right ventricles volumes and function and has&#xD;
      emerged as a reference standard for quantifying mitral regurgitation. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators will perform longitudinal follow-up data with cardiac MRI to inform the&#xD;
      prophylactic surgery vs. close follow-up debate and to better define the natural history of&#xD;
      this condition. The investigators hypothesize, that in the majority of patients mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation will not worsen overtime, left ventricular hemodynamics will remain stable,&#xD;
      exercise capacity will not decline, and symptoms will not worsen during follow-up. This&#xD;
      finding would have a significant impact on the current recommendations for treatment in&#xD;
      patients with mitral regurgitation by supporting a conservative management approach.&#xD;
