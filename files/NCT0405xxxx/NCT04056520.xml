  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to prospectively collect data on subjects having posterior cervical&#xD;
      fusion surgery using the Medtronic Infinity system. Researchers plan to collect information&#xD;
      from patients having this type of surgery in order to learn more about patient how patients&#xD;
      do after the surgery, including the rate of bone healing following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is for 250 patients to take part in the study or for 500 screws to be used,&#xD;
      whichever comes first. Each patient will need a varying amount of screws to be used during&#xD;
      their surgery. Because we are measuring the accuracy of each individual screw and the surgeon&#xD;
      will likely use multiple screws during each surgery, it is likely that the study will reach&#xD;
      its goal of 500 screws before 250 patients are enrolled in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm study of clinical and radiological outcomes as well as&#xD;
      surgical data from posterior cervical fusion for treating degenerative disc disease (DDD).&#xD;
      Patients undergoing posterior cervicothoracic fusions between C2 and upper thoracic will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled up to 250 patients (at maximum) or 500 screws, whichever is&#xD;
      achieved first. This will adequately power the study assuming 95% screw accuracy, which is in&#xD;
      line with published data, and assuming precision of +/- 2% with a confidence level of 9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to show that the Medtronic Infinity System is safe and&#xD;
      effective in posterior cervicothoracic fusion surgeries. Outcomes measures and complication&#xD;
      rates will be compared to historical controls. Secondary objectives include screw accuracy&#xD;
      rates/revision rates which can also be compared to historical controls. Other secondary&#xD;
      objectives aim to clarify the workflow and operative time of using the O-arm and Stealth&#xD;
      navigation for these types of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for adverse events throughout the duration of the study,&#xD;
      particularly at and around the time of standard of care clinical assessments. The number of&#xD;
      CT related adverse events will be evaluated. The monitoring will be performed by the&#xD;
      investigator and study clinical research coordinator. The monitoring will occur both when a&#xD;
      quarter and a half of the study patients have been enrolled. The study will be stopped should&#xD;
      any significant CT related adverse events be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected&#xD;
