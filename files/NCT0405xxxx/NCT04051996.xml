  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the complete remission&#xD;
      (including complete remission with incomplete count recovery) rates of glasdegib in&#xD;
      combination with either decitabine on a 5-day or 10-day schedule in patients with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed poor-risk AML who either refuse or are ineligible for intensive therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this multi-center, randomized phase 2 study is to determine the&#xD;
      response rates, complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery&#xD;
      (CRi), of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two secondary objectives for this study. The first secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the toxicity and safety profiles of glasdegib/DAC5 and glasdegib/DAC10 in patients&#xD;
      with newly-diagnosed PrAML. The other secondary objective is to determine the event-free&#xD;
      survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response,&#xD;
      bone marrow mutational clearance, and remission clonality of glasdegib/DAC5 and&#xD;
      glasdegib/DAC10 in patients with newly-diagnosed PrAML.&#xD;
