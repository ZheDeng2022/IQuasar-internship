      Abstract Title: &quot;Heart-track&quot; cardiac rehabilitation device prototype designed for exercise&#xD;
      training post coronary revascularisation: A usability study Background: Percutaneous Coronary&#xD;
      Intervention (PCI) is a common surgical procedure for heart attack patients. International&#xD;
      guidelines recommend that all patients complete phase two (outpatient) cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      (CR) after PCI, as it plays a critical role in reducing five-year cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      and the risk of cardiovascular-related hospital admission. Patients in our institution have&#xD;
      suboptimal exercise compliance and effectiveness during cardiac rehabilitation. Root cause&#xD;
      analysis identified 'lack of commitment', 'lack of care monitoring and continuity' and 'lack&#xD;
      of motivation and engagement' to be key contributing factors. Yet, healthcare resource&#xD;
      limitations necessitate innovation for care continuity and patient engagement. &quot;Heart-track&quot;,&#xD;
      a novel, app-based innovation was created. By 'game-ifying' cardiac rehabilitative exercise&#xD;
      training program, &quot;Heart-track&quot; guides and tracks cardiac rehabilitation at home at patient's&#xD;
      comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To explore experiences of app usability in terms of content, functionality and&#xD;
      design of the prototype &quot;Heart-track&quot; app to improve user experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twelve community-dwelling adults who are also active member of cardiac rehab support&#xD;
      group, aged above 50, and undergone coronary revascularisation for acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction at least 1 year before were recruited. Participants were introduced to&#xD;
      &quot;Heart-Track&quot; mobile app system and its navigational characteristics with standardised&#xD;
      instructions. Each participant then performed a self-directed Cardiac rehabilitation session&#xD;
      using the app. Participants rated their experience with the hardware and software components&#xD;
      of &quot;Heart Track&quot;, and their acceptance of it as a cardiac rehabilitation tool. Descriptive&#xD;
      analysis of quantitative responses were analysed using IBM SPSS software version 19.0&#xD;
      (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).&#xD;

    <description>Participants rated their experience with the hardware and software components of &quot;Heart Track&quot;, and their acceptance of it as a cardiac rehabilitation tool. The survey form is a likert-scale ( Strongly agree to strongly disagree) survey that asking subjects about their feedback and satisfaction about the Heart Track hardware and software, and overall experience using Heart Track.</description>

    <intervention_name>Heart Track</intervention_name>
    <description>Description of the device: Wearable heart rate sensors are used in Heart-track, and a receiver on a smartphone app. Real-time wireless heart rate data is sent to paired mobile device with a wireless distance of up to 10m. The sensor is able to monitor a heart rate range of 30 to 240 beats per minute.&#xD;
Another component of Heart-track is a &quot;Heart-track&quot; mobile app which captures and reflect real-time heart rate from the heart rate sensor. The mobile app also includes warm-up and cool down exercises that are gamified and supported on a smart-phone running on Android or iOS platforms.&#xD;
The HR sensor will be purchased by our collaborator, Immersive Play Pte Ltd.</description>
