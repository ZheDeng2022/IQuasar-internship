      Nobio has developed dental restorative materials with long term antibacterial properties in&#xD;
      order to fight recurrent decay/caries around restorations. These composites with incorporated&#xD;
      non-leaching antibacterial agents might overcome the vicious circle of newly developed&#xD;
      cavities around freshly placed fillings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will ask lower partial denture wearers to allow them to place a &quot;gap model&quot;&#xD;
      with the Nobio-composite and enamel slab in one denture flange. In the other denture flange a&#xD;
      gap model with a standard composite will be placed as control. In the laboratory the&#xD;
      investigators will test with established methods for demineralization/caries prevention in&#xD;
      the test and control enamel slabs, respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a major issue in dentistry, it has been stated that two-thirds of all restorative&#xD;
      dentistry involves the replacement of failed restorations. Secondary caries indicates a&#xD;
      lesion developing at the margins of an existing restoration and is the major reason for&#xD;
      replacement of amalgam and composite resin restorations in operative dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In research the use of experimental intra-oral caries models dealing with caries prevention&#xD;
      has increased. The most realistic experimental model is the in vivo model that uses living&#xD;
      teeth, followed by the in situ model using specimens with natural surfaces held in the mouth&#xD;
      during the experimental period. In situ models have the potential to study both fundamental&#xD;
      aspects of the caries process as well as more applied research problems in caries prevention&#xD;
      in human subjects without actually causing caries in the natural dentition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To simulate a failed interface between a tooth and a restoration, a gap can be formed between&#xD;
      an enamel slab and the restoration prior to a cariogenic challenge. The &quot;gap-model&quot; will be&#xD;
      inserted for instance into the denture flanges, and the cariogenic challenge occurs inside&#xD;
      the mouth during the wear period..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nobio has developed dental restorative materials with long term antibacterial properties in&#xD;
      order to fight recurrent decay around restorations. These composites with incorporated&#xD;
      non-leaching antibacterial agents might overcome the vicious circle of newly developed&#xD;
      cavities around freshly placed fillings. The ongoing caries activity due to bacteria around&#xD;
      the filling may be interrupted by quaternary ammonium silica dioxide (QASi) particles&#xD;
      incorporated in the test composite at 1.2% (by weight). These particles are members of the&#xD;
      Nobio Antimicrobial Particle (NAP) family (Nobio, Israel). QASi are synthesized to form a&#xD;
      high concentration of antimicrobial groups that are covalently-bound onto a carrier core,&#xD;
      such as silica. The resulting micro or nano-sized QASi particles are mixed with other fillers&#xD;
      of the dental composite material, during manufacturing. Following in situ placement and&#xD;
      light-initiated polymerization, QASi particles are permanently retained in the final dental&#xD;
      restoration. Laboratory studies have shown that the quaternary ammonium silica particles are&#xD;
      potent antibacterial agents, do not leach out in contrast to other antimicrobials or caries&#xD;
      preventive active substances, inhibit the breakdown of the composite, and maintain&#xD;
      antibacterial activity over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an in situ study. Subjects, wearing lower partial dentures with acrylic flanges&#xD;
      on both sides of the mouth will be recruited. On each side of the denture an enamel slab will&#xD;
      be placed next to a composite, separated by a tiny gap. On one side of the denture the&#xD;
      composite will be Nobio's antibacterial composite, on the other side a regular composite (a&#xD;
      Nobio composite w/o particles or another commercial composite will serve as control material.&#xD;
      Enamel slab and composite will be recessed into the flange, allowing microbial plaque to&#xD;
      accumulate on top of it and especially in the gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After wearing the dentures for four weeks with the slabs, decalcification - ΔZ mineral loss -&#xD;
      in the enamel slabs adjacent to the gap will be determined by cross-section microhardness&#xD;
      testing in the laboratory. Average ΔZ mineral loss will be calculated for the Nobio group and&#xD;
      the control group, and difference will be tested for statistical significance.&#xD;

    <description>The mineral loss is determined in the laboratory using cross-sectional microhardness testings of the enamel after the 4-weeks wearing period of the gap-model.&#xD;
The overall relative mineral loss, ΔZ, for each sample is calculated by creating a hardness profile curve by plotting normalized volume percent mineral against distance from the outer enamel surface. The area under the curve that represents ΔZ (µm * vol % mineral) is calculated using Simpson's integration rule.</description>

        <title>Mineral Loss ΔZ</title>
        <description>The mineral loss is determined in the laboratory using cross-sectional microhardness testings of the enamel after the 4-weeks wearing period of the gap-model.&#xD;
The overall relative mineral loss, ΔZ, for each sample is calculated by creating a hardness profile curve by plotting normalized volume percent mineral against distance from the outer enamel surface. The area under the curve that represents ΔZ (µm * vol % mineral) is calculated using Simpson's integration rule.</description>

        <population>From the original 25 subjects data of the first 5 subjects were used for a sample size calculation. The sample size calculation determined data from 17 subjects would be needed. To account for loss due to follow-up issues, we recruited 20 subjects. 1 subject did not follow the instructions (required wearing time), 2 sample/data sets could not be retrieved due to Covid-19 shelter-in-place restrictions. Results of the first 5 were not included due to statisticians concerns for clean statistics.</population>
