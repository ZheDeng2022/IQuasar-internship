    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the single-dose plasma PK of mobocertinib and&#xD;
      its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) in participants with moderate and/or severe HI&#xD;
      compared to matched-healthy participants with normal hepatic function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      29-Apr-2020 Enrollment of new participants into this study was paused due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      situation. The duration of this pause was dependent on the leveling and control of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug being tested in this study is called mobocertinib. The study will assess the PK of&#xD;
      single dose mobocertinib and its active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) in participants&#xD;
      with moderate and/or severe HI compared to matched-healthy participants with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      the following 3 treatment groups in a staggered manner based on their degree of hepatic&#xD;
      impairment which will be determined based on Child-Pugh Score as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate HI (Child-Pugh B): Mobocertinib 40 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe HI (Child-Pugh C): Mobocertinib 40 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal Hepatic Function: Mobocertinib 40 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants with normal hepatic function will be recruited to match both moderate&#xD;
      and severe HI by age (mean plus or minus [+-] 10 years), gender (+-2 participants per&#xD;
      gender), and body mass index (BMI, mean +-10 percent [%]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take single dose of mobocertinib on Day 1. The dose level&#xD;
      for severe HI may be modified based on the previous results of approximately 3 moderate HI&#xD;
      and healthy participants who completed up to Day 10 study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 51 days. Participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      telephone 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
