    <description>The plication was done by the same surgeon either via a 7-8 cm long lateral thoracotomy and entrance to the pleural cavity through the eighth intercostals space on the affected side or using VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) procedure. It was performed under single lumen intubation general anaesthesia. The diaphragm with the abdominal content was pushed caudally till the normal position of the copula achieved. At this position a fold of about 5 cm is made using traction forceps of the reluctant diaphragm. Polypropylene sutures (zero or 1) were used to perform the plication of the diaphragm. in making a fold on itself. The plication was performed using interrupted polypropylene U-stitches; usually, it started from posterior part to the anterior part of the diaphragm. We merged every two rows with continuous polypropylene sutures. The diaphragm became tough and firm and returned to its normal position. An intercostal tube was inserted, and the thoracotomy was closed in layers.</description>
