  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to treatment-related late effects, including&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial morbidities, subsequent malignancies, and premature death. Symptom&#xD;
      assessment provides a unique insight into survivorship care since symptoms not only indicate&#xD;
      the manifestation for the occurrence of chronic health conditions, but also impact quality of&#xD;
      life and survival. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has developed a Patient-Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) to assess&#xD;
      symptomatic adverse events (AEs) for adult-onset cancer patients who are receiving cancer&#xD;
      therapies. However, content-appropriate and clinically validated symptom assessment tools for&#xD;
      adult survivors of childhood cancer are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Object 1: Establish content validity for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1A: Conduct a symptom selection process through qualitative research to&#xD;
      identify symptomatic AEs for adult survivors of childhood cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1B: Create symptomatic AE items for adult survivors of childhood cancer&#xD;
      based on the prevalence and clinical importance ratings on the items&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2: Validate the PRO-CTCAE-SCC using psychometric methods and objective&#xD;
      clinical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2A: Test dimensionality for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2B: Test clinical validity for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2C: Test responsiveness to change for the PRO-CTCAE-SCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 1: Increase clinical usefulness of the PRO-CTCAE-SCC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective 2: Establish meaningful cut-points and minimally important differences&#xD;
      (MIDs) on symptom burden scores for clinical decision-making&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to adapt an existing symptomatic adverse event tool, the Patient-Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), to be content appropriate and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful for adult survivors of childhood cancer using two well-established&#xD;
      childhood cancer survivor cohorts. Psychometric methodologies will be used to validate this&#xD;
      tool by incorporating objective clinical anchors collected from medical evaluations. Our&#xD;
      symptomatic AE tool has the potential to augment the Children Oncology Group Survivorship&#xD;
      Care Guidelines by implementing risk-based symptom screening to track and anticipate adverse&#xD;
      health events.&#xD;
