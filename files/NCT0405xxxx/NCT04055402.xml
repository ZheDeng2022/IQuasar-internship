  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposed study has 3 primary objectives to address the knowledge gap regarding&#xD;
      the exposure to alcohol advertisements in university students: (1) To estimate the frequency&#xD;
      of exposure to alcohol advertisements and promotion of alcohol drinking culture (PADC) via&#xD;
      television, print, radio, posters, banners, billboards, point-of-sale websites and social&#xD;
      media in university students, (2) To examine the effect of exposure to alcohol advertising&#xD;
      and PADC on alcohol use, binge drinking, pro-drinking attitudes and acceptance of alcohol&#xD;
      advertisements, and (3) To examine the discrepancy in measuring the exposure to alcohol&#xD;
      advertisements and PADC between the ecological momentary assessment and a traditional&#xD;
      retrospective survey.The proposed study is a combination of (1) a time-based system-triggered&#xD;
      EMA, which will collect real-time exposure to alcohol advertisements and (2) longitudinal&#xD;
      surveys involving university students who are current alcohol users. Consented participants&#xD;
      will be individually randomized to the EMA and non-EMA group. The EMA group will complete a&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire, and complete 4 EMAs prompted randomly and 1 end-of-day survey with a&#xD;
      smartphone app per day over a week. After 2 weeks of completing the EMA, they will be&#xD;
      contacted to complete a telephone follow-up survey. The non-EMA group will only complete the&#xD;
      baseline and the follow-up surveys.&#xD;

      1. Study design The proposed project is a combination of (1) a time-based system-triggered&#xD;
           EMA, which will collect real-time exposure to alcohol advertisements and PADC, and (2)&#xD;
           longitudinal surveys involving university students who are current alcohol users.&#xD;
           Consented participants will be individually randomized to 2 groups - the EMA and non-EMA&#xD;
           group. The EMA group will first complete a baseline questionnaire, followed by 5&#xD;
           regularly prompted EMA surveys via a smartphone application (App) every day for 14&#xD;
           consecutive days. The EMA includes questions of the self-reported exposure to and /or&#xD;
           responses to alcohol advertising PADC. 2 weeks after the completion of the EMA, they&#xD;
           will be contacted to complete a telephone follow-up survey. The non-EMA group will only&#xD;
           complete the baseline and the follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects The study targets to recruit 100 students (EMA: 50; non-EMA: 50) who are Hong&#xD;
           Kong residents and are studying in undergraduate or postgraduate programmes in any Hong&#xD;
           Kong tertiary institutions. Other inclusion criteria will include (1) aged between 18&#xD;
           and 35 years, (2) using a mobile smartphone with internet access, (3) drank any alcohol&#xD;
           in past 30 days (current drinkers), (4) he/she will stay in Hong Kong during the 2-week&#xD;
           EMA study period, and (5) able to read and write in Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedures A mass email containing the study information will be sent to all&#xD;
           undergraduate and postgraduate HKU students for recruitment. Also, subject recruitment&#xD;
           ad will be posted in different online discussion boards. Voluntary participants can&#xD;
           directly contact our recruitment staff via telephone, email or submission of online&#xD;
           application form. The staff will assess the participants' eligibility by telephone. The&#xD;
           staff will then randomise the eligible participants into either the EMA or non-EMA group&#xD;
           and deliver consent forms to the participants face-to-face before conducting the&#xD;
           baseline survey. Sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelope (SNOSE) will be used for&#xD;
           the random allocation. All participants will be invited to join a briefing session where&#xD;
           the staff will administer the baseline survey. The staff will help the participants in&#xD;
           the EMA group to install and set up the EMA App. The briefing will also emphasise the&#xD;
           role of EMA participants that they should perform their normal activities as usual&#xD;
           instead of finding out the alcohol advertisements and PADC intentionally. Within 2 weeks&#xD;
           after completing the baseline survey, participants in EMA group will complete 5 EMAs&#xD;
           prompted regularly every day for 14 consecutive days. The participants will then be&#xD;
           contacted for a follow-up survey 2 weeks after the completion of EMA. Participants in&#xD;
           non-EMA group will only complete a baseline questionnaire and a follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incentives for participants The EMA validity largely relies on the participants'&#xD;
           compliance, therefore an attractive incentive is needed. All participants will be given&#xD;
           a HK$100 gift voucher upon the completion of the baseline survey and 2-week follow-up&#xD;
           survey. In addition, participants in EMA group will accumulate HK$15 gift voucher for&#xD;
           completing 3 EMA surveys within each day in their account. If they complete all EMA&#xD;
           surveys within a day, they can further accumulate HK$10 gift voucher. EMA participants&#xD;
           who have successfully completed all EMAs in the 14-day period will be given additional&#xD;
           $50 gift voucher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EMA app An EMA App will be developed to administer the regular prompts automatically. To&#xD;
           protect the privacy of the participants, no personal information (e.g. names and&#xD;
           telephone numbers) will be collected by the App. Only a 5-digit case number will be used&#xD;
           for identification. Unless otherwise specified, the case number will be the last 5&#xD;
           digits of subject's phone number. Once the App is successfully installed, the user will&#xD;
           be asked to choose a start date for the 14 consecutive days study period within the&#xD;
           coming 2 weeks and set up awake time from 9:00am to 12:00nn in these study days to&#xD;
           undertake the regularly-prompting EMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On each study day, the App will regularly prompt the participants to complete a&#xD;
           questionnaire about their recent exposure to alcohol advertisements and PADC every 3&#xD;
           hours for 5 times. For example, if a participant sets the awake time to 9:00am, he will&#xD;
           be asked to complete an EMA survey at 9:00am, 12:00nn, 3:00pm, 6:00pm and 9:00pm for the&#xD;
           study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each EMA survey will take about 1 minute to complete. If the user cannot respond to the&#xD;
           EMA survey prompt immediately, he/she could choose to postpone the prompt for 5 minutes&#xD;
           / 30 minutes. The EMA prompt will be re-generated to remind the user again. Each prompts&#xD;
           not responded for 3 mins, or postponed more than once will be regarded as non-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All the above data, including the date and time of completing the EMA survey and&#xD;
           responses to the prompts will be sent to our server immediately. Participants can check&#xD;
           their progress and record about their EMA surveys completion status and the amount of&#xD;
           rewarded gift voucher in the EMA App.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Questionnaire design&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline questionnaire There are 4 parts in the baseline questionnaire to&#xD;
                investigate the participants' drinking history, their awareness of alcohol&#xD;
                advertising and PADC, and their attitude towards alcohol drinking culture, alcohol&#xD;
                advertisements and alcohol advertising and marketing policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Part 1 - Participants' history of alcohol consumption during the past year The&#xD;
                Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) published by the World Health&#xD;
                Organisation (WHO) will be taken as a reference to understand participants' history&#xD;
                of hazard and harmful alcohol consumption, especially in excessive alcohol intake&#xD;
                during the past year. The test consists of 3 stages, namely &quot;Hazardous Alcohol&#xD;
                Use&quot;, &quot;Dependence Symptoms&quot; and &quot;Harmful Alcohol Use&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In the 1st stage, questions will be involving the frequency of drinking, typical&#xD;
                quantity of drinking, and frequency of heavy drinking (&gt;60 grams of pure alcohol&#xD;
                intake on one occasion) to identify any sign of hazardous alcohol consumption.&#xD;
                During the 2nd stage, subject's experience in impaired control over drinking,&#xD;
                increased salience of drinking and morning drinking will be asked to evaluate&#xD;
                subject's alcohol dependence. At the 3rd stage, subject's history of harmful&#xD;
                alcohol use, including guilt after drinking, blackouts, alcohol-related injuries&#xD;
                and others concerned about drinking will be asked. A final score based on the&#xD;
                answers can be computed and be used to classify the subject into &quot;Low-risk&quot;,&#xD;
                &quot;Risky&quot;, &quot;Harmful&quot;, and &quot;Almost certainly dependent&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Part 2 - Participants' current drinking habit and involvement in PADC events&#xD;
                Subject's current drinking habit in the past month will be asked in details,&#xD;
                including types of alcohol beverage consumed, frequency of unplanned drinking and&#xD;
                participations of events promoting drinking culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Furthermore, the locations and activities where the subject has drunk any alcohol&#xD;
                will be asked. Options for location include: accommodation, restaurant, campus,&#xD;
                bar, public area, transportation, and rural outdoor areas. Whereas options for&#xD;
                activities include: family meal gathering, business, university societies' event,&#xD;
                high-table dinner, spectating sports/race, celebrating festivals.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In addition, experiences associated with passive and forced drinking will be asked,&#xD;
                including negative influence by surrounding drinkers and situation where the&#xD;
                subject had experienced forced drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Part 3 - Participants' awareness of alcohol advertising and PADC To evaluate&#xD;
                subjects' exposure to alcohol advertisements and PADC, we first separate the&#xD;
                channel to traditional media (TV/ radio/ newspaper/ magazine), internet (website/&#xD;
                social media/ video platforms/ mobile applications) and other physical locations&#xD;
                (outdoor billboard/ restaurant/ supermarket/ shopping mall/ concert/ sports event).&#xD;
                After that, subjects' average daily view counts via the corresponding channel&#xD;
                during the past week will be asked and a total view count will be computed for&#xD;
                further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Part 4 - Participants' attitude towards alcohol consumption, drinking culture,&#xD;
                alcohol advertisements, and alcohol related policy Subjects will be asked to rate&#xD;
                their extent of agreement (from 1: strongly disagree to 5: strongly agree) with&#xD;
                various views on alcohol drinking, such as its impact on social relationships,&#xD;
                relaxation, personal popularity, and potential health benefits and risks.&#xD;
                Subsequent questions will cover subject's view on drinking-culture promoting&#xD;
                events/ festivals, effect of ads on subjects' drinking behaviour, followed by&#xD;
                subject's view on advertisement of alcoholic products featuring food/ sports/&#xD;
                music, and subject's view on banning alcohol advertisements and PADC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. EMA Surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
                In each EMA prompt, participants will be asked if they have seen any alcohol&#xD;
                advertisements and PADC in the past 3 hours (except for the first EMA survey of the&#xD;
                day, which asks about the period starting from the last EMA on the previous day&#xD;
                rather than the past 3 hours). Based on the reported number of advertisement(s) and&#xD;
                PADC, they have to indicate where the advertisement and/or PADC has appeared, such&#xD;
                as via television, prints, radio, social media, webpage, public area etc. In each&#xD;
                reported exposure, participants will be asked what type of alcoholic drink has been&#xD;
                advertised, with options &quot;Beer&quot;, &quot;Wine&quot;, &quot;Liquor/ Spirit&quot;, &quot;Chinese spirit&quot;,&#xD;
                &quot;Cocktail&quot;, &quot;Japanese Sake&quot;, &quot;Alcopop&quot;, and &quot;Others&quot;. Then, they will be asked 7&#xD;
                follow-up questions to assess his/her appraisals on the advertisement(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The main actor/actress in the alcohol ads are attractive,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The ad is innovative,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. I love the ad&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. The ads effectively appealed me to purchase the advertised product(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. The ads effectively appealed me to join the PADC event(s), and&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. I want to drink alcohol after watching the ads.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. I want to purchase alcohol after watching the ads&#xD;
&#xD;
                In each statement, participants will be asked to rate his/her agreement from &quot;1&#xD;
                (strongly disagree)&quot; to &quot;5 (strongly agree)&quot;. Questions (1) to (3) will be asked&#xD;
                for each advertisement the subject has seen. Questions (4) to (10) will be asked&#xD;
                only once on each EMA day as an overall assessment for the subjects' response to&#xD;
                these exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Participants will also be prompted to report the amount and type of alcohol&#xD;
                consumed in the past 3 hours, with options &quot;Beer&quot;, &quot;Wine&quot;, &quot;Liquor/ Spirit&quot;,&#xD;
                &quot;Chinese spirit&quot;, &quot;Cocktail&quot;, &quot;Japanese Sake&quot;, &quot;Alcopop&quot; and &quot;Others&quot;, whether they&#xD;
                have purchased any alcohol and/or participated in any activities about promoting&#xD;
                alcohol drinking culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In addition to the system-triggered EMAs, participants can take photographs of the&#xD;
                alcohol advertisements they have seen anytime and upload them via the EMA App.&#xD;
                These photographs will be used for a content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Follow-up questionnaire The questions in the follow-up survey will be very similar&#xD;
                to the baseline questionnaire, but mainly focusing on exposure to alcohol ads and&#xD;
                PADC for the sake of comparison between the EMA group and non-EMA group. In&#xD;
                addition, a section is added for participants to express their satisfaction or&#xD;
                dissatisfaction regarding different aspect of the study, including the baseline&#xD;
                survey, mobile application, EMA surveys, follow-up survey and the overall rating of&#xD;
                the study. The user feedback will be used to improve the user experiences and&#xD;
                effectiveness of similar research projects in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics about the exposure to the alcohol&#xD;
           advertisements/ PADC will be computed. Multiple comparison of Pearson and Spearman&#xD;
           correlation coefficient with Bonferroni correction will serve as a preliminary measure&#xD;
           of consistency of individual participant's responses on baseline, EMA (if applicable)&#xD;
           and follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All daily observations are nested within each participant. We will examine the relationship&#xD;
      between number of daily exposure and the binary alcohol consumption/ binge drinking (any&#xD;
      alcohol consumption/ binge drinking during that day) with logistic regression model and&#xD;
      generalised estimation equation model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the participant-level analysis, the reported weekly exposure count will be regressed on&#xD;
      age, gender, programme enrolled and AUDIT test score with zero-inflated negative binomial&#xD;
      regression model. This regression model is preferred over the Poisson regression model&#xD;
      because some participants will have zero exposure for a period of time and there may be&#xD;
      over-dispersion of the count outcomes (i.e. when variance is greater than the mean). While&#xD;
      the association between exposure and other attitude subscales in the baseline survey will be&#xD;
      analysed with ordered logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective recall of exposure to alcohol advertisements assessed at the follow-up&#xD;
      survey between the EMA and non-EMA groups will be compared using t-test if the count data&#xD;
      distribution does not significantly deviate from normal distribution, otherwise Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U test will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test for effect of EMA on exposure count, within the EMA group, we will compare&#xD;
      the reported weekly exposure in baseline, EMA and the follow-up survey, repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA or Friedman test will be applied, depending on whether the normality assumption has&#xD;
      been met. Post hoc test such as paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will then be&#xD;
      applied to discover whether the EMA effect on exposure is positive compared to baseline/&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
