      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women and in Sweden about 9700 women are&#xD;
      affected each year.Therefore, it is of great importance to promote the rehabilitation process&#xD;
      by minimizing unnecessary symptoms and complications that may arise during a breast cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Surgery is the primary cure for breast cancer and about 40% need to undergo a&#xD;
      major surgical procedur and major operations also involve an increased risk of complications&#xD;
      and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is the most common reported symptom in women who are operated on for breast cancer other&#xD;
      complications after surgery that may occur are seroma, wound infektions and swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No published evidence exists for the benefit and effect in pain relief from wearing a bra as&#xD;
      a support after breast surgery is available, therefore it is important to evaluate useful and&#xD;
      simple methods that the patient can manage herself that can minimize the experience of pain&#xD;
      and other symptom after breast cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Karolinska University Hospital's breast cancer center, women who undergo breast surgery&#xD;
      are offered a bra after surgery in order to provide good support for the patient to feel&#xD;
      safe, comfortable and minimize complications and symptoms such as pain. Two different types&#xD;
      of bra are used and, according to the clinical staff at Karolinska's breast cancer center&#xD;
      clinical experience, there is disagreement about which type of bra gives the optimal effect&#xD;
      in different surgical procedures to reduce symptoms and post-operative complications. Neither&#xD;
      is there enough knowledge about and how women experience comfort from the bra they received&#xD;
      from the healthcare, which is important as the bra should be used large parts of the day for&#xD;
      about 3 weeks after the procedure. Lack of knowledge makes it difficult to provide&#xD;
      person-centered care for each individual. The purpose of this study is to compare two&#xD;
      different types of bra after breast cancer surgery and to evaluate whether a particular type&#xD;
      of bra affects the perception of pain, other symptoms, the occurrence of complications and&#xD;
      experiences of bra comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare two different types of postoperative-bra after breast cancer surgery and to&#xD;
      evaluate how a particular type of bra affects the perception of pain, other symptoms, the&#xD;
      occurrence of complications and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the presence of pain. Secondary outcome measures are, other&#xD;
      symptoms, seroma, wound complications, and the patient's experience of satisfaction with&#xD;
      support and comfort when using their postoperative bra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled trial aimed to comparing two groups of women undergoing breast cancer&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will take place at the Breast Center, Karolinska University Hospital in&#xD;
      Solna, where approximately 500 breast cancer operations are performed every year. The women&#xD;
      will be identified by the nurse or doctor at the MDT conference. The identified women will be&#xD;
      asked about the participation of the nurse / doctor at the new visit to the surgeon's&#xD;
      reception and bring written information home with them about the study. A few days after the&#xD;
      new visit, the woman is called by a researcher or nurse for further oral information and the&#xD;
      women who wish to participate will be given written informed consent. After this, baseline&#xD;
      measurement and randomization are performed to one of two groups. Evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed on two occasions, prior to surgery (baseline for pain and other symptoms,&#xD;
      demographic issues) and 3 weeks after surgery (pain, symptoms, clinical assessment of the&#xD;
      breast). Demographic (age, education, etc.) and medical information (weight, BMI, illness&#xD;
      history, smoking, alcohol habits and physical activity, etc.) as well as the type of surgical&#xD;
      procedure and drain are collected through medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women from 18 years of age with malignant tumor of the breast gland to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men with breast cancer. Women with benign tumors or women with health factors where the&#xD;
      assessment is that Bra use from healthcare is not necessary or possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be instructed to use the bra according to. Instruction and adherence to&#xD;
      intervention will be via diary pages where the participant for 3 weeks briefly fills in&#xD;
      (number of days) and how often (number of hours / day) you have used the bra you received&#xD;
      from the health care. Primary outcome measure is; pain, secondary outcome measures are,&#xD;
      presence of seroma, symptoms after breast surgery mainly swelling, redness, and satisfaction&#xD;
      with the use of bra focusing on comfort and support. Instruments for self-estimated outcome&#xD;
      measures that will be used are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the perception of pain comes the estimation instrument VAS (visual analogue&#xD;
           scale). VAS is a 10 cm long horizontal line where on one side measures &quot;no pain&quot; and on&#xD;
           the other &quot;worst possible pain&quot; and the patient places a mark on the line corresponding&#xD;
           to the perceived pain .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure chest symptoms, EORCT QLQ-BR 23 will be used. BR 23 is a questionnaire that&#xD;
           measures common symptoms of breast cancer disease and treatment (eg you have had&#xD;
           difficulty lifting or moving your arm, have you had pain around your breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of wound complications, seroma and other symptoms reported by the patient&#xD;
           (swelling, redness) will be assessed by clinical assessment of the nurse and medical&#xD;
           record. E.g. Seroma will be assessed on the basis of a template based on the number of&#xD;
           drops and the amount / ml of dropped liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine how participants experience the convenience, comfort, and support of the&#xD;
      postoperative bra they used in the study, participants will answer study-specific questions&#xD;
      (open and closed) regarding patient experience (patient satisfaction) regarding BRA use that&#xD;
      relates to comfort, support and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized into one of two groups. Group 1) is offered the more stable bra&#xD;
      with some compression after breast cancer surgery, while Group 2) is offered a softer bra&#xD;
      without compression. Participants are encouraged to use the bra according to instructions and&#xD;
      record the number of hours / days for use in a diary. When returning to a nurse / doctor&#xD;
      after about 3 weeks of use, all participants respond to survey questions about pain, other&#xD;
      symptoms and experience of support and comfort during use, and undergo a clinical assessment&#xD;
      of the nurse according to a template with respect to seroma, number of taps, quantity and&#xD;
      occurrence of complications (eg wound infection). Compliance with intervention takes place&#xD;
      trough a simple diary which participants fill in for 3 weeks eg. how long (number of days)&#xD;
      and often (number of hours / day) have you used the bra you received from the healthcare&#xD;
      system, as well as grading daily pain according to the VAS- scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there are differences between 2 groups with respect to the variable pain as&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure, a sample size of 80 women per group is calculated to be&#xD;
      necessary with a power of 0.80 percent and a significance level of &lt;0.05. Given that subgroup&#xD;
      analyzes (about 5 groups - mastectomy +- SN, mastectomy +- axillary, sector + - SN, sector +-&#xD;
      axillary and primary reconstruction) will be done and a planned 10% drop-out, 100 women per&#xD;
      group will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be processed using relevant statistical parametric methods for&#xD;
      normally distributed data and non-parametric methods for non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
      Analyzes will investigate differences between groups as well as within the group (ANOVA) as&#xD;
      well as analyzes for the relationship between different parameters (eg type of bra and&#xD;
      surgical procedure). Demographic baseline data is reported as descriptive statistics (SD,&#xD;
      mean, frequency). Statistics will be used for support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current research project will follow the basic ethical principles that include the&#xD;
      information requirement, the consent requirement, the confidentiality requirement and the use&#xD;
      requirement . Involved persons in the team for the BH study all have long experience of&#xD;
      meeting people with cancer diagnosis. Close ethical discussion with expertise in the research&#xD;
      group on the routines that exist today for bra use after surgery and in randomization so as&#xD;
      not to cause or risk injury to the woman. All participants will; receive oral and written&#xD;
      information about the study, have the opportunity to ask questions via telephone or mail&#xD;
      during the entire study period (the information requirement). Participants will be informed&#xD;
      that participation is completely voluntary and that there is no disadvantage if participation&#xD;
      is canceled (the consent requirement). Personal data will be de-identified and handled in&#xD;
      accordance with statutes to minimize the identity of the participants for unauthorized&#xD;
      persons in the reporting of results (the confidentiality requirement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will only be used for research purposes (the use requirement).&#xD;
