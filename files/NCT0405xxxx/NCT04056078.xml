  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a part of the Olympic program and with 150 countries in the international Handball&#xD;
      Federation team handball has become a worldwide popular sport. Unfortunately, a large number&#xD;
      of different types injuries have been reported among team handball players, and shoulder pain&#xD;
      has some of the biggest incidence. In handball 44-75% of the athletes had a history of&#xD;
      shoulder pain and a weekly prevalence of shoulder problems in 28% of the athletes. Shoulder&#xD;
      pain has been reported to have an impact on the athletes' training activities, performance,&#xD;
      and daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have established risk factors for shoulder injuries among overhead athletes,&#xD;
      with a focus on the range of motion in glenohumeral joint (ROM), shoulder strength and&#xD;
      scapula control. Injury occurrence results from a combination of possessing these different&#xD;
      risk and the amount of throwing. Thereby training overhead sports must be considered a&#xD;
      primary risk factor for shoulder injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, several studies have performed kinematics analysis of different throws techniques&#xD;
      commonly used in team handball. But no studies havn't investigated kinematics and kinetics of&#xD;
      different throwing techniques in relation to team handball players and the development of&#xD;
      shoulder pain, and if a throwing technique or a wrong throwing technique stresses the&#xD;
      shoulder joint more than other throwing techniques. In baseball it was found that youth&#xD;
      pitchers throwing with a curveball was associated with a 52% increased risk of shoulder pain&#xD;
      and the slider was associated with an 86% increased risk of elbow pain, and there was a&#xD;
      significant association between number of throws and rate of shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two types of wind-ups are used in handball, and those different wind-ups also changed the&#xD;
      throwing kinematics and throwing performance. Investigators found that the pelvis rotation&#xD;
      was more important in the throw with the circular wind-up than in the whip-like wind up. In&#xD;
      addition, the total throwing time was longer with the circular wind up. This could result in&#xD;
      less stress and forces on the shoulder joint when compared with the whip like to reach the&#xD;
      same performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions arises whether the used throwing techniques of the handball players during&#xD;
      training and matches are a risk factor for shoulder pain and if some throwing techniques&#xD;
      cause bigger risk than other throwing techniques as the players could put more force on the&#xD;
      shoulder and elbow joint.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For a trainer or a coach in sports, it is very important to know what determines performance&#xD;
      and how to affect the performance by training. However, training can also cause injuries by&#xD;
      using wrong techniques or too much overload. One of those injuries in handball (one of the&#xD;
      biggest sports in Scandinavia) is shoulder pain. Besides handball, shoulder pain and injury&#xD;
      is reported to be a large problem in athletes in other overhead sports such as baseball,&#xD;
      javelin, tennis, badminton, volleyball. In handball 44-75% of the athletes had a history of&#xD;
      shoulder pain and a weekly prevalence of shoulder problems in 28% of the athletes. While in&#xD;
      baseball half of the youth baseball pitchers prevalence shoulder pain during the season.&#xD;
      Shoulder pain has been reported to have an impact on the athletes' training activities,&#xD;
      performance, and daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have investigated risk factors for shoulder injuries among overhead athletes,&#xD;
      with particular focus on glenohumeral joint range of motion (ROM) and shoulder strength. and&#xD;
      scapular control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In handball it was found that reduced glenohumeral internal rotation and excessive&#xD;
      glenohumeral external rotation have been suggested as risk factors and that a reduction of&#xD;
      total glenohumeral rotation has been associated with shoulder problems. Regarding rotator&#xD;
      cuff strength, external rotation weakness and low ratios of concentric and eccentric external&#xD;
      to internal rotation strength have been reported as risk factors in handball and baseball. In&#xD;
      addition, weakness in glenohumeral abduction strength has been associated with shoulder&#xD;
      injury in baseball. However, in a recent study of van Cingel the glenohumeral internal range&#xD;
      of motion deficit and total range of motion deficit in elite female handball players seemed&#xD;
      not to be risk factors for shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, sports injury research needs to move from simple analyses of risk factors and&#xD;
      concentrate on how these factors interact among other determinants for injury. Athletes in&#xD;
      overhead sports require a subtle balance of shoulder stability and mobility in order to meet&#xD;
      the functional demands of their respective sport. It has been reported that altered shoulder&#xD;
      mobility in these athletes is caused by adaptive structural changes to the joint because of&#xD;
      the extreme physiological demands of the overhead activity. Nonetheless, it is not known if&#xD;
      these possible changes that are necessary for high performance also cause injuries. Injury&#xD;
      occurrence results from a combination of possessing these different risk factors and&#xD;
      participating with these risk factors. Mostly it is a combination of possessing these risk&#xD;
      factors and the amount of throwing that causes injuries. Thereby training overhead sports&#xD;
      must be considered a primary risk factor for shoulder injury, while non-participation-related&#xD;
      risk factors like strength, glenohumeral ROM and scapular control influence the amount of&#xD;
      handball participation a player can tolerate before shoulder injury occurs. Møller showed in&#xD;
      a 31-week cohort study of elite youth handball players that an increase in handball load by&#xD;
      &gt;60% was associated with greater shoulder injury rate. Furthermore, the effect of an increase&#xD;
      in handball load between 20% and 60% was worsened among players with reduced external&#xD;
      rotational strength or scapular dyskinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of the above mentioned studies investigated kinematics of throwing, which&#xD;
      perhaps could be the most important risk factor for shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A throwing technique or a wrong throwing technique that stresses the shoulder joint than&#xD;
      other throwing techniques. In baseball it was found in youth pitchers that throwing with a&#xD;
      curveball was associated with a 52% increased risk of shoulder pain and the slider was&#xD;
      associated with an 86% increased risk of elbow pain. There was a significant association&#xD;
      between the number of pitches thrown in a game and during the season and the rate of elbow&#xD;
      pain and shoulder pain. The investigators concluded that pitchers in this age group should be&#xD;
      cautioned about throwing breaking pitches (curveballs and sliders) because of the increased&#xD;
      risk of elbow and shoulder pain and that a limitation on pitches thrown in a game and in a&#xD;
      season can reduce the risk of pain. In another study showed other risk factors like decreased&#xD;
      satisfaction, arm fatigue during the game pitched, throwing more than 75 pitches in a game,&#xD;
      and throwing fewer than 300 pitches during the season.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In handball, it is difficult to count all throws during training and matches. However, it is&#xD;
      possible to perform kinetic and kinematic and neuromuscular analysis of these types of&#xD;
      throws. Several studies have performed kinematics analysis of different throws in handball.&#xD;
      In these studies kinematics of different types of throws like standing, with run up and jump&#xD;
      throws, which are the three commonly used types of throws in team handball were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was shown that the elbow extension and internal rotation movement starting from a maximal&#xD;
      external rotation angle is one of the main contributors in overarm throwing in team handball.&#xD;
      Furthermore it was thought that hypermobility (increased maximal external rotation angle) in&#xD;
      the overhead athletes to allow larger arm cocking might have a positive effect on ball&#xD;
      velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, this mobility of the overhead athletes is often tested by active and passive range of&#xD;
      motion tests conducted by physical therapists. In these tests the maximal glenohumeral&#xD;
      internal and external rotation angle is measured and used as a measurement of shoulder&#xD;
      mobility. Furthermore, the range of motion of the glenohumeral joint is compared with a&#xD;
      normal population or with the non-dominant arm. In addition, most studies that conducted&#xD;
      these types of measurements were performed in baseball and tennis. As described earlier&#xD;
      changes in the range of motion measured during these tests were identified as risk factors.&#xD;
      Still, none of these studies have investigated whether the measured range of motion of the&#xD;
      external rotation also influences the actual throwing kinematics. Only one study reported in&#xD;
      baseball players that there was a correlation between passive range of motion of external&#xD;
      rotation and the maximal external rotation angle during pitching. On the other hand, in&#xD;
      handball a study did not find any correlation between these ROM tests and throwing kinematics&#xD;
      or performance in elite team handball throwers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questions arises whether the used throwing techniques of the handball players during&#xD;
      training and matches are a risk factor for shoulder pain and if some throwing techniques&#xD;
      cause bigger risk than other throwing techniques as it could put more force on the shoulder&#xD;
      and elbow joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study identified that all used handball throws can be divided by their wind-up: a circular&#xD;
      or whip-like wind up and that these different wind up cause different important changes in&#xD;
      the throwing kinematics and throwing performance. The investigators found that the pelvis&#xD;
      rotation was more important in the throw with the circular wind-up than in the whip-like wind&#xD;
      up. In addition, the total throwing time was longer with the circular wind up. This could&#xD;
      result in less stress and forces on the shoulder joint when compared with the whip like to&#xD;
      reach the same performances. However, only standing throws were investigated and no kinetic&#xD;
      analysis (inverse dynamics) were performed that could show how much force there occurs upon&#xD;
      the shoulder joint during different throws. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, also&#xD;
      no neuromuscular investigations of the muscles used during the different handball throwing&#xD;
      techniques are performed to give more insight about the muscle use during handball throws&#xD;
      that produce the different joint movements and have to manage the kinetics on the shoulder&#xD;
      joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following research questions are expected answered during this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do the three most used techniques in team handball (standing, with run-up and jump&#xD;
           throws), with different wind-ups (circular and whip-like) influence the kinematics, the&#xD;
           neuromuscular coordination and kinetics in the shoulder joint (anterior and posterior&#xD;
           peak force)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do previous shoulder injury/pain, current injury/pain or post- shoulder operation&#xD;
           influence on the throwing biomechanics and neuromuscular coordination compared with&#xD;
           handball players playing without pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do shoulder strength, stability and trunk mobility influence throwing kinematics and&#xD;
           kinetics?&#xD;
