  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous study reported that propofol binded to glutamate receptors in the hypothalamus and&#xD;
      inhibits AVP release mediated by endogenous γ-aminobutyric acid, as well as directly inhibits&#xD;
      the regulated calcium currents leading to normal neuronal depolarization and AVP release.&#xD;
      However, there is no clinical data demonstrating the mechanism of propofol can induce&#xD;
      transient DI by inhibiting the release of AVP from the hypothalamus when applied to humans.&#xD;
      Remifentanil, binding to the μ-receptor or partly κ-receptor, have been used in total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia combined with propofol, also reported inhibiting AVP relaese in both&#xD;
      the hypothalamus (κ receptor mediator mechanism) and posterior pituitary (μ receptor mediator&#xD;
      mechanism). However, the effects of anesthetics on water homeostasis during surgery have been&#xD;
      not well established. Therefore, we aim to investigate the changes of intraoperative water&#xD;
      homeostasis, and related hormones and osmolality in patients with propofol based total&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia due to neuromonitoring for spine surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      &quot;All patients will get the total intravenous anesthesia with propofol-remifentanil via an&#xD;
      effective site-controlled infusion (TCI). For this, TCI continuous infusion pump will be used&#xD;
      with Schnider pharmacokinetic model for propofol and Minto pharmacokinetic model for&#xD;
      remifentanil. Propofol and remifentanil will be initiated with target effective site&#xD;
      concentrations of 3 μg.ml-1 and 3 ng.ml-1, respectively, and controll these concentrations&#xD;
      considering patient's consciousness loss and vital signs. And then 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium for&#xD;
      muscle relaxation will be administered for intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with BIS&#xD;
      level 40-60 and vital signs will not be more than 20% of the baseline or less. In order to&#xD;
      prevent the sudden movement of the patient during surgery, rocuronium will be infused&#xD;
      continuously about 50% of TOF until the end of intraoperative neuromonitoring.&#xD;
