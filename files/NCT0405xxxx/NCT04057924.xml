  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to describe and evaluate the rate of spontaneous regression of CIN2 at 2&#xD;
      year of follow up in women between 18 and 39 year old. This follow-up is proposed as an&#xD;
      alternative to the treatment of reference (conization) with a possible extension to 4 years&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The INCa recommendations of December 2016 propose the destruction or abstention-monitoring of&#xD;
      high-grade histological cervical lesions (HSIL) as an alternative to conization under certain&#xD;
      conditions. These are women under 30 years old, with a small lesion in colposcopy, without&#xD;
      any sign of invasion, with a squamocolumnar junction seen. These women must accept the&#xD;
      principle of regular monitoring by cytology and colposcopy +/- biopsy every 6 months for a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 years. HSIL group 2 histological entities CIN2 and CIN3. It is recognized that&#xD;
      CIN2 are associated with CIN1 and CIN3 biology whose diagnosis is the result of the&#xD;
      subjectivity of colposcopy allowing cervical biopsy and the variability of pathological&#xD;
      interpretation due to poor reproducibility of histological diagnosis. CIN2 regress&#xD;
      spontaneously in more than 50% of cases at 1 year, either completely (no lesion) or partially&#xD;
      (LSIL low grade lesions). No invasive lesions are diagnosed over 2-year observation periods.&#xD;
      Among the clinical, pathological and virological criteria, only the initial HPV genotyping&#xD;
      seems to have a prognostic influence. There is therefore no strong scientific argument for&#xD;
      routine conization in a woman over 30 years of age with a CIN2 lesion extended over more than&#xD;
      two quadrants. In addition, conization is associated with an obstetrical risk (prematurity)&#xD;
      and post-therapeutic colposcopic cervical stenosis complicates subsequent monitoring in case&#xD;
      of abnormal smears. These considerations encourage the extension of the indications of&#xD;
      abstention monitoring in the management of women with CIN2 wishing to procreate with an&#xD;
      extension of the age to 39 year old, with no limit of size of the lesion and to satisfactory&#xD;
      colposcopy&#xD;
