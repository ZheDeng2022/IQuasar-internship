  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled into this double-blind, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      for the Deferoxamine Intradermal Delivery Patch (DIDP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects who pass Screening will enter into the 2-week Standard of Care (SOC) Run-In&#xD;
      period. During this time, ulcers will be assessed to check healing based on digital&#xD;
      planimetry, and qualitative features of the ulcer. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at&#xD;
      the end of the 2-week Run-in Period will be randomized into active and control groups (2&#xD;
      active to 1 placebo) and enter the 12-week Treatment Period. At each visit during the&#xD;
      Treatment Period, the target ulcer will be measured by digital photographic planimetry, the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator will assess the wound qualitative attributes, and the DIDP (or placebo&#xD;
      patch) will be placed as the primary wound dressing. At each visit the subject will also&#xD;
      receive/review a daily diary to document pain , study drug compliance, and analgesic use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled to allow for up to 48 male or female subjects with&#xD;
      SCD and cutaneous ulcers to complete this double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sentinel group of 3 subjects will be enrolled and evaluated for safety (while still&#xD;
      blinded). The remaining subjects will be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio, active:placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those subjects who pass Screening will enter into the Standard of Care (SOC) Run-In period.&#xD;
      During this time, ulcers will be assessed to check healing based on digital planimetry, and&#xD;
      qualitative features of the ulcer. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at the end of the&#xD;
      Run-in Period will be randomized and enter the 12-week Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DIDP (or placebo) will be replaced daily at home. The subject will visit the clinic on an&#xD;
      approximately weekly basis for study assessments, to include imaging and planimetric wound&#xD;
      measurements and qualitative wound assessments. Clinical laboratory samples will be collected&#xD;
      at Treatment Baseline, Treatment Weeks 4, 8 and 12, or at End of Study (EOS) visit if sooner.&#xD;
      A blood sample for PK testing will also be collected at these timepoints. During this&#xD;
      Treatment Period, if at any time the wound has met the criterion for 100% healing, the&#xD;
      subject will immediately go into the 4-week Follow-up Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Follow-up Period, the subject will come to the clinic at 1-week intervals. At&#xD;
      these visits, the area of the wound will continue to be protected with a protective dressing.&#xD;
      Clinical laboratory samples will be collected at the Termination Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcer pain will be assessed by the subject daily and recorded in a diary, along with a record&#xD;
      of analgesic use. At each visit, study staff will assist the subjects to assign an overall&#xD;
      ulcer pain score for the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life Assessment will be performed at Baseline prior to dosing and at End of&#xD;
      Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed based upon known adverse outcomes of Deferoxamine (DFO) therapy. Skin&#xD;
      will be examined for evidence of rash and skin irritation.&#xD;
