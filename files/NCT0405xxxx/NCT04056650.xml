      The growing consumer-grade molecular and digital wellness market is generating unprecedented&#xD;
      volumes of information to support decision-making around individual health. Current trends&#xD;
      suggest the demand for personalized health information, tools, and services will continue to&#xD;
      rise in the next decade. What is missing is a reliable, individualized way to turn this data&#xD;
      into action. Dialogue around consumer health often ignores the disconnect between&#xD;
      measurements and goals. For example, monitoring one's weight is not the same as losing&#xD;
      weight, and counting steps is not the same as lowering blood pressure. If individuals are to&#xD;
      benefit from data, they must be able to relate changes in their personal data to targeted&#xD;
      changes in actions and outcomes. There is a great need and opportunity to adapt the tools and&#xD;
      capabilities of modern computer science, statistics, and clinical trial design to the needs&#xD;
      of individual patients and consumers. The team at the Institute for Next Generation&#xD;
      Healthcare (INGH) has created a smartphone-based app (&quot;N1 app&quot;) and study platform that&#xD;
      together allow individuals to design, implement, and analyze methodologically sound,&#xD;
      statistically robust studies of their personal health data. The focus of the platform will be&#xD;
      the creation of single-participant randomized crossover studies, known as n-of-1 trials. The&#xD;
      platform employs informatics-based intelligence that automates study design and analysis&#xD;
      while simultaneously maintaining high standards of statistical rigor and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These novel methods and tools are designed to empower individuals to make rational,&#xD;
      data-driven choices about their own health, maximizing the benefit all will receive from new&#xD;
      and existing sources of personal health data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing burden of chronic disease in the U.S. and the economics of accountable care are&#xD;
      driving a shift toward proactive approaches to disease prevention and health maintenance. At&#xD;
      the same time, precision medicine studies continue to reveal substantial heterogeneity in the&#xD;
      manifestations of even the most common chronic diseases. The bulk of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in the U.S. arises from conditions with a significant lifestyle component (e.g. type II&#xD;
      diabetes), and responsibility for monitoring and maintaining health largely falls on&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in molecular biology, sensors, and digital health technology underlie rapidly&#xD;
      growing market availability of products and devices for measuring and monitoring individual&#xD;
      health. A vast array of wearable devices, smart home monitors, and health tracking apps&#xD;
      provide an unprecedented view of individuals &quot;in the wild&quot; and provide customers with health&#xD;
      information once accessible only to researchers. The growing digital health market is&#xD;
      generating unprecedented volumes of information to support decision making around individual&#xD;
      health, and current trends suggest the demand for personalized health information, tools, and&#xD;
      services will continue to grow in the next decade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is missing from this technological and scientific growth is a reliable, individualized&#xD;
      way to translate data into action. If society wants to prevent diabetes, heart disease, and&#xD;
      other chronic illnesses that kill millions of Americans each year, individuals must be&#xD;
      empowered to address precursor conditions like obesity, hypertension, and depression.&#xD;
      Dialogue around consumer health often fails to address the profound disconnect between&#xD;
      measurements and outcomes/goals; e.g. monitoring one's weight is not the same as losing&#xD;
      weight, and counting steps is not the same as lowering blood pressure. Data are only useful&#xD;
      if they can help individuals identify interventions that work for them. The combination of&#xD;
      diet, exercise, drugs/supplements, activities, and lifestyle changes that targets an&#xD;
      individual's particular set of health problems is unique to him or her, and it is dependent&#xD;
      on a complex web of factors including genetics, environment, and personal lifestyle. If&#xD;
      individuals are to benefit from data, they must be able to relate changes in their personal&#xD;
      data to targeted adjustments in actions and outcomes. This effectively necessitates&#xD;
      conducting a robust trial at the level of the individual to determine the most promising&#xD;
      recipe of personal lifestyle adjustments to effect change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these challenges, the researchers have developed a unified statistical framework&#xD;
      for producing consistent, interpretable study results from diverse n-of-1 study designs. The&#xD;
      analysis framework is the backbone of the initial software platform, which includes modules&#xD;
      for study design, e-consent, data ingestion, data analysis, and visualization of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this platform, the researchers plan to deploy a prototype study that allows&#xD;
      individuals to test the cognitive effects of two commonly consumed substances: caffeine and&#xD;
      caffeine in combination with a safe, prevalent compound, L-theanine. Each enrolled individual&#xD;
      will participate in his/her own n-of-1 trial. After a baseline period where neither treatment&#xD;
      is taken, participants will alternate between the two treatments (&quot;caffeine alone&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;caffeine + L-theanine&quot;) according to a predefined schedule. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      daily cognitive assessment composed of 3 validated cognitive tests administered via the N1&#xD;
      app. The platform will analyze the cognitive assessment data and determine whether there is a&#xD;
      statistically meaningful treatment effect for either treatment compared to baseline for any&#xD;
      of the 3 cognitive tests for each individual that completes the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to state explicitly that the research objectives for this protocol are not&#xD;
      related to the efficacy of L-theanine and caffeine. This specific study is designed to allow&#xD;
      the researchers to efficiently recruit and enroll subjects so that the underlying statistical&#xD;
      methods and software platform for executing n-of-1 trials may be evaluated.&#xD;
