    <textblock>
      The McGill University Health Center (MUHC) Division of Cardiology, with funding from the&#xD;
      Canadian Institute of Health Research, is performing this randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      determine which dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), ticagrelor + aspirin (T+A) or clopidogrel&#xD;
      and aspirin (C+A), is the most effective and safest for our patients. While the PLATO trial&#xD;
      reported that T+A was superior, the prespecified group of North American patients (about 1/10&#xD;
      of the total study sample) actually did better with C+A, although this difference was not&#xD;
      statistically significant. When the FDA approved T, they also stated: &quot;Lack of Robustness of&#xD;
      PLATO Superiority with Failure in the US Makes a Confirmatory Study Mandatory.&quot; As no&#xD;
      confirmatory study has been done, this TC4 study aims to fill that void.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cluster randomization design, so all patients will receive either T+A or C+A,&#xD;
      depending on the month they arrive at the MUHC when they start their DAPT. We will follow&#xD;
      patients through their electronic health records. The patients have no follow-up visits for&#xD;
      this research project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is most often caused by erosion or rupture of an&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque associated with inflammation, thrombus formation, vasoconstriction,&#xD;
      and microembolisation. In unremitting circumstances, thrombosis at the site of plaque rupture&#xD;
      or erosion leads to complete compromise of coronary blood flow and ultimately myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI). Platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation, therefore, play key roles in&#xD;
      the transformation of a stable atherosclerotic plaque to an unstable lesion and antiplatelet&#xD;
      drugs have become a mainstay in the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large multicenter RCT (PLATO) showed a statistically significant decrease in composite CV&#xD;
      outcomes with the newer ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel. This has prompted both European&#xD;
      and Canadian guideline writers to endorse ticagrelor/aspirin as the DAPT of choice. However&#xD;
      residual uncertainties regarding the choice of DAPT are highlighted by the PLATO subgroup&#xD;
      analysis that showed an increased risk with ticagrelor in North America (NA) patients. This&#xD;
      led to delayed FDA approval, dissenting FDA reviews and a reluctance in US guidelines to&#xD;
      recommend the ticagrelor DAPT regime over others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main area of uncertainty, at least from the NA perspective, hinges on the small number of&#xD;
      NA patients randomized in the PLATO trial and their increased risk with ticagrelor (n=1814,&#xD;
      HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.93 - 1.67). The risk in NA patients was statistically significantly&#xD;
      different from the benefit seen in the other subgroups (P=0.04) and the crux of the debate is&#xD;
      then whether to believe the subgroup analysis or the combined study results (n=18624, HR,&#xD;
      0.84; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92). The complete study provides maximal information but perhaps at a&#xD;
      cost of being less representative of what to expect in NA practice. Conventional statistical&#xD;
      paradigms would say that given the pre-specified nature of the geographic subgroup analysis&#xD;
      and given the statistically significant interaction observed, one should concentrate on the&#xD;
      subgroup results and not the combined results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional statistical model used in the PLATO analysis subsumes that every patient,&#xD;
      regardless of differences in recruitment characteristics or ancillary treatment strategies&#xD;
      received in the different regions, is completely identical in their response to the studied&#xD;
      intervention. It seems highly unlikely that patients from the 43 PLATO enrolling countries&#xD;
      are truly identical in their drug response given recruitment, genetic and background&#xD;
      treatment variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will resolve these uncertainties and address the crucial clinical question of&#xD;
      which DAPT regime is best after an ACS? This proposal will double the currently available&#xD;
      evidence with a novel research design using inexpensive, electronic data and will provide a&#xD;
      feasible answer to this important clinical question.&#xD;
