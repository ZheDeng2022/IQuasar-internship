    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether home use of day and night closed&#xD;
      loop insulin delivery under free living conditions applying faster insulin aspart (FiAsp) is&#xD;
      non-inferior to home use of closed-loop applying standard insulin aspart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, multi-centre, randomised, crossover design study, involving a run-in&#xD;
      period followed by two study periods during which glucose levels will be controlled either by&#xD;
      an automated closed-loop system using standard rapid acting insulin analogue or by an&#xD;
      automated closed-loop system using faster insulin aspart in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the safe use of closed-loop insulin delivery&#xD;
      system. Subjects will have regular contact with the study team during the home study phase&#xD;
      including 24/7 telephone support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by&#xD;
      CGM during home stay. Secondary outcomes are the HbA1c, time spent with glucose levels above&#xD;
      and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other CGM based metrics.&#xD;

      Purpose of clinical trial The purpose is to determine whether home use of day and night&#xD;
      closed loop applying faster insulin aspart is not inferior to home use of closed loop&#xD;
      applying standard insulin aspart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives The study objective is to compare day and night automated closed-loop&#xD;
      glucose control using faster acting insulin aspart with closed loop control using standard&#xD;
      insulin aspart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EFFICACY: The objective is to assess the efficacy of day and night automated closed-loop&#xD;
           glucose control applying standard rapid-acting insulin analogue in maintaining CGM&#xD;
           glucose levels within the target range from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l, as compared to day and&#xD;
           night closed-loop using faster acting insulin aspart&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of day and night automated closed-loop&#xD;
           glucose control in terms of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and other&#xD;
           adverse events and adverse device effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. UTILITY: The objective is to determine the percentage of time when closed-loop was&#xD;
           operational, and usability and acceptance of the closed-loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A double-blind, multi-centre, randomised, two-period crossover study,&#xD;
      contrasting day and night automated closed-loop glucose control applying standard rapid&#xD;
      acting insulin analogue with day and night closed-loop control applying faster acting insulin&#xD;
      aspart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Efficacy Endpoints The primary outcome is the time spent in the target glucose range&#xD;
      from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l based on CGM glucose levels during the free living phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include time spent above and below the target glucose range, based on CGM&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluation Frequency of severe hypoglycaemic episodes as defined by American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association, frequency of severe hyperglycaemia (&gt;20 mmol/l) and / or significant ketosis&#xD;
      (plasma ketones &gt;3mmol/l) and nature and severity of other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utility Evaluation Percentage of time spent in closed-loop. Usability and acceptance of the&#xD;
      closed-loop system will be assessed using a patient experience questionnaire at the end of&#xD;
      the second intervention. Additionally, human factor questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      following recruitment and at the end of each intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size 24 adults completing the study. Up to 30 subjects will be recruited to allow for&#xD;
      dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum duration of study for a subject 20 weeks (5 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The subjects will be recruited through the adult diabetes outpatient clinics or&#xD;
      other established methods at participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Participants will be asked to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment Eligible subjects will undergo a baseline evaluation including a blood&#xD;
      sample for the measurement of HbA1c, renal, liver functions, full blood count, thyroid&#xD;
      functions and coeliac antibody screen (if not done in the previous 3 months). Urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test will be done in females. Additional centre specific assessments will also be undertaken.&#xD;
      Human factor questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Training and Run-in Period Training sessions on the use of study CGM, insulin pump and&#xD;
      closed-loop system will be provided by the research team. During the 2-4 weeks run-in period,&#xD;
      subjects will use study CGM and insulin pump and will have regular contact with the research&#xD;
      team. At the end of the run-in period, for compliance and to assess the ability of the&#xD;
      subject to use the CGM and study pump safely, before the start of the first home study phase,&#xD;
      at least 7 days of CGM data need to be recorded and safe use of study insulin pump&#xD;
      demonstrated. CGM and insulin pump data during the run-in period will be used to assess&#xD;
      baseline glucose control and optimise treatment before the start of the first home study&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Competency Assessment Competency on the use of study insulin pump, study CGM and closed-loop&#xD;
      system will be evaluated using a competency assessment tool developed by the research team.&#xD;
      Further training may be delivered as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Eligible subjects will be randomised using randomisation software to the use of&#xD;
      closed-loop with faster acting aspart or to closed-loop with standard insulin aspart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automated closed-loop Training on the use of closed-loop will be provided by the research&#xD;
      team. Automated closed-loop control will be commenced and during the 2-3 hour training the&#xD;
      participant will operate the system under the supervision of the clinical team. Competency on&#xD;
      the use of closed-loop system will be evaluated. Subjects will be advised to use automated&#xD;
      closed-loop system for next 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over Assessment At the end of the first intervention human factor questionnaires will&#xD;
      be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no washout period in phase 3 extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of study assessments A patient experience questionnaire will be given at the end of the&#xD;
      second intervention. Additionally human factor questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for safety monitoring during trial Standard operating procedures for monitoring&#xD;
      and reporting of all adverse events and adverse device events will be in place, including&#xD;
      serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and specific adverse&#xD;
      events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to test and record blood ketones if their finger-stick glucose is&#xD;
      above 14 mmol/l as part of the safety assessment for hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) will be informed of all serious adverse events&#xD;
      and any unanticipated adverse device/method effects that occur during the study and will&#xD;
      review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal of patients on safety grounds&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a&#xD;
      reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the participation of a&#xD;
      subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant protocol violation or noncompliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to satisfy competency assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision by the investigator, or the sponsor, that termination is in the subject's best&#xD;
           medical interest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergic reaction to insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technical grounds (e.g. subject relocates)&#xD;
