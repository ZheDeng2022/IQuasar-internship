  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity and inadequate sleep are prevalent, and frequently co-occurring, health&#xD;
      risks among children, both of which are associated with serious medical and psychosocial&#xD;
      health complications including risk for cardiovascular disease. Although the investigator's&#xD;
      data suggest that disrupted or shortened sleep may be causally associated with increased&#xD;
      energy intake and weight gain in children, and with self-regulation and neural response to&#xD;
      food cues in adults, understanding of mechanisms involved in the sleep/eating association is&#xD;
      incomplete, thereby impeding development of targeted, optimally timed intervention&#xD;
      strategies. The proposed mechanistic clinical trial aims to assess the effects of an&#xD;
      experimental sleep manipulation on eating-related self-regulation and its neural substrates,&#xD;
      and on real-world eating behavior, among children with overweight/obesity, which will help&#xD;
      guide research efforts towards the refinement of prevention and intervention strategies&#xD;
      targeting sleep and its eating-related correlates to curb weight gain throughout development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient sleep and excess weight status contribute to adverse health outcomes across the&#xD;
      lifespan, including risk for cardiometabolic disease. Cross-sectional data suggest that&#xD;
      children with overweight/obesity are more likely to experience sleep disturbances than their&#xD;
      non-overweight peers. Although the nature of this association may be bidirectional,&#xD;
      prospective studies indicate that sleep impacts body weight regulation through multiple&#xD;
      physiological and psychological pathways. In particular, insufficient sleep is related to&#xD;
      greater energy intake and reduced diet quality in children. Although mechanisms explaining&#xD;
      the association between sleep and eating behavior are poorly understood, sleep restriction&#xD;
      has been found to impact brain processes related to reward valuation of food and&#xD;
      self-regulation, the behavioral manifestations of which may increase susceptibility to&#xD;
      suboptimal dietary behaviors and subsequent weight gain. A limitation of prior research on&#xD;
      mechanisms is that much of it has been conducted in adults and in laboratory settings,&#xD;
      thereby calling into question the ecological validity of the findings. Alternatively, studies&#xD;
      on sleep restriction/extension in children's natural environments have relied on&#xD;
      retrospective reporting of eating behavior, included children across the weight spectrum, and&#xD;
      had limited focus on underlying mechanisms, particularly neural substrates. A clearer&#xD;
      understanding of momentary mechanisms involved in the sleep/eating association could improve&#xD;
      development and/or refinement of sleep-related interventions, particularly those delivered in&#xD;
      real time when risk for engaging in maladaptive eating is highest. The proposed R01 study&#xD;
      will examine prospective associations among sleep, eating-related self-regulation, and eating&#xD;
      behavior in the natural environment. Community-based children with overweight or obesity&#xD;
      (n=120) will undergo a naturalistic protocol involving assessment of typical sleep and eating&#xD;
      patterns (week 1), followed by sleep restriction or extension (weeks 2 and 3, separated by a&#xD;
      7-day wash-out), the latter occurring within a randomized crossover design. Assessment&#xD;
      throughout the study period will involve daily actigraphy measurement of sleep patterns;&#xD;
      repeated daily self-reports on eating behavior and behavioral assessment of eating-related&#xD;
      self-regulation; and intermittent 24-hour dietary recalls informed by daily real-time food&#xD;
      photography. Participants will complete fMRI-based assessment of neural activation during an&#xD;
      eating-related self-regulation task after each week-long period of sleep restriction and&#xD;
      extension. Overall aims are to assess short-term effects of sleep extension versus&#xD;
      restriction on eating-related self-regulation (including behavioral and neural performance)&#xD;
      and naturalistic eating behavior. These data will clarify timing and trajectory of changes in&#xD;
      eating behavior and self-regulatory mechanisms as a consequence of sleep patterns. The&#xD;
      proposed study has clear potential to advance scientific and clinical understanding of&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the prospective associations between inadequate sleep and maladaptive&#xD;
      eating in youth and inform interventions to alleviate their cumulative personal and societal&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
