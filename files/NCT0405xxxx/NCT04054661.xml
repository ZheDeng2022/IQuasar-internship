    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the accuracy of the SD Biosensor STANDARD™&#xD;
      point-of-care (POC) G6PD test in measuring G6PD activity and classifying results compared to&#xD;
      a reference assay and across repeated measurements in capillary samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with 250 volunteer participants. The clinic will&#xD;
      recruit and consent adult study participants. Clinic staff will draw venous blood and obtain&#xD;
      finger stick capillary blood samples. Clinic staff will perform the investigational SD&#xD;
      Biosensor STANDARD™ G6PD test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and a&#xD;
      HemoCue® hemoglobin test on finger stick capillary blood. An anti-coagulated venous blood&#xD;
      sample will be sent to a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab for&#xD;
      G6PD reference testing by the gold standard assays: G6PD measurement by spectrophotometry&#xD;
      using the Pointe Scientific G6PD reference assay and hemoglobin measurement by a hematology&#xD;
      analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals identified as G6PD deficient or intermediate by the reference test will be&#xD;
      notified of their results by the clinic and referred to their physician for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a nested repeatability study and a nested sample stability study. In the&#xD;
      nested repeatability study up to 20 consented participants will provide 4 additional finger&#xD;
      stick samples. Clinic staff will perform the SD Biosensor STANDARD™ G6PD test to assess the&#xD;
      repeatability of the test in capillary blood over 8 G6PD and hemoglobin measurements on up to&#xD;
      3 different instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the nested sample stability study up to 8 consented participants will provide an&#xD;
      additional venous blood draw sample to be tested at additional time points to document&#xD;
      stability of the samples over time when tested by the SD Biosensor STANDARD™ G6PD Test.&#xD;

    <measure>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying G6PD Deficient Individuals</measure>
    <time_frame>All samples were collected on study day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive in the Pointe Scientific assay. A true positive was defined as a participant with ≤ 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test is defined as the percentage of participants who tested positive for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true positive / (Number of participants who were test and true positive + Number of participants who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying G6PD Deficient Individuals</title>
        <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive in the Pointe Scientific assay. A true positive was defined as a participant with ≤ 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test is defined as the percentage of participants who tested positive for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true positive / (Number of participants who were test and true positive + Number of participants who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;

        <title>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying Women With Intermediate G6PD Activity</title>
        <description>To investigate the performance of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test to distinguish females with intermediate G6PD activity from females with normal activity, assay sensitivity was determined at a G6PD activity threshold of 70%.

        <title>Specificity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying Women With Intermediate G6PD Activity</title>
        <description>To investigate the performance of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test to distinguish females with intermediate G6PD activity from females with normal activity, the specificity was determined at a G6PD activity threshold of 70%. A true negative for intermediate G6PD activity in females was defined as G6PD activity &gt; 70% of normal in circulating venous blood as determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Specificity is the percentage of participants who tested negative for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified as negative using the test assay, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true negative / (Number of participants who were test and true negative + Number of participants who were test positive but true negative [ie false positive]) * 100%.&#xD;
Specificity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>

        <title>Sample Stability Substudy: G6PD Levels Measured Over Time After Storage at Room Temperature</title>
        <description>Each participant in the sample stability substudy underwent an additional blood draw in 3 different anti-coagulants which were stored at room temperature (15-30°C/59-86°F). The freshly collected venous whole blood samples were tested at the clinic site lab using the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test within 1 hour of collection for baseline (0 hour) and at 4 additional time points, up to 2 days (48 hours) after collection. The anti-coagulants included:&#xD;
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anti-coagulated blood&#xD;
heparin-anti-coagulated blood&#xD;
acid citrate dextrose (ACD)-anti-coagulated blood</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected on day 1. Samples were tested immediately (&lt; 1 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after collection.</time_frame>

        <title>Sample Stability Substudy: Hemoglobin Levels Measured Over Time After Refrigerated Storage</title>
        <description>Each participant in the sample stability substudy underwent an additional blood draw in 3 different anti-coagulants which were stored in a refrigerator (2-8°C/25-46°F). Hemoglobin levels were measured from the freshly collected venous whole blood samples at the clinic site lab using the SD Biosensor STANDARD hemoglobin test within 1 hour of collection for baseline (0 hour) and at 5 additional time points, up to 7 days (168 hours) after collection. The anti-coagulants included:&#xD;
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anti-coagulated blood&#xD;
heparin-anti-coagulated blood&#xD;
acid citrate dextrose (ACD)-anti-coagulated blood</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples were collected on day 1. Samples were tested immediately (&lt; 1 hour) and at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 168 hours after collection.</time_frame>

          <description>Participants provided whole blood samples as well as finger-stick capillary blood samples.&#xD;
At the clinic site lab, study staff conducted the SD Biosensor point-of-care G6PD test and the point-of-care HemoCue Hb test on both finger stick blood and whole blood samples.&#xD;
At the reference laboratory, G6PD activity was measured from whole blood samples using the Pointe Scientific G6PD reference assay and hemoglobin was measured using a hematology analyzer.</description>
