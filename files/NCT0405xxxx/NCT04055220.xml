  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, 2 arms study concerning patients with bone sarcoma&#xD;
      after the first line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first arm, patients will be treated with regorafenib for a maximum of 12 months as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy after first line therapy (chemotherapy and surgery), whereas in the&#xD;
      second arm, patients will be treated with placebo (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison between this two arms will allow to determine whether or not regorafenib is&#xD;
      efficient for disease control, in terms of Relapse-Free Survival improvement.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone sarcomas are rare primary bone cancers, although, their frequency has been increasing by&#xD;
      0.3% per year over the last decade. They include a very large number of tumour types&#xD;
      belonging to the family of primary malignant bone tumours and originate from bone as&#xD;
      Osteosarcomas (OS), Chondrosarcomas (CS), Fibrosarcomas, Chordomas, …&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current conventional treatments for OS combine chemotherapy and surgery. Compared with&#xD;
      surgery alone, multimodal treatment of high-grade sarcomas increases disease-free survival&#xD;
      probabilities from only 10%-20% to 50-65% depending on the bone sarcoma type. In general,&#xD;
      despite second-line treatment, the prognosis of recurrent disease has remained poor, with&#xD;
      long-term post-relapse survival of &lt;20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of bone sarcoma has been dramatically improved by the addition of chemotherapy in&#xD;
      the 70' and 80' but has remained remarkably stable in the last 3 decades, with a survival&#xD;
      rate largely plateaued, despite introduction of novel regimens, both in localized and&#xD;
      metastatic disease, in children and in adults. Primary bone cancer presented challenges in&#xD;
      new drug development partly because of their rarity and heterogeneity. Thus, improving&#xD;
      treatments for these diseases is a high priority, but advances have been few in recent years.&#xD;
      In this context, maintenance therapy may be an interesting option as a way to prolong the&#xD;
      benefit of first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regorafenib may play a role in the maintenance setting for bone sarcomas (as improved&#xD;
      Progression-Free Survival and sustained responses were observed in the REGOBONE study) in&#xD;
      maintaining the initial response to chemotherapy and delaying the need for further treatment&#xD;
      at relapse, while exerting a manageable associated toxicity and minimal negative impact on&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no available agent used as maintenance therapy after first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In the context of a clinical trial with close monitoring, it is, thus,&#xD;
      acceptable to consider a placebo-control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, this study propose to conduct a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of regorafenib versus placebo in the treatment of patients with bone&#xD;
      sarcomas, who have no evidence of disease after neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the present study is then to explore whether sequential addition of&#xD;
      regorafenib after completion of a standard induction chemotherapy in patients with bone&#xD;
      sarcomas would improve outcomes in term of event-free-survival (EFS) defined by local or&#xD;
      distant recurrence of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be stratified on the &quot;high-risk&quot; versus &quot;low-risk&quot; of relapse. As response to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and metastatic status at time of diagnosis are known to be important&#xD;
      on patient's outcome, stratification will rely on a combined criteria taking into account&#xD;
      these two factors. Thus, &quot;high-risk&quot; of relapse will be defined by the group of patients who&#xD;
      are poor responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or in metastatic setting at diagnosis,&#xD;
      whereas &quot;low-risk&quot; of relapse will be defined by the group of patients who have no metastatic&#xD;
      disease at time of diagnosis and are good responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>RFS will be defined as the time from randomization to relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients alive without relapse at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of last tumour assessment. The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate median RFS for each study arm. The two-sided log-rank test, stratified on randomization stratification factors, will be used to compare RFS between the investigational arm and the control arm. The stratified Cox-regression (with proportional hazards) will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of the hazard ratio.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>TTF will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of permanent discontinuation of the study treatment, whichever is the cause. Patient not known to have withdrawn treatment before 12 months (study treatment duration) will be censored at the time of treatment stop. TTF survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and will be described in terms of medians along with the associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death, from any cause. Patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. OS survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and will be described in terms of medians along with the associated 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's Quality of Life will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Scores will be calculated at each time point according to the scoring manuals. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate baseline scores and evolution of scores from baseline to each time point (Every 3 months since baseline, then every 4 months after second year surveillance). Data will be compared between arms using the Student's t-test. The QoL data will also be presented graphically if deemed relevant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's tolerance to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The safety will be described mainly on the frequency of adverse events coded using the common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTCAE v5.0) grade. Descriptive statistics will be provided for characterizing and assessing patient tolerance to treatment. Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRA®.</description>
