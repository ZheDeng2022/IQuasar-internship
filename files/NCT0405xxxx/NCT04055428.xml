  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black individuals are more likely to have decreased insulin sensitivity which results in a&#xD;
      high risk for the development of cardiometabolic disease. The reasons for this are&#xD;
      incompletely understood. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are hormones produced by the heart that&#xD;
      play a role in regulating the metabolic health of an individual. Low circulating level of NPs&#xD;
      is an important contributor to increased risk for diabetes. The NP levels are relatively&#xD;
      lower among Black individuals thus affecting their metabolic health and putting them at a&#xD;
      higher risk for diabetes. This study aims to test the hypothesis that by augmenting NP levels&#xD;
      using sacubitril/valsartan, among Black Individuals one can improve their metabolic health&#xD;
      (as measured by insulin sensitivity &amp; energy expenditure) and help establish the role of NPs&#xD;
      in the underlying mechanism behind increased risk for cardiometabolic disease in these&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Black individuals are more likely to have a reduced insulin sensitivity which results in a&#xD;
      greater risk for diabetes. However, the reasons for their decreased insulin sensitivity are&#xD;
      not clearly understood. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are hormones produced by the heart that is&#xD;
      known to have a wide range of favorable metabolic effects. Studies indicate that lower NP&#xD;
      levels are associated with a decreased insulin sensitivity and this may be causally related&#xD;
      to the development of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that Black individuals have low levels of NPs. Increased clearance of NPs&#xD;
      by neprilysin, an NP degrading enzyme, contributes to the low levels of NP among Black&#xD;
      individuals. Since NPs play an important role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      energy expenditure, one can infer that relatively low NP levels are an important biological&#xD;
      contributor to the high prevalence rates of cardiometabolic disease in African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacubitril/valsartan is an FDA-approved inhibitor of neprilysin that augment NP levels. NP&#xD;
      augmentation using sacubitril/valsartan has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      lipid metabolism in a small clinical trial among obese White individuals. It can be&#xD;
      postulated that NP augmentation in populations with relatively low NP levels will help in&#xD;
      improving their metabolic health. Improvement in the metabolic health following NP&#xD;
      augmentation will also help us to outline the relationship between the NP system and the risk&#xD;
      of cardiometabolic disease among Black individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that NP augmentation among Black individuals will show an improvement in their&#xD;
      metabolic health as measured by insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that African American individuals will show an improvement in their insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      their resting &amp; exercise energy expenditure after treatment with sacubitril/valsartan versus&#xD;
      valsartan alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will have the following aims. The first aim is to assess the change in the insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity after NP augmentation therapy (using sacubitril/valsartan) as compared with NP&#xD;
      neutral therapy (using valsartan) among Black individuals. We will measure the change in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity (assessed using IVGTT) after 12 weeks of intervention. We will also&#xD;
      assess the change in NP levels (a marker of NP augmentation) &amp; cyclic guanylate monophosphate&#xD;
      (cGMP) levels after intervention and evaluate their relationship with the change in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of our study is to examine the change in the energy expenditure after&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan as compared to valsartan alone among Black individuals. The individuals&#xD;
      enrolled in the first aim will also be examined for the change in resting as well as exercise&#xD;
      energy expenditure. This will be assessed using standardized protocol performed using the&#xD;
      metabolic cart and an exercise treadmill, at baseline and after 12 weeks of either&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan or valsartan alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of our study is to assess the GLP-1 response to meals after treatment with&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan in Black individuals. We will evaluate the change in postprandial GLP-1&#xD;
      response to meals at baseline and after 12 weeks of either sacubitril/valsartan or valsartan&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
