  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well telehealth works in improving adherence to endocrine&#xD;
      (anti-estrogen) therapy in participants with estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor&#xD;
      positive (hormone receptor positive) stage 0-III breast cancer who have underwent surgery.&#xD;
      Telehealth is an approach to care that uses digital information and communication tools to&#xD;
      manage health and well-being. Participants interact with their health care providers via a&#xD;
      video chat on a computer or smart phone. Telehealth may help identify the effects of&#xD;
      treatment on participants with breast cancer who have underwent surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate if the utilization of automated patient reported outcomes and follow up&#xD;
      Telehealth can improve patient adherence with adjuvant endocrine therapy during the first 12&#xD;
      months of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate if the utilization of Smart Pill Bottles and follow-up Telehealth encounters&#xD;
      can improve patient adherence with adjuvant endocrine therapy during the first 12 months of&#xD;
      study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate if the utilization of automated patient reported outcome and follow-up&#xD;
      Telehealth encounters can improve quality of life and decrease side effects while taking&#xD;
      adjuvant endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care office visits approximately every 3 months for one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care as in Arm I and 4 automated electronic surveys&#xD;
      every 3 weeks (+/- 1 weeks) for a total of 18 electronic surveys over one year. Patients who&#xD;
      report severe or very severe side effects, or stopping or are thinking about stopping their&#xD;
      endocrine therapy (ET) will have a follow up encounter with a research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive a wireless smart pill bottle that performs daily time-specific&#xD;
      reminders to open the pill bottle and take the medication. Additional messages are triggered&#xD;
      by the pill bottle when non-adherence is indicated (lack of bottle opening or no change in&#xD;
      remaining pills), as well as when medication is skipped.&#xD;

    <measure>Adherence to endocrine therapy (ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>ET is defined as the proportion of patients with filled prescriptions to cover &gt;= 80% of their ET doses for the year and pill diaries documenting receipt of &gt;= 80% of prescribed doses of ET for the year. ET medication adherence will be evaluated by pill diary collected at each quarterly clinic visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out the Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) at initiation of trial, and then at each of the quarterly clinic visits for Arm B and on paper for patients on Arm A. The FACT-ES, has two sections each of which will be evaluated separately. The first section, FACT-G, will be used as a measure of general quality of life. It consists of 27 items, each scored 0 to 4. Scores range from 0 to 108 with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ET side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out the Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale (FACT-ES) at initiation of trial, and then at each of the quarterly clinic visits. The FACT-ES, has two sections each of which will be evaluated separately. The second section of the FACT-ES will be used as a measure of specific side effects of endocrine therapy. It consists of 19 items scored 0 to 4 with scores ranging from 0 to 76. A higher score indicates worse side effects. The FACT-ES has established validity and reliability in breast cancer patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with cancer care</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be evaluated using a modified version of the Patient Satisfaction With Cancer Care Scale (PSCCS). The modified scale contains 14 items, each rated on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree (5) to strongly disagree (1). Scores range from 14 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
