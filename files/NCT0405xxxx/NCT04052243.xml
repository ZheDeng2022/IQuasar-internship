  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is characterized by obstruction of the&#xD;
      pulmonary vasculature by residual organized thrombi, leading to increased pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance (PVR), progressive pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy and balloon angioplasty (BPA) are effective treatment alternatives in&#xD;
      lowering pulmonary pressures and increasing pulmonary flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the hemodynamic effects of BPA or medical therapy on the&#xD;
      pressure-flow relationship in the pulmonary vasculature and the pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [CTEPH] is a rare condition with a significant&#xD;
      risk of morbidity and mortality. The primary cause of CTEPH is thrombotic lesions, which did&#xD;
      not resolve after acute pulmonary embolism. This causes increased pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance [PVR], leading to secondary remodeling of pulmonary arteries causing pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and ultimately progressive right heart failure. The treatment of choice is&#xD;
      surgical pulmonary endarterectomy [PEA], however up to 40% cases are not treated surgically,&#xD;
      due to operability, anatomic location of the lesions, patient choice and comorbidities&#xD;
      significantly increasing procedural risk. A new alternative procedure, balloon pulmonary&#xD;
      angioplasty [BPA] has been proposed for patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) and is currently characterized&#xD;
      with good outcome in functional capacity, hemodynamic parameters, biomarkers, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise stress tests of the pulmonary circulation are used in workup and diagnosis of&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension as a hemodynamic abnormality. The approach has allowed identification&#xD;
      of patients with normal or marginally increased mPAP at rest but with symptomatic increases&#xD;
      in mPAP at exercise, related to either increased resistance or increased left atrial&#xD;
      pressure. Although this differential diagnosis is of obvious therapeutic relevance,&#xD;
      guidelines about exercise stress studies of the pulmonary circulation have not been developed&#xD;
      until now for lack of robust evidence allowing for a consensus on clearly defined cutoff&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither the pathophysiology of the exercise limitation nor the underlying mechanisms of the&#xD;
      BPA - induced improvement were studied before. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the hemodynamic effects of BPA treatment on the pressure-flow relationship in the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature and the pulmonary vascular compliance. Furthermore, the investigators will&#xD;
      explore possible differences in treatment effect across centers. Especially explore the&#xD;
      timing of medical therapy vs balloon angioplasty.&#xD;
