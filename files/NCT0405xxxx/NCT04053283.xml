      To characterise the safety and tolerability of NG-641 in patients with metastatic or advanced&#xD;
      epithelial tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase Ia part of the study is a dose escalation and dose expansion phase investigating&#xD;
      NG-641 administration by intratumorural injection (IT) and intravenous (IV) infusion in a&#xD;
      range of tumour types&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase Ib part of the study is to investigate safety and efficacy of NG-641 as monotherapy&#xD;
      or in combination with chemotherapy agents and/or checkpoint inhibitors in separate efficacy&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with specific epithelial tumour types.&#xD;
