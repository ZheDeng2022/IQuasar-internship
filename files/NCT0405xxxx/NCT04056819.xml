    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human assessment of safety of using UCMSC in patients with AMI via a&#xD;
      combination of IC and IV stem cell administration. The novelty of the current UMSC01&#xD;
      treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via&#xD;
      IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not&#xD;
      predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be&#xD;
      minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and&#xD;
      concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive&#xD;
      patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world, with global&#xD;
      deaths due to coronary artery disease estimated to increase from 7.3 million in 2008 to 25&#xD;
      million by 2020 WHO, 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic and therapeutic cascade in patients with&#xD;
      suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients will ultimately develop an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or&#xD;
      fibrinolytic therapy. Basically, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) presentations. Acute STEMI is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This product is a new cell therapy product for treating AMI and produced by Ever Supreme Bio&#xD;
      Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its&#xD;
      effectiveness for AMI and stroke. The rats with coronary artery ligation receiving&#xD;
      intravenous injection of UMSC01 showed significantly improved cardiac function.&#xD;
