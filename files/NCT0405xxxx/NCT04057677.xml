  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to gather data on how exercise can help recovery of muscle&#xD;
      mass, strength, and physical function after bedrest in older adults with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) experience an accelerated rate of sarcopenia, which&#xD;
      is the deterioration in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. Periods of disuse&#xD;
      caused by illness or hospitalization causes rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which&#xD;
      negatively impact physical function upon re-ambulation. Without adequate rehabilitation,&#xD;
      physical function does not fully recover in older adults following disuse, reducing the&#xD;
      quality of life and loss of independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will enter a 10-day strictly controlled bed rest intervention at&#xD;
      the Translational Research Institute (TRI) clinical research unit. Participants are&#xD;
      randomized to either a progressive 4-week aerobic and resistance training recovery program at&#xD;
      the exercise training or an ambulatory recovery group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to determine how an exercise intervention can aid in&#xD;
      recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function following bed rest in older adults&#xD;
      with T2D.&#xD;
