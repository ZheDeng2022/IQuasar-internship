  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, the misuse of prescription opioids has significantly increased. A&#xD;
      recent systematic review reported as much as 67% to 92% of opioids dispensed on discharge&#xD;
      post-surgery go unused. This culture of overprescribing is consistently observed across&#xD;
      surgical specialties. Less frequently observed is the potential for opioid use and misuse in&#xD;
      children and adolescents post-surgery. The research to date in this area has been poorly&#xD;
      performed with heterogenous data collection, analysis and reporting, as well as large loss of&#xD;
      patients to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous prospective observational deception study identified three areas&#xD;
      of concern:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a culture of postoperative opioid over-prescribing at discharge as demonstrated&#xD;
           by heterogenous opioid dosing and duration of treatments across practitioners for single&#xD;
           procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This overprescribing is in excess of patients' home-requirements and results in&#xD;
           significant quantities of leftover opioids&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is a culture of inappropriate storage and lack of safe disposal of prescribed&#xD;
           opioids in the community&#xD;

      This study focuses on addressing and minimizing pediatric surgical over-prescribing. It aims&#xD;
      to reduce the amount of opioids prescribed by focusing prescribers and families on regular&#xD;
      use of simple non-opioid analgesics, as well as decreasing the amount of opioids prescribed&#xD;
      and dispensed.&#xD;
