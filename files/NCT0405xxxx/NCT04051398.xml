  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ancient use of acupuncture as a treatment modality of traditional Chinese medicine has&#xD;
      also been proven effective in Western medicine. The use of this treatment tool for pain&#xD;
      control is already proven in the literature and today is considered an important adjuvant for&#xD;
      this purpose. However, the ancient texts of acupuncture also report the use of certain points&#xD;
      to tonify organs functions, despite of pain control. According to these texts there are some&#xD;
      points that allow the treatment of lung diseases improving respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the effects of stimulation of such points using electric field&#xD;
      application, the effect of these procedure on pulmonary function and the impact of this&#xD;
      practice on dyspnea symptoms, the investigators will conduct a randomized study with 60&#xD;
      patients (1: 1 randomization) distributed in 2 arms (intervention arm-BI and control arm-BC).&#xD;
      Transcutaneous neural stimulation of acupuncture points of the BI patients will be performed.&#xD;
      For the BC arm the investigators will place the electrodes over the points without turn on&#xD;
      the device to produce a placebo effect. Pulmonary function test, Borg scale application and 6&#xD;
      min walk test will be performed before and after the intervention in each group for&#xD;
      subsequent data comparison.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of acupuncture for pain management is well defined and fully established. The&#xD;
      stimulation of acupuncture points using needles, electrical stimuli, thermal or laser stimuli&#xD;
      produce local effects at the point (nociceptor stimulation and release of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators) that generate systemic effects (serotonin release and endorphins in the Central&#xD;
      Nervous System). leading to the state of body relaxation, well-being, changes in heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure and analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, acupuncture can trigger other effects beyond pain control. In ancient texts dealing&#xD;
      with the subject there are descriptions of points capable of promoting improvement of&#xD;
      specific organic functions such as pulmonary function. 2 This effect is due to changes&#xD;
      generated by the action of acupuncture on the autonomic nervous system promoting&#xD;
      bronchodilation and decreased mucus production. Some studies of effects of acupuncture in&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have shown promising results related to&#xD;
      improved lung function and reduced symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous nerve electrostimulation (TENS) can be used to stimulate acupuncture points as&#xD;
      an alternative to needles. This modality of stimulation prevents the occurrence of serious&#xD;
      complications such as pneumothorax secondary to needle application to thoracic points. This&#xD;
      practice turns the procedure safer allowing any trainned healthcare professional to do it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the immediate effects of this procedure on pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effects of TENS on dyspnea symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be recruited 60 participants over the age of 18 years, smokers and patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary nodules attended at Santa Marcelina Hospital. Patients with pacemakers, patients&#xD;
      unable to read, understand and sign the informed consent form, with mobility restrictions,&#xD;
      chest pain and patients who have previously used TENS will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in a 1/1 ratio to form 2 arms: intervention arm (BI) and&#xD;
      control arm (BC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BI participants will initially undergo simple spirometry and a 6-minute walk test and&#xD;
      Borg scale application (this texts are detailed at &quot;Tests Description&quot; item at the end of&#xD;
      this manuscript) upon admission to the thoracic surgery department. Immediately after the&#xD;
      exams, they will undergo to a TENS application session over the acupuncture points: Feishu,&#xD;
      Zhongfu, Taiyuan and Dingchuan using a frequency of 200Hz and a pulse time of 80 seconds of&#xD;
      sufficient intensity to cause a slight sensation of local numbness without muscle&#xD;
      fasciculations. The TENS application time will be 30 minutes. Immediately after the TENS&#xD;
      application, the participants will be submitted to a new spirometry, a new 6-minute walk test&#xD;
      and again to the Borg scale evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BC participants will undergo to the same steps as BI, however when applying TENS to these&#xD;
      participants the investigators will place the electrodes over the points without turning on&#xD;
      the device in order to obtain the effect of a placebo. To minimize the impact of non-blinding&#xD;
      investigators, will be designated a specific investigator who will be responsible for&#xD;
      randomizing participants at the time of TENS application and performing the intervention do&#xD;
      not allowing the investigators responsible for data collection know whether the patient will&#xD;
      be BI or BC. After data collection, the same investigator will segregate the information from&#xD;
      BC and BI keeping the subgroups identification in secret do not allowing the investigator who&#xD;
      will perform the statistical analysis know what are the groups. Once the data analysis is&#xD;
      ready, the investigator responsible for randomization will tell the other investigators which&#xD;
      subgroup corresponds to each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      # 6-minute Walk Test (6 MWT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2002, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines on how to perform the 6&#xD;
      MWT. This guideline stressed the need for a standardized protocol to perform the 6 MWT to&#xD;
      minimize variation in results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the 6 MWT is very safe, emergency equipment should be at hand. The test should be&#xD;
      conducted by personnel qualified to use this equipment. Physicians are not required to be&#xD;
      present in most situations, but should be readily available. The physician ordering the test&#xD;
      may decide if a physician should supervise the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to ATS guidelines, a 30 meters distance course is recommended. Turnaround points&#xD;
      should be identified. Three-meter interval measurements are marked with colored tape on the&#xD;
      floor. Shorter corridor lengths may increase the 6 MWD due to more frequent turns involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stop watch or timer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two small cones to mark the lap boundaries&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement scale for floor measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mechanical lap counter&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Resuscitation equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6 MWT is performed on a walking track in hospital facility. The track has been marked at&#xD;
      3-m intervals so that accurate measurement of the walking distance can be performed. Chairs&#xD;
      are available at 30-m intervals in case the patients become so symptomatic that have to stop&#xD;
      and sit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comfortable clothing should be worn&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Environment temperature should be ambient&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Shoes should be comfortable and any walking aids that the patient ordinarily uses should&#xD;
           be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Light meals are acceptable before morning and afternoon tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Don't perform a warm up before the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The patient should rest comfortably for 10 minutes prior to the test. During this time&#xD;
           blood pressure and heart rate should be measured and potential contraindications&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulse oximetry is optional. If it is used, it should be ensured that readings are stable&#xD;
           prior to starting the 6 MWT, and signal is optimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Before the test starts, the patient should stand up and rate for dyspnea and fatigue.&#xD;
           The Borg scale may be used for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Set the lap counter to zero and timer to 6 minutes. Assemble all necessary equipment and&#xD;
           move to starting point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The supervisor may walk a lap to demonstrate performance of the test to the patient.&#xD;
           During the test the supervisor should never walk with or in front of the patient as the&#xD;
           patient may try to match the supervisor's pace. The supervisor may walk behind the&#xD;
           patient to support the patient in case of staggering or to prevent falling. The patient&#xD;
           is allowed to rest during the test if gets fatigued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Use standardized phrases and an even tone for encouragement at completion of each minute&#xD;
           of the test. For an example of a standardized script, the reader is referred to the 2002&#xD;
           ATS guidelines. Some examples are &quot;keep up the good work&quot; or &quot;you are doing fine&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Resting during the test is allowed, but don't stop the clock. If the patient cannot go&#xD;
           any further, the test should be stopped and distance covered recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Stop the test if patient develops chest pain, intolerable dyspnea, staggering,&#xD;
           diaphoresis, intolerable cramps, and/or ashen appearance. Test supervisors should be&#xD;
           trainned to provide appropriate care at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. At the conclusion of the test, ask the patient to rate his/her dyspnea and fatigue&#xD;
           levels. Record the reason for stopping the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional details about technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the patient is on supplemental oxygen, use the same oxygen level that normally uses&#xD;
           with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The 2002 ATS guidelines do not recommend routine measurement of pulse oximetry during&#xD;
           the test. In untreated patients with pulmonary hypertension, oxygen desaturation &gt;10%&#xD;
           during 6 MWT has been associated with mortality. With the widespread availability of&#xD;
           light-weight portable oximeters, monitoring of oxygen saturation during walking can be&#xD;
           reliably performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quality control and standardization are important to reduce variability in measurement.&#xD;
           Persons supervising the test should be trained using a standard protocol, and should&#xD;
           conduct supervised 6 MWTs before patients are able to perform them independently. A&#xD;
           practice test generally should not be needed. If a practice test is done, there should&#xD;
           be a wait time of about an hour between the two tests, and the longer 6 MWD should be&#xD;
           reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Borg scale measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale allows individuals to subjectively rate their level of exertion during exercise or&#xD;
      exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a gradual scale that varies from zero (no fatigue symptoms) to ten (maximum fatigue&#xD;
      like the sensation of the hardest race that the participant have ever did)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with higher values on Borg scale evaluation are considered worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
