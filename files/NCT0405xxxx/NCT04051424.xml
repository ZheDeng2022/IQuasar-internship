      When endotracheal intubation is known or predicted to be difficult, patients are intubated&#xD;
      awake using a flexible bronchoscope (awake fibre-optic intubation: AFI) so that they can&#xD;
      protect their airway with normal upper airway muscle activity until the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      (ETT) is safely in place. New bite blocks have been invented for bag mask ventilation but are&#xD;
      not suitable for AFI.1 A newly invented airway device, the McKay airway, may provide a better&#xD;
      solution for AFI by enabling jaw thrust, a condition where the upper airway is opened more as&#xD;
      the jaw is protruded forward. It may also be more comfortable for awake users. A study is&#xD;
      proposed to assess the functionality of the device for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect the bronchoscope, a bite block is used during AFI to protect the very delicate&#xD;
      glass fibres from damage from inadvertent biting by the patient. Currently used bite blocks&#xD;
      protect the scope, but do not position the jaw optimally for scoping. The proposed device is&#xD;
      an attempt to improve upon current bite blocks by both protecting the bronchoscope and&#xD;
      positioning the jaw optimally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Residents in training in the Division of Respirology have limited experience in&#xD;
      fibre-optic bronchoscopy and perform it under the direct supervision of an expert. Null&#xD;
      hypothesis: the time to visualization of vocal cords with a fibre-optic bronchoscope by&#xD;
      residents learning in the Division of Respirology will be no different with the McKay airway&#xD;
      than with the conventional bite block or Williams Airway.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION When endotracheal intubation is known or predicted to be difficult, patients are&#xD;
      intubated awake using a flexible bronchoscope so that they can protect their airway with&#xD;
      normal upper airway muscle activity until the endotracheal tube (ETT) is safely in place. A&#xD;
      newly invented airway device, the McKay airway, (Appendix 2) may provide a better solution to&#xD;
      placing an ETT into the windpipe of an awake patient, (awake fibre-optic intubation: AFI) A&#xD;
      study is proposed to assess the functionality of the device for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect the bronchoscope, a bite block is used during AFI to protect the very delicate&#xD;
      glass fibres from damage from inadvertent biting by the patient. Currently used bite blocks&#xD;
      (Appendix 2, figure 5) protect the scope, but do not position the jaw or bronchoscope&#xD;
      optimally for scoping. This is not a problem for experienced bronchoscopists such as&#xD;
      respirologists, but can be for those, like anesthesiologists, who do bronchoscopy&#xD;
      infrequently. For these, the proposed device may be an improvement upon current bite blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Residents in training in the Division of Respirology have limited experience in&#xD;
      fibre-optic bronchoscopy and perform it under the direct supervision of an expert. Null&#xD;
      hypothesis: the time to visualization of vocal cords with a fibre-optic bronchoscope by&#xD;
      residents learning in the Division of Respirology will be no different with the McKay airway&#xD;
      than with the conventional bite block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: The proposed experiment is an unblinded repeated measures interventional&#xD;
      clinical trial with concealed randomization of which device is used first and which second.&#xD;
      Randomization will be by a computer-generated random number table (1s and 2s where 1 is&#xD;
      conventional bite block is used first and 2 means McKay airway first) transcribed to paper&#xD;
      cards in numbered opaque envelopes to be opened just prior to bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Time from beginning insertion of bronchoscope into the bite block to&#xD;
      visualization of vocal cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Scores will be recorded on rating scales for: ease of insertion, ease of&#xD;
      obtaining proper position of teeth in the device by patients, assessment of gag reflex.&#xD;
      Comments about overall impression will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants are of two kinds, patients and residents. Patients will be&#xD;
      consenting patients booked for bronchoscopy by pulmonologists at Royal University Hospital.&#xD;
      Excepted patients will be those who do not wish to participate and those with any health&#xD;
      conditions that the attending pulmonologist feels puts them at any added risk by&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: With University of Saskatchewan Research Ethics Board approval, the investigators&#xD;
      will recruit patients and obtain signed informed consent at the time of booking bronchoscopy&#xD;
      or on arrival for bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and privacy concerns: As well as the primary and secondary outcomes, data collection on&#xD;
      paper data sheets will include basic demographics. These are: age, gender, height, weight,&#xD;
      and diagnosis as well as airway characteristics (see Appendix 1, Data Sheet). Because this&#xD;
      may identify patients and breach their privacy, the data sheets will be identified only by&#xD;
      number. The de-identified data collection sheets will be labeled with a unique numerical&#xD;
      identifier (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc). The data collection sheet will be linked to the patient&#xD;
      Personal Health Number by way of a physically separate Master Data list (e.g., 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      etc.). (See attached - Master Data List) The de-identified data from the data collection&#xD;
      sheet (See Attached - Data Collection Sheet) will be transcribed by Dr. McKay to data base on&#xD;
      a password protected computer kept in a locked office in the Department of Anesthesiology at&#xD;
      all times. Identifiable patient information will not be transcribed electronically. Upon&#xD;
      completion of the study, Dr McKay will store electronic data files and paper forms in a&#xD;
      locked filing cabinet in the Department of Anesthesiology (accessible only by key code), as&#xD;
      per the University of Saskatchewan Research Integrity Policy&#xD;
      (http://www.usask.ca/university_secretary/policies/research/8_25.php). The Master Data List&#xD;
      (paper only) will be stored in a physically separate location from the data collection forms.&#xD;
      The hard copies of the data collection forms, master list, and completed consent forms will&#xD;
      be destroyed through the confidential paper disposal services of the SHR, while the&#xD;
      electronic data will be permanently deleted after 5 years as per the above University of&#xD;
      Saskatchewan Research Integrity Policy. We anticipate this data to be the basis for a&#xD;
      publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and at a national scientific meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety: The experiment will be overseen by the attending specialist respirologist who&#xD;
      will intervene immediately as needed and proceed as clinically indicated if any issue of&#xD;
      patient safety arises at any time. This is normal practice. We expect that risk to&#xD;
      participating patients is minimal. We anticipate the following incidence: 1) common (1-10%)&#xD;
      side effects: none. 2) uncommon (0.1 to 1%) side effects: mild abrasion of the mouth (which&#xD;
      can occur with the currently available awake intubation bite blocks and airways as often). 3)&#xD;
      rare (0.01-0.1%) side effects: zero. 4) Very rare (&lt;0.01%) side effects: sensitivity to the&#xD;
      plastic with irritation of the oral mucosa (which can occur with the currently available&#xD;
      awake intubation plastic bite blocks and airways as often). The McKay airway is made of&#xD;
      medical grade plastic. 5) Severe side effects: zero (prolonged hospital admission, admission&#xD;
      to intensive care, loss of limb or vital organ, or death). We believe that risk of&#xD;
      participation is not different from risk of bronchoscopy, and is safe in expert hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements. With a stopwatch, the investigator will measure the time from beginning to&#xD;
      place the bronchoscope in the mouth following topicalization to visualization of vocal cords&#xD;
      or epiglottis. Following bronchoscopy, the Respirologist will rate the modalities with rating&#xD;
      scales (see attached Data Sheet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants: There is no similar study from which to calculate sample size. We&#xD;
      will initially assuming that one modality is 0.2 times faster with standard deviation 0.2,&#xD;
      paired t-test sample size is calculated at n = 10, then recalculate based on the primary&#xD;
      outcome findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Demographic and rating data will be tabulated as observational; time&#xD;
      measurements compared by paired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test as mean ± standard deviation&#xD;
      and [95% Confidence Intervals] or median and [interquartile range] as appropriate following a&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality.&#xD;
