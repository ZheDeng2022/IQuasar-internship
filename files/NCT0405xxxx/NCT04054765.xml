  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of the Invite Only VR, with the aim to prevent the initiation of e-cigarette use in&#xD;
      teens by increasing their knowledge, decreasing their intentions to use e-cigarettes,&#xD;
      influencing their harm perceptions and attitudes associated with e-cigarettes, and increasing&#xD;
      self-efficacy associated with refusing peers involving e-cigarettes.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim #1: DEVELOPMENT: The researcher will update our current VR prototype into a&#xD;
      polished videogame intervention using input from 4 focus groups of 5 adolescents each (n =&#xD;
      20), aged 12-17 and the extant literature. These focus groups will inform the development of&#xD;
      the VR videogame intervention, Invite Only VR, for e-cigarette prevention among teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: EVALUATION: Conduct a pilot non-randomized cluster trial with 295 teens ages&#xD;
      11-14 comparing the Invite Only VR intervention vs. an attention/control non-health-related&#xD;
      VR videogame, collecting assessment data at baseline, post-gameplay, three months and six&#xD;
      months to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the preliminary impact of the intervention on e-cigarette use behaviors, knowledge,&#xD;
           nicotine addiction knowledge, perceived addictiveness of e-cigarettes, perceived&#xD;
           likelihood of using e-cigarettes, perceptions of harm, self-efficacy to refuse, social&#xD;
           approval of e-cigarettes, and e-cigarette social perceptions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the intervention's acceptability and feasibility by collecting quantitative and&#xD;
           qualitative data on teens' satisfaction and gameplay experience of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. preliminary evidence of the impact of Invite Only VR on players' perception and&#xD;
           experience of social pressure and social norm development&#xD;

    <description>To determine the impact of a VR prevention videogame intervention prototype, Invite Only VR, on participants' attitudes involving e-cigarette use - pretest survey. Participants will complete a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) and then play the videogame intervention. The survey includes 4 questions adapted from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014) focus on attitudes about e-cigarettes. Questions have 4 response choices ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) or 1 (definitely yes) to 4 (definitely not), or 1 (very unlikely) to 4 (very likely). Some items were reverse coded so that scores of 1 always represented less healthy attitudes and scores of 4 corresponded to more healthy attitudes. Items were averaged into a composite scale that ranged from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating healthier attitudes.</description>

        <title>Attitudes Towards E-cigarettes Pre-test</title>
        <description>To determine the impact of a VR prevention videogame intervention prototype, Invite Only VR, on participants' attitudes involving e-cigarette use - pretest survey. Participants will complete a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) and then play the videogame intervention. The survey includes 4 questions adapted from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014) focus on attitudes about e-cigarettes. Questions have 4 response choices ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) or 1 (definitely yes) to 4 (definitely not), or 1 (very unlikely) to 4 (very likely). Some items were reverse coded so that scores of 1 always represented less healthy attitudes and scores of 4 corresponded to more healthy attitudes. Items were averaged into a composite scale that ranged from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating healthier attitudes.</description>

        <description>To determine the impact of a VR prevention videogame intervention prototype, Invite Only VR, on participants' knowledge about e-cigarettes- 3 months post-test survey. Participants will complete a post-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software). The survey includes 15 questions adapted from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014) focus on knowledge about e-cigarettes. For knowledge, questions have 3 response choices (True, False, and not sure). Correct answers are scored as 1, incorrect are scored as 0, and not sure responses are also scored as 0. Total scores range from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating better performance.</description>

Participants will complete a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) before playing the videogame intervention. The survey includes 5 questions adapted from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014) focus on harm perceptions about e-cigarettes. Questions have 4 choices ranging from 1 (no harm) to 4 (a lot of harm). Some items are reverse coded such that higher mean scores indicate greater perceived harm of e-cigarettes. Items were averaged into a composite scale that ranged from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater perceived harm.</description>

          <description>To determine the impact of a VR prevention videogame intervention prototype, Invite Only VR, on participants' harm perceptions involving e-cigarette use - pretest survey. Participants will complete a pre-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) before playing the videogame intervention. The survey includes 5 questions adapted from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014) focus on harm perceptions about e-cigarettes. Questions have 4 choices ranging from 1 (no harm) to 4 (a lot of harm). Some items are reverse coded such that higher mean scores indicate greater perceived harm of e-cigarettes. Items were averaged into a composite scale that ranged from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater perceived harm.</description>

        <title>Refuse E-cigarettes Post-test</title>
        <description>To determine the impact of a VR prevention videogame intervention prototype, Invite Only VR, on participants' self-efficacy to refuse e-cigarettes - 6 months post-test survey. Participants completed a survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software) 6 months after playing the videogame intervention. The survey includes 6 questions adapted from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (2014) that focus on self-efficacy to refuse e-cigarettes. Questions are Likert scale and have 4 choices ranging from 1 (not at all sure) to 4 (definitely sure). Higher scores represent greater self-efficacy to refuse e-cigarettes across a variety of situations. Items were averaged into a composite scale that ranged from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater elf-efficacy to refuse e-cigarettes.</description>

        <description>To determine participants' satisfaction and gameplay experience - posttest survey (experimental only). Participants will complete a post-survey through a secured, data collection website (Qualtrics Data Collection Software). The survey includes questions adapted from a survey developed at the play2PREVENT Lab about gameplay satisfaction and experience. Questions have 4 choices ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Some items were reverse coded prior to all items being averaged into a composite scale that ranged from 1 to 4, with higher scores representing greater satisfaction with gameplay experience.</description>
