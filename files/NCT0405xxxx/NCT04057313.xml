      Coffee is the most consumed drink worldwide, sometimes needed to boost energy and other times&#xD;
      to entertain social connectivity. Caffeine is mostly present unbound in the plasma, only 10&#xD;
      to 30% of caffeine binds to plasma proteins. It is distributed freely into the intracellular&#xD;
      space, and it has a small distribution volume. Therefore, caffeine can pass through the&#xD;
      dialysis membrane during a standard hemodialysis session. In hemodialysis patients, headache&#xD;
      occurs in 40 to 75% of patients. Some authors have suggested that one of the reasons of&#xD;
      headache during hemodialysis is caffeine withdrawal. This trial aims to find whether coffee&#xD;
      intake during hemodialysis reduces the headache episodes. It is a randomized double blind&#xD;
      multicenter trial where 160 patients will be randomized to 2 groups: group 1 of 80 patients&#xD;
      will be given a cup of coffee each dialysis session for 4 weeks and group 2 will receive&#xD;
      decaffeinated coffee each dialysis session for 4 weeks.&#xD;

      Coffee is the most consumed drink worldwide, sometimes needed to boost energy and other times&#xD;
      to entertain social connectivity. It is known also to cause addiction and thus be a cause for&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms such as headache and irritability. Coffee is not contra-indicated in&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease. Caffeine is mostly present unbound in the plasma, only&#xD;
      10 to 30% of caffeine binds to plasma proteins. It is distributed freely into the&#xD;
      intracellular space, and it has a small distribution volume within the body around 0,7L/kg.&#xD;
      Therefore, caffeine can pass through the dialysis membrane during a standard hemodialysis&#xD;
      session. In hemodialysis patients, intra-dialytic hypotension, fatigue post-dialysis and&#xD;
      headache occur in 40 to 75% of patients. Some authors have suggested that one of the reasons&#xD;
      of headache during hemodialysis is caffeine withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to find out whether coffee consumption during dialysis could decrease&#xD;
      headache episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting All patients on chronic hemodialysis in three Lebanese dialysis units,&#xD;
      Saint-Georges Ajaltoun hospital, Hôtel-Dieu de France and Bellevue Medical Center will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and participants This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multi-center&#xD;
      clinical trial. Patients will be randomized to one of two arms and then group one will&#xD;
      receive the coffee during hemodialysis session and group two will receive decaffeinated&#xD;
      coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding will be ensured by designating an external employee that will hold the cups of&#xD;
      coffee to the unit's nurses every day with the name of each patient on the cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients will be assigned to receive coffee during hemodialysis or not using a&#xD;
      1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will receive a&#xD;
      cup of coffee (80 cc) in the middle of the dialysis session every session for 4 weeks. Group&#xD;
      2 will receive non-caffeinated cup of coffee (80 cc) in the middle of the dialysis session&#xD;
      every session for 4 weeks. The coffee that will be used is the boiled unfiltered Arabica&#xD;
      coffee with a ratio of water to coffee of 800 ml/125 g. Patients can add sugar to their&#xD;
      coffee if they want. Ultrafiltration rate will not exceed 13 mL//kg/hour for all included&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant timeline Every patient will be followed from first day of randomization till the&#xD;
      end of the month (4 weeks follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation If we consider a two-sided alpha of 5% and power of 90% and a&#xD;
      prevalence of headache in the dialysis population up to 75% that will be reduced by 25% in&#xD;
      the group taking caffeine, the total sample size needed would be 160 patients, 80 in each&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables that will be collected include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal information: age, sex, smoking, alcohol intake per week, hypertension (at least&#xD;
           one antihypertensive drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caffeine intake: number of coffee cups at home per day (outside the dialysis session),&#xD;
           coffee intake before the dialysis session (yes/no), coffee intake during the dialysis&#xD;
           session (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history: diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of headache or&#xD;
           migraine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications: beta blockers, antidepressants, benzodiazepine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dialysis sessions related information: dialysis vintage (months), urea reduction ratio&#xD;
           (URR) of the month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical variables: number of intra-dialytic hypotensive the month before the trial and&#xD;
           during the trial, number of intra-dialytic and home headache episodes during the trial,&#xD;
           pre-dialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate of the first and the&#xD;
           last session of the trial, insomnia before and at the end of the trial, energy after a&#xD;
           dialysis session before and after the trial and irritability before and after the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events will be also reported such as arrhythmia, tachycardia or hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Continuous variables will be presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      and categorical variables as percentages. The effectiveness of the randomization will be&#xD;
      checked by comparing baseline variables with the appropriate tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will depend on the distribution of the outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If outcome variables are normally or quasi-normally distributed, Hotelling's T-Squared will&#xD;
      be used as an overall multivariate test for the difference between the 2 groups, followed by&#xD;
      t-tests to assess individual outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If outcome variables are skewed, the Mann-Whitney test will be used. Bonferroni correction&#xD;
      will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons. A P-value of ≤0.05 is considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions Hypotensive episodes are defined as drop of systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg&#xD;
      or of 20 mmHg accompanied with clinical symptoms such as muscle cramps, chest pain, dyspnea,&#xD;
      dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, anxiety, paleness and&#xD;
      sweating. Hypotensive episodes during dialysis usually occur in 15-30% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritability and energy will be assessed based on two questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have you been a very nervous person, irritated by minor incidents? (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much energy do you feel after your dialysis session on a scale from 1 to 10?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia will be assessed by two questions: have you any difficulty sleeping at night?&#xD;
      (yes/no), how many hours do you sleep at night?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval The study will get approval from the ethics committee of Saint-Joseph&#xD;
      University and is in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.&#xD;
