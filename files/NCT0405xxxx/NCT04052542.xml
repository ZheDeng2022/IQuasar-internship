  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will pilot test three strategies designed to speed implementation of preventive&#xD;
      post-extubation noninvasive ventilation (NIV): one control strategy (traditional online&#xD;
      continuing medical education) and two novel strategies (interprofessional education and&#xD;
      just-in-time education).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a one-month intervention period, the investigators will pilot test the educational&#xD;
      strategies in three participating UPMC ICUs. Prior to receiving education, participants will&#xD;
      be invited to complete a short online survey. Participants in the control group will be&#xD;
      invited to complete a 30-minute online continuing education module, which will conclude with&#xD;
      a survey. Participants in the interprofessional education group will be invited to attend a&#xD;
      90-minute, in-person, interprofessional education session that will occur in or near the&#xD;
      participating ICU. A trained advance practice provider will provide participants in the&#xD;
      just-in-time education group with 5-10 minutes of education in the ICU when the ICU team is&#xD;
      rounding on a patient who is identified to be high risk for extubation failure. The&#xD;
      just-in-time education may occur more than once per day, depending on the number of high-risk&#xD;
      patients identified. All educational strategies will include content on the benefits of&#xD;
      preventive post-extubation NIV, the indications and contraindications for preventive&#xD;
      post-extubation NIV, and the value of working together as an interprofessional ICU team when&#xD;
      implementing preventive post-extubation NIV. Each educational intervention will include a&#xD;
      survey designed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the&#xD;
      educational strategies. The investigators will also directly observe instances of&#xD;
      interprofessional and just-in-time education and conduct in-person interviews to assess these&#xD;
      factors in a qualitative manner. Lastly, during the intervention period and the 6 months&#xD;
      before and after the intervention period, the investigators will collect data from the&#xD;
      electronic health record and analyze changes in percent of high-risk patients who receive&#xD;
      preventive post-extubation NIV, reintubation rate, duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
