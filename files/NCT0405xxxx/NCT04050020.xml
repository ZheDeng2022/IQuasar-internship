      The primary objective of the present study is to investigate and compare the treatment&#xD;
      efficacy of PRP injection vs placebo treatment in men with mild-moderate vasculogenic ED, as&#xD;
      measured by IIEF.The secondary objective of the present clinical trial is to study the&#xD;
      adverse events and safety of the PRP injection treatment in vasculogenic ED patients&#xD;

    <time_frame>at 24 weeks follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>MCID is defined according to baseline ED severity as:Improvement by 5 or more in the EF domain score of the IIEF for patients with moderate ED at baseline and by 2 or more in the EF domain score of the IIEF for patients with moderate ED at baseline</description>

    <description>EF domain of the IIEF questionnaire will be completed. IIEF-EF consists of items 1,2,3,4,5,15 of the IIEF questionnaire.According to the score of the iIEF-EF there are five categories of erectile function: 1-10 (Severe Erectile Dysfunction), 11-16(Moderate dysfunction), 17-21(Mild to moderate dysfunction), 22-25(Mild dysfunction), 26-30 (No dysfunction).</description>

    <time_frame>4,12, 24 weeks follow up visit</time_frame>
    <description>EDITS is an 11-item validated questionnaire assessing treatment satisfaction. The 11 items in the EDITS questionnaire are combined into an index score by computing the mean of the 11 item scores and multiplying this value by 25. This results in an EDITS index score with a range of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 100 (extremely high treatment satisfaction) for an individual patient.</description>

    <measure>The difference between the PRP group (2 sessions of PRP) and the placebo group in the the Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) after each injection treatment session</measure>
    <time_frame>at week 0 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by the pain VAS, right after each LIST session. Pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity . It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal (HVAS) or vertical (VVAS) line, usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100-mm scale]. To avoid clustering of scores around a preferred numeric value, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not recommended. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm</description>
