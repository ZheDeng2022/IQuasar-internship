  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, prospective biomarker study that will be conducted at Sinai Hospital of&#xD;
      Baltimore. After screening for patients who were treated with aspirin, thirty patients will&#xD;
      be treated with 81 mg enteric coated (EC) aspirin for 7 days in the &quot;lead-in&quot; period and then&#xD;
      will be randomly treated with EC aspirin (81mg qd) or EC aspirin (81mg qd) plus rivaroxaban&#xD;
      (2.5 mg bid) for 12 weeks. Platelet aggregation, soluble markers of platelet activation and&#xD;
      inflammation, thrombin generation kinetics and tissue factor (TF)-induced platelet-fibrin&#xD;
      clot strength will be assessed at baseline (after 7 days of treatment with 81 mg EC aspirin),&#xD;
      and 4 and 12 weeks after randomization of the study drug administration.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: to qualify, all subjects must meet have CAD and PAD as according to&#xD;
        criteria specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects meeting criteria for CAD$ must have one or more of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction within the past 20 years, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multivessel coronary disease* with symptoms or with history of stable or unstable&#xD;
             angina, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multivessel CABG surgery (* Refers to stenosis of ≥ 50% in 2 or more coronary&#xD;
             arteries, confirmed using invasive coronary angiography, or noninvasive imaging or&#xD;
             stress studies (eg, exercise or pharmacologic) suggestive of significant ischemia in 2&#xD;
             ≥ coronary territories; or in 1 coronary territory if at least 1 other territory has&#xD;
             been revascularized.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        $Subjects with the qualifying criteria of CAD must also met at least one of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 65 years, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;65 years and documented atherosclerosis or revascularization involving at least 2&#xD;

                       the brain, gastro-intestinal tract, lower limbs, upper limbs, or kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Subjects meeting criteria for PAD must have one or more of the&#xD;

                  angiography or by duplex ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Previous carotid revascularization or asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis ≥ 50%&#xD;
                  as diagnosed using duplex ultrasound or angiography.&#xD;

                    -  Subject may be of either sex and of any race, and must be &gt;18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subject agrees to not participate in any other investigational or invasive&#xD;
                       clinical study for a period of 4 months during the study period&#xD;
