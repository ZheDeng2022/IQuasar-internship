      This study is a Phase III, randomized, double blind, multi-center, active controlled,&#xD;
      2-treatment arm, parallel group, non-inferiority study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      diclofenac diethylamine 2.32% gel applied twice daily versus diclofenac diethylamine 1.16%&#xD;
      gel applied four times daily for 7 days in participants with acute ankle sprain. The&#xD;
      participants who experience an acute Grade I -II ankle sprain within the past 24 hours, and&#xD;
      pain on movement of at least 50 millimeter (mm) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      who will meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio,&#xD;
      immediately post injury. All participants will receive 4 tubes of study drug, for treatment&#xD;
      in morning, noon, late afternoon, and late evening, respectively. The very first dose of&#xD;
      study drug will be applied at the study center. The participants will be instructed to apply&#xD;
      the gel topically with the finger tips for approximately 1 minute in the morning, at noon,&#xD;
      late afternoon, and late evening for 7 days. Each tube will be labeled for use at one of&#xD;
      these 4 times. After the randomization visit (Visit 1/baseline visit- Day 1), participants&#xD;
      will return to the study site for post baseline visits- Visit 2 (Day 3), Visit 3 (Day 5), and&#xD;
      Visit 4 (Day 8 +/- 1 d) to complete efficacy and safety assessments. Baseline safety&#xD;
      laboratory test blood samples will be taken at Visit 1. End of study safety laboratory tests&#xD;
      will be performed at Visit 4, or in case of early termination on the day of termination. In&#xD;
      addition, the participants (ex-clinic) will assess pain intensity and pain relief at frequent&#xD;
      intervals on Day 1 and then at each study drug application throughout the rest of the study.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Participant will lie down on an even horizontal surface and investigator will gently lift the leg and hold it up in the air at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. While holding the leg with one hand, the investigator will perform a gentle inversion of the foot of the injured ankle to reach an angle of approx. 30 degrees. The extent of ankle pain will be evaluated by the participant in answer to the question: &quot;How would you describe your ankle pain right now?&quot; The pain-on-movement will be registered by the participant by drawing a perpendicular line on the 100 mm VAS scale with anchors at 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 = &quot;extreme pain&quot;. Change from baseline in POM will be calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the Day 5 value.</description>

    <description>Safety will be assessed by evaluating the number, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study product including any washout or lead-in product or investigational assessment, whether or not considered related to the study product, including any washout or lead-in product or investigational assessment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tenderness as Measured by Pressure Algometry on Days 3, 5 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The tenderness will be measured by applying pressure in an area of 1 cm^2 at the center of the injured area, using a handheld pressure algometer. The investigator will apply the pressure gauge to the marked tender point of maximum sensitivity by placing the gauge at 90 degrees angle vertical to the skin. The pressure pain threshold will be estimated by instructing participants to say 'stop' when the sensation of pressure becomes the first sensation of pain. Change from baseline in tenderness will be calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8 values respectively.</description>

    <measure>Difference Between the Tenderness Measurement of Affected Ankle and Contralateral Ankle on Days 3, 5 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The tenderness will be measured by applying pressure in an area of 1 cm^2 at the center of the injured area, using a handheld pressure algometer. The investigator will apply the pressure gauge to the marked tender point of maximum sensitivity by placing the gauge at 90 degrees angle vertical to the skin. The pressure pain threshold will be estimated by instructing participants to say 'stop' when the sensation of pressure becomes the first sensation of pain. Difference between tenderness of treated painful area and corresponding anatomical position of the healthy uninjured contralateral side will be measured at Days 3, 5 and 8 to assess the efficacy of treatment in inflammation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ankle Joint Function on Days 3, 5 and 8 as Assessed by Karlsson Scoring Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Karlsson Scoring scale is a validated scoring scale which measures the recovery of ankle joint function after an acute ligament injury. Assessments will be made in the eight categories (score): pain (20), swelling (10), instability (subjective) (15), stiffness (5), stair climbing (10), running (10), work activities (15), and the use of a support device (5). Total score ranges from 0 &quot;worst possible score&quot; to 90 &quot;best possible score&quot;. Change from baseline in the ankle joint function will be calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8 values respectively.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Circumference of Affected Ankle as Measured by Figure of Eight Method on Days 3, 5 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>One-quarter-inch wide (about 63 mm), retractable, plastic tape measure will be utilized to the measurements of each participant's ankle in centimeters (cm). Each participant will be seated comfortably in a long sitting position with both feet extended beyond the end of the plinth in a slight dorsiflexion position. The figure of eight-method will be applied to both feet and the tape measure will be wrapped around the ankle along the following course: the beginning of the tape placed midway between the tibialis anterior tendon and lateral malleolus and then continued across anatomically defined points in the form of a figure of eight around the ankle joint. The tape localization of the first measurement would be marked with an appropriate marker. Each ankle will be measured three times and the average will be calculated. Change from baseline in circumference will be calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8 values respectively.</description>

    <description>One-quarter-inch wide (about 63 mm), retractable, plastic tape measure will be utilized to the measurements of each participant's ankle in cm.

The tape localization of the first measurement would be marked with an appropriate marker. Each ankle will be measured three times and the average will be calculated. The difference in this average between ankles tracks the natural course of disease on Day 3, Day 5 and Day 8.</description>

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) From 0 - 24 Hours Post First Dose (Day 1) and From 96 - 120 Hours Post First Dose (Day 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 - 24 hours post first dose (Day 1) and from 96 - 120 hours post first dose (Day 5)</time_frame>
    <description>SPID will be calculated from the equation: SPIDt = ΣPIDt (timet - timet-1)(h); where PI= pain intensity (measured on 100 mm VAS scale with anchors at 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 = &quot;extreme pain&quot;), t= time in hours post first dose (0-24 hours for Day 1 and 96-120 hours for Day 5 calculations). A higher value in SPID indicates greater pain relief.</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) From 0 - 24 Hours Post First Dose (Day 1) and From 96 - 120 Hours Post First Dose (Day 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 - 24 hours post first dose (Day 1) and from 96 - 120 hours post first dose (Day 5)</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR will be calculated from the equation: TOTPAR = ΣRt x (timet - timet-1); where Rt = the pain relief score at time t and time t = time in hours post first dose. Pain relief scores will be measured by using a 5 point categorical pain relief rating scale. (None = 0, A Little Relief = 1, Some = 2, A Lot = 3, Complete Relief = 4). The minimum possible TOTPAR 6 score = 0, maximum possible score = 24.</description>

One or two tablets may be taken, repeated after at least 4 hours, if needed, up to a maximum of 2000 mg (four tablets) per day.
