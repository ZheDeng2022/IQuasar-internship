  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Camidanlumab&#xD;
      Tesirine (ADCT-301) in participants with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Camidanlumab Tesirine (ADCT-301) in participants with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma. This study will enroll approximately 100 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camidanlumab Tesirine (ADCT-301) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), composed of the human&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, HuMaxÂ®-TAC, which is directed against human CD25. The antibody is&#xD;
      conjugated through a protease cleavable linker to SG3199, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer&#xD;
      cytotoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant the study will include a screening period (of up to 28 days), a&#xD;
      treatment period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a follow-up period (approximately every 12-week&#xD;
      visits) for up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue treatment for up to 1 year or until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients benefiting clinically at 1 year may continue treatment after a case by&#xD;
      case review with the Sponsor.&#xD;

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a tool for evaluating quality of life (QoL). The instrument consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the visual analog scale (VAS). The 1st part comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The participant evaluates each dimension by ticking the box next to the most appropriate level (1-5). This decision results in a 1-digit number that represents the level selected for that dimension. A high level indicates a negative rating. These digits are combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state. The 2nd part involves the participant indicating their health state on that day on a VAS (by placing an 'X'), where the endpoints are labelled 'the best health you can imagine' (100) and 'the worst health you can imagine' (0). A low score indicates a negative result.</description>

    <description>The FACT-Lym is a lymphoma-specific subscale for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 15 specific items that are used together with the core 27-item questionnaire FACT-G. The participant is asked to give each item a score of between 0-4 (0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = very much). A higher score indicates a worse level of QoL.</description>
