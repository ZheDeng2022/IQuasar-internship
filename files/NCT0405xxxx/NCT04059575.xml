      Research design: The study protocol was approved and required permissions were taken from&#xD;
      related tennis club officials, and a written consent was obtained from all the participants'&#xD;
      parents about the study. Thirty-three young tennis players aged between 9 and 12 were&#xD;
      included in our study. Assessment were done bare (no tape), after 45 min of performance plus&#xD;
      kinesio taping application (PP application) and after 45 min of gold text FP kinesio taping&#xD;
      application (GT application). We were randomly taped with either PP or GT taping applications&#xD;
      using an online random allocation software program (GraphPad Software QuickCalcs, GraphPad&#xD;
      Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Thirty min of rest was given between 2 taping applications&#xD;
      after the removal of the first tape. One participant was not able to complete the second&#xD;
      taping procedure. PP and GT taping applications were done by using kinesio taping muscle&#xD;
      facilitation techniques to Quadriceps and Gastrosoleus muscles. I-shaped tape with a tension&#xD;
      of 10-35% was used for muscle facilitation. All patients were assessed by an experienced&#xD;
      physiotherapist, and the tapings were done by another experienced physiotherapist in order to&#xD;
      provide a single blind structure of the study.&#xD;

      Participants: Thirty-three young tennis players aged between 9 and 12 yrs were recruited in&#xD;
      the study. The exclusion criteria included those (a) with soft tissue or bone problems&#xD;
      affecting lower extremity, (b) who had acute inflammation affecting lower extremity region,&#xD;
      (c) had scoliosis, (d) who had undergone any orthopedic surgery, (e) who had defined any pain&#xD;
      or painful area at lower extremities and (f) who were obese (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: Thermal analysis was done for risk of injury including both lower extremities.&#xD;
      Quadriceps muscle was chosen from upper leg and gastro soleus muscle was chosen from lower&#xD;
      leg region for thermal analysis. The thermo graphic assessment was performed by using FLIR E5&#xD;
      (FLIR Systems AB, Sweden) thermal camera in order to evaluate which muscles had the highest&#xD;
      thermal activity while maintaining stable upright posture. The part of muscle with more&#xD;
      activation (greater heat) was measured by the thermo graphic camera and the heat was recorded&#xD;
      in centigrade. Each participant was thermo graphically evaluated in the same room (ambient&#xD;
      temperature, 21°C) and participants were left for 10-20 minutes to 'acclimatize' to the&#xD;
      thermographic imaging environment FLIR E5 Thermal Camera, with a resolution of 120 x 90&#xD;
      pixels was used for thermal imaging and the Color Palette iron was chosen for displaying the&#xD;
      images. It is indicated that IR imaging may be a reliable and valid measure of treatment&#xD;
      outcomes with clinical utility and sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power analysis indicated that 33 participants for total were needed with 80 % power and a&#xD;
      5 % type 1 error. The power analysis of our study showed a power of 80% with tissue&#xD;
      temperature as the primary outcome. The data were analyzed using statistical software (SPSS&#xD;
      version 18, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All the statistical analyses were set a priori at an&#xD;
      alpha level of p&lt;0.05. The tests for homogeneity (Levene's test) and normality (Shapiro-Wilk)&#xD;
      were used to determine the appropriate statistical methods. According to the test results,&#xD;
      nonparametric Friedman test was used for comparisons between baseline, first taping and last&#xD;
      taping. Wilcoxon test was used for possible differences which may occur between taping&#xD;
      applications in order to identify the application that provided the difference. Parametric&#xD;
      test assumptions were not possible due to small sample size and inhomogeneous parameters.&#xD;

    <description>A vertical jump test was performed before and after the application of Kinesio taping® to their quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles according to Kase's recommendations. The height and flight time data was collected using a portable optical timing system (Optojump Next; Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) during a counter movement jump. Mean maximum jump height and flight time were averaged from three attempts. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess the influence taping condition on vertical jump performance.</description>
