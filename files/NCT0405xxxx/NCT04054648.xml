  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (present in 1 of 5 Canadian adults) increases the risk of heart attack&#xD;
      and stroke. Blood pressure lowering pills reduce this risk - but perhaps not optimally. A&#xD;
      Spanish study suggests that using blood pressure pills at bedtime, instead of in the morning&#xD;
      (when they are most commonly used), reduces death, heart attack, and stroke by more than 50%.&#xD;
      If true, a switch to bedtime prescribing would have more impact on the health of those with&#xD;
      high blood pressure than whether high blood pressure is treated at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BedMed, a community-based Canadian primary care trial, is already running and looking both to&#xD;
      validate the findings of this Spanish study and to determine whether there might be&#xD;
      unrecognized harms of bedtime use (such as more falls and fractures as a result of lower&#xD;
      overnight blood pressure). One very important population that is likely to be more sensitive&#xD;
      to the effects of medications, and almost always excluded from randomized trials, are the&#xD;
      frail elderly (such as those who are resident in nursing homes). In order to have the&#xD;
      greatest information about the safety and effectiveness of bedtime blood pressure&#xD;
      medications, the BedMed team is additionally conducting a similar trial to BedMed in nursing&#xD;
      homes (&quot;BedMed-Frail&quot; - the subject of this trial registration) to determine whether the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of bedtime prescribing differ in this highly understudied population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basics of the trial: When patients are admitted to nursing homes, neither they nor their&#xD;
      physicians are consulted about the timing of blood pressure medication. Unless explicitly&#xD;
      stated to be otherwise, blood pressure pills are instead largely arbitrarily assigned for&#xD;
      morning use by default. Given there is evidence that bedtime administration may be safer, the&#xD;
      nursing homes participating in BedMed-Frail will have each hypertensive resident randomized&#xD;
      to either continue with morning blood pressure medication use, as is their norm, or to have&#xD;
      their facility's pharmacist gradually switch each residents blood pressure pills to bedtime.&#xD;
      Over a period of roughly 2 years, health outcomes in these facilities will be tracked using&#xD;
      routinely collected electronic health data to determine differences in things like&#xD;
      hospitalization, death, or hip fractures - and at the end of the study the investigators hope&#xD;
      to determine whether or not the recommendations for blood pressure medication timing in frail&#xD;
      older adults should differ from those for the general population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BedMed trial (led out of the University of Alberta and funded by both Alberta Innovates&#xD;
      Health Solutions, and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research) is a pragmatic&#xD;
      multi-provincial trial intended to determine whether bedtime antihypertensive use, as&#xD;
      compared to conventional morning use, reduces major adverse cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      community dwelling primary care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BedMed-Frail, led by the same group of investigators, is a complementary but separate&#xD;
      randomized trial evaluating whether the risks and benefits of bedtime antihypertensive use&#xD;
      differ in a long-term care (LTC) population. To accomplish this, within participating Alberta&#xD;
      LTC and supportive living facilities, eligible residents with hypertension will be randomized&#xD;
      at the patient level to the antihypertensive medication timing intervention (i.e. bedtime&#xD;
      versus continued morning use). Trial outcomes and baseline characteristics are drawn from&#xD;
      routinely collected electronic health data - using both provincial administrative health&#xD;
      claims data and the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (RAI-MDS), which is a&#xD;
      standard instrument for collecting clinical information in Canadian LTC facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BedMed-Frail is event driven, receiving quarterly reporting of total events from the Alberta&#xD;
      Support for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) Unit's Data Platform. The trial will end upon&#xD;
      observation of 368 primary outcome events. Upon observation of half that number, an&#xD;
      independent data safety monitoring board (IDSMB) chaired by Dr. James Wright (Cochrane&#xD;
      Hypertension Review Group Co-ordinating Editor) will examine all available outcomes. If p is&#xD;
      ≤ 0.001 for benefit (the Haybittle-Peto boundary - recommended to reduce the chance of&#xD;
      stopping too early and magnifying benefit), or if p is ≤ 0.05 for harm, the IDSMB will apply&#xD;
      clinical judgement and make recommendations to the steering committee on whether the trial&#xD;
      should break early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of BedMed-Frail are primarily designed to be analogous to the cardiovascular and&#xD;
      safety outcomes monitored for in the community BedMed study. However BedMed-Frail is also&#xD;
      examining for differences in behaviour issues between groups. Both behavioural problems, and&#xD;
      blood pressure, have circadian rhythms. Blood pressure is normally lower overnight and&#xD;
      behavioural problems in long term care residents typically worsen during the same period - a&#xD;
      phenomenon known as &quot;sundowning&quot;. Conceivably, there could be a relationship between the two&#xD;
      such that behaviour problems might improve, or worsen, with bedtime antihypertensive use. The&#xD;
      investigators will report the behavioural outcomes as a secondary analysis, in a separate&#xD;
      publication, with the primary outcome for that secondary analysis being an MDS record by the&#xD;
      care team that problem behaviours are present a minimum of 4 days per week and not easily&#xD;
      altered (see detailed description below).&#xD;
