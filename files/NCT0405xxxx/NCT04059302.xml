  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of online cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to improve markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      among middle aged adults (40-64 years) with chronic insomnia who are at moderate-to-high risk&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease. Multiple trials have revealed face to face and digital CBT-I&#xD;
      improves insomnia symptoms and associated daytime functioning. However, CBT-I has not been&#xD;
      tested as a primary prevention intervention to reduce risk for CVD. Mid-life adults are a&#xD;
      high-risk group for the emergence of CVD with detrimental consequences pervading into older&#xD;
      adulthood including reduced quality of life and greater health care costs. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate whether online CBT-I affects vascular and cardiac function and structure at&#xD;
      post-treatment and 8-week follow-up in a community-based sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Online CBT-I will improve indices of cardiovascular function and structure&#xD;
      compared to a wait-list control group at post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Improvements in indices of cardiovascular function and structure will be&#xD;
      maintained at 8-week follow-up in the online CBT-I group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial, comparing internet-delivered cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to a wait-list control group on pre-post trial changes in&#xD;
      indices of cardiovascular structure and function among community-based middle-aged adults&#xD;
      with insomnia and moderate-to-high risk for cardiovascular disease, the investigators will&#xD;
      recruit and enroll 38 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial screening will be conducted with an online survey. If they meet preliminary study&#xD;
      criteria, then research staff will contact the participant to schedule an in-person, baseline&#xD;
      assessment visit. They will be instructed that they must meet fasting requirements prior to&#xD;
      this visit to obtain accurate cardiovascular physiology measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline assessment visit, the participants will undergo the informed consent process,&#xD;
      complete questionnaire inquiring about medical, mental, and sleep health history, undergo a&#xD;
      brief physical (vital signs, height, weight), and complete cardiovascular physiology&#xD;
      assessment. If the participants remain eligible after these assessment, then the pariticpants&#xD;
      will receive orientation on how to complete an online sleep diary while simultaneously&#xD;
      wearing a wrist actigraph to track sleep and activity for the next 7 nights. This procedure&#xD;
      is for baseline assessment. It will not be used to further screen participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants complete this baseline sleep assessment, then they will randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either immediate treatment with internet delivered CBT-I or a wait-list control&#xD;
      group. The intervention group will receive an email with their own personal subscription to&#xD;
      the online CBT-I program. Both groups will continue to wear the wrist actigraph for the&#xD;
      duration of the trial. The immediate CBT-I group will complete sleep diaries within the&#xD;
      online therapy program throughout the trial, whereas the wait-list control group will&#xD;
      complete email-delivered, online sleep diaries from study staff throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia intervention is based in a standardized,&#xD;
      manualized treatment designed to decrease sleep-inhibiting cognitions and behaviors, and to&#xD;
      alter sleep-wake schedules. This fully automated therapy tailors its program features&#xD;
      according to sleep diary data inputs. The therapy will consist of CBTI-I components: stimulus&#xD;
      control therapy, sleep restriction therapy, cognitive therapy, and sleep education. The first&#xD;
      week of treatment will solely focus on sleep education and completion of sleep logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the treatment period, all participants will complete one more week of&#xD;
      sleep diaries and wearing the wrist actigraph. The participants also will be scheduled to&#xD;
      attend their post-treatment/trial in-person visit for assessment and to return the actigraph.&#xD;
      Participants will complete questionnaires and undergo cardiovascular physiological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this post-treatment visit, the wait-list control group will receive their subscription&#xD;
      of the internet-delivered CBT-I program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to immediate internet delivered CBT-I will be scheduled for an&#xD;
      8-week follow-up visit during which they will once again complete outcome questionnaires and&#xD;
      cardiovascular physiological assessment.&#xD;
