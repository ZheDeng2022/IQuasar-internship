  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We assume that an early iterative automatic CT scan analysis (D0, D1 and D3) by different AI&#xD;
      approaches will allow an early differentiation of the tissues evolution after TBI. Our&#xD;
      objective is to couple theses scan profiles to a neurological evolution, measured by&#xD;
      therapeutic intensity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury is a common and serious pathology, responsible of an important&#xD;
      morbi-mortality. The TBI can be consider as a complex set of nosological entities of&#xD;
      different evolution with difficult early identification whereas the main issue of this&#xD;
      pathology depends on prevention and management of the lesions caused by the initial cerebral&#xD;
      aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different evolutionary profiles seems to exist and sometimes coexists: edema evolution,&#xD;
      hemorrhagic transformation and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption issues with&#xD;
      hydrocephalus apparition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no Imaging methods that can be used in every day clinical management that&#xD;
      allows a visualization, quantification and prediction of these different lesional evolutions&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan is the reference imaging method for TBI patient monitoring. It allows a lesion&#xD;
      description, a therapeutic adaptation and an evaluation of the prognostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if it is used as a routine examination, the analysis of cerebral scanners remains manual&#xD;
      and a non-quantitative one, which make a little informative analysis as far as lesions&#xD;
      evolution is concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it has been established the automatic MRI analysis with AI approach allows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - To show aspects of images that can't be seen to the naked eye&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - To automatically segment and quantify the different tissues (edema, hemorrhage...).&#xD;
           First tests on this kind of analysis on CT scans shows that this technology can be&#xD;
           transferred from MRI to CT scans and more importantly it brings out new quantitative&#xD;
           informations on cerebral lesions evolution.&#xD;
