  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of 2141-V11 in people who&#xD;
      have cancer that does not respond to standard treatment and who have skin lesions (skin&#xD;
      tumors) associated with their cancer. The study will also test how the body processes and&#xD;
      responds to 2141-V11, and if the study drug has cancer fighting activity in people. The study&#xD;
      drug activates a naturally occurring protein called CD40. By activating CD40, cells of the&#xD;
      immune system are better able to identify and kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are testing if injection of 2141-V11 into metastasis to the skin will be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated, and may result in immune activation in patients with solid tumors that have&#xD;
      metastasis to the skin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the Fc-engineered variant 2141-V11 in&#xD;
      patients with previously treated relapsed or refractory solid tumors and locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors to the skin amenable to intratumoral injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to the study: a dose-finding stage (Part I), and a dose expansion stage&#xD;
      (Part II). Both Part I and Part II of the study will include patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic cancers of the skin which are not amenable to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be used (Part I). Successive cohorts of&#xD;
      participants (3 participants/cohort) will be started on a fixed dose intratumoral injection&#xD;
      of 2141V11 at the dose assigned to their cohort. The study drug, 2141-V11, will be dosed once&#xD;
      every 3 weeks. The study drug is administered in cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of study participants in Part I will receive the lowest dose of study drug.&#xD;
      The next group of study participants will receive the next higher dose. This dosing scheme&#xD;
      continues until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      will be defined as 1 dose level below the dose in which DLTs are observed in &gt;33% of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Part II of the study will receive the MTD determined from Part 1 (dose&#xD;
      escalation) of the study. Part II participants in the study will also receive two&#xD;
      vaccinations (KLH and tetanus) to allow monitoring of their immune function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both Part I and II can continue to receive cycles of study drug at their&#xD;
      assigned dose if they do not experience progression of disease, a serious adverse event, and&#xD;
      the study is ongoing.&#xD;
