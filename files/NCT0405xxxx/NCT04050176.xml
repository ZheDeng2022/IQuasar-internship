      The study will employ a randomized longitudinal clinical trial design to evaluate the&#xD;
      relative efficacy of a blinded hypnotic tapering protocol when used in combination with&#xD;
      therapist delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) for enhancing hypnotic&#xD;
      discontinuation rates. A blinded SMT+CBTI intervention will be compared to open-label&#xD;
      SMT+CBTI.&#xD;

      Treatment-seeking insomnia sufferers most often present in primary care venues where the&#xD;
      first and usually only treatment is a prescription for a sedative hypnotic, typically a&#xD;
      benzodiazepine (BZD) or newer benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BzRA). For some patients,&#xD;
      short-term or intermittent hypnotic use provides satisfactory insomnia relief. However, more&#xD;
      than 65% of individuals who are prescribed hypnotics use them for more than a year, and &gt; 30%&#xD;
      remain on these agents for more than five years. Whereas some patients may appreciate partial&#xD;
      or full relief of insomnia symptoms with ongoing hypnotic use, continuous long-term use of&#xD;
      these agents may not represent optimal therapy. Many insomnia patients who participate in&#xD;
      non-drug insomnia therapy such as cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy (CBT-I) achieve&#xD;
      sustained insomnia remission long after a time-limited course of treatment. However, it is&#xD;
      difficult for most long-term hypnotic users to convert from use of medications to a&#xD;
      self-management approach. Interventions that combine CBT-I with supervised medication&#xD;
      tapering (SMT) have shown the greatest promise for achieving this outcome, but almost 50% of&#xD;
      patients who receive this assistance either fail to discontinue their hypnotics or return to&#xD;
      them even if they do achieve short-term abstinence. Our clinical and research observations&#xD;
      suggest that psychological factors including sleep-related performance anxiety, low&#xD;
      sleep-related self-efficacy and beliefs about needs for medications interact to lead to&#xD;
      difficulties abstaining from hypnotic use. Moreover, our highly promising pilot data suggest&#xD;
      that such factors may be mitigated by use of a blinded SMT protocol which appears to increase&#xD;
      rates of medication abstinence. The current project will use a 2 x 4 randomized longitudinal&#xD;
      clinical trial design to test the relative efficacy of our highly promising blinded tapering&#xD;
      protocol, vis a vis open-label tapering, when combined with therapist delivered CBT-I. A&#xD;
      sample of 260 will be enrolled, complete pre-intervention baseline measures and then be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to: (1) a blinded hypnotic SMT + therapist delivered CBT-I; or (2)&#xD;
      open-label tapering + CBT-I. During treatment all enrollees will first receive one on one&#xD;
      treatment sessions with a trained CBT-I therapist over a 6 week period while maintaining&#xD;
      baseline doses of their respective hypnotics. They then will begin a 10 week SMT during which&#xD;
      they are provided a blinded or open-label tapering SMT protocol. During this phase they will&#xD;
      have their hypnotic medication doses reduced by 25% every two weeks. Immediately after&#xD;
      completing the SMT and again at 3- and 6-month follow-ups they will complete study outcome&#xD;
      measures. The primary study outcome will be hypnotic discontinuance rates of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups. Secondary outcomes include nights of hypnotic use per week, nightly average&#xD;
      dosage of hypnotic used in diazepam equivalents as well as scores on sleep quality, daytime&#xD;
      fatigue and quality of life. This study will lead to refining guidelines for tapering methods&#xD;
      and providing a better understanding of treatment outcome predictors so as to provide more&#xD;
      successful, person-centered interventions.&#xD;
