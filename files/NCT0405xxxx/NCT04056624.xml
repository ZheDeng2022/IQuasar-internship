      The central goal of this proposal is to examine validity and sensitivity of RS-assessed skin&#xD;
      carotenoid status as a marker of F&amp;V intake in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of&#xD;
      individuals. First, investigators will examine the association (RS Device Validity) between&#xD;
      RS-assessed skin carotenoids and the primary outcomes of objectively-measured plasma&#xD;
      carotenoids and self-reported F&amp;V consumption across four diverse groups:&#xD;
      African-American/Black, Asian, White, and Hispanic/Latino (n=213). Then the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial to define the relative skin carotenoid responses&#xD;
      (RS Device Sensitivity) across racial-ethnic groups, in comparison with plasma carotenoid&#xD;
      responses. The investigators will conduct a 6-week randomized controlled trial of a&#xD;
      carotenoid-containing juice intervention [placebo control, low and high dose juice (N=156).&#xD;
      Finally, the genetic basis for racial/ethnic group differences in skin carotenoid responses&#xD;
      to diet will be investigated through hypothesis-driven genomic analysis of participants from&#xD;
      Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A diet rich in fruits and vegetables (F&amp;Vs) is associated with lower risk of&#xD;
      nutrition-related chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. Despite these benefits, the US&#xD;
      population under-consumes F&amp;Vs, with particularly low intake in disadvantaged populations.&#xD;
      Low F&amp;V intake results in higher rates of nutrition-related chronic disease among&#xD;
      disadvantaged populations when compared with more advantaged populations. Detecting and&#xD;
      addressing inadequate F&amp;V intake in these populations is needed to reduce such disparities.&#xD;
      Yet, there is still no commonly used predictive, objective measure of F&amp;V intake for&#xD;
      surveillance or determination of policy or intervention effectiveness. The current objective,&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; marker of F&amp;V intake is blood carotenoid concentration-an expensive,&#xD;
      time-intensive, and invasive measurement. Traditional methods of self-reported dietary&#xD;
      assessment are imprecise and have diminished utility in rural and disadvantaged populations&#xD;
      due to low literacy, numeracy, and internet connectivity. In the past decade, skin carotenoid&#xD;
      status assessed by non-invasive resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) has emerged as a promising&#xD;
      biomarker of F&amp;V intake. Reflection spectroscopy (RS) is an improvement over RRS, offering&#xD;
      stronger signals, faster data acquisition, and greater portability in a commercially&#xD;
      available device (Veggie Meter, Longevity Link Corporation). However, a hurdle impedes use of&#xD;
      RS in scientific studies: to date, nearly all of the non-invasive skin carotenoid validation&#xD;
      has been conducted in non-Hispanic whites, primarily by RRS. Therefore, it is critical to&#xD;
      evaluate RS in racially and ethnically diverse populations. The central goal of this proposal&#xD;
      is to examine validity and sensitivity of RS-assessed skin carotenoid status as a marker of&#xD;
      F&amp;V intake in a racially and ethnically diverse sample of individuals. First, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine the association (RS Device Validity) between RS-assessed skin&#xD;
      carotenoids and the primary outcomes of objectively-measured plasma carotenoids and&#xD;
      self-reported F&amp;V consumption across four diverse groups: African-American/Black, Asian,&#xD;
      White, and Hispanic/Latino (target n = 320 but due to Covid-19, N=213). Then the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to define the relative skin&#xD;
      carotenoid responses (RS Device Sensitivity) across racial-ethnic groups, in comparison with&#xD;
      plasma carotenoid responses. The investigators will conduct an 6-week randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of a carotenoid-containing juice intervention [placebo control, low and high dose juice&#xD;
      across 4 genetically-stratified racial-ethnic groups (goal n = 156). Finally, the genetic&#xD;
      basis for racial/ethnic group differences in skin carotenoid responses to diet will be&#xD;
      investigated through hypothesis-driven genomic analysis of participants from Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
      The results of this study will prepare RS for mass deployment in population surveillance&#xD;
      studies and community-based intervention trials, ultimately leading to more accurate&#xD;
      determination of the most effective strategies to reduce health disparities related to low&#xD;
      F&amp;V intake in the United States and beyond.&#xD;
