  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial for the frontline treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed AML or MDS following allo-HCT. Eligible subjects will receive up to 4 cycles of&#xD;
      combined modality treatment. The number of cycles depends on response, toxicity, and the&#xD;
      remaining cell dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Peripheral white blood cell count &lt;50 x 10^9/L. The use of hydroxyurea for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects and spouse/partner who are of childbearing potential must be using highly&#xD;
             effective contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control (at least 1 of which&#xD;

             study (for at least 3 months after the last dose of ruxolitinib if study treatment is&#xD;
             stopped early or subject withdraws consent). Highly effective contraception is defined&#xD;

             Persisting fever without signs or symptoms of infection will not be interpreted as an&#xD;
             active uncontrolled infection. Subjects with a controlled infection receiving&#xD;
             definitive therapy for 72 hours prior to enrollment are eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or sexually active and unwilling to use&#xD;
             effective birth control for the duration of the study, as agents in this study are in&#xD;
             pregnancy category C: Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the&#xD;
             fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and category D:&#xD;
             there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from&#xD;
             investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days prior to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior therapy for relapse after allo-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior DLI. CD34-selected boost is allowed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients or donors with any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, might interfere with the subject's participation in the trial, pose&#xD;
             any additional risk for the patient/donor, or confounds the assessments of the&#xD;
             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known allergies, hypersensitivity or intolerance to ruxolitinib or&#xD;
