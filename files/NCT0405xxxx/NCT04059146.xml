  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with individuals who have chronic&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy (AT). This study investigates the effects of education on outcomes&#xD;
      (specified in hypotheses below) related to participation in an exercise program. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two educational programs. All participants will receive the same&#xD;
      exercise intervention. This study will consent and randomize 66 participants, who will&#xD;
      complete 2 in-person evaluation sessions (baseline, 8-week follow-up), 8 treatment sessions&#xD;
      with a physical therapist (between baseline and 8-week follow-up), and 1 online evaluation&#xD;
      sessions (12-week follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that 1) a biopsychosocial approach to education will decrease pain (NPRS) and&#xD;
      disability (PROMIS physical function) more than the standard of care for patients with AT, 2)&#xD;
      exercise will improve all three pain mechanisms examined in this RCT (increased PPT,&#xD;
      decreased kinesiophobia, increased number of heel raises).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility randomized controlled trial was designed to address the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 examines if education on central pain mechanisms (i.e. biopsychosocial&#xD;
      approach) compared to education on peripheral pain mechanisms (i.e. standard of care&#xD;
      utilizing a biomedical approach) is more effective at reducing pain and disability in a pilot&#xD;
      RCT exercise program for Achilles tendinopathy. We hypothesize that a biopsychosocial&#xD;
      approach to education will decrease pain (NPRS) and disability (PROMIS physical function)&#xD;
      more than the standard of care for patients with AT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 determines which central pain mechanisms (nociplastic pain, pain psychology,&#xD;
      motor dysfunction) are improved by an exercise program, regardless of education group. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that exercise will improve all three central pain mechanisms (increased PPT,&#xD;
      decreased kinesiophobia, increased number of heel raises).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 66 adults with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT) will be enrolled (consented and&#xD;
      randomized) in this single-site pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). All data will be&#xD;
      collected at a single site within an academic medical center. A pilot RCT comparing&#xD;
      effectiveness of exercise with pain education to standard of care, i.e. exercise with&#xD;
      biomedical education. Participants will be randomized to treatment group using a permuted&#xD;
      block randomization scheme stratified by sex and AT type (insertional and midportion).&#xD;
      Participants will complete up to 7 treatment sessions over an 8-week period. With an&#xD;
      anticipated 10% dropout rate, we plan to analyze data on 30 adults with chronic AT per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete 2 evaluation sessions at baseline and 8-week follow-up. Evaluation&#xD;
      sessions will involve the following 4 types of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical exam (including ultrasound imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires (demographics, symptom description, and psychological) Private,&#xD;
           identifiable information will be collected via questionnaires administered online and&#xD;
           in-person. All data will be entered into a University of Iowa REDCap database, which is&#xD;
           maintained by University of Iowa ITS staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Movement analysis and verbal pain rating Participants' motion and force will be captured&#xD;
      as they walk, perform heel raises, hop, and do calf stretches within a 3-dimensional motion&#xD;
      analysis with force plates flush with the floor. To monitor pain level throughout&#xD;
      participation, we will have participants verbally rate their pain with each task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Sensory testing (Pain pressure threshold at the hamstring and Achilles bilaterally;&#xD;
      Conditioned pain modulation at the Achilles)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete questionnaires at 12-weeks. Participants will attend&#xD;
      7 treatment sessions over approximately 8 weeks. Over this time period participants will&#xD;
      complete the following procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaires (exercise adherence, educational quizzes, symptom description) This&#xD;
           private, identifiable information will be collected via questionnaires administered&#xD;
           online and in-person. All data will be entered into a University of Iowa REDCap&#xD;
           database, which is maintained by University of Iowa ITS staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise participation Participants will be given exercises to do at home in between&#xD;
           treatment sessions. Participants will receive instruction from a physical therapist&#xD;
           prior to doing the exercise at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Education Participants will be given homework and online quizzes to do at home in&#xD;
           between treatment sessions. The physical therapist will review the educational material&#xD;
           with the participant at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a research team member will access the medical records of participants with&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy to gain information about the participant's medical history and imaging&#xD;
      related to Achilles tendinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was based on a power analysis for the primary outcome measures of Specific&#xD;
      Aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: This analysis will compare the between group (biopsychosocial vs biomedical&#xD;
      approach to education) changes in pain and disability scores from baseline to 8 weeks and to&#xD;
      12-week follow-up for participants with AT participating in an exercise program. Based on&#xD;
      findings from Moseley et al. for an RCT comparing a 4-week exercise program with education on&#xD;
      central pain mechanisms to standard of care in 49 patients with chronic low back pain, we&#xD;
      anticipate between group differences with Cohen's d greater than or equal to 0.36 for pain&#xD;
      (between group difference across 2 time points=0.75, SD of 1.05 on the NPRS, effect size of&#xD;
      f=0.36) and disability (between group difference across 2 time points=1.95, SD of 2.33 on low&#xD;
      back pain-specific measure, effect size of f=0.42). Under these assumptions, a sample size of&#xD;
      30 patients per group would be needed to reach 80% power for the time averaged difference&#xD;
      between two group means in a repeated measures design with alpha equal to 0.025 (Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction of 0.05/2 for 2 outcomes in Aim 1) to detect a between group effect size of 0.36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: This analysis will compare the within group changes (baseline to 8-weeks and&#xD;
      to 12 weeks) in central pain mechanisms (nociplastic pain, psychosocial factors, motor&#xD;
      dysfunction) with an exercise intervention for participants with AT, regardless of&#xD;
      educational group. The power analysis for this aim is based on data from 3 studies that have&#xD;
      had a moderate to large (Cohen's d greater than or equal to 0.51) treatment effects on&#xD;
      central pain mechanisms. A study led by Dr. Sluka previously found that massage improved PPTs&#xD;
      2 days after an intense exercise protocol with a large effect size (27.6%, SD=14.7%, effect&#xD;
      size= 1.88). Cai et al. found that a 4-week cognitive behavioral therapy program reduced fear&#xD;
      of movement by 8.1 points with a SD of 5.44 (effect size= 1.5). Based on our preliminary data&#xD;
      from the K99 phase, there was a mean improvement of 3.4 repetitions (SD of change= 6.7) in&#xD;
      heel rise performance after an anesthetic injection for the AT group (effect size=0.51). We&#xD;
      used the smallest and population-specific anticipated effect size of 0.51 to calculate the&#xD;
      sample size for Aim 2. Type I error rate of alpha equal to 0.017 (Bonferroni correction of&#xD;
      0.05/3 for 3 outcomes in Aim 2) will be used for this aim to adjust for the multiple&#xD;
      comparisons. The sample size of 60 patients calculated for Aim 1 would allow us to detect an&#xD;
      effect size of d greater than or equal to 0.43 with 80% power under these assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normality of the continuous data will be tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test and by examining&#xD;
      the quantile-quantile plot. Normally distributed Continuous variables will be presented as&#xD;
      mean plus or minus SD for normally distributed data and median with interquartile ranges for&#xD;
      non-normally distributed data. When the normality assumption is not met, transformation, such&#xD;
      as log, will be used to complete planned parametric analyses. Type I error rate will be&#xD;
      maintained at 0.05 by using Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. First, potential&#xD;
      differences between group demographics at baseline will be examined univariately using two&#xD;
      independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests, as appropriate. If differences are&#xD;
      observed, these variables will be used as covariates in the multivariable models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified intention-to-treat principle will be followed, which will include outcome data on&#xD;
      all participants based on the group they were randomized and complete evaluation at 8 weeks.&#xD;
      We will also compare patient characteristics of those who remained in the study to those who&#xD;
      dropped out to determine if data at subsequent time points is consistent with missing at&#xD;
      random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1 we will assess the effect of the interventions on the primary outcomes for pain&#xD;
      (NPRS) and disability (PROMIS physical function) from baseline to 8-weeks and to 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up using linear mixed model for repeated measures. Similarly, for Aim 2 a linear mixed&#xD;
      model for repeated measures will assess the effect of the interventions by group on the&#xD;
      primary outcomes for central pain mechanisms (nociplastic pain: PPT, psychosocial factors:&#xD;
      TSK, motor control: heel raises) from baseline to 8 weeks. For Aims 1 and 2, the factors in&#xD;
      the linear mixed model will include group and time effects. In addition, the significance of&#xD;
      the group*time interaction term, where the group*time interaction tests if the change over&#xD;
      time differs between groups, will also be tested. We will also assess for normality,&#xD;
      linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence of residuals for the multiple regression models&#xD;
      (dependent variables: pain and disability). Statistical significance will be defined by alpha&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses for secondary outcome measures of central sensitization, psychological factors,&#xD;
      motor control, pain and disability for Aims 1 and 2 will be performed using the same&#xD;
      statistical tests described above. Secondary analyses on sex will examine potential sex-based&#xD;
      differences in both Aims 1 and 2 to inform sample size estimates for future clinical trials.&#xD;
      The analyses described above for each aim will be expanded to explore the effect of sex as a&#xD;
      fixed factor and examine interactions with group and time. Using the same data analysis&#xD;
      strategy as described for sex, a secondary analysis on AT type (insertional vs. midportion)&#xD;
      will also be assessed for Aims 1 and 2 to inform recruitment strategies for future clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
