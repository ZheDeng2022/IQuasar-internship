  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate functional and aesthetic outcomes of combined facial&#xD;
      and upper extremity composite tissue allografts on patients who have not achieved functional&#xD;
      and aesthetic outcomes with conventional reconstructive surgical strategies and prosthetic&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational surgery that transfers tissue from&#xD;
      a non-living donor to a living individual will help restore greater function, appearance, and&#xD;
      sensation to the face and upper extremity areas of individuals who have suffered injury to&#xD;
      those areas. Upper extremity constitutes the part of the body including arm, forearm and&#xD;
      hand. This procedure is called combined craniomaxillofacial and upper extremity&#xD;
      allotransplantation or &quot;combined face and upper extremity transplant&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also collect data on how patients do during and after having a combined face&#xD;
      and upper extremity transplant from a nonliving donor. Recovery and outcomes will be observed&#xD;
      through clinical exams, x-rays, blood and tissue tests, and other associated evaluations at&#xD;
      all follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to take part in this research study who have suffered severe injury&#xD;
      to the face and upper extremity and previous surgeries to repair the injury have not restored&#xD;
      function, appearance, and sensation. Participants must have attempted a trial of prosthetics&#xD;
      (artificial upper extremity), if at all possible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Lack of stable housing and/or supportive significant other/caregiver throughout all&#xD;
             phases of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently active smoker within 1 year&#xD;

             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Level of amputation proximal to mid-humerus: some presence of proximal muscles is&#xD;
             required to motor a functioning hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital Abnormalities: co-existent absence/atrophy/agenesis of any tissue may&#xD;
             affect post-transplant results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of amputation of less than six months: subject must be allowed to attempt&#xD;
             prosthetic use prior to hand transplantation. This can be waived in cases where the&#xD;
             recipient requires amputation/revision of the transplant site at the time of&#xD;
             transplantation. However, if at all possible, it is highly encouraged that the patient&#xD;
             has ruled out prosthetics as an alternative to transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blindness: blind amputees may be poor candidates because sensory return in the hand&#xD;
             may not provide sufficient protective sensation&#xD;
