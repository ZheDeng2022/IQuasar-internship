             CAR T cell therapy under 1 of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Have met eligibility for CAR T-cell therapy or transplant, but have refused&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have disease progression or relapse within 12 months after autologous or allogeneic&#xD;
             stem cell transplant or have relapsed following CAR T-cell therapy and meet the&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Had a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the 3-month disease&#xD;
                  assessment and then subsequently progressed &gt; 3 months after first CAR T-cell&#xD;

             obtained following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment and be&#xD;
             willing to release the specimen for exploratory tumor molecular profiling. If an&#xD;
             historic specimen is not available, the subject must be willing to undergo a biopsy&#xD;
             during the screening period, if considered safe by the Investigator. If safety&#xD;
             concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the screening period, a tumor biopsy&#xD;
             specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment may&#xD;
             be used.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use effective contraception while on study and for at least 5 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of CD19 t-haNK for Infusion. Non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom&#xD;
             while on study and for up to 5 months after the last dose of CD19 t-haNK for Infusion.&#xD;
             Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal&#xD;
             ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with spermicide,&#xD;
             intrauterine devices (IUDs), and abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Body weight at screening of ≤ 50 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the&#xD;
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for&#xD;
             treatment-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's&#xD;

             colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inadequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 750 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count &lt; 75,000 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject&#xD;
