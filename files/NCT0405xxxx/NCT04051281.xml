  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics and broad spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics by general practitioners (GPs) in England. Unnecessary prescriptions are defined&#xD;
      as those that do not improve patient health outcomes. The intervention is to send GPs a&#xD;
      letter from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) that gives feedback on their practice's&#xD;
      prescribing levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three intervention samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. practices whose prescribing in the past year was under the new target of 0.965 items per&#xD;
           STAR-PU but who would exceed the target if they had a 5% increase in prescribing; trial&#xD;
           compares prescribing of practices whose GPs receive a letter informing them that their&#xD;
           practice's prescribing is just under the new target to that of practices that are not&#xD;
           sent a letter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Practices whose prescribing in the past year was above the new target but who not in the&#xD;
           top 20% of prescribers; trial compares prescribing of practices whose GPs receive a&#xD;
           letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new target to&#xD;
           practices who get a letter that includes a graph showing their prescribing relative to&#xD;
           the target and to practices that are not sent a letter&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Practices that are currently in the top 20% of prescribers; trial compares effect on&#xD;
           prescribing of a feedback letter with a social norms message (current standard practice&#xD;
           for this group) to a letter informing GPs that their practice's prescribing exceeds the&#xD;
           new target and to a letter with a social norms message, that includes a specific example&#xD;
           of a case of patient harm caused by antimicrobial resistance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve three trials, each conducted as non-blinded randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial, with GP practices as the unit of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 1 Targeting practices whose prescribing in the past year was under the new target but&#xD;
      who would exceed the target if they had a 5% increase in prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: No letter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing is just under the&#xD;
           new target (Letter A) Trial hypothesis: Sending a letter to GPs whose practices are just&#xD;
           under the new prescribing target will reduce antibiotic prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 2 Targeting practices whose prescribing in the past year was above the new target but&#xD;
      who not in the top 20% of prescribers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: No letter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 1: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new&#xD;
           target (Letter B1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 2: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new&#xD;
           target with a graph representing prescribing relative to the target (Letter B2)&#xD;
           Hypotheses: (i) Sending a letter to GPs whose practices missed the new prescribing&#xD;
           target will reduce their prescribing; (ii) A letter with a graph will be more effective&#xD;
           than a letter without a graph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial 3 Targeting practices that are currently in the top 20% of prescribers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control: Current standard practice, a social norms message, that their practice is in&#xD;
           the top 20% of prescribers (Letter C1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 1: Letter informing them that their practice's prescribing exceeds the new&#xD;
           target (Letter C2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention 2: Social norms message, that they are in the top 20%, with a specific&#xD;
           example of a case of patient harm caused by antimicrobial resistance (Letter C3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (i) A letter with a social norms message and a specific example of a case where a&#xD;
      patient came to harm will be more effective than a feedback letter without a specific&#xD;
      example; (ii) A letter telling GPs that they missed the prescribing target will be no less&#xD;
      effective than a letter with social norms feedback&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each letter, there will be two versions, one for practices whose prescribing has&#xD;
      increased by &gt; 5% in the previous year, informing them of that their prescribing has&#xD;
      increased since the previous year, and one for practices whose prescribing has not been&#xD;
      increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The letters will signpost GPs to resources to help address patient demand for inappropriate&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing, recognising that many GPs feel that patients expect antibiotics and&#xD;
      that GPs may find it difficult to have the necessary patient conversations, especially within&#xD;
      a short consultation. As with previous letters, these letters will advise GPs of actions that&#xD;
      they can take to reduce inappropriate prescribing, supporting them to have conversations with&#xD;
      patients, and there will be TARGET leaflets enclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation All trials are powered to detect a 2% reduction in prescribing at a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 with a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan In order to test our hypotheses, the investigators will use a fixed&#xD;
      effects panel regression model, with time trends accounting for seasonal effects, to estimate&#xD;
      the effect of treatment status on prescribing. The investigators will also run ANCOVAs for&#xD;
      each month separately and one covering the whole six months of the trial. Analysis will&#xD;
      control for baseline prescribing rates and for whether practices got the version of the&#xD;
      letter saying that their prescribing has been increasing.&#xD;
