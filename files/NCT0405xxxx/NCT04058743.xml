  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of patients with self reported&#xD;
      nickel sensitivity undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with conventional,&#xD;
      standard-of-care vs nickel-free implants. The hypothesis is that patients with a&#xD;
      self-reported nickel sensitivity will have similar patient reported outcome scores compared&#xD;
      to those patients without reported nickel sensitivity. Therefor the anticipation is for there&#xD;
      to be no differences in other clinical outcome measures or functional outcome scores between&#xD;
      the two cohorts.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Metal implants are a mainstay of orthopedic treatment, and a variety of metal implants have&#xD;
      been utilized for more than 40 years. Total knee replacement implants have been comprised of&#xD;
      a variety of metal, ceramic, and plastic components. Current standard-of-care for TKA employs&#xD;
      a cobalt chrome alloy femoral implant that articulates with the polyethylene surface of the&#xD;
      tibial component. This cobalt chrome alloy can contain up to 1% nickel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most patients report pain relief and satisfaction after TKA, there are a number of&#xD;
      complications that can result. Infection, component loosening, polyethylene wear, and&#xD;
      malalignment are common reasons for persistent pain after TKA. Metal sensitivity as a cause&#xD;
      of persistent pain after total joint arthroplasty is a controversial topic. Cutaneous metal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity has a prevalence of approximately 10-15% in the general population, with&#xD;
      nickel being the most common metal sensitizer with a prevalence near 14%. Cross reactivity&#xD;
      with cobalt chrome and nickel is very common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of metal allergy in orthopedic surgery and total joint arthroplasty is a poorly&#xD;
      understood relationship. The cause and effect relationship of this process has not been&#xD;
      delineated - it is unclear if the immunogenic response causes implant failure, or implant&#xD;
      failure releases hapten particles with lead to a deep tissue reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metal hypersensitivity after TKA is a rarely documented phenomenon without specific&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria, and there is much debate on if this is even a true diagnosis. The two&#xD;
      most commonly described presentations include 1) dermatitis or 2) persistent painful&#xD;
      synovitis although these have only been described in case reports without defined diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria. Few reports exist regarding the diagnosis and management of these conditions. There&#xD;
      is no reliable or generally accepted test to predict allergy to total joint replacement&#xD;
      components. Patient history of metal sensitivity is not a reliable indicator of TJA outcome,&#xD;
      as 25% of patients with well-functioning TJA implants have a reported metal allergy. A nickel&#xD;
      or metal sensitivity has not been statistically identified as a risk factor for any specific&#xD;
      cutaneous or deep tissue reaction, complication, or poor outcome after TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, metal sensitivity patients are identified after having a superficial skin reaction&#xD;
      after dermal contact with a metal. Nickel containing jewelry is a common precipitator. The&#xD;
      true diagnosis of skin sensitivity to metal is diagnosed by cutaneous patch testing, often&#xD;
      employed by dermatologists. This test is not specific or sensitive for the diagnosis of deep&#xD;
      tissue metal sensitivity. In a case control study, Granchi et al followed 94 patients without&#xD;
      metal implants, with stable painless TKA, and with TKA and evidence of loosening. The study&#xD;
      found no predictive value in dermal patch testing for metal hypersensitivity and the&#xD;
      stability of TKA implants. Verma et al followed 30 patients with dermatitis following TKA.&#xD;
      Fifteen were available for patch testing, but only seven patients tested 1+ or 2+ reaction to&#xD;
      a metal. Dermatitis in all patients cleared with topical steroid. The relationship between&#xD;
      positive patch testing and clinically relevant deep tissue reactions has not been delineated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphocyte transformation testing (LTT) or lymphocyte stimulation testing involves obtaining&#xD;
      patient lymphocytes from a peripheral blood draw, and testing reactivity with a variety of&#xD;
      antigens, including cobalt, nickel, and zirconium. Many argue that this test better&#xD;
      replicates the sensitization that occurs in deep tissue after TJA, but its correlation to&#xD;
      outcomes after arthroplasty has never been shown. Niki et al preformed lymphocyte stimulating&#xD;
      testing on 92 patients (108 knees) undergoing primary TKA. 24 patients tested positive for&#xD;
      metal hypersensitivity. Ultimately only five went on to develop dermatitis. Thus the clinical&#xD;
      significance of positive results of lymphocyte stimulation testing is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, serum metal levels are often elevated in patients with well-functioning TKA,&#xD;
      and thus this test is not recommended for diagnosis of metal sensitivity. As a result, other&#xD;
      causes such as infection, malalignment, aseptic loosening, referred pain, or systemic pain&#xD;
      syndromes should all evaluated in persistently painful TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, metal sensitivity is not considered a significant cause of TKA failure. As the&#xD;
      literature is inconclusive on identification and management of patients with metal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity there is currently no indication for metal allergy screening prior to TKA.&#xD;
      No study has found that patients with a previously known metal sensitivity have an increase&#xD;
      rate of failure or revision TKA compared to those without. None of the major academic&#xD;
      orthopedic societies recommend routine use of nickel free implants. There is currently no&#xD;
      data showing correlation between nickel allergy and poor outcomes after total joint&#xD;
      replacement with nickel containing implants. While non-nickel containing TKA implants have&#xD;
      been developed, there is no evidence-based criteria for their use in specific patient&#xD;
      populations. The goal of this study is to compare Knee Society Scores in patients with&#xD;
      self-reported metal allergy who receive standard of care nickel containing implants vs&#xD;
      oxidized zirconium nickel free implants for primary TKA.&#xD;
