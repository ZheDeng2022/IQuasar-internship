  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States (U.S.), suicide is a major public health concern. U.S. Veterans who live&#xD;
      in rural areas may be at even higher risk for suicide than their urban counterparts.&#xD;
      Available evidence indicates that suicide risk in rural U.S. Veterans is most concentrated&#xD;
      during high-risk care transition scenarios such as discharge from an emergency room. There is&#xD;
      limited knowledge about effective interventions to address suicide risk. There is a critical&#xD;
      need to develop targeted interventions that address suicide risk during high-risk care&#xD;
      transition periods. To be effective, these interventions should address key contributors to&#xD;
      suicide risk such as reduced engagement in treatment. This clinical trial evaluates the&#xD;
      effect of a suicide prevention intervention to support treatment engagement during high risk&#xD;
      transition periods such as discharge from an emergency room.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States (U.S.), death by suicide is a notable public health concern and a&#xD;
      particular problem in the U.S. Veteran population. Furthermore, U.S. Veterans who live in&#xD;
      rural areas may be at even greater risk for suicide than their urban counterparts. These&#xD;
      risks may be concentrated during times of transition in their treatment such as after&#xD;
      emergency room discharge. Multiple interventions have been developed to target suicide risk&#xD;
      during periods of transition but there is limited evidence regarding their efficacy in&#xD;
      preventing suicide. Furthermore, a key contributor to suicide risk may include limited or no&#xD;
      engagement in care. Therefore, developing interventions to support engagement in treatment&#xD;
      may be effective ways to help mitigate suicide risk and promote participation in care. This&#xD;
      clinical trial studies an intervention that is designed to help support treatment engagement&#xD;
      during periods of high risk in Veterans who live in rural areas. The trial will recruit&#xD;
      Veterans from various treatment settings such as the emergency room and the residential drug&#xD;
      treatment programs and follow them for a period of three months. The trial evaluates not only&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention on suicidal behavior but also measures of engagement.&#xD;

    <measure>The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline BSS at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSSI ranges from 0-38. While there is no established BSS cutoff score to classify suicide risk, here is evidence that higher scores on the BSS correspond to more severe suicidal ideation and that an improvement of five points or more on the total BSS scores may be clinically relevant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Beck Scale for Hopelessness (BSH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline BSH at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSH ranges from 0-20 with higher scores associated with increased hopelessness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Partners in Health Scale (PIH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PIH at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PIH is used to measure patient self-management of chronic conditions. It is a 12-item instrument, each question measured on a Likert scale of 0-8. Higher scores indicate better self-management.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire 15 (INQ-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline INQ-15 at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The INQ-15 is a 15-item self-report scale that measures thwarted belongingness (9 items) and perceived burdensomeness (6 items). Each item is measured on a 7-point Likert scale, with higher scores suggesting lower perceived connectedness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Number of events according to the CSSR-S at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a valid and reliable scale that includes a seven-item subscale that asks patients to self-report on actual attempts, interrupted attempts, aborted attempts, and preparatory acts or behaviors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline MSPSS at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MSPSS is a 12-item self-reported scale that is designed to ask about support from several sources including friends, family and significant other. The scale has been shown to have good internal and test-retest reliability as well as good validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicide-Related Coping Scale (SRCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline SRCS at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale includes 17 questions related to a patient's perception of their ability to cope with suicidal thoughts. Each item is assessed using a 5-point Likert scale and the measure has been developed based on two studies of suicide prevention strategies conducted within Veteran populations. The scale includes two subscales including an External Coping subscale and an Internal Coping Subscale. Both subscales have shown good acceptable internal consistency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>App Engagement Scale (AES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline AES at 1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AES is adapted from the end-user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). The AES has been studied in patients with mental health conditions, has been shown to have good internal reliability, and is strongly related to app engagement.</description>
