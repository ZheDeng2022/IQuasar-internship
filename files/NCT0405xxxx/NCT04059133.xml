      The hypothesis of the present study is low intensity extracorporeal low energy shock wave&#xD;
      therapy (LiESWT) can decrease inflammatory disorders, increase pelvic floor blood supply,&#xD;
      enhanced bladder stem cell activation, Using LiESWT can decrease bladder overactivity,&#xD;

      Clinical application of low intensity extracorporeal low energy shock wave therapy (LiESWT)&#xD;
      (2000 to 3000 impulses in 0.20-0.25 millijoule/mm2 (mJ/mm2)) initiated wound healing,&#xD;
      promoted angiogenesis, reduced the level of oxidative stress, induced the releasing of VEGF,&#xD;
      stimulated proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, and resulted in the effect of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and tissue regeneration. Generally, LiESWT was used clinically to improve&#xD;
      tissue regeneration at tendon-bone junctions, ischemic cardiovascular disorders, skin wound&#xD;
      healing, chronic injuries of soft tissues and erectile dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LiESWT has also been shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression&#xD;
      in ischemic tissues in vivo and to promote angiogenesis and functional recovery in models of&#xD;
      chronic myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease.&#xD;
      Importantly, the advantages of LiESWT include therapies without medication or surgery,&#xD;
      outpatient therapies, short treatment sessions, no anesthesia required, and non-invasive&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present study is LiESWT can decrease inflammatory disorders, increase&#xD;
      pelvic floor blood supply, enhanced bladder stem cell activation, Using LiESWT can decrease&#xD;
      bladder overactivity, eliminate urinary incontinence and improve stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      (SUI) and overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Therefore improve quality of life and improve&#xD;
      social activity.&#xD;
