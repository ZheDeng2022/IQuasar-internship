  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if use of the video camera surveillance system for&#xD;
      HH observation and performance feedback about HH compliance rates can improve the HH&#xD;
      compliance of HCWs and reduce healthcare-associated infections in the NICU.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Hand hygiene (HH) compliance monitoring using video camera surveillance and giving&#xD;
      feedback of HH compliance rates to HCWs would effect the hand hygiene behavior of health care&#xD;
      workers (HCW) and healthcare-associated infections (HAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A video camera surveillance system is in place in all NICU rooms since 2018. The&#xD;
      investigators designed a quasiexperimental (before-after) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site and participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will take place in NICU from July 2019 to March 2020. All nurses, attending&#xD;
      physicians, resident physicians, environmental services staff, medical assistants work in&#xD;
      NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control period (Before intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will observe HH behavior of HCWs using the video camera surveillance for four weeks. This&#xD;
      will give us the baseline HH compliance rates of NICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline HAI rates will be calculated of the 3 months before intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will report baseline HH compliance rates and HAI rates to HCWs during a meeting where all&#xD;
      HCWs are present. During this meeting we will remind major infection control measures, give&#xD;
      examples of common mistakes they made without violating personal privacy rights of HCWs and&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental period (After intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform HH observation for four weeks after the intervention. At the&#xD;
      end of the observation period, feedback about the HH compliance rates, change and detailed&#xD;
      analysis of HH compliance rates by indication, day of week, hour of the day and NICU rooms&#xD;
      will be given during a second meeting with HCWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAI rates will be calculated for period of 3 months after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustainability of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure HH compliance rates 12 weeks after the intervention to investigate the&#xD;
      sustainability of our intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third meeting will be done with HCWs in the unit which the investigator give feedback about&#xD;
      the HH compliance, HAI rates before and after the intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven, trained HH observers will participate in the study. These observers will achieve at&#xD;
      least 80% concordance before the study. HH compliance data will be collected using a mobile&#xD;
      app. HH monitoring will be performed Monday through Sunday making observations from randomly&#xD;
      selected 20 minutes lapses of morning (08:00 am - 04:59 pm), afternoon (05:00 pm - 11:59 pm)&#xD;
      and night (00:00 am - 07:59 am) shifts of the day. All HCWs in the room during the 20 minutes&#xD;
      observation period are monitored for HH opportunities. Each HH opportunity was stratified as&#xD;
      compliant or noncompliant and was classified according to the three of WHO's My 5 Moments for&#xD;
      HH as follows: (1) before touching a patient, (4) after touching a patient, and (5) after&#xD;
      contact with the patient's environment. HH moments before an aseptic task (2) and after body&#xD;
      fluid exposure risk (3) was not included due to low resolution of video camera surveillance&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance was calculated by dividing the total HH opportunities for each subject by the&#xD;
      number of HH compliance × 100. Adequate materials for HH are defined using either the soap&#xD;
      and water or alcohol-based handrub solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAIs are identified and recorded by active surveillance method in NICU. HAIs are identified&#xD;
      using CDC criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used G-power program for sample size calculation. With a power of 90%, 0.05 type I error&#xD;
      rate and anticipated HH compliance increase before and after intervention period as 10% we&#xD;
      planned to record 538 HH opportunities for each period (1076 HH opportunities total)&#xD;
