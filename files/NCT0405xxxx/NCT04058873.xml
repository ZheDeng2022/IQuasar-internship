  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to build on the previous research and gather data in an actual use study /&#xD;
      patient registry of pericoital LNG 1.5mg to understand women's acceptability of the product&#xD;
      along with associated side effects, and monitoring for their correct and incorrect use. These&#xD;
      findings will contribute to the discussion around the feasibility of pericoital LNG as an&#xD;
      additional contraceptive by adding to the body of evidence.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study would consist of distributing pericoital LNG 1.5mg across 75 pharmacy sites in&#xD;
      Ghana over the course of 12 months. Recruitment will be staggered, and women will be&#xD;
      recruited up to 9 months into the study. As such, the data collection period per participant&#xD;
      will be at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the recent WHO study (Festin et al. &quot; A prospective, open-label, single arm,&#xD;
      multicentre study to evaluate efficacy, safety and acceptability of pericoital oral&#xD;
      contraception using LNG 1.5mg&quot; (2016)), participants will be given instructions on how to&#xD;
      correctly use LNG 1.5mg, namely to take one pill 24 hours before or after sexual relations,&#xD;
      and no more than 6 times per month. Contraceptive protection requires use only once per 24&#xD;
      hours, regardless of how many times sexual relations are had during those 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include a broad population of women age 18-49, not currently on any&#xD;
      long-term modern method, who do not wish to get pregnant in the following 6 months but would&#xD;
      not consider it a serious issue if they did become pregnant. They will be asked to use LNG&#xD;
      1.5mg as their exclusive method of contraception for the period of the study, with the&#xD;
      exception of condoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug used for the study is LNG 1.5mg, specifically Marie Stopes International's BK-1&#xD;
      pill, repackaged for the study purposes. The BK-1 pill is currently registered as an&#xD;
      emergency contraceptive and sold in Ghana with good quality assurance procedures in place.&#xD;
      The BK-1 emergency contraception pill is manufactured for Marie Stopes International by Acme&#xD;
      Formulation Pvt., Limited, one of the leading drug manufacturers of India. It is registered&#xD;
      as an emergency contraception by the Food and Drugs Authority in Ghana and assigned&#xD;
      registration number FDA/SD.183-11710. The package will read &quot;LNG 1.5mg for Pericoital Use -&#xD;
      for study purposes only&quot; and be devoid of any other branding (please see Appendix for&#xD;
      artwork).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection components with research participants include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline background information about the research participants will be collected during&#xD;
           the screening (e.g., qualifications for inclusion/ exclusion) and enrollment process&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biweekly (i.e., every two weeks) phone call surveys with research participants. They&#xD;
           will be asked 10 questions about user satisfaction, circumstances of use, and outcomes&#xD;
           (e.g., self-reported side effects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Two extended surveys per participant to better understand participant perception of LNG&#xD;
           1.5mg, customer satisfaction with product and service, and future contraceptive&#xD;
           intentions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection components with pharmacies will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline data of average packs of FP products sold at the pharmacy, in order to&#xD;
           understand the overall increase in FP methods sold over the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A mystery shopping survey to check the quality of service provision and monitoring of&#xD;
           recruitment/quality of information at each of the 75 study sites 2x during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Register collected at pharmacy point of sale, with units sold over the course of the&#xD;
           12-month pilot. Note: participants will be able to go to any of the participating&#xD;
           pharmacies during the course of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pharmacists feedback surveys to understand the provision of LNG 1.5mg&#xD;
