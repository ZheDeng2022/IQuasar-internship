  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) convene African American and Latino Community Coalitions&#xD;
      to adapt Family Teamwork (FT) for school-age youth, and integrate FT with the Smart and&#xD;
      Secure Children (SSC) program community-based, peer delivery format, 2) identify facilitators&#xD;
      and barriers to parental involvement in diabetes management for African American and Latino&#xD;
      parents of children (5-9 years) with T1D to refine, with Community Coalitions the adapted and&#xD;
      integrated Family Teamwork- Peer Delivery (FT-P), and 3) evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes of the FT-P program among African American and Latino&#xD;
      parents of school-aged children (5-9 years) withT1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized pilot trials will be conducted with African American and Latino families to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility, parent satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes of FT-P. Families will&#xD;
      be stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and HbA1c strata, and randomized to FT-P plus standard&#xD;
      diabetes care or to standard diabetes care alone after completion of baseline assessment&#xD;
      using a random numbers table generated by a program created through Baylor College of&#xD;
      Medicine's Institute for Clinical Training and Research data management specialists.&#xD;
