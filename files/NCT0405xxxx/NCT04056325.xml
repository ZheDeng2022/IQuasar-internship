    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2, blinded and randomized clinical trial. The phase 2a trial is single&#xD;
      blinded and conducted in Lao, while the phase 2b trial is double-blinded and conducted in Lao&#xD;
      and Cambodia. The study aims at providing evidence on effective doses and safety of&#xD;
      moxidectin in adults against infection with S. stercoralis in Laos (trial 2a) and efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of moxidectin compared to ivermectin in adults against infection with S.&#xD;
      stercoralis in Laos and Cambodia (trial 2b). The efficacy of the treatment will be assessed&#xD;
      by collecting three stool samples once pre-treatment and once 21 days post-treatment. The&#xD;
      stool samples will be analyzed by a quantitative Baermann assay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a single-blinded and a phase 2b double-blinded randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      which aims to determine efficacy and safety of (2a) seven ascending oral moxidectin dosages&#xD;
      in 210 adults infected with S. stercoralis, namely placebo, 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, 10 mg, 12&#xD;
      mg in Lao and (2b) the recommended dose moxidectin (i.e. the most promising dosage identified&#xD;
      in trial A; between 2-12 mg) in comparison to the standard treatment dose of ivermectin (200&#xD;
      µg/kg) in 245 adults infected with S. stercoralis in Lao and Cambodia. Embedded in the trial&#xD;
      is a pharmacokinetic/-dynamic study with the goal to measure moxidectin disposition in adults&#xD;
      and to determine population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of the optimal dose of moxidectin&#xD;
      in the treatment of S. stercoralis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the dose-response of moxidectin based on cure rates&#xD;
      (CR) against S. stercoralis and to quantify the efficacy of the recommended dose to the&#xD;
      standard treatment (ivermectin) in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the trial are: Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      dose-dependent treatment regimes, evaluation of the safety and tolerability of moxidectin&#xD;
      compared to ivermectin, comparison of the larvae reduction rate (LRR) of the different&#xD;
      treatment regimens against S. stercoralis (trial 2a,b), determination of an exposure-&#xD;
      (including Cmax, area under curve (AUC) and tmax) -response correlation of moxidectin in&#xD;
      adults, comparison of the exposure-response of moxidectin using venous and capillary blood,&#xD;
      evaluation of the cure rate of the different moxidectin treatment regimens against&#xD;
      co-infection and the determination of the population PK parameters of the optimal dose of&#xD;
      moxidectin in the treatment of S. stercoralis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent from each individual, the medical history of the&#xD;
      participants will be assessed with a standardized questionnaire, in addition to a clinical&#xD;
      examination carried out by the study physician before treatment. Enrollment will be based on&#xD;
      collection and analysis by a quantitative Baermann method (in duplicates) of three stool&#xD;
      samples. Randomization of participants into the different treatment arms will be stratified&#xD;
      according to intensity of infection. The adults will also be interviewed before treatment, 3&#xD;
      and 24 hours as well as 21 days after treatment about the occurrence of adverse events (AE).&#xD;
      The efficacy of the treatment will be determined 21 days post-treatment by collecting another&#xD;
      three stool samples. All stool samples will be examined with duplicate Baermann assays&#xD;
      recorded quantitatively. Co-infection with T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides and hookworm&#xD;
      infection will be identified using duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears on stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsample of adults will further be sampled using finger pricking for micro sampling at 0,&#xD;
      2, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours, 7 and 21 days post treatment to evaluate pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters (trial phase 2a) and at defined time windows, that are based on the PK model&#xD;
      earned from trial 2a (trial phase 2b). For validation of the analytical method the subsample&#xD;
      of one study arm (8 mg, trial phase 2a) will undergo venous blood sampling in addition to&#xD;
      finger pricking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An available case analysis (full analysis set according to the intention to treat principle)&#xD;
      will be performed, including all subjects with primary end point data. Supplementary, a&#xD;
      per-protocol analysis will be conducted. CRs will be calculated as the percentage of&#xD;
      larvae-positive subjects at baseline who become larvae-negative after treatment. Larvae per&#xD;
      gram (LPG) stool sample will be assessed by calculating the mean of the larvae counts from&#xD;
      the three duplicate Baermann assays and divided by the mean weighted amount of these stool&#xD;
      samples. The LRR will be calculated following: (LRR = (1-(mean at follow-up/mean at&#xD;
      baseline))*100) Geometric and arithmetic mean larvae counts will be calculated for the&#xD;
      different treatment arms before and after treatment to assess the corresponding LRRs.&#xD;
      Bootstrap resampling method with 2,000 replicates will be used to calculate 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CIs) for LRRs. Emax models using the dose finding package of the statistical&#xD;
      software environment R will be implemented to predict the dose-response curves in terms of&#xD;
      CRs and LRRs.&#xD;
