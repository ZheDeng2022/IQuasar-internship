    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of a stannous fluoride containing&#xD;
      toothpaste in reducing gingivitis when used twice daily for a maximum for 3 weeks, when&#xD;
      compared to a standard sodium fluoride toothpaste (negative control).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single center, controlled, single blind (examiner blind), randomized,&#xD;
      two-treatment arm, parallel design, clinical study in participants (aged 18-65 years), with&#xD;
      good general health (non-smokers) and generalized mild-moderate plaque-induced gingivitis and&#xD;
      greater than equal to (&gt;=) 20 natural teeth. The study consists of 4 study visits. At Visit&#xD;
      1, Screening, after signing informed consent, participants will be assessed for eligibility&#xD;
      based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and will undergo oral soft tissue (OST) and oral&#xD;
      hard tissue (OHT) assessments. Participants will return between 1 and 28 days following the&#xD;
      screening visit for the Visit 2, baseline where they will undergo, a full OST examination&#xD;
      followed by assessments of gingival inflammation (MGI), gingival bleeding (BI) and&#xD;
      supra-gingival plaque (TPI). Eligible participants will be stratified based on gender and&#xD;
      baseline mean whole mouth MGI score (low: less than equal to (&lt;=) 2.00/High greater than (&gt;)&#xD;
      2.00), to ensure a balance of gingivitis across both treatment groups and then randomized to&#xD;
      study product. All randomized participants will receive full mouth dental prophylaxis&#xD;
      (followed by flossing) to remove sub and supra-gingival calculus, stain, plaque and debris&#xD;
      from the teeth. All participants will enter the treatment period with no visible plaque&#xD;
      (TPI=0). After all clinical assessments, participants will be instructed to brush for 1 timed&#xD;
      minute at site with their assigned study product, after which they will be instructed to&#xD;
      continue using this twice daily (morning and evening) for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks the&#xD;
      participants will return to site for their Week 2 (Visit 3) assessments. They will then&#xD;
      continue using their test dentifrice for a further week and will continue to record all&#xD;
      brushing events in the diary provided, after which they will return for their Week 3 (Visit&#xD;
      4) assessments. All assessments will be carried out on the facial and lingual/palatal&#xD;
      surfaces of each incisor, canine, pre-molar and molar, excluding third molars. After the Week&#xD;
      3 visit, study closeout procedures will take place and the participant may undergo an&#xD;
      additional prophylaxis if it is deemed necessary by the examiner. Adverse events and&#xD;
      incidents will be recorded from informed consent and at the end of each study visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Whole Mouth Mean Bleeding Index (BI) at Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>BI method used to assess gingival bleeding as measure of gingival health for facial and lingual/palatal gingival surfaces of all evaluable teeth, six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual/palatal, lingual/palatal, and distolingual/palatal). Examiner inserted a round-end probe approximately(app.) 1millimeter(mm) into gingival sulcus (at app 60 degrees) and moved around tooth, from distal interproximal area to mesial interproximal area, gently stretching gingival epithelium. Gingival bleeding was assessed 30 seconds after probing. Assessments performed 1 quadrant at a time; BI scores recorded as per given scoring criteria: 0=absence of bleeding on probing,1=bleeding observed within 30 seconds of probing,2=bleeding observed immediately on probing. Lower scores indicate better results. Mean whole mouth BI score for each participant was derived from total BI score divided by number of tooth sites scored. Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <title>Whole Mouth Mean Bleeding Index (BI) at Week 3</title>
        <description>BI method used to assess gingival bleeding as measure of gingival health for facial and lingual/palatal gingival surfaces of all evaluable teeth, six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual/palatal, lingual/palatal, and distolingual/palatal). Examiner inserted a round-end probe approximately(app.) 1millimeter(mm) into gingival sulcus (at app 60 degrees) and moved around tooth, from distal interproximal area to mesial interproximal area, gently stretching gingival epithelium. Gingival bleeding was assessed 30 seconds after probing. Assessments performed 1 quadrant at a time; BI scores recorded as per given scoring criteria: 0=absence of bleeding on probing,1=bleeding observed within 30 seconds of probing,2=bleeding observed immediately on probing. Lower scores indicate better results. Mean whole mouth BI score for each participant was derived from total BI score divided by number of tooth sites scored. Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
        <population>Modified intent-to-treat (m-ITT) population was defined as all participants who were randomized, received at least one dose of the study treatments and provided at least one post-baseline assessment of efficacy.

          <title>Whole Mouth Mean Bleeding Index (BI) at Week 3</title>
          <description>BI method used to assess gingival bleeding as measure of gingival health for facial and lingual/palatal gingival surfaces of all evaluable teeth, six sites per tooth (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual/palatal, lingual/palatal, and distolingual/palatal). Examiner inserted a round-end probe approximately(app.) 1millimeter(mm) into gingival sulcus (at app 60 degrees) and moved around tooth, from distal interproximal area to mesial interproximal area, gently stretching gingival epithelium. Gingival bleeding was assessed 30 seconds after probing. Assessments performed 1 quadrant at a time; BI scores recorded as per given scoring criteria: 0=absence of bleeding on probing,1=bleeding observed within 30 seconds of probing,2=bleeding observed immediately on probing. Lower scores indicate better results. Mean whole mouth BI score for each participant was derived from total BI score divided by number of tooth sites scored. Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Overall Turesky Modification of the Quigley &amp; Hein Plaque Index (TPI) Score at Week 2 and Week 3</title>
        <description>TPI assessed supra-gingival plaques on facial and lingual surfaces of all evaluable teeth. Each tooth divided into 3 areas;3 scores recorded facially (mesiofacial,facial,distofacial) and 3 scores lingually (mesiolingual,lingual,distolingual) generating a total of 6 scores per tooth. Plaque was identified using disclosing solution followed by rinsing with tap water(10 milliliters for 10 seconds) and scored as per given scoring criteria:0-no plaque,1-separate flecks of plaque at cervical margin,2-thin continuous band of plaque (up to 1mm) at cervical margin,3-band of plaque wider than 1mm but covering less than(&lt;)1/3 of tooth surface,4-plaque covering more than or equal to (&gt;=)1/3 but &lt;2/3 of tooth surface,5-plaque covering &gt;=2/3 of tooth surface. Lower scores indicate better results. Mean Overall TPI score for each participant was derived from total TPI score over all tooth sites divided by number of tooth sites scored. Overall mean calculated for all participants was reported.</description>
