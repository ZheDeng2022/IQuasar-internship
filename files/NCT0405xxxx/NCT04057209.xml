      Laser surgery and radiotherapy are well-established standards of care for unilateral stage 0&#xD;
      &amp; I carcinoma in situ (Cais) and squamous cell carcinoma of glottic larynx (SCCGL). Based on&#xD;
      meta-analyses, functional and oncological outcome after both treatment modalities are&#xD;
      comparable1-5. However, no properly conducted randomized trials comparing these treatments&#xD;
      exist. The only such trial with the endpoint of voice quality had to be prematurely closed&#xD;
      due to low accrual6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional radiotherapy involves the treatment of the whole larynx. Recently, a new&#xD;
      radiotherapy technique was introduced by a team of researchers from Netherlands, where the&#xD;
      treated target volume consists of involved vocal cord and therefore 8 to 10-fold smaller than&#xD;
      the target volumes used for traditional whole larynx irradiation. The treatment is reduced to&#xD;
      16 fractions which corresponds to 3 weeks and a day7-12. The results of a prospective cohort&#xD;
      (n=30) with single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI) were compared with the results of a&#xD;
      historical prospective cohort previously treated with whole larynx radiotherapy (n=131) in&#xD;
      the same institute. The median follow-up was 30 months. The voice handicap index (VHI) at all&#xD;
      time points beginning from the 6th week after SVCI was significantly superior to the same&#xD;
      time points with conventional radiotherapy. Moreover, a comparable local control with SVCI&#xD;
      (100%) vs. conventional radiotherapy (92%) was reported at two years, p=0.2412.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this information, the investigators' main aim is to compare SVCI to Transoral&#xD;
      CO2-Laser Microsurgical Cordectomy (TLM) with the main focus of patient-reported voice&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common type of cancer&#xD;
      worldwide. Of all head and neck cancers, approximately 30% originates from the larynx. In&#xD;
      Europe, annually 52.000 patients are diagnosed with cancer of the larynx. About 50-60% of&#xD;
      laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas arise from the glottic region and over 80% of these&#xD;
      patients present in an early stage. The larynx has important roles in production of voice,&#xD;
      coordination of deglutition, and respiration. Therefore, the treatment aim of laryngeal&#xD;
      cancer is not only achievement of maximum disease control, but also maintenance of function.&#xD;
      Transoral CO2-Laser Microsurgical Cordectomy (TLM) and radiotherapy are well-established&#xD;
      standard treatment modalities for unilateral stage 0-I carcinoma in situ and squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of glottic larynx (for convenience, both will be mentioned as SCCGL throughout this&#xD;
      protocol). Based on various clinical studies and meta-analyses, functional and oncological&#xD;
      outcome (overall survival and local control) after both treatment modalities are comparable.&#xD;
      However, no properly conducted randomized trials comparing these treatments exist. The only&#xD;
      such trial with the endpoint of voice quality had to be prematurely closed due to low&#xD;
      accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment option varies remarkably in different countries and among institutions.&#xD;
      Especially in the case of unilateral SCCGL, other factors such as voice quality, cultural and&#xD;
      socioeconomic factors, and patients' preference should be considered. Hoarseness is one of&#xD;
      the main and early signs of SCCGL, whereas both radiotherapy and TLM influence voice quality&#xD;
      by altering the vocal cord motion and anatomy. Another issue worth to consider is the&#xD;
      treatment time. Surgery is performed in one day followed by a few days of hospital stay. In&#xD;
      contrast, radiotherapy is applied in daily fractions. Although each fraction only takes few&#xD;
      minutes, the patients have to visit the radiation oncology department over a course of 4 to 7&#xD;
      weeks, depending on the institutional preference of dose and fractionation. The&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up schedules are identical for both strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between both treatment modalities have been extensively reported. However,&#xD;
      either due to no meaningful difference or due to the heterogeneity in the voice analysis&#xD;
      techniques, several studies revealed no significant differences while better voice quality&#xD;
      was reported after radiotherapy as compared with TLM in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional radiotherapy involves the treatment of the whole larynx over a period of 4 to&#xD;
      7 weeks. Recently, a new radiotherapy technique was introduced by a team of researchers from&#xD;
      Netherlands, where the treated target volume consists of involved vocal cord and therefore 8&#xD;
      to 10 fold smaller than the target volumes used for traditional whole larynx irradiation. The&#xD;
      treatment is reduced to 16 fractions with higher dose per fraction which corresponds to 3&#xD;
      weeks and a day. The results of a prospective cohort (n=30) with single vocal cord&#xD;
      irradiation (SVCI) were compared with the results of a historical prospective cohort (n=131)&#xD;
      previously treated with whole larynx radiotherapy in the same institute. The median follow-up&#xD;
      was 30 months. The voice handicap index (VHI) at all time points beginning from the 6th week&#xD;
      after SVCI was significantly superior to the same time points with conventional radiotherapy.&#xD;
      Moreover, a comparable local control with SVCI (100%) vs. conventional radiotherapy (92%) was&#xD;
      reported at two years, p=0.2412.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the long-term voice quality and oncologic outcome (survival and local tumor&#xD;
      control) are comparable with both TLM and traditional radiotherapy. Furthermore, the new SVCI&#xD;
      technique offers a possibly superior long-term voice quality with an at least equal oncologic&#xD;
      outcome compared to traditional radiotherapy. With this background, the investigators' main&#xD;
      aim is to compare SVCI to TLM with the main focus of patient-reported voice quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Treatments and Indication&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the indication to treat early stage SCCGL in an organ preservation setting, both TLM and&#xD;
      SVCI are going to be compared head-to-head, and therefore are considered as investigational&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Evidence to Date&#xD;
&#xD;
      In well-recognized international cancer treatment guidelines, TLM and radiotherapy are&#xD;
      considered as comparable modalities for the successful treatment of early stage SCCGL. Based&#xD;
      on various clinical studies and meta-analyses, functional and oncological outcome (overall&#xD;
      survival and local control) after both treatment modalities are comparable. However, no&#xD;
      properly conducted randomized trials comparing these treatments exist. The only such trial&#xD;
      with the endpoint of voice quality had to be prematurely closed due to low accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between both treatment modalities have been extensively reported. However,&#xD;
      either due to no meaningful difference or due to the heterogeneity in the voice analysis&#xD;
      techniques, several studies revealed no significant differences while better voice quality&#xD;
      was reported after radiotherapy as compared with TLM in other studies. Nevertheless, most of&#xD;
      the literature consists of reports about retrospective case series with the lack of level I&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of Choice of Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the eligibility criteria, the study population will include patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with unilaterally situated stage 0-I SCCGL who are considered as eligible both for&#xD;
      radiotherapy and surgery by a multidisciplinary tumor board. Both treatment modalities are&#xD;
      well-established standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Objective The ultimate goal of the study is to compare the treatment outcome of the&#xD;
      SVCI and TLM for unilateral stage 0-I SCCGL.&#xD;

      Appendix A. CTCAE v.5.0 will be used for the classification of toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      General study design and justification of design This is a prospective randomized&#xD;
      multi-center open-label comparative phase III study with a superiority design (see Section 11&#xD;
      for the details of statistical considerations). Primary endpoint of this study is&#xD;
      patient-reported subjective voice quality between 6 to 24 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome, the VHI at 6 to 24 months&#xD;
      (averaged). Based on the literature, the investigators consider the VHI to be comparable&#xD;
      between TLM and traditional whole larynx radiotherapy. Therefore, the working hypothesis is&#xD;
      that there is a difference between TLM and SVCI in regard to VHI. Al-Mamgani et al. reported&#xD;
      standard deviations for VHI ranging from 2 to 10 score points12. A difference of 8 points&#xD;
      between the two groups are regarded as clinically relevant and a conservative standard&#xD;
      deviation of 8 points is assumed. Based on a two-sample means test, 34 patients (17 per&#xD;
      group) are needed to detect a difference in VHI at a two-sided alpha-level of 0.05 with a&#xD;
      power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size calculation is conservative. In the analysis, the average difference over&#xD;
      four time points (6, 12, 18, and 24 months) will be modelled and additionally adjusted for&#xD;
      the baseline VHI to yield more power. In each center, patients will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study by the local principal investigator. The local PI can be a head and neck surgeon or&#xD;
      radiation oncologist. However, before patient accrual, the patient must be informed about the&#xD;
      study at least by the attending surgeon and the radiation oncologist. It is highly&#xD;
      recommended that the patient is evaluated and informed in a multidisciplinary tumor board&#xD;
      setting before the accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions in the trial are considered as non-experimental standard treatments. No&#xD;
      diagnostic tool or imaging modality that will be used during the trial is experimental. No&#xD;
      interim analysis for futility or safety will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of minimizing bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization A probabilistic minimization technique will be used for random treatment&#xD;
      allocation between the two treatment arms using a 1:1 ratio. The computer chooses a treatment&#xD;
      dynamically, based on the tumor stage (Stage 0 vs. I), and VHI at baseline (&lt;34 vs. ≥34) as&#xD;
      two predefined stratification factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation will be done via a dedicated website within the clinical trial management system&#xD;
      also containing the electronic case report forms. Only system administrators who are&#xD;
      otherwise not involved in the trial will have access to the algorithm and stored lists during&#xD;
      the recruitment period. Investigators receive the allocation only after registration of a&#xD;
      patient. The underlying randomization lists and details of the minimization algorithm will&#xD;
      not be disclosed but kept securely at CTU Bern. All these measures will help to ensure&#xD;
      concealment of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding procedures Due to obvious differences between surgery and radiotherapy, it is not&#xD;
      possible to have a blinded design in this study setting.&#xD;

By means of reading the phonetically balanced text &quot;The Rainbow Passage&quot; in English and &quot;Die Sonne und der Wind&quot; in German, French and Italian (versions in different languages provided in the protocol), the speaking voice is assessed by the investigator according to the parameters roughness - breathiness - hoarseness (RBH), using the scale of 0: normal, 1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe. In this study, the assessment will be carried out blind.</description>

    <measure>Jitter and shimmer (JS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>JS are regarded as objective, quantitative characteristics of voice quality. They describe the variations in the fundamental note of a vocal signal. Jitter is the variation of the cycle-to-cycle frequency in held vowels (in Hz or. %, norm = 0-3%), shimmer is the cycle-to-cycle variation in the amplitude of held vowels (in dB, or. %, norm = 0-20%). In this study, the assessment will be carried out blind.</description>

    <measure>Glottal-to-Noise Excitation Ratio (GNE)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>GNE serves to describe the relationship of the voice signal to the noise signal (norm = 1-0) and is also a quantitative characteristic of voice quality. Jitter, shimmer and GNE correspond to the perceptual characteristics roughness - breathiness - hoarseness. In order to carry out jitter, shimmer and GNE, the test subjects hold the vowel /a/ mezzoforte for at least 5 seconds at their average speaking pitch. The vocal samples will be recorded and subsequently evaluated using the open source freeware software Praat (http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/ by Paul Boersma and David Weenink - Phonetic Sciences, University of Amsterdam Spuistraat 210 1012VT Amsterdam, Netherlands).

    <description>The 'brilliant' sound of a voice is characterized in acoustic terms by a high degree of acoustic energy above 2 kHz. This can be calculated with the aid of the SPR. In the Fast-Fourier-Transformation, the amplitudes of the highest peaks between 2 and 4 kHz and of the highest peaks between 0 and 2 kHz are determined using a vocal sample and the one subtracted from the other. The lower the SPR, the more &quot;sonorous&quot; is the voice. For this, the test subjects hold the vowel /a/ mezzoforte for at least 5 seconds at their average speaking pitch. The vocal samples will be recorded and subsequently evaluated using Praat. In this study, the assessment will be carried out blind.</description>
