      ICU delirium are assessed by clinical nurses twice every day. Delirious patients are matched&#xD;
      with patients according to their disease, gender and age range(±3 years). Stool samples for&#xD;
      gene sequencing are collected. Gut barrier function are studied with several serum biomarkers&#xD;
      (endotoxin, etc.). Ecological analyses, regression models and mediation equation will be&#xD;

      ICU delirium are assessed by clinical nurses twice every day using Confusion Assessment&#xD;
      Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Delirious patients are matched with patients according to their&#xD;
      disease, gender and age range(±3 years). Stool samples for gene sequencing are collected&#xD;
      within 24 hours after surgeries. Gut barrier function are studied with several serum&#xD;
      biomarkers (endotoxin, etc.). Ecological analyses, regression models and mediation equation&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
