  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the implementation pilot is to assess the practicality of introducing a&#xD;
      perioperative immunonutrition protocol into a hospital environment as well as a true measure&#xD;
      of impact on the rate of surgical site infection (SSI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative infectious complications are independently associated with increased hospital&#xD;
      length of stay (LOS) and cost, and contribute to significant inpatient morbidity. Despite&#xD;
      recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management, the rate of&#xD;
      postoperative infectious complications remains high with 54% of all&#xD;
      hospital-acquired-infections occurring in high-risk surgical populations.2 Poor nutritional&#xD;
      status along with surgical stress predisposes patients to postoperative complications and&#xD;
      immune depression. Research is now demonstrating the importance of additional perioperative&#xD;
      nutritional support through the use of enteral and parenteral feeds in high-risk patients,&#xD;
      with a specific focus on the role of immunonutrition. Immunonutrition substrates have been&#xD;
      found to modulate postsurgical immuno-depression and inflammatory responses and positively&#xD;
      impact patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunonutrition is defined as a solution that contains nutrients such as arginine, omega&#xD;
      fatty acids, and protein. Arginine deficiency after surgical stress was first reported over&#xD;
      30 years ago, and recent studies have demonstrated that the perioperative use of&#xD;
      arginine-supplemented diets have the ability to decrease the rate of postoperative infection.&#xD;
      Arginine is an amino acid that is synthesized in the body but not in high enough&#xD;
      concentration to support metabolic needs during periods of stress, such as surgery. While&#xD;
      under stress, arginine is the primary fuel source for T-cells and helps maintain immune&#xD;
      function and decrease the risk of infection. Th1 induced macrophages also use arginine for&#xD;
      many of their immune functions. In addition, omega fatty acids, such as n-6 and n-3, are&#xD;
      derived from fish oil and have been shown to attenuate the production of inflammatory&#xD;
      compounds and ultimately reduce the cytotoxicity of inflammatory cells. This role that omega&#xD;
      fatty acids play in the resolution of inflammation results in enhanced wound healing and&#xD;
      improved lymphocyte function. Finally, whey protein substrates have great potential to be&#xD;
      used effectively to support post-surgery anabolism. Whey proteins are of high quality, have&#xD;
      proved to be effective in modulating muscle protein synthesis, and are a convenient way to&#xD;
      supplement protein needs in malnourished patients. Whey proteins also have immuno-modulating&#xD;
      properties, including biosynthesis of antioxidant glutathione, which could attenuate the&#xD;
      catabolic effects of surgery and spare protein. These ingredients have been shown to work&#xD;
      synergistically and are associated with significantly better overall and recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival. Each element works towards improving the immune response through modulation of&#xD;
      excessive inflammatory responses and replenishing depleted nutrients when the body is in a&#xD;
      state of surgical stress.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HHS implementation pilot will provide preoperative patients with EMN's immunonutrition&#xD;
      formula, INergy-FLD®. INergy-FLD® is an immune-modulating solution that contains whey protein&#xD;
      isolate, refined fish oil with omega 6 fatty acids, antioxidants such as vitamins A, C, D and&#xD;
      E, and has an elevated amino acid concentration with 4.2 grams of L-Arginine per serving. It&#xD;
      has a natural citrus flavor, low sugar and a trace of lactose, and therefore can be tolerated&#xD;
      by patients who are lactose intolerant. INergy-FLD® is categorized under Health Canada as a&#xD;
      formulated liquid diet (FLD). INergy-FLD® complies with the detailed and explicit&#xD;
      compositional and labeling requirements of an FLD supplement as well as providing complete&#xD;
      directions for preparation and the use of the food product (Food Category: CFIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported consumption diaries will be used to track the consumption of INergy-FLD® by&#xD;
      patients in the perioperative period, and patient feedback will be sought on experience and&#xD;
      barriers in implementation of this regimen. In order to track the impact of INergy-FLD® on&#xD;
      the rate of postoperative infectious complications, HHS will rely on the NSQIP&#xD;
      patient-outcome audit system. According to two new studies presented by researchers from the&#xD;
      American College of Surgeons (ACS), NSQIP provides more accurate data than administrative&#xD;
      data for driving surgical quality improvement. NSQIP codes are standardized, very specific,&#xD;
      and can identify the primary reason for readmission. Other advantages of NSQIP include the&#xD;
      detail of preoperative risk variables collected by the database, allowing for a more robust&#xD;
      risk-adjusted analysis. Using this database available at HHS, EMN will be able to accurately&#xD;
      analyze the impact of INergy-FLD® immunonutrition on surgical patient outcomes.&#xD;
