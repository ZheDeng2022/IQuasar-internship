      maximal tolerated dose and designate the recommended phase 2 dose for subjects with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid cancers. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: part 1 will&#xD;
      involve dose escalation and part 2 will involve expansion of the recommended phase 2 dose.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have histologically confirmed unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
             cancer regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have received treatment with at least 1 prior line of therapy in the metastatic&#xD;
             setting or not be a candidate for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease. Prior&#xD;
             immune therapy and prior treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor as per FDA indication&#xD;
             for current standard-of-care therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have at least 1 measurable lesion and/or non-measurable disease evaluable in&#xD;
             accordance with RECIST Version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have a recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy specimen&#xD;
             obtained following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment and be&#xD;
             willing to release the specimen for exploratory tumor molecular profiling. If an&#xD;
             historic specimen is not available, the subject must be willing to undergo a biopsy&#xD;
             during the screening period, if considered safe by the Investigator. If safety&#xD;
             concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the screening period, a tumor biopsy&#xD;
             specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment may&#xD;
             be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be willing to provide pre- and post-infusion blood samples for exploratory&#xD;
             analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required&#xD;
             by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use effective contraception while on study and for at least 5 months after the last&#xD;
             dose of PD-L1 t-haNK for Infusion. Non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a&#xD;
             condom while on study and for up to 5 months after the last dose of PD-L1 t-haNK for&#xD;
             Infusion. Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy,&#xD;
             tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with&#xD;
             spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), oral contraceptives, and abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Body weight ≤ 50 kg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the&#xD;
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for&#xD;
             treatment- related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's&#xD;
             disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inadequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 750 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count &lt; 75,000 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject&#xD;
                  has documented Gilbert's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])&#xD;

             medication; unstable angina; congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association&#xD;
             grade 2 or higher; or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or other disease requiring&#xD;
             continuous oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Positive results of screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;

             corticosteroids (dose equivalent to or greater than 10 mg/day methylprednisolone),&#xD;
             excluding inhaled steroids. Short-term steroid use to prevent IV contrast allergic&#xD;
             reaction or anaphylaxis in subjects who have known contrast allergies is allowed.&#xD;
