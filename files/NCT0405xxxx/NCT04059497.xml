  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effect of practicing short-bout handgrip and isometric&#xD;
      exercises on nicotine craving, smoking urges and withdrawal symptoms in adult smokers&#xD;
      undergoing acute tobacco abstinence. The study is a randomized controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      effect of practicing a set of short-bout exercises (10-second exercise) on reducing nicotine&#xD;
      craving and withdrawals. Smokers, who have been abstinent from tobacco use for 9 hours, will&#xD;
      join a guided exercise session using 10s-E or a healthy-diet (HD, control) intervention&#xD;
      session, and complete a craving assessment before and 2 assessments after the respective&#xD;
      intervention session. Primary outcomes will be nicotine craving, smoking urges and withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of practicing a set of&#xD;
      short-bout exercises (10-second exercise) on reducing nicotine craving and withdrawals.&#xD;
      Smokers, who have been abstinent from tobacco use for 9 hours, will join a guided exercise&#xD;
      session using 10s-E or a healthy-diet (HD, control) intervention session, and complete a&#xD;
      craving assessment before and 2 assessments after the respective intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Target subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
           At recruitment stage (hotspot or telephone follow-up), smokers with the following&#xD;
           inclusion criteria (Appendix 1) will be invited to participate in an intervention and&#xD;
           assessment session:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consume 10+ traditional cigarettes a day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aged 18 years or above&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Able to communicate in Cantonese&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-reported no serious injury of hands and arms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-reported no mental illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the intervention and assessment session, the invited participants will be&#xD;
           assessed with the following eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-reported no smoking in past 9 hours before the intervention session&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exhaled carbon monoxide &lt;= 15 parts per million (ppm) or reduced by at least 50%&#xD;
                compared to that measured at recruitment stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedures Our recruitment staff (research assistants or student helpers) will approach&#xD;
           smokers at the outdoor smoking hotspots, and introduce the RCT to the smokers. Potential&#xD;
           participants will be assessed with the eligibility criteria, and asked to test their&#xD;
           exhaled carbon monoxide with a Bedfort Smokerlyzer to confirm their smoking status. If&#xD;
           eligible, they will be asked to participate in the intervention and assessment session&#xD;
           of this RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our telephone interviewers of other smoking cessation trials, which have similar&#xD;
           eligibility criteria as the present trial, will ask their participants during their&#xD;
           telephone interviews if they currently consume 10 cigarettes or more a day and other&#xD;
           eligibility criteria. If eligible, they will also be invited to participate in the&#xD;
           intervention and assessment session of this RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If all these participants agree to participate, the recruitment staff will arrange an&#xD;
           intervention and assessment session for these participants, and request them to be&#xD;
           abstinence from tobacco products for at least 9 hours before joining the intervention&#xD;
           and assessment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the intervention and assessment session, the principle investigator (PI) will firstly&#xD;
           measure the exhaled carbon monoxide and ask if the participant has been abstinent for 9&#xD;
           hours. If eligible, they will provide a written consent (Appendix 2), complete a&#xD;
           baseline questionnaire (Appendix 3) (administered by the PI), and will be allocated&#xD;
           randomly to one of two conditions: exercise or healthy-diet. All intervention and&#xD;
           assessments will take around 40 minutes to complete. All participants will be given&#xD;
           HK$350 shopping vouchers after completing all intervention and assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interventions: Exercise condition Each participant in the intervention group can freely&#xD;
           choose a handgrip of strength from 10 to 25kg which can be gripped with adequate grip&#xD;
           strength. The PI will play the short video (5 minutes,&#xD;
           www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZex2Wwy3fU) about the 10s-E for the participant, including (1)&#xD;
           rapid grip-and-release the handgrip for at least 30 times in 10seconds in each hand, and&#xD;
           (2) short-bout hand pushing and pulling exercises without handgrip. During the video,&#xD;
           participants are asked to follow the 10s-E demonstrated by the medical professor. After&#xD;
           the video, the PI will guide the participant to repeat the 10s-E for 5 times within the&#xD;
           next 5 minutes. If participants feel pain in their hands, they can slow down the&#xD;
           exercise. Between each exercise set, rest time for 10-20 seconds will be allowed. After&#xD;
           practicing all these exercises, participants are asked to complete a post-intervention&#xD;
           questionnaire (Appendix 4a, administered by a RA blinded to group allocation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HD intervention (Control) The control group will watch two videos on healthy diet&#xD;
           (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v1vF_zrpAc and&#xD;
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_u4BYV2Okc). Similar to the 10s-E condition, they will&#xD;
           complete a post-intervention questionnaire after the two videos (Appendix 4b,&#xD;
           administered by a RA blinded to group allocation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 15-minute follow-up After the post-intervention measurement, both groups are asked to&#xD;
           watch another 10-minute of health education videos about nicotine craving&#xD;
           (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpbxHj3_qns) and healthy diet (&#xD;
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4wyRsl8mls), and then complete another set of&#xD;
           post-intervention questionnaire (Appendix 5, administered by a RA blinded to group&#xD;
           allocation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcomes Socio-demographic characteristics, smoking history and the Fagerstr√∂m Test for&#xD;
           Nicotine Dependence (FTND) [18] will be collected at the recruitment stage. At the&#xD;
           intervention and assessment session, nicotine craving, smoking urges and withdrawal&#xD;
           symptoms are assessed to examine the physiological effect at baseline. Nicotine craving&#xD;
           will be assessed with a 7-point (1-not at all, 4-somewhat, 7-extremely) scale item: &quot;How&#xD;
           strong is your desire to smoke right now&quot; (West &amp; Hajek, 2004). Smoking urge will be&#xD;
           assessed with the 10-item Questionnaire of Smoking Urges-Brief (QSU-brief) (Yu et al.,&#xD;
           2010). Withdrawal symptoms were measured with Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS),&#xD;
           including 7 components: 'irritable', 'restless', 'hungry', 'poor concentration',&#xD;
           'stress', 'tension', and 'depressed' (West &amp; Hajek, 2004). Respondents can select 1&#xD;
           option from 5 levels (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree) in each component.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The follow-up questionnaire also includes the following questions on the satisfaction of&#xD;
           the intervention: (1) How much would you like the intervention video? (Scale 1-5; 1&#xD;
           indicates strongly dislike and 5 indicates strongly like); (2) How much do you&#xD;
           understand the intervention? (Scale 0-10; 0 indicates totally not understand it and 10&#xD;
           indicates totally understand it); (3) Would you agree that the intervention help&#xD;
           quitting? (Scale 1-5; 1 indicates totally disagree and 5 indicates totally agree); (4)&#xD;
           Are you confident to do 10s-E (exercise group) / have healthy diet (diet group)? (Scale&#xD;
           0-10; 0 indicates totally no confidence and 10 indicates strongly confident); (5) Do you&#xD;
           agree you have a real plan to quit with 10s-E (exercise group) / healthy diet (diet&#xD;
           group)? (Scale 0-10; 0 indicates strongly disagree and 10 indicates strongly agree); (6)&#xD;
           Do you think quitting by 10s-E (exercise group) / healthy diet (diet group) is&#xD;
           difficult? (Scale 0-10; 0 indicates totally no difficulty and 10 indicates strongly&#xD;
           difficult); (7) Will you introduce this video to other people? Options are yes or no;&#xD;
           (8, exercise group only) Have you followed the exercise demonstration just now in the&#xD;
           video? Options include &quot;Not followed totally&quot;, &quot;I followed a little bit&quot;, &quot;I followed&#xD;
           most of all&quot;, and &quot;I followed all&quot;; and (9) Do you agree that 10s-E (exercise group) /&#xD;
           health diet (diet group) reduced their craving (Scale 1-5; 1 indicates strongly disagree&#xD;
           and 5 indicates strongly agree).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Research hypothesis The exercise group will have a significantly greater decline of the&#xD;
           craving, smoking urges and withdrawal than the control group assessed post-intervention&#xD;
           and 15 minutes after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Effect size estimation The sample size calculation is based on the score of desire to&#xD;
           smoke (Scale 1-7). Assuming the group difference in mean change of smoking desire is&#xD;
           0.75 (Ussher et al., 2009), a significance level of 1%, statistical power 90%, a sample&#xD;
           size of 30 participants (15 each group) is needed to detect a difference between the two&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Randomization, allocation concealment and blinding Simple individual randomization&#xD;
           method by sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) will be used to ensure&#xD;
           the counselors and the participants will be blinded from the allocation sequence before&#xD;
           the group allocation (Chan et al., 2013; Doig &amp; Simpson, 2005). The primary investigator&#xD;
           will prepare about 50 identical, opaque, sealed, A5-sized envelops, with a unique&#xD;
           3-digit number on the cover of each envelope as an identifier. Then he will create a&#xD;
           random sequence list of the intervention or control group, and each group allocation&#xD;
           will be sequentially numbered that is matched with the envelope identifier. A paper&#xD;
           indicating the treatment condition will be inserted into each envelop, according to the&#xD;
           random sequence list.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both the PI and the participants are not blinded from the behavioral intervention, but&#xD;
           the outcome assessors (HKU research staff) at the 2 post-intervention follow-up are&#xD;
           blinded from the group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Drop-out Participants can choose to drop out from the RCT during the study period,&#xD;
           without any penalties or administrative procedures. If the participants refuse to&#xD;
           continue the intervention during the intervention and assessment session, the reasons of&#xD;
           the drop-out will be documented by the counselor and reported to the HKU research staff&#xD;
           on the same day. The envelopes of the drop-out participants will not be re-used for&#xD;
           other participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Statistical analysis Data will be entered into SPSS for Windows (version 20) for&#xD;
           analysis. By intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and worst case scenario, participants who&#xD;
           lost to follow-up or refused the follow-up will be treated as smokers. Descriptive&#xD;
           statistics including frequency, percentage, and mean will be used to summarize the&#xD;
           outcomes and other variables. For the desire to smoke, QSU-brief and MPSS, linear mixed&#xD;
           models which allow for multiple observations between subjects and account for clustering&#xD;
           of data within subjects will be used. Both the main effect (group allocation) and&#xD;
           interaction effect (group X time) will be analyzed.&#xD;
