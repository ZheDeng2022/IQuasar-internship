      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of combined supraclavicular and&#xD;
      interscalene brachial plexus block in brachio-axillary surgeries in chronic renal failure as&#xD;
      a sole anesthetic technique in comparison to general anesthesia.&#xD;

      This randomized open blinded end-point pilot study was implemented at Mansoura University&#xD;
      Hospitals. After acceptance of Institutional Research Board (No: MS/17.08.26), sixty patients&#xD;
      of chronic renal failure, The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III, aged from 20&#xD;
      to 60 years old of either sex and planned for brachioaxillary graft interposition vascular&#xD;
      surgery were enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients refusal, have allergy to local anesthetic, neurological, neuromuscular, psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, uncompensated hepatic, respiratory or cardiac disease, uncontrolled seizures,&#xD;
      coagulation disorders, infection at the block injection site, body mass index more than 30&#xD;
      were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consents were obtained. Patients were classified using closed envelop method&#xD;
      into two groups; group (GA) received general anesthesia; group (RA) received combined&#xD;
      supraclavicular and interscalene block, each group were carried on 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were subjected to the preoperative assessment including history taking, clinical&#xD;
      examination and assessment of ASA score. All patients subjected to dialysis session one day&#xD;
      before the surgery. Basal laboratory investigation as complete blood count, coagulation&#xD;
      profile (prothrombin time, international normalized ratio and activated partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time), arterial blood gases, Electrocardiography and echocardiography were&#xD;
      done after dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an overnight fasting, patients admitted to preanesthetic room where an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      cannula was inserted in the contralateral upper limb. Standard monitoring was applied to the&#xD;
      patient include heart rate (HR), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerical rating scale (NRS) was explained to all candidates (zero = no pain and 10 = the&#xD;
      worst pain). Patients were lightly sedated by fentanyl 0.5 μg /kg IV to maintain verbal&#xD;
      contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (GA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After pre-oxygenation general anesthesia was induced using 2mg/kg propofol, 1μg/kg of&#xD;
      fentanyl. After loss of consciousness 0.5 mg/kg of atracurium was injected. The endotracheal&#xD;
      tube (ETT) was placed and inflated. The patient was mechanically ventilated to adjust end&#xD;
      tidal CO2 between 35 and 40mmHg, anesthesia was maintained using 1.2 % isoflurane diluted in&#xD;
      3L of 50 % oxygen mixed with air. Increments of fentanyl (0.5 μg/kg ) and atracurium 10 mg&#xD;
      were used whenever required and the hemodynamic values were maintained within 20% of the&#xD;
      basal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, residual muscle relaxant was reversed with 50µg/kg neostigmine and&#xD;
      0.02 mg/kg atropine. Patients were discharged from post anesthesia care unit according to&#xD;
      modified Aldrete recovery score ≥ 9 . Side effects or complications were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (RA):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment Sterile gloves, Sterile gauze, Alcohol and betadine solution for sterilization, 22&#xD;
      gauge 90mm stimulating needle, 3 ml syringe filled with 3ml 2% lidocaine for local&#xD;
      infiltration at the site of needle entry, 50 ml syringe filled with local anesthetic prepared&#xD;
      for injection, Ultrasound device (philips, clearvue 350,USA) and high frequency (4-12MHZ)&#xD;
      Linear probe was used in this study, its depth setting was 2-4cm .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixture of anesthetic solution was prepared by 20 ml isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% plus 10ml&#xD;
      lidocaine 2% plus 10ml normal saline, total volume was 40ml which is divided into 25ml for&#xD;
      supraclavicular block and 15ml for interscalene block .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient position The patient was placed in supine position with the head turned 45 degrees to&#xD;
      the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supraclavicular block :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Land marks Subclavian artery pulsation which appears as a pulsatile hypoechoic circle, The&#xD;
      nerves appear as multiple hypoechoic circles, the most common appearance is a grape like&#xD;
      clusters of 4-6 circles likely resembling the divisions or as vertical line of 3 circles&#xD;
      likely representing the trunks of the brachial plexus. First rib which appears as hyperechoic&#xD;
      linear line. The pleura can also be visualized as hyperechoic line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After skin preparation and local anesthetic infiltration of the skin, supraclavicular fossa&#xD;
      was scanned to locate the landmarks. If there was difficulty in finding the subclavian&#xD;
      artery, the transducer was slide medially to identify the distal carotid artery firstly ,&#xD;
      then moved laterally to image the subclavian artery which rested on the first rib, the&#xD;
      pulsation was confirmed by doppler colour. The nerves will appear just lateral and superior&#xD;
      to the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in plane approach, a 22 gauge needle 75mm was advanced from lateral to medial to the&#xD;
      corner pocket where the lower trunk commonly lies at this area between the subclavian artery&#xD;
      medially, first rib inferior and the plexus superior then 10ml of the mixture local&#xD;
      anesthetic was injected, the remaining volume was injected just above and lateral to the&#xD;
      subclavian artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interscalene block Land marks The linear probe was placed at the level of the cricoids&#xD;
      cartilage. Carotid artery, anterior scalene muscle, middle scalene muscle, sternomastoid&#xD;
      muscle, internal jugular vein and nerves in the inter-scalene groove appear hypoechoic&#xD;
      distinctly round or oval were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After local anesthetic infiltration of the skin, a 22 gauge needle 75mm was inserted in plane&#xD;
      approach from lateral to medial toward the inter-scalene groove between the anterior and&#xD;
      middle scalene muscles. The anesthetic mixture 15 ml was injected toward C5, C6 cervical&#xD;
      nerve roots aiming to block nerves escaped from supraclavicular nerve block .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensory block will be assessed by pinprick test and recorded in two stages: 0= normal&#xD;
      sensation; 1= no pain. Onset of sensory block is the time between the end of injection and&#xD;
      total abolition of pinprick sensation. Sensory loss was assessed every 3 minutes until 30&#xD;
      minutes after block. The block was defined as complete when loss of sensation is observed in&#xD;
      all tested areas .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor loss was assessed every 3 minutes until 30 minutes after injection. The block was&#xD;
      defined as complete when loss of movement is observed in all tested areas. Motor block was&#xD;
      evaluated in the following stages: 0= no weakness; 1= paresis; 2= paralysis. Onset of motor&#xD;
      block is the time gaped between the end of injection to complete motor block .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The onset of surgical anesthesia is defined as the time of loss of pinprick sensation at the&#xD;
      skin dermatomes involved in the surgical field and inability to do motor functions specific&#xD;
      to each nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After operation, patients transferred to the recovery room and monitored. Heart rate, mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure and SpO2 were recorded for 24 hours.&#xD;
