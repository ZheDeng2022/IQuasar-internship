      This study aims to evaluate the effect of planned inhaler medication training on self-care&#xD;
      agency and self-efficacy level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary diseases are a major source of mortality and morbidity globally. The major symptom&#xD;
      of COPD is dyspnea. Since dyspnea leads to activity limitation and inadequate self-care&#xD;
      skills among individuals, it is often associated with major psychological comorbidity, social&#xD;
      isolation and poor perceived quality of life. COPD patients with high self-efficacy are high&#xD;
      enough to level of treatment adherence. On the other hand, the most preferred treatment&#xD;
      method for the management and mitigation of COPD symptoms is by the use of inhaler&#xD;
      medication. However, incorrect use of the inhaler would lead to failure in the control of&#xD;
      COPD patients. Also, it fails to provide COPD patients with self-care agency and&#xD;
      self-efficacy levels. In COPD, planned inhaler medication training has been shown in many&#xD;
      studies to reduce dyspnoea, increase self-care and self-efficacy levels. Therefore, planned&#xD;
      inhaler medication training increases quality of life in COPD patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline to the 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>CSES developed by Wigal et al. (1991) is used to determine the degree of confidence that COPD patients have in managing or avoiding breathing difficulty during certain activities. The scale consists of 34 items and 5 subscales.</description>

    <measure>Self-Care Agency Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-care Agency Scale (1979) was developed by Kearney and Fleischer, and its validity and reliability study in Turkey was conducted by Nahcivan in 1993. With this scale consisting of 35 items, patients evaluate their ability or agency to perform self-care actions.</description>

    <measure>Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>While the Modified Borg Scale is nowadays generally used to define the severity of dyspnea in exercise, it can also be used to assess the severity of resting dyspnea</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The dyspnea scale is a 1 to 5 score scale consisting of five items based on various physical activities that produce a feeling of dyspnea.</description>
