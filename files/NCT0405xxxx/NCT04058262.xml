  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is estimated to affect 15% of reproductive age couples worldwide and is defined&#xD;
      as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sex for women under 35 or 6&#xD;
      months for women over 35 and is associated with stress, especially due to psychological&#xD;
      factors such as anxiety, frustration and depression. In addition, women seeking treatment for&#xD;
      pregnancy suffer additional stressors - significant emotional burdens and physical changes&#xD;
      that can increase stress and anxiety levels. The possibility of an association between&#xD;
      emotional stress and pregnancy outcome in women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment&#xD;
      makes important therapies that address the psychological state of these women. Meditation and&#xD;
      Reiki have been used to successfully reduce stress and anxiety in various health contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reiki is a complementary health approach in which practitioners lightly place their hands on&#xD;
      or just above a person to facilitate their own healing response. Reiki has been used as an&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy to treat the symptoms common to infertile women seeking treatment,&#xD;
      including anxiety, stress, depression, anger, despair and depression. Reviews of randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials concluded that implementation of the Reiki intervention in health centers&#xD;
      resulted in mental health benefits, including reduced tension, mental confusion, anxiety and&#xD;
      pain as well as improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meditation can be defined as a form of mental training aimed at improving an individual's&#xD;
      psychological capacities, such as attentional and emotional self-regulation. Meditation&#xD;
      encompasses a family of practices that include mindfulness meditation, mantra meditation,&#xD;
      yoga, tai chi and chi gong. Meditation has been used specifically in women undergoing IVF&#xD;
      treatment to successfully reduce symptoms related to psychological distress. Studies measure&#xD;
      the development of self-compassion, mechanisms of emotion regulation, and coping strategies&#xD;
      related to infertility and quality of life in infertility. However, only one study showed a&#xD;
      relationship between meditation and pregnancy rate. Unfortunately, the authors incorporated&#xD;
      yoga and psychological approaches into meditation. Therefore, we designed this study to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of Meditation and Reiki on the outcome of assisted reproduction&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
