    <textblock>
      Background During anaesthesia for repair of a broken hip, many patients experience low blood&#xD;
      pressure. There have been many studies showing that patients who experience low blood&#xD;
      pressure during anaesthesia are at increased risk of sustaining kidney or heart damage,&#xD;
      strokes, having a post-operative infection, or dying. During anaesthesia, in most cases blood&#xD;
      pressure is monitored using a cuff which inflates on the arm (the 'normal' way blood pressure&#xD;
      is measured in a GP practice or hospital ward). This gives a reading each time the cuff goes&#xD;
      up and down, every 3-5 minutes typically. There is a less well used way to measure blood&#xD;
      pressure, using an additional cuff on the finger which gives a constant, continuous measure&#xD;
      of blood pressure. We think that using this monitor, rather than the 'standard' monitor, will&#xD;
      mean that low blood pressure is recognised more quickly, therefore treated more quickly, and&#xD;
      will lead to patients having less exposure to dangerously low blood pressures. If this is the&#xD;
      case, we hope that it will reduce how often patients experience kidney or heart damage, have&#xD;
      an infection after surgery, suffer a stroke, and reduce the risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology To test this, we would need to run a large clinical trial comparing the&#xD;
      continuous monitor to the standard monitor. This would be expensive and involve a great deal&#xD;
      of work in a large number of hospitals, and so first we wish to determine whether the trial&#xD;
      we would like to run is practical, and possible to deliver in the real world. To do this we&#xD;
      plan to run the trial first on a small-scale feasibility (pilot) study, where we will recruit&#xD;
      30 patients, half of whom will have the standard monitor, and half of whom will have the&#xD;
      continuous monitor. We will see what proportion of the patients who could enter the trial&#xD;
      actually do so and complete it, and use it as an opportunity to iron out problems with the&#xD;
      trial. If we find it is possible to run the trial on a small scale, we will apply for funding&#xD;
      to run a full study. This will aim to answer the question of whether the continuous monitor&#xD;
      improves the patient outcomes which were agreed during development with the patient public&#xD;
      involvement group locally; rate of kidney damage, heart damage, stroke, post-operative&#xD;
      infections, risk of death, and hospital length-of-stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes and implications. We anticipate we will find the trial to be feasible with&#xD;
      amendments to the way it is run, and if this is the case, we will apply to run the full scale&#xD;
      trial. If this shows that using the continuous monitor improves the patient outcomes above,&#xD;
      then it would represent new, significant evidence that may lead to the NHS adopting it's use&#xD;
      as 'standard care' during anaesthesia for repair of a broken hip, and would like lead to&#xD;
      similar trials in other operations where patients may benefit in a similar way.&#xD;
