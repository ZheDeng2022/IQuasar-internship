  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mandibular dysplasia with deafness and progeroid features (MDP) syndrome is a rare genetic&#xD;
      metabolic disorder that causes lipodystrophy: the inability of the body to store subcutaneous&#xD;
      adipose tissue (fat under the skin). This creates a unique scenario where any ingested fat is&#xD;
      diverted to the abdomen and liver, often leading to diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have an opportunity to study an individual with MDP who has competed in and&#xD;
      won national para-cycling championships and is able to prevent/control his diabetes by&#xD;
      regular bicycle training. He has approached us for advice on nutritional strategies to&#xD;
      improve his cycling performance, and insight into how he uses fat during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also wish to study a moderately-trained cyclist with Familial partial&#xD;
      lipodystrophy (FPL). Those with FPL show a different pattern of lipodystrophy than those with&#xD;
      MDP, allowing us to further increase the investigator's understanding of fat utilisation in&#xD;
      those with lipodystrophy during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know how subcutaneous fat is used during exercise, and how duration,&#xD;
      nutrition, carbohydrate availability, and exercise intensity can affect this. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate these processes during exercise in MDP and FPL. This will&#xD;
      potentially provide nutrition and performance advice to the individuals, and insight on fat&#xD;
      use in lipodystrophy and diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During prolonged sub-maximal endurance exercise, both fat and carbohydrate are readily used&#xD;
      substrates. The relative contribution and regulation of either is dependent on substrate&#xD;
      availability (endogenous and exogenous), the duration of exercise, and the intensity of&#xD;
      exercise. For example, exercising under fasted or caffeine supplemented conditions increases&#xD;
      adipose tissue lipolysis, free fatty acid availability, and thus fat utilisation, whilst&#xD;
      exercising under fed or carbohydrate loaded conditions increases glucose availability from&#xD;
      elevated liver and muscle glycogen stores, and thus carbohydrate utilisation. This is&#xD;
      important during prolonged sub-maximal exercise because when the limited endogenous&#xD;
      carbohydrate stores are depleted, the body must rely more on fat. However, it is not known&#xD;
      whether this regulation is present in conditions such as MDP and FPL where there is&#xD;
      essentially no adipose tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have an opportunity to study an individual with MDP who has competed in and&#xD;
      won national para-cycling championships. He has approached us for advice on nutritional&#xD;
      strategies to improve his cycling performance, and insight into how he uses fat during&#xD;
      exercise. Intriguingly, the individual has provided anecdotal evidence that exercising under&#xD;
      fasted conditions severely impairs his performance but that the use of caffeine improves his&#xD;
      performance. He also states that he uses carbohydrate feeding strategies before and during&#xD;
      prolonged exercise but is unsure whether it helps or not. This raises two fundamental&#xD;
      questions that should be answered before any nutritional advice should be given (e.g. should&#xD;
      a pre-exercise fat feeding or low glycemic index carbohydrate strategy be adopted?):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do fasting and caffeine stimulate lipolysis in lipodystrophy and, if so, where is the&#xD;
           fat coming from?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does carbohydrate feeding before exercise impair lipolysis in lipodystrophy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to answer these questions, the investigators need to directly measure rates of fat&#xD;
      and carbohydrate utilisation from the circulation and muscle stores during exercise in the&#xD;
      individual and a control participant using a stable isotope infusion approach. As well as&#xD;
      providing results of significant scientific interest to the lipodystrophy field (researchers,&#xD;
      clinicians, patients) and answering fundamental exercise physiology questions on substrate&#xD;
      availability, the investigators hope that the outcomes will offer a substantial platform for&#xD;
      improving the participant's knowledge of exercise nutrition and exercise performance.&#xD;

How carbohydrate and caffeine ingestion can affect the contribution to energy expenditure during 1 hour of exercise at 55%Wmax from:&#xD;
Plasma free fatty acids&#xD;
Plasma glucose&#xD;
Muscle glycogen&#xD;
Fat from other sources (predominantly muscle)&#xD;
This will be calculated from&#xD;
Plasma free fatty acid oxidation: Production of breath 13CO2 from a continuous infusion of [U-13C]palmitate&#xD;
Plasma glucose oxidation: The rate of disappearance of labelled [6, 6-2H2] glucose from a continuous infusion&#xD;
Muscle glycogen = Total carbohydrate oxidation - plasma glucose oxidation&#xD;
Fat from other sources = total fat oxidation - plasma free fatty acid oxidation</description>
