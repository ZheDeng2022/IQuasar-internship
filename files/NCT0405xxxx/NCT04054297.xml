  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive fat in the liver is associated with impairments in metabolic health. Reducing the&#xD;
      amount of carbohydrates and fat both have been shown to reduce liver fat. However, not only&#xD;
      the amount fats and carbohydrates, but also their quality have been shown to influence liver&#xD;
      fat. Diets high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and diets with a high glycemic index (GI) have&#xD;
      been shown to increase liver fat content. However, available data from human dietary&#xD;
      intervention studies is limited and these studies did not reflect a realistic diet. In the&#xD;
      present study a combination of low GI/SFA on the one hand and high GI/SFA on the other hand&#xD;
      is used to reflect realistically a healthy and an unhealthy diet as they are actually&#xD;
      consumed by the Dutch population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether a two-week low compared to high&#xD;
      GI/SFA diet reduces liver fat content. In addition, it will be investigated whether a two-&#xD;
      week low compared to high GI/SFA diet reduces DNL, lowers the 24-hour glycemic response,&#xD;
      lowers hepatic glycogen content, increases hepatic fat oxidation and changes hepatic lipid&#xD;
      composition. Furthermore, the metabolic response to a meal (metabolites related to energy&#xD;
      metabolism and substrate oxidation) will be studied upon the low and high GI/SFA diets.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive fat in the liver is associated with impairments in metabolic health. Reducing the&#xD;
      amount of carbohydrates and fat both have been shown to reduce liver fat. However, not only&#xD;
      the amount fats and carbohydrates, but also their quality have been shown to influence liver&#xD;
      fat. Diets high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and diets with a high glycemic index (GI) have&#xD;
      been shown to increase liver fat content. However, available data from human dietary&#xD;
      intervention studies is limited and these studies did not reflect a realistic diet. Here the&#xD;
      investigators want to combine low GI/SFA on the one hand and high GI/SFA on the other hand to&#xD;
      reflect realistically a healthy and an unhealthy diet as they are actually consumed by the&#xD;
      Dutch population. It is hypothesized that such a low compared to a high GI/SFA diet reduces&#xD;
      liver fat content and possibly liver fat composition. Furthermore, underlying pathways&#xD;
      involved in mediating those changes in liver fat are largely unknown. Hepatic lipid storage&#xD;
      can originate from several metabolic pathways, including de novo lipogenesis (DNL) or&#xD;
      decreased hepatic fat oxidation. Based on current literature the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that with the diets chosen here, both DNL (by differences in GI) and fat oxidation (by&#xD;
      differences in fat composition) will be involved in causing changes in liver fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether a two-week low compared to high&#xD;
      GI/SFA diet reduces liver fat content. In addition, it will be investigated whether a two-&#xD;
      week low compared to high GI/SFA diet reduces DNL, lowers the 24-hour glycemic response,&#xD;
      lowers hepatic glycogen content, increases hepatic fat oxidation and changes hepatic lipid&#xD;
      composition. Furthermore, the metabolic response to a meal (metabolites related to energy&#xD;
      metabolism and substrate oxidation) will be studied upon the low and high GI/SFA diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized cross-over study comparing the effects of a high GI/SFA compared to a&#xD;
      low GI/SFA diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to seventeen healthy overweight/obese males and postmenopausal females, aged between 45-75&#xD;
      years and BMI between 27-38 kg/m2 will participate in the study (minimally 13 volunteers need&#xD;
      to finish the study).&#xD;
