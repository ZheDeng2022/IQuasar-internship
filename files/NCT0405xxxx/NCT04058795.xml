  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a stepped-care approach in treating symptoms of&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The information learned by doing this study may help us&#xD;
      to develop some target treatments for PTSD symptoms in survivors of stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomized to a mobile app or usual care. An assessment&#xD;
      will be made after 4 weeks and a determination made of adding more intensive treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire 4 times over a period of 6 months, at&#xD;
      the time your participation is complete.&#xD;
