      This study will describe the safety, response rate, progression free and overall survival,&#xD;
      and summarize safety events of ivosidenib in combination with nivolumab in participants with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors (nonresectable or metastatic) or enhancing gliomas. Participants are&#xD;
      required to have a histologically consistent diagnosis of IDH1 gene mutated tumor that is not&#xD;
      eligible for curative therapy. Enrolled subjects will receive orally administered ivosidenib&#xD;
      dosed daily on 28-day cycles and nivolumab will be infused every 28 days. Participants will&#xD;
      be assessed at every visit for adverse events starting from the first dose of study&#xD;
      treatment. Assessment (CT or MRI) for evaluation of disease response will be conducted every&#xD;
      8 weeks (±7 days) from the first day of treatment cycle 1 and/or at any time when progression&#xD;
      of disease is suspected. A Post-Treatment Follow-Up Visit for safety will occur 28 (+/- 5)&#xD;
      days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             study results and, in the judgment of the treating investigator, would make the&#xD;
