  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to brain damage acquired (BDA), is often difficulty in gait and balance alterations, as&#xD;
      problems that patients designated as the most disabling. It is essential to an effective&#xD;
      assessment of the balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of the present project adapt and verify the validity of the scale&#xD;
      MiniBESTest, version of the BESTest, in patients with BDA in subacute and chronic stage,&#xD;
      since that is postulated as a brief tool and covering the peculiarities of the specific&#xD;
      alterations of the patient after suffering brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Between September 2019 and December 2020 will be transcultural adaptation to the&#xD;
      BDA and validation of psychometric scale Mini-BESTest in three phases. 60 subjects who&#xD;
      receive treatment in the center of attention State reference to brain damage (CEADAC),&#xD;
      together with the comunidad de Madrid private neurological rehabilitation centers will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: validity and reliability parameters shall be calculated by means of descriptive&#xD;
      statistics for each item of the scales and the set of scale score. You will also analyze the&#xD;
      internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, the interclass correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      used to determine the reliability, and the items will be scanned with the Pearson&#xD;
      coefficient: &gt; 0.20, among other parameters.&#xD;

      Marta Fernández Hontoria, physiotherapist at the State Reference Center of Attention to Brain&#xD;
      Injury (CEADAC), will develop, together with her team formed by Cristina Lirio Romero and&#xD;
      María Torres Lacomba of the Department of Physiotherapy at the University of Alcalá, a&#xD;
      cross-cultural adaptation to the Spanish population with Adquired Brain Injury (ABI) and&#xD;
      psychometric validation of the Mini-BESTest scale. Previously, the author of the scale has&#xD;
      been asked for consent. The study will take place at the CEADAC. After receiving the approval&#xD;
      of the Ethics and Clinical Research Committee of the University of Alcalá (Madrid), it is&#xD;
      proposed to implement the study between September 2019 and May 2020. A minimum of 100 adults,&#xD;
      aged between 18 and 65, will be recruited subacute or chronic state after suffering brain&#xD;
      damage. The sample size conforms to COSMIN recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verifying that there are no parallel studies on the subject in progress, the possible&#xD;
      participants will be informed of the development of the investigation (ANNEX 1), who must&#xD;
      sign the informed consent (ANNEX 2) before being recruited into the study. In addition, a&#xD;
      coding sheet (ANNEX 3) of the participants will be filled in so that from now on the data&#xD;
      related to the proper name does not appear but with a number that ensures the protection of&#xD;
      their data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be all users of CEADAC and the selection criteria to enter to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be: adults who had suffered a ABI at least 2 months ago, that&#xD;
      their disability before suffering it was less than or equal to three on the scale modified by&#xD;
      Rankin, who have an absence of cognitive impairment according to the Minimental State&#xD;
      Examination scale, that is, a score in it greater than 24, without previous diseases that&#xD;
      alter the balance, that were clinically stable and without fever, with the ability to walk&#xD;
      with help technical or without it, and that they gave their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, those people with medical contraindications for physical tests (acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal or peripheral nervous system disorders), who did not understand the&#xD;
      instructions, severe aphasias or with subjects with acute processes of any added pathology&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was developed in 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Transcultural adaptation process. Phase 2: Pre-Test: collected , as well as the ease&#xD;
      of interpretation of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Psychometric validation process.&#xD;

    <description>the overall consistency measures the homogeneity of the scale and the interdependence of the items, indicating the relationship between them.&#xD;
To determine test-retest test reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) will be used. Derived from the test-retest reliability study, the measurement error will be calculated, using the formula ED (estandar deviation) x √1-ICC.</description>
