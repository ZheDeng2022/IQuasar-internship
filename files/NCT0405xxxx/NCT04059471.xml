  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the recent past there has been a number of large urban Yellow Fever outbreaks in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa, tropical South Americas, The demand for Yellow Fever vaccines in response&#xD;
      to the large urban outbreaks occurring concurrently and the risk of further spread through&#xD;
      Africa and to Asia was larger than the available global supply. In this situation, the World&#xD;
      Health Organisation (WHO) developed recommendations for the use of fractional doses of Yellow&#xD;
      Fever vaccine as a dose-sparing strategy. These recommendations were based on data from a&#xD;
      limited number of clinical trials, none of which had been conducted in Africa. This was due&#xD;
      to the uncertainties on the minimum dose requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study complements a study which is comparing full standard dose to 1/5th of standard dose&#xD;
      of all four WHO-prequalified YF vaccines in adults (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02991495),&#xD;
      and is currently ongoing at KEMRI CGMRC and Epicentre, Mbarara which is designed to answer&#xD;
      questions on the use of current stock of YF vaccines with a potency as close as possible to&#xD;
      each manufacturers' minimum release. Data from this trial will inform a WHO recommendation on&#xD;
      using 1/5th of the current standard dose of vaccine for outbreak control. However, since many&#xD;
      vials will contain excess YF vaccine such that 1/5th of a vial is likely to be substantially&#xD;
      above the current minimum potency requirements, these data may not be scientifically&#xD;
      explanatory regarding the minimum dose required for preventive use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new complementary study, aims to determine the lowest YF vaccine dose that is&#xD;
      non-inferior to the current standard full dose among populations in sub-Saharan Africa. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in Kenya (KEMRI Center for Geographical Medicine Research-Coast&#xD;
      (CGMR-C), Kilifi) and Uganda (Epicentre, Mbarara) with trial participants recruited at both&#xD;
      sites, using vaccine from one WHO-prequalified manufacturer (Institut Pasteur de Dakar,&#xD;
      Senegal (IPD)).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yellow fever (YF) is a disease caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is endemic in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. Ninety percent of YF cases are in Africa where&#xD;
      YF virus is transmitted by different mosquito genera in three recognized transmission cycles.&#xD;
      A sylvatic cycle involves transmission between forest-dwelling mosquitoes (Haemagogus spp)&#xD;
      and non-human primate reservoirs, with sporadic incidental transmission to humans (e.g.&#xD;
      forest workers). An intermediate cycle, occurring only in Africa, involves mosquito&#xD;
      transmission between non-human primates and humans, or human-to-human transmission among&#xD;
      humans living or working close to forested areas. An urban cycle involves transmission&#xD;
      between humans and urban mosquito vectors, primarily Aedes aegypti, and occurs when a&#xD;
      viraemic person, infected in the sylvatic or intermediate cycle, introduces YF virus to areas&#xD;
      with a large non-immune population and A. aegypti vectors resulting in disease outbreaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection with YF virus is characterised by a wide range of manifestations, ranging from&#xD;
      subclinical infection with mild and non-specific symptoms, to severe, life-threatening&#xD;
      illness with jaundice, renal failure and haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A highly effective vaccine is available for use against YF in adults and children aged â‰¥9&#xD;
      months. The vaccine is a freeze-dried preparation of live attenuated YF virus strain 17D,&#xD;
      which was developed in 1937 and is produced by four WHO-prequalified manufacturers. A single&#xD;
      dose of YF vaccine is considered sufficient to confer life-long protective immunity against&#xD;
      all seven known genotypes of wild-type YF virus. Protective levels of YF virus neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies are developed in 80-100% vaccine recipients within 10 days after vaccination, and&#xD;
      in 99% within a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although fractional dosing has recently been used in vaccination campaigns in Kinshasa and&#xD;
      Brazil in 2016, 2017 and 2018, WHO recommendations were based on a limited number of clinical&#xD;
      studies and important data gaps remain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fractional vaccine dosing is compounded by the uncertainty surrounding minimum dose&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims to determine the lowest dose in International Units (IU/dose) that&#xD;
      is non-inferior to the standard full dose among populations in sub-Saharan Africa. The data&#xD;
      generated in this study will provide information regarding the re-definition of the minimal&#xD;
      dose and potency requirements of the vaccine. The study will also provide further confidence&#xD;
      in the use of fractional doses of YF vaccine during epidemics. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess the range of views and perceptions of key stakeholders in vaccine policy and&#xD;
      implementation on reduced vaccine dose usage during YF epidemics and for routine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The study will be conducted at the KEMRI CGMRC in Kilifi, Kenya and at Epicentre in&#xD;
      Mbarara, Uganda. Both these sites are already working together in an ongoing study&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02991495).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants (n=480) will be randomized for vaccination with full standard dose or with&#xD;
      1000, 500 or 250 IU (i.e. 4 arms) with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio. Results for the safety and&#xD;
      primary outcome of the adult study will then be reviewed by the DSMB, and the lowest&#xD;
      non-inferior dose in the adult study selected for assessment in children aged 9 months to 5&#xD;
      years (n=420) in comparison to full standard dose (i.e. 2 arms) with a 1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
      The determination of the non-inferior dose to use in children will be made by the sponsor in&#xD;
      discussion with the study Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), vaccine manufacturer and&#xD;
      relevant stakeholders, and the final decision communicated to the various regulatory&#xD;
      authorities as a notification (i.e. Scientific and Ethics Review Board (SERU) at KEMRI,&#xD;
      Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC) and Pharmacy and Poisons board (PPB) for&#xD;
      the Kilifi site, Mbarara University of Science and Technology's Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (MUST-REC), Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (UNCST) and National Drug&#xD;
      Authority (NDA) for the Mbarara site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult vaccinees will be followed up for 2 years, and children for 1 year. There will be no&#xD;
      gradual age de-escalation on the basis that there are few safety concerns with the full dose&#xD;
      of YF vaccines, having been used in millions of children worldwide.&#xD;
