      Women with provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) suffer from severe dyspareuni and often present a&#xD;
      hyperactivity of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) which maintain the dyspareunia. The rationale&#xD;
      for the study is that for women with PVD who don't succeed to restore the function of the PFM&#xD;
      by physiotherapy, Botulinum Toxin A (BTA) could be an optional treatment by decreasing the&#xD;
      high muscle tonus and thus possibly reduce the coital pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and outcome Women with PVD will be recruited for a double blind RCT of 2 injection&#xD;
      of 50 Allergan-units BTA (3 months apart) or placebo in the bulbocavernous muscles (situated&#xD;
      adjacent to the lower part of the vagina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: The reduction of patient self-reported dyspareunia measured by VAS 0 (no&#xD;
      pain) to 100 (worst pain imaginable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: Pain at tampon insertion measured by VAS 0-100, functional measurement of&#xD;
      dyspareunia (see below), the reduction of pelvic floor hyperactivity/tonus, measured with a&#xD;
      vaginal manometer, safety aspects and effect duration of BTA, influence on quality of life&#xD;
      and psychosexual evaluation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale Dyspareunia is a common pain problem among women. The prevalence has been estimated&#xD;
      to be 10-15%. The most common type of dyspareunia among premenopausal women is provoked&#xD;
      vestibulodynia (PVD). PVD is characterized by pain upon touch, pressure and stretch of the&#xD;
      vestibular tissue in spite of the absence of other gynecological or dermatological disease&#xD;
      [4]. The pain and its associated sexual consequences have a severe negative impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life of affected women. Currently the etiology, although still not completely&#xD;
      clarified, is considered to be multi-factorial involving biomedical and psychosexual causes.&#xD;
      Two sub-categories of PVD has been identified; primary PVD, where pain occurs at the first&#xD;
      attempt of vaginal entry (intercourse or tampon use) and secondary PVD, where pain occurs&#xD;
      after a period of normal functioning. There is evidence of patho-physiological changes in&#xD;
      three interdependent systems; the vestibular tissue, the pelvic floor muscles and the pain&#xD;
      regulatory pathways of the central nervous system. Signs of a neurogenic inflammation in the&#xD;
      vestibular mucosa, with neural hyperplasia of CGRP and Substance P positive C-fibers have&#xD;
      been found. Furthermore, recent evidence supports the importance of a pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      (PFM) dysfunction to the etiology of PVD. Women with PVD have been shown to have elevated&#xD;
      resting activity, lower maximal strength and poorer control of the PFM compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls. Evidence suggests that this hyperactivity, although possibly originating as a&#xD;
      protective defense mechanism provoked by pain, is chronic and thus contributes to maintaining&#xD;
      and exacerbating the neurogenic inflammation and pain. A circular model has been suggested in&#xD;
      which pain during intercourse and fear of pain may decrease sexual arousal and increase PFM&#xD;
      tonus, whereby the PFM hyperactivity might act as an initiator of vestibular sensory changes&#xD;
      and inflammation. However there is a lack of longitudinal studies to answer the question&#xD;
      whether the PFM dysfunction is antecedent to the pain or a result of the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gentilcore-Saulnier et al. proposed that superficial and deep layers of the PFM may differ in&#xD;
      their involvement in PVD as assessed with EMG external surface electrodes and an intravaginal&#xD;
      probe, respectively. They found that women with PVD have significantly higher resting&#xD;
      activity in the superficial muscle (bulbocaverneous) in comparison with controls. The&#xD;
      difference was not significant for the deep layer (puborectalis, pubococcygeus, ileococcygeus&#xD;
      and ischiococcygeus muscles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment guidelines today recommend a multi-modal treatment including topical anesthetic&#xD;
      agents, cognitive behavioral therapy and PFM rehabilitation based on physiotherapy. As a&#xD;
      second line treatment injections with botulinum toxin A (BTA) in the bulbocavernous muscles&#xD;
      bilaterally has been suggested and to a limited extent tested. The main target for BTA is a&#xD;
      transient paretic effect on skeletal muscular fibers and it also blocks the release of&#xD;
      neuropeptides and neurotransmitters involved in the neuropathic pain and could therefore have&#xD;
      additional effect in the treatment of PVD. Previously published reports on the effects of BTA&#xD;
      for PVD are few and the methods of injection (different injection sites, use or non-use of an&#xD;
      EMG needle for direction of injection sites) and doses used (20, 35, 100 IU) differ as well&#xD;
      as methods of measuring treatment outcome. Only one double blind RCT has been published so&#xD;
      far where no additional effect of BTA compared to saline could be detected, however the BTA&#xD;
      dose used was low (20 IU) and only one treatment was performed. Using BTA in the PFM seems to&#xD;
      be safe and only tenderness at the injection site and mild influenza like symptoms have been&#xD;
      reported side effects so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that two treatments (three months apart) of injections with 50&#xD;
      Allergan-units of BTA in the bulbocavernosus muscles in women with PVD will reduce the&#xD;
      hyperactivity in the PFM and thus significantly decrease the pain during intercourse.&#xD;
