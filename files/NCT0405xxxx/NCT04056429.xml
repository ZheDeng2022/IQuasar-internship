  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Bone Healing Accelerant (BHA) product when applied to tibia (leg bone) fractures with an&#xD;
      external wound or skin break (also called open tibia fractures). It is hypothesized that by 6&#xD;
      months, the number of subjects with successful bone healing will be greater in the&#xD;
      BHA-treated group compared to subjects treated with standard of care alone. Open tibia&#xD;
      fractures were chosen for this study because healing rates are typically longer than for&#xD;
      other bone fractures due to the limited vascular supply, limited soft tissue coverage, and&#xD;
      higher risk of infection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is between the ages of 18-75 inclusive at time of randomization. Patient has an&#xD;
        acute open Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIA or IIIB fracture of the tibia shaft, with or without&#xD;
        a fibula fracture, secondary to trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient received antibiotic treatment within 2 hours of presentation at initial medical&#xD;
        facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient underwent their first operative debridement within 24 hours of presentation at&#xD;
        initial medical facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is scheduled to have DWC within 14 days of initial injury. The tibia fracture&#xD;
        requires open fracture reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary (IM) nailing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        - IM nailing has been cross-locked for stability with a 4-5mm interlock, with a minimum of&#xD;
        1 static screw above the fracture site and 1 static screw below the fracture site, and All&#xD;
        IM nails have a diameter between 8.5-12mm with 1.0-1.5mm over-reaming of the canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The temporary use of external fixation prior to IM rodding and DWC is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Upon stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a cortical deficit of less than&#xD;
        or equal to 1.0cm involving no more than 50% of the tibia circumference. The cortical&#xD;
        deficit of the residual 50% circumference must be less than 1.0cm. Gap assessments to be&#xD;
        made with calibrated radiographs or visual inspection. In addition, patients are not likely&#xD;
        to require a secondary procedure(s) to promote bone healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        BHA is able to be applied through existing soft tissue defects created by the injury or&#xD;
        those created during surgical treatment. No new incisions should be required specifically&#xD;
        for application of BHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures including all&#xD;
        pre-operative, post-operative and rehabilitation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is able to give voluntary IC to participate and has signed an IC form specific to&#xD;
        this study prior to study treatment and DWC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of childbearing potential must use adequate methods of contraception during the&#xD;
        duration of follow-up (12-months). Adequate methods include abstinence, female and male&#xD;
        sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injectables,&#xD;
        and double barrier methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are currently participating in another investigational trial or having&#xD;
        participated in a clinical investigation within the last 90 days or intend to during the&#xD;
        course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are currently prisoners. Patients who are unable to give informed consent.&#xD;
        Patients who are skeletally immature (&lt;18 years of age or radiographic evidence of open&#xD;
        tibial physes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Type I, II, or IIIC open tibia fractures according to the Gustilo-Anderson&#xD;
        classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current injury is a pathological fracture. Patients with additional injuries that could&#xD;
        impact their ability to complete the required assessments and postoperative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with immune deficiency or history of auto-immune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with an active malignancy or a history of any invasive malignancy (except&#xD;
        non-melanoma skin cancer), unless the patient has been treated with curative intent and&#xD;
        there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of malignancy for at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any medical condition or life circumstances that in the surgeon's opinion&#xD;
        could impact their ability to return for follow-up visits and/or complete the required&#xD;
        assessments and postoperative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who are known to have anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to human blood&#xD;
        products, genipin, Î²-TCP, glycerin or to other components of the investigative product&#xD;
        formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients of child-bearing potential who meet any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is currently pregnant (prior diagnosis or a positive pregnancy test at baseline),&#xD;
        or planning to become pregnant any time during the course of the study Currently&#xD;
        breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed at any time during the course of the study Upon&#xD;
        stabilization of the tibia fracture, the patient has a bone gap greater than 1.0cm apparent&#xD;
        by calibrated radiographs or by visual inspection and/or the patient is highly likely to&#xD;
        require secondary intervention procedure(s), surgical or nonsurgical (e.g., bone&#xD;
        stimulation or ultrasound treatment) for the index fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have mal-alignment post-IM nailing of &gt;10Â° in the coronal plane or &gt;15Â° in the&#xD;
        sagittal plane.&#xD;

        of the DWC surgery, patients who have a planned secondary intervention procedure, surgical&#xD;
        or nonsurgical (e.g., bone stimulation or ultrasound treatment) for the index fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
