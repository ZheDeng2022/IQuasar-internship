  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Switzerland, about 6000 individuals live with the consequences of a spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (Brinkhof et al, 2016). One of the major goals after an incomplete spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (iSCI) is to regain walking function. To this end, different approaches are used in&#xD;
      rehabilitation such as treadmill-based, robotic-assisted (exoskeleton or end-effector) and&#xD;
      conventional gait training. According to current literature, the superiority of one of these&#xD;
      approaches remains unclear (Mehrholz, Harvey, Thomas, and Elsner, 2017); In the research on&#xD;
      gait rehabilitation after iSCI, recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) found no statistical&#xD;
      differences between conventional gait training and robotic-assisted gait training.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, according to the comparison of effect sizes obtained from these training, these&#xD;
      trials suggested that the conventional training approach leads to larger improvements in gait&#xD;
      capacity when compared to robotic-assisted therapy (Field-Fote and Roach, 2011; Nooijen, Ter&#xD;
      Hoeve, and Field-Fote, 2009). Therefore, these trials highly recommended further research&#xD;
      considering these aspects. However, in clinical settings, the implementation of such&#xD;
      systematic and intense training sessions remains challenging. The present study aims to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that conventional training might have larger effect sizes on gait capacity and&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility of such systematic training in a clinical setting of inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To contribute to the current knowledge on best clinical practice in gait&#xD;
      rehabilitation within the iSCI population. More specifically, the study objectives are&#xD;
      two-fold: A first objective is to compare the effects of conventional training, end-effector&#xD;
      based therapy and the combination of these interventions on the gait ability of iSCI. A&#xD;
      second objective is the evaluation of the feasibility of systematic gait training protocols&#xD;
      in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), presenting a&#xD;
      traumatic or non-traumatic iSCI with an injury onset &lt;6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will be trained in one of the three groups by trained physical&#xD;
      therapists during 10 sessions, 3x/week with an average duration of 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: To attain the first objective the effects will be quantified by the following main&#xD;
      outcomes: Walking capacity (independence), walking speed, and safety. Feasibility of the&#xD;
      systematic intervention will be evaluated using the drop-outs of therapy interventions.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to add evidence for best practice in gait recovery interventions for&#xD;
      individuals with incomplete SCI (iSCI). In contrast to post-stroke rehabilitation, the&#xD;
      evidence on best practice for gait recovery for individuals with iSCI is less well-founded. A&#xD;
      recent Cochrane review and the guidelines from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr&#xD;
      Neurorehabilitation suggests that in post-stroke rehabilitation the combination of&#xD;
      conventional gait training (walking overground) and robotic-assisted gait training is most&#xD;
      successful to improve gait capacity (Mehrholz et al., 2014; Dohle et al., S2e Leitlinie&#xD;
      ReMoS, 2015); Furthermore, guidelines suggest according to the high level of evidence, that&#xD;
      the use of robotic-assisted training is advantageous to improve walking speed and endurance&#xD;
      in individuals with post-stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such recent guidelines for spinal cord injury do not yet exist to knowledge of the&#xD;
      investigators. In 2014 a Cochrane Review was published indicating that there is insufficient&#xD;
      evidence about the best practice for gait recovery in incomplete SCI individuals (Mehrholz,&#xD;
      Pohl, Elsener, 2014). Recently, a systematic review points out the critical assumption that&#xD;
      according to the present evidence robotic-assisted gait training is not superior to&#xD;
      conventional gait training (walking overground) (Mehrholz et al, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since these studies suggest a high frequency of training and systematic intervention over&#xD;
      several weeks (ex.: 4-5x / week; over 3 weeks) the present investigators would like to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized-controlled trial with a two-fold aim: 1. Adding evidence to existing&#xD;
      knowledge on gait rehabilitation best practice in individuals with iSCI. And 2) assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility of such a protocol in a clinical setting in daily clinical practice. The latter&#xD;
      is a very important aspect considering that the transfer from research knowledge into&#xD;
      clinical practice is a large challenge (Maher et al, 2004). Among the most frequent barriers&#xD;
      to implement evidence into practice are methodological problems (66%), a lack of replication&#xD;
      (54%) and poor generalisability (53%) according to the analysis by Metcalf and colleagues on&#xD;
      715 clinicians (physio-, occupational, speech and language therapists) (Metcalfe et al,&#xD;
      2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      randomized, pre-post design, pilot-study to test the superiority of conventional gait&#xD;
      training to mechanical-assisted gait training in individuals with motor incomplete spinal&#xD;
      cord injury at a sub-acute stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes for patients' characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, to the outcomes measures of gait ability participants will be assessed for&#xD;
      clinical parameters on structural and activity level to characterize participants level of&#xD;
      impairment and deficits. The assessments in question quantify lower limb spasticity and motor&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spasticity will be assessed with the composite spasticity index (CSI) will be used to test&#xD;
      spasticity in the lower extremities. The CSI is a 16-point scale measuring the reflex&#xD;
      response for example after a tap on the Achilles or patellar tendon (4 points), resistance to&#xD;
      full-range passive ankle dorsiflexion at a moderate speed (8 points), and duration of the&#xD;
      clonus at the ankle (4 points). Value intervals of 1-5, 6-9, 10-12 and 13-16 correspond to&#xD;
      absent, mild, moderate and severe spasticity, respectively (Levin and Hui-Chan, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor function will be quantified using the International Standards for Neurological&#xD;
      Classification of Spinal Cord Injury, revised 2011, published by the American Spinal Injury&#xD;
      Association (ASIA) (Kirshblum and Waring, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Outcomes: For safety purpose, a 16-point Borg Scale will be assessed immediately&#xD;
      prior, during (2-3x) and immediately after the training session. The cut-off for training&#xD;
      cessation is set at a Borg score of 15-16 (hard) (Swain et al, ACSM 2014). According to&#xD;
      literature in healthy a score of 15-16 indicates that the anaerobic threshold has been&#xD;
      exceeded. Since the training should in a submaximal level the aim is to train participants in&#xD;
      an aerobic range of energy supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, potential safety outcomes are muscle soreness or pain induced by skin irritation&#xD;
      of the harness used with the end-effector device. Skin irritation will be inspected and&#xD;
      controlled by the nurses responsible for participants as it is conducted regularly and&#xD;
      systematically as an in-house practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at the local inpatient rehabilitation of the REHAB Basel,&#xD;
      Switzerland. Once participant accepted participation, they will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of the three groups with the use of the randomization process for block randomization on&#xD;
      www.randomization.com (Dallal E.G.; last access 6.05.19). The allocation is conducted from&#xD;
      externally. Assessors are blinded during the process. Participants and Physiotherapists&#xD;
      cannot be blinded due to the training location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission to the REHAB Basel in the ward for individuals with spinal cord injury, each&#xD;
      patient was screened by the assessors from the rehabilitation centre. Medical Doctors&#xD;
      responsible for the ward are informed about the in- and exclusion criteria and can report a&#xD;
      potential participant for screening. Screening includes the consultation of the medical&#xD;
      history (digital) checking for in- and exclusion criteria particularly lesion location and&#xD;
      onset. If potential participants pass the screening of medical dossier the assessors&#xD;
      communicate with the responsible therapist about the inclusion criteria on the capacity to&#xD;
      perform sit-to-stand and step initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-selected participants are then invited for a first visit to give the patient&#xD;
      information and explain and hand-out the informed consent. In case of the incapacity to sign,&#xD;
      secondary to the lesion, participants are asked to a legal relative (mature) signing the&#xD;
      paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the informed consent is signed the participants were planned for a pre-evaluation to&#xD;
      test the final eligibility with the gait assessments and clinical evaluation. In case the&#xD;
      participant does not meet inclusion criteria or stop the participation there will be no&#xD;
      consequences on participants' treatment. Study participants do not receive any compensation&#xD;
      or payment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment to study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is conducted by the principal investigator. The investigator is not involved in&#xD;
      the pre- and post-evaluation of the participant and not on site. Before the study, the&#xD;
      subject numbers have been assigned to the groups using the online calculating system for&#xD;
      block randomization www.randomization.com. With the subject's number assessor obtain the&#xD;
      information about the group assignment via E-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concealing of group assignment: The group assignment is registered in an xls file where the&#xD;
      ID of the participants is encoded and some demographics are registered. The folder with the&#xD;
      xls file is registered in a personnel file of the assessors called RCGTSCI_18&#xD;
      (robotic-conventional gait training spinal cord injury 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapists conducting the treatment cannot be blinded since they have to know all&#xD;
      of the three treatment types since they can be assigned to every patient. The assignment of&#xD;
      physiotherapist (PT) to patients is based on the availability in the PT team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have to be informed a priori about all the potential treatments they can be&#xD;
      assigned to. Based on treatment nature participants cannot be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessors are blinded. They are not involved in the training of participants or the prior&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal: Should a participant be expelled prematurely due to a particular&#xD;
      reason for the cancellation criteria or by the withdrawal of their consent before the end of&#xD;
      their participation, this participant will be replaced by a new participant. The data of the&#xD;
      expelled participant will not be used for any analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, the patients are personally informed about the study. Afterwards, they&#xD;
      are neutrally asked about their willingness to participate. They will receive an information&#xD;
      sheet and a declaration of consent. Patients are informed that they have time for&#xD;
      consideration and that they will be contacted again in 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When patients give consent to the study, they are randomly assigned to a group by an&#xD;
      uninvolved person. The central therapy planning is informed about the study participation of&#xD;
      the person concerned and then plans the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first baseline measurement is planned 2 days before the start of the intervention. Main&#xD;
      outcome parameters (FAC, CSI, MFW, TUG and 10mWT) are recorded during the measurement. After&#xD;
      the measurement, the further procedure depends on group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-evaluation Screening Visit (Day 0): The possible participants are visited by one of the&#xD;
      authorized assessors. Participants will be informed verbally about the study project and&#xD;
      receive the information sheet and the declaration of consent. The potential participants are&#xD;
      informed that they have time to decide and that they will be visited again in the next 2 days&#xD;
      for clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant gave the consent to the study, the participants get randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of the three groups; Appointment 1 Pre-evaluation (Day 2): The authorized examiners&#xD;
      test the composite spasticity. They evaluate the motor score of the lower extremity, the&#xD;
      functional ambulation categories, 10-meter walking test and the timed up and go test&#xD;
      (described in 9.2.) Post- and Follow-up evaluation Appointment 12 (day 1-2 after the last&#xD;
      training session): During post-evaluation the main outcome parameters for gait ability, gait&#xD;
      speed and safety are assessed by the authorized assessors. The outcomes are quantified with&#xD;
      the functional ambulation categories, 10-meter walking test and the timed up and go test&#xD;
      (described in 9.2.) in the same manner as during pre-evaluation. Clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      spasticity and motor function is not conducted since these parameters do not count as outcome&#xD;
      parameters. These assessments serve to characterize the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no follow-up survey planned. The records of participants who prematurely stop the&#xD;
      study are not used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical evaluation measurements are carried out by 3 trained physiotherapists. The&#xD;
      intervention units are carried out by certified, experienced physiotherapists. The therapists&#xD;
      record the content and the distance as well as all values to be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study aims at first to test if conventional gait rehabilitation (CT) is superior&#xD;
      to robotic-assisted therapy (EET) or the combination of both (CETcomb), conventional and&#xD;
      robotic-assisted therapy as suggested by recent literature. In line with that, time-effect of&#xD;
      training (pre- post-training) for all three interventions on gait ability (FAC), gait speed&#xD;
      (10MWT) and safety (TUG) will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with these objectives the hypotheses are formulated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: Group A = Group B = Group C; Group A (EET), Group B (CT), and Group C (CETcomb) will all&#xD;
      result in significant improvements in gait ability, speed and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Group C (CETcomb) &gt; Group B (CT) &gt; Group A (EET); The combination group (Group C) will&#xD;
      result in significantly higher improvements in gait ability, speed and safety from pre- to&#xD;
      post-testing when compared to Group B and Group A. The time effect in Group B will be&#xD;
      significantly higher when compared to Group A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the present pilot study, a participant number of at least 12 was defined for each group&#xD;
      based on a sample size calculation (Noordzij et al, 2010) using the mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation of walking speed found in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury. The&#xD;
      number of 12 participants in each group was necessary to achieve a power of 0.80. The power&#xD;
      was set at 0.80 which is considered as an optimal power to avoid false rejection of the H0&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the formula 0.05-0.06 m/s was used as SD2 since this range was considered as minimal&#xD;
      clinical relevant change (Field-Fote and Roach, 2011; Musselman, Fouad, Misiaszek, and Yang,&#xD;
      2009; Street and Singleton, 2018) Consequently, the target difference for the present study&#xD;
      was set at 0.06 m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned analysis consists of a hypothesis testing for time-effect and group comparison in&#xD;
      line with standard treatments in gait rehabilitation. The data set consist of clinical data&#xD;
      obtained with standardized assessments in physiotherapy (i.e. gait assessments and evaluation&#xD;
      of clinical parameters such as muscle strength and spasticity). The values obtained are on an&#xD;
      ordinal, interval and ratio level. The analysis will be conducted after the completion of&#xD;
      data collection of the aimed 36 participants (12 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For primary outcomes, time effect on gait parameters for each group will be analysed at&#xD;
      two-time points: pre to post-training. Furthermore, the difference between pre- and&#xD;
      post-evaluation at the end of data collection for each participant respectively. These values&#xD;
      will be used for statistical comparison. These differences will be tested for the normality&#xD;
      of data distribution. Therefore, the Shapiro-Wilk test will be applied to the difference&#xD;
      between pre- and post-evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance is set at an alpha level of ‚â§0.05. The secondary outcome is the&#xD;
      feasibility of the training protocols in a clinical setting. Feasibility will be quantified&#xD;
      with the number of drop-outs and number of completed training sessions (total of 10 sessions&#xD;
      per participants). The Study is considered feasible if 80% of the participants completed &gt;8&#xD;
      sessions of training (80% of total sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be conducted by the investigator, Martina Betschart, using the current&#xD;
      version of SPSS (23.).&#xD;
