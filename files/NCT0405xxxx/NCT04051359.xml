      The purpose of this controlled, randomized intervention is to investigate whether a&#xD;
      carbohydrate-restricted diet, having a positive effect on blood sugar and weigh maintaining&#xD;
      in diabetes, is effective and safe for pregnant woman with GDM and safe for their offspring,&#xD;
      when compared to the standard carbohydrate content diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing prevalence of obesity and tendency to become pregnant later in life can explain&#xD;
      rising prevalence of gestation diabetes (GDM) (1). Diabetes in pregnancy is a major public&#xD;
      health issue: it has been shown that the mother's glycemic levels correlates perfectly with&#xD;
      child's birth weight, death in utero, perinatal mortality and hypoglycemia (2). Therapeutic&#xD;
      management is relatively simple and based on correction of hyperglycemia by carbohydrate&#xD;
      restriction and energy-controlled diet adapted to pre-pregnancy BMI (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although restriction of dietary carbohydrate has been the cornstone for treatment of GDM&#xD;
      (4,5) with ACOG and The Endocrine Society recommendation for carbohydrate intake to 33-40% of&#xD;
      total daily calories, the paucity of RCT evidence supporting safety of carbohydrate&#xD;
      restriction still exist and actual dietary composition that optimizes perinatal outcomes is&#xD;
      unknown (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbohydrate restriction in GDM comes with the potential increases in dietary fat intake and&#xD;
      consequently a strong association between maternal lipids (i.e., triglycerides and free fatty&#xD;
      acids) and excess fetal growth (6). Moreover, restrictive caloric and carbohydrate diet&#xD;
      increases ketogenesis and ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) cross&#xD;
      well the placental barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational ketogenic diet in mouse deleteriously affects the offspring growth and brain&#xD;
      development (7), an early postnatal exposure to a ketogenic diet results in significant&#xD;
      alterations to neonatal brain structure and can be accompanied by functional and behavioral&#xD;
      changes in later postnatal life (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second half of pregnancy, under the influence of increasing placental hormones and&#xD;
      cytokine concentration, lipolysis become dominant and use of free fatty acids as the energy&#xD;
      material for the mother's body in place of glucose that is consumed mostly by the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These mechanisms are responsible for increased ketogenesis during pregnancy and are three&#xD;
      times higher at night among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women (16). Human studies&#xD;
      focused mostly exclusively on ketonuria; and a negative correlation between ketonuria and&#xD;
      intellectual quotient in children born to diabetic mothers have been reported (9). Rizzo et&#xD;
      al. did not confirm this correlation, although the authors did reveal a negative correlation&#xD;
      between maternal β-hydroxybutyrate concentration in blood and the child's mental development&#xD;
      (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, evaluating ketone production in early pregnancy with type 1 diabetes by&#xD;
      measuring blood BHB, the Jovanovic et al. found that despite the significantly elevated blood&#xD;
      BHB level (2.5-fold higher than nondiabetic pregnant at 6th week gestation, and 1.6-fold at&#xD;
      12th week gestation), there was trend to lower BHB level in diabetic and nondiabetic mothers&#xD;
      with malformed infants and pregnancy loss. The level of BHB was lower also in diabetic&#xD;
      mothers of macrosomic infants (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, inexpensive quantitative test of BHB became available using small capillary blood&#xD;
      sample. Therefore, we would like to evaluate the levels of BHB in GDM patients treated by two&#xD;
      different carbohydrate restricted diets in order to add an evidence on safety and proper&#xD;
      caloric and carbohydrate restriction recommendation during pregnancy in order to optimize&#xD;
      maternal and perinatal outcomes.&#xD;
