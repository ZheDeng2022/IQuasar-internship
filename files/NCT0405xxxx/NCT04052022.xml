      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with tuberculosis (TB) feel better after starting treatment. But for some people,&#xD;
      the opposite happens. They may feel better at first, but then suddenly get worse. This is a&#xD;
      paradoxical reaction. Researchers want to better understand what causes this reaction and&#xD;
      what happens after someone has it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about paradoxical reactions to TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older diagnosed with confirmed or suspected TB and currently on treatment for&#xD;
      at least 2 weeks, with or without signs/symptoms of a paradoxical inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will give blood&#xD;
      and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center 3 times over 6 to 18 months. Each&#xD;
      visit will take 7 hours to complete; visits may be scheduled over more than 1 day.&#xD;
      Participants may have more visits if their TB symptoms change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood, urine, and sputum samples. They will have adverse event&#xD;
      assessments. They will have 2 to 3 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)&#xD;
      scans. PET/CT scans make pictures of the inside of the body. For this, participants will lie&#xD;
      on a table that slides into a donut-shaped scanner. They will get a small amount of&#xD;
      radioactive dye through an IV, which is a small plastic tube placed in a vein in the arm&#xD;
      using a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have optional apheresis. For this, blood is taken from a needle in one arm.&#xD;
      White blood cells are separated from the rest of the blood. The rest of the blood is returned&#xD;
      through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Paradoxical reaction in non-HIV tuberculosis (TB) is a clinical and/or radiologic worsening&#xD;
      of a patient s pre-existing TB while receiving anti-TB medications. This phenomenon has been&#xD;
      clinically well described for many years and is thought to occur in 10%-25% of HIV-negative&#xD;
      patients starting treatment for TB. Paradoxical reactions are diagnosed by excluding other&#xD;
      possible causes for worsening of TB signs and symptoms, such as a second infection or&#xD;
      treatment failure. However, challenges in culturing TB can complicate early diagnosis of&#xD;
      paradoxical reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study intended to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      paradoxical response to treatment in TB-infected patients who do not have HIV. We plan to&#xD;
      follow up to 20 patients with TB who have already initiated treatment and are suspected to&#xD;
      have paradoxical reactions, as well as about 40 patients taking TB treatment without signs of&#xD;
      paradoxical reactions (controls). All participants will have regular study visits for&#xD;
      clinical assessments, blood and sputum collections, positron emission tomography-computed&#xD;
      tomography (PET/CT) scans, and optional leukapheresis. Radiography and laboratory evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed to identify biomarkers, clinical signs, and molecular explanations for&#xD;
      paradoxical reactions. Better understanding of characteristics of paradoxical reactions will&#xD;
      assist in earlier diagnosis or even prediction.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Aged greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosed with confirmed (microbiologically or with molecular methods) or suspected&#xD;
             (clinical plus or minus histologic diagnosis) TB and currently on ATT for a minimum of&#xD;
             2 weeks, or have completed ATT, with at least 2 of the following signs/symptoms of a&#xD;
             paradoxical inflammatory reaction:&#xD;

               -  Recrudescent symptoms of TB after initial clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Change in physical exam after initial clinical improvement suggestive of new&#xD;
                  inflammatory process (e.g., lymphadenopathy or new findings on pulmonary exam).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Worsening radiographic evidence of disease after initiation of treatment, as&#xD;
                  compared with imaging prior to or earlier in treatment.&#xD;
