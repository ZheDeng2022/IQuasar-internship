    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine whether neurofeedback augmented mindfulness intervention&#xD;
      increases the plasticity in brain areas affected by exposure to early life adversity in&#xD;
      youth. The study will first establish the augmented mindfulness training protocol targeting&#xD;
      the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) with real-time fMRI neurofeedback for use with healthy&#xD;
      control and ELA-exposed youth. Next, in addition to ongoing data collection with healthy&#xD;
      controls, ELA-exposed youth will be randomly assigned to either complete the neurofeedback&#xD;
      augmented mindfulness training (AMT) or sham condition protocol. Effect of augmented&#xD;
      mindfulness training on state measures of mindfulness, perceived stress, and affect will be&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early life adversity (ELA) is a major public health crisis that results in significant&#xD;
      disruptions in neurobiological processes and long-term psychiatric and health consequences,&#xD;
      yet very little is known about interventions that may prevent them and the optimal time to do&#xD;
      so. Not only is ELA associated with earlier onset and greater severity and comorbidity of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, these individuals also evidence significantly&#xD;
      poorer responses to psychological and pharmacological interventions when treated for these&#xD;
      conditions. Consequently, there is a dire need to develop preventive interventions that&#xD;
      target individuals with ELA exposure. The first step in this process is to establish&#xD;
      malleability of neural mechanisms disrupted by ELA exposure to acute interventions. We use&#xD;
      augmented mindfulness training, that is, a standard mindfulness training combined with&#xD;
      real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) to influence and&#xD;
      increase the plasticity of brain areas affected by ELA, in turn affecting state changes in&#xD;
      symptoms in youth with ELA exposure. These fMRI tasks are designed to engage the PCC and&#xD;
      mindfulness practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the course of three years, 120 eligible youth with early life adversity or healthy&#xD;
      controls will be recruited into the study. All healthy controls will receive AMT, and&#xD;
      ELA-exposed youth will be randomly assigned to AMT, consisting of real-time fMRI with&#xD;
      neurofeedback during mindfulness practice, or Sham, consisting of artificially calculated&#xD;
      neurofeedback signals during mindfulness practice. Adolescents will complete self-report&#xD;
      measures to assess state affective symptoms before and after receiving mindfulness training&#xD;
      and scanning, and again one week later.&#xD;

    <measure>State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (average: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SMS is a 21-item measure rated on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all - very well). Items may be summed or averaged, with greater scores indicating greater levels of state mindfulness. SMS scores will evidence a greater increase from pre- to post-training and 1-week follow-up in the AMT relative to the Sham group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (average: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS is a 10 item measure on a 5-point Likert scale (never - very often), with 4 items reverse scaled. Items are summed, with greater scores indicating greater levels of perceived stress. PSS scores will evidence a greater decrease from pre- to post-training and 1-week follow-up in AMT relative to the Sham group.</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (average: 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS-C assesses domains of positive and negative affect on a 5-point Likert scale (not much or not at all - a lot) with 30 items. Scores for each domain are summed, with greater scores indicating greater levels of its respective affective domain. PANAS-C scores will evidence a greater change from pre- to post-training and 1-week follow-up in AMT relative to the Sham group.</description>
