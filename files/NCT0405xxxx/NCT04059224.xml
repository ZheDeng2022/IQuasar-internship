  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial will investigate the efficacy and safety of trametinib and dabrafenib in&#xD;
      patients with advanced BRAF V600 (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) wild-type&#xD;
      melanoma (stratified according to BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS (neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene&#xD;
      homolog) mutant and BRAF V600 wild-type/NRAS wild-type melanoma patients) that have been&#xD;
      pretreated and progressed following treatment with PD-1- (programmed cell death-1) and&#xD;
      CTLA-4-blocking (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that treatment with trametinib will result in objective&#xD;
      antitumor activity. In order to improve the tolerability and optimize the dose intensity of&#xD;
      trametinib, a minimal dose of dabrafenib will be added to prevent and manage&#xD;
      trametinib-related skin toxicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a non-randomized stratified dual-arm open-label two-stage single-centre phase 2&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible if they are diagnosed with BRAF V600 (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral&#xD;
      oncogene homolog B) wild-type unresectable AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage&#xD;
      III or IV melanoma and are documented with progression of disease following treatment with a&#xD;
      PD-1- (programmed cell death-1) and CTLA-4-blocking (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated&#xD;
      antigen 4) immune checkpoint inhibitor or who have a contraindication for treatment with&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be considered for study participation not earlier than 4 weeks after the last&#xD;
      dosing of the prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to their NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene&#xD;
      homolog) mutation status: arm A involves patients with advanced pretreated BRAF V600&#xD;
      wild-type/NRAS mutant melanoma; arm B involves patients with advanced pretreated BRAF V600&#xD;
      wild-type/NRAS wild-type melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with trametinib 2 mg once a day and dabrafenib 50 mg twice a&#xD;
      day. Throughout their study participation, patients will be continuously monitored for safety&#xD;
      and evaluated for tumor response every 8 weeks or sooner if there is clinical suspicion of&#xD;
      progressive disease. Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      progression-free survival, overall survival and safety.&#xD;
