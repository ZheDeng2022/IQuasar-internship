      This is a multi-site, open-label gluten challenge study to characterize peripheral blood and&#xD;
      intestinal gluten specific CD4+ T cell subsets in participants with celiac disease (CeD).&#xD;
      Participants will receive 8 grams (g) of gluten daily for 13 consecutive days. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken at pre-dose, Day 6, and Day 14. Duodenal biopsy samples will also be collected&#xD;
      on Day 14. Participants will also complete a symptom diary.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must have documented diagnosis with celiac disease (CeD) by&#xD;
             duodenal/jejunal biopsy at least 6 months prior to entrance into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must be on a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female participants must not be a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 positive, assessed at screening. If&#xD;
             participants have already been genotyped, results from previous testing may be used in&#xD;
             lieu of genotyping at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) &lt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) as&#xD;
             measured by serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be judged to be in good health based on medical history, physical examination&#xD;
             (including a targeted neurological exam), versus (vs.) measurements and&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have a body mass index (BMI) 18-35 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Has a history of significant multiple and/or severe allergies (eg, food, drug, latex&#xD;
             allergy), or has had an anaphylactic reaction or systemic allergic reaction to&#xD;
             prescription or nonprescription drugs or food.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a history of severe acute symptomatic reactions to sporadic gluten&#xD;
             ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Is positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Had major surgery, donated or lost 1 unit of blood (approximately 500 mL) within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to the prestudy (screening) visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Is on Coumadin™ or other anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Is unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of systemic anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
             immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory medications, which may include ibuprofen &gt; 2400&#xD;
             mg/day, naproxen &gt;750 mg/day, prednisone &gt;10 mg/day, or methylprednisolone &gt; 8 mg/day,&#xD;
             within 48 hours prior to the start of and throughout the entire gluten challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has participated in another investigational study within 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is greater) prior to the prestudy (screening) visit. The window will be&#xD;
             derived from the date of the last visit in the previous study.&#xD;
