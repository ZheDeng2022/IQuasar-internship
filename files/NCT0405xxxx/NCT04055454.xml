  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, dose finding phase I trial in&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteer participants consisting of two phases, an unblinded dose escalation&#xD;
      and an observer-blinded treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MV-LASV after&#xD;
      administration of two different dose levels of MV-LASV. Placebo will be applied to blind the&#xD;
      different Treatment schedules.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, observer-blinded, randomized, phase I trial, comparing&#xD;
      different dose levels of MV-LASV. As safety precaution, the study will begin with enrollment&#xD;
      of two successive unblinded dose groups of sentinel participants randomized into groups of&#xD;
      four in an open-label fashion (group A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, 52 participants will be enrolled in an observer-blinded, randomized manner into&#xD;
      one of the three treatment groups (A, B or C). Placebo will be applied to blind the different&#xD;
      Treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening visit, participants will bei enrolled to one of three Treatment groups.&#xD;
      Visits for immunogenicity sample collection and safety assessments will be performed for 56&#xD;
      days, and additionally subjects will for long-term follow-up up to 365 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and site personnel assessing Adverse Events (AEs), all participants, as well&#xD;
      as the sponsor's representatives involved in the monitoring and conduct of the study will be&#xD;
      unblinded to which vaccine was administered within the unblinded treatment phase. Only the&#xD;
      site personnel performing randomization, reparation and administration of Investigational&#xD;
      Medicinal Product (IMP) will be unblinded within the randomized observer-blinded treatment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
