  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether the patient's self-reported pain level is associated with a multivariate&#xD;
      physiological biomarker bias achieved in the actual clinical setting. This study will use a&#xD;
      clinical-grade wearable sensor to continuously monitor the patient's physiological condition&#xD;
      (pain-related biomarkers) and use the mobile app to allow participants to actively report&#xD;
      their pain scores, symptoms and quality of life.After analysis of the biomarkers we may&#xD;
      predict the coming pain attacks by way of the meaningful biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjective scores have traditionally been used to measure human pain, such as the visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) to determine the presence or absence of pain and its severity. People can&#xD;
      only express the pain experienced by dictation, scale, and image depicting the degree of&#xD;
      pain. Although this is important information, the self-evaluation method has problems for&#xD;
      diagnosis and research purposes. The results of a person's self-assessment depend on past&#xD;
      pain experiences and many other cognitive and behavioral factors and therefore change over&#xD;
      time. In addition, it is difficult to obtain a reliable comparison between the rewards of&#xD;
      different people. When the patient complains of a certain degree of pain, it is impossible to&#xD;
      know whether it is equivalent to the same pain described by other patients. Moreover, it is&#xD;
      difficult to obtain self-evaluation results among ethnic groups of different natures, such as&#xD;
      young people, patients who block the transmission of ideas due to different disease types,&#xD;
      and those who are unconscious. A variety of survey-based pain scales and functions have been&#xD;
      developed recently, and the utility has improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because it is still based on self-assessment, it will leave some of the same&#xD;
      problems with self-assessment. Developmental measurements of biomarkers or surrogate markers&#xD;
      with acute and/or chronic pain have made significant progress over the past few years. Thanks&#xD;
      to the development of new and improved technologies, such as in the field of angiography and&#xD;
      wearable biosensors, there has been considerable development. Studies have shown that pupils&#xD;
      respond to a variety of different stimuli and may predict the presence of pain. There are&#xD;
      many different physiological parameters, such as changes in heart rate, pulsating components&#xD;
      of the heart cycle, and skin activity, which have been shown to be associated with the&#xD;
      presence or absence of pain. From the development of research in this field, it is feasible&#xD;
      to develop clinical tools for measuring the presence or absence of acute and/or chronic pain,&#xD;
      including cancer pain, using biomarkers or surrogate markers. This objective tool can make&#xD;
      more significant advances in clinical pain research and treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Patient will report pain intensity in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0-10 through smartphone and when they suffer from pain. If possible they will type in the medications they take when they suffer from moderate (NRS&gt;=4) to severe pain (NRS&gt;=7). Besides, they may choosing the location of pain using a validated body map and logging the time the pain event took place to the nearest 15 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Reporting and record of EQ-5D-3L (Quality of Life Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>There are 5 dimensions in the record of EQ-5D-3L (3-level version of the EuroQol-5 Dimension of health questionnaire) including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/ depression. There are 3 severity levels (no such problem, some problems/ moderately affected, unable to perform activities or extremely affected) in each dimensions of evaluation. The labels 1-3 describe different severity levels in a dimension and are used to form part of a numerical description of a health state.&#xD;
The second part is the EQ VAS (EuroQol visual analogue scale) records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical VAS scled from 0 to 100 where the endpoints 0 and 100 are labelled 'The worst health you can imagine' and 'The best health you can imagine'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents</description>
