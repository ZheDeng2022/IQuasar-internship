  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-Intestinal Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (GI-aGVHD) is a complication of allogeneic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant which is usually treated with steroids. You are being asked to take part&#xD;
      in this study because you have recently been diagnosed with GI-GVHD. The standard of care for&#xD;
      GI-aGVHD is steroids. When aGVHD does not respond to steroids it is described as&#xD;
      steroid-refractory aGVHD. There is no standard therapy for steroid-refractory GI-aGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase II study. The main goal of a Phase II study is to see the efficacy and&#xD;
      what side effects are seen with FMT as a treatment for GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of fecal material from a healthy donor&#xD;
      to a patient in order to restore the diversity of the intestinal microbiota. FMT is currently&#xD;
      indicated for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium Difficile infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMT is considered experimental in this study, meaning it is not approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of GVHD.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study follows R. Simon's minimax two-stage phase II design with type I error of 0.05 and power of 80%. Ten participants will be enrolled on stage one. If there are 2 or less responses, the trial will be stopped and the treatment will be considered less than 60% effective for this patient population. If there are 3 or more responses, 7 additional patients will be enrolled.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Toxicity is defined as:&#xD;
Any bacterial or fungal infection that can be definitely attributed to FMT.&#xD;
Any grade 3 or more adverse event that occurs during or immediately after receiving the treatment and is definitely attributed to FMT.</description>

    <description>Response will be determined from the maximum GI-aGVHD stage and grade at day 28 (+/- 3 days) post FMT treatment. Response will be determined by P.I and a second physician.&#xD;
Complete response (CR) is defined as the complete resolution of GI aGVHD symptoms, without secondary GVHD therapy.&#xD;
Partial response (PR) is defined as improvement without complete resolution and without worsening of GI aGVHD, without secondary aGVHD therapy.&#xD;
No response (NR) is defined as the same grade of GVHD, progression, death, or the addition of secondary GVHD therapy.&#xD;
Progression is defined as worsening GI aGVHD.</description>
