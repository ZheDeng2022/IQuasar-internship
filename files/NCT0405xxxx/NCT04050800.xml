  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open label, imaging study of radiochemical and radiation safety in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and in-line computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT), the whole body (WB) biokinetics of Carbon-11 butanol will be quantified with serial&#xD;
      scans acquired every 3 minutes for two hours. Vital signs (VS), electrocardiograms (ECGs) and&#xD;
      clinical laboratory tests of intrernal organ function will be acquired before and at several&#xD;
      timepoints after administration of the radiopharmaceutical. Radiation exposures will be&#xD;
      estimated with the MIRD Formalism.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vital signs (VSs) will be measured, electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be acquired, and blood&#xD;
      will be sent to the clinical laboratory for safety assessments before a single dose,&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) administration of 555 MBq of Carbon-11 butanol. VSs will be re-measured,&#xD;
      ECGs will be acquired again, and more blood will be sent to the clinical laboratory for&#xD;
      repeat safety assessments after 2 hours of whole body (WB) scanning. WB scanning will consist&#xD;
      of imaging acquisition sweeps of 200 cm from head-to-toe over 180 secs (3 min). Up to 40&#xD;
      sweeps per imaging session will be performed. The subjects will then be given a rest period&#xD;
      (&quot;coffee break&quot;) for about two hours, after which the entire sequence of events will be&#xD;
      repeated. The primary outcome measure will be related to radiation safety derived from the&#xD;
      areas under the time-activity curves (AUCs) for internal organs. Co-primary clinical safety&#xD;
      measures will include changes in VSs, ECG parameters such as the PR and corrected QT&#xD;
      intervals, and clinical laboratory tests, such as proteins that reflect renal and hepatic&#xD;
      function. Secondary endpoints will include the time-activity curves (TACs) and total volumes&#xD;
      of distribution (VT) in several brain regions. The results should allow calculation of the&#xD;
      repeatability coefficients (RCs) under zero-biological-change conditions. RC values will be&#xD;
      essential for understanding whether future measurements of effect sizes in response to&#xD;
      therapeutic maneuvers or the differences between groups are meaningful.&#xD;
