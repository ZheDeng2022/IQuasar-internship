  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study with an open-label dose escalation phase followed by a blinded&#xD;
      withdrawal phase and an open label extension. The study is designed to monitor the PTG-300&#xD;
      safety profile and to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of PTG-300 for the treatment of&#xD;
      phlebotomy-requiring polycythemia vera.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2 study in approximately sixty subjects previously diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera who&#xD;
      require phlebotomy on a routine basis. There is a 28 week dose finding phase to identify a&#xD;
      dose that maintains hematocrit &lt;45%. Subjects who successfully complete the dose finding&#xD;
      phase will be entered into a 12 week randomized withdrawal phase to confirm the response.&#xD;
      Subsequently patients will enter into an up to 3 year open label extension to investigate&#xD;
      long term safety.&#xD;

    <description>A subject will be considered a responder during the blinded randomized withdrawal phase if hematocrit control is maintained without phlebotomy eligibility.&#xD;
&quot;Phlebotomy eligibility&quot; is defined as any one of the following criteria being met:&#xD;
hematocrit ≥45% that was ≥3% higher than Week 29 pre-randomization hematocrit value, or&#xD;
hematocrit &gt;48%, or&#xD;
an increase of ≥5% in hematocrit compared to Week 29 pre-randomization hematocrit value.</description>

    <description>&quot;Phlebotomy eligibility&quot; in Part 1 is defined as a hematocrit ≥45% that was ≥3% higher than baseline level (defined as Part 1 pre-dose Day 1) or a hematocrit &gt;48%.</description>
