      This is a prospective, single center study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh designed&#xD;
      to test the applicability and utility of XenMatrix™ AB Surgical Graft in the restoration of&#xD;
      function in the setting of volumetric muscle loss after soft tissue trauma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Previously, a human subject clinical trial (NCT01292876, PRO10010500) to evaluate a&#xD;
      regenerative medicine approach using ECM for VML treatment was conducted. ECM scaffolds were&#xD;
      implanted and combined with aggressive and early physical therapy in 13 subjects, then&#xD;
      followed for 24-28 weeks after implantation. Histomorphological assessments collected from&#xD;
      core needle biopsies identified formation of new, vascularized, innervated islands of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle within the implantation site. Subjects demonstrated increased force&#xD;
      production in physical therapy evaluations and improved functional task performance when&#xD;
      compared with pre-operative performance. By 6 months after ECM implantation, subjects had a&#xD;
      37.3% improvement in strength and 27.1% improvement in range-of-motion tasks. Additionally,&#xD;
      changes in nerve conduction study (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) before and after ECM&#xD;
      implantation were measured. 63% of study participants experienced improvements in NCS or EMG&#xD;
      within the scaffold remodeling site, indicating clinical improvement in muscle strength. The&#xD;
      promising functional and regenerative results from this early study encourages evidence of&#xD;
      ECM bioscaffolding as a viable treatment to VML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to use XenMatrix™ AB Surgical Graft which has 510(k) approval [#K162193]&#xD;
      intended for implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists and for surgical&#xD;
      repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue, including abdominal plastic and reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery; muscle flap reinforcement; hernia repair including abdominal, inguinal, femoral,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic, scrotal, umbilical, and incisional hernias. The graft has an antibiotic&#xD;
      coating, specifically, Rifampin and Minocycline. This coating has been shown in preclinical&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo testing to reduce or inhibit microbial colonization on the device. The&#xD;
      claim of reduction of bacterial colonization of the device has not yet been established with&#xD;
      human clinical data, nor has a clinical impact associated with this claim been demonstrated&#xD;
      and will need further investigation. This trial proposes to test the applicability and&#xD;
      utility of XenMatrix™ AB Surgical Graft in the restoration of function in the setting of&#xD;
      volumetric muscle loss after trauma. 10 subjects will be enrolled for participation in the&#xD;
      study. Prior to Graft implantation, subjects will receive a pre-operative course of physical&#xD;
      therapy for a maximum time period of 16 weeks. A physical therapist will confirm that&#xD;
      functional plateau is reached prior to implantation of the Graft. Following Graft&#xD;
      implantation, radiographic, functional, and electrophysotherapy outcomes will be measured at&#xD;
      various time points up to 24-28 weeks post-operatively. A CT scan or MRI will be collected at&#xD;
      screening and pre-operative visits to evaluate tissue volume, then again at post-operative&#xD;
      Visit 1 and Visit 6. Physical therapy training will be performed as a research procedure&#xD;
      following Graft implantation for a maximum of 30 weeks. Additionally, Physical Therapy&#xD;
      evaluations will be conducted at screening, pre-op visit 1, post-op, and at post-op Visits 3,&#xD;
      and 4. A small core needle biopsy 1-5 grams will be collected at three time points to conduct&#xD;
      histomorphological assessment of the tissue prior to Graft implantation (Operative visit,&#xD;
      Visit 2 and at Visit 4).&#xD;

             with the XenMatrix AB Surgical Graft&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or situation as it relates to the subject's health or safety, that would&#xD;
             render concern to the investigators, and therefore preclude subject enrollment in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
