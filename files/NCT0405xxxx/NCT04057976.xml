  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular schwannomas (VS) arise from the vestibulocochlear (hearing and balance) nerve,&#xD;
      located at the base of the brain. Although benign, VS can enlarge over time, resulting in&#xD;
      debilitating symptoms; therefore, surgical removal is frequently offered. One significant&#xD;
      risk of surgery is inadvertent injury to the facial nerve, which lies adjacent to the&#xD;
      vestibulocochlear nerve. Currently, the nerve's course is only revealed during surgical&#xD;
      dissection and injury can cause permanent facial weakness. It would therefore be useful for&#xD;
      the surgeon to know the course of the nerve before operating. To this end, a new MRI&#xD;
      technique known as probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) has shown potential in&#xD;
      revealing the course of the facial nerve pre-operatively. However, its clinical reliability&#xD;
      remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the reliability of DTT in identifying the course of the facial&#xD;
      nerve preoperatively in patients undergoing surgery for VS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The future benefit would be to enable surgeons to operate with more confidence and&#xD;
      potentially reduce the chance of nerve injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit adult patients due to have surgery for VS. The only change to the&#xD;
      participants' clinical pathways will be the addition of a DTT sequence to their pre-operative&#xD;
      MRI scans (increasing scanning time by approximately 10 minutes).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Vestibular schwannomas (VS) are peripheral nerve sheath tumours&#xD;
      arising from the vestibulocochlear nerve, which emerges from the brainstem at the base of the&#xD;
      brain and enters the structures of the inner ear via a small bony canal within the skull&#xD;
      (internal auditory meatus). VS account for 8% (Johnson J et al.) of intracranial tumours and,&#xD;
      although benign, these tumours can grow resulting in several potentially debilitating&#xD;
      symptoms, including hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus, facial paralysis and meningitis.&#xD;
      Furthermore, large tumours may cause compression on the brainstem, which can, in some cases,&#xD;
      have life-threatening consequences (Johnson J et al.). Therefore, patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      larger tumours (&gt;1.5cm extrameatal component) are frequently offered surgical resection (as&#xD;
      opposed to conservative management or stereotactic radiosurgery). As surgical techniques have&#xD;
      improved, the goal of surgery has broadened to include not only tumour removal, but also&#xD;
      preservation of the function of the nerves involved by VS. In particular, surgical resection&#xD;
      aims to preserve the function of the facial nerve, responsible for innervating the muscles of&#xD;
      facial expression, and which runs alongside the vestibulocochlear nerve and is frequently&#xD;
      displaced and flattened by VS. Given its juxtaposition, the facial nerve is at high risk of&#xD;
      injury during surgery. Injury to the facial nerve (and consequent debilitating facial&#xD;
      weakness or paralysis) is a serious potential risk of vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery.&#xD;
      However, at present, the only means of avoiding nerve injury involves a combination of&#xD;
      meticulous surgical technique and the use of a facial nerve monitor (a device that can detect&#xD;
      activity within the facial muscles when stimulated by a surgeon-held probe); however, despite&#xD;
      this, facial nerve injury may still occur. Indeed, until the surgeon begins operating, the&#xD;
      course of the facial nerve is unknown. In a large series (&gt;1000 surgical cases) by Sampath et&#xD;
      al., the position of the facial nerve position was found most commonly on the anterior middle&#xD;
      portion of the tumour; however, in a smaller proportion of cases, the nerve lay in 1 of 7&#xD;
      additional locations (Sampath et al.). Therefore, it follows that preoperative detection and&#xD;
      identification of the course of the facial nerve would be extremely useful to guide surgery&#xD;
      and reduce the potential risk of neuronal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There now exists a potential means of non-invasively identifying the course of the facial&#xD;
      nerve using advanced applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This involves&#xD;
      utilising a technique known as diffusion tensor tractography (DTT), which has the capacity to&#xD;
      detect the direction (vector) of diffusivity in a particular volume of tissue (voxel)&#xD;
      (Mukherjee et al.). This data can be subsequently used to reveal structures, such as nerve&#xD;
      fibre tracts, that are arranged along particular vectors, enabling them to be differentiated&#xD;
      from surrounding tissue (Cauley et al.). This cannot be achieved using standard MRI&#xD;
      sequences, in which the flattened nerve often becomes indistinguishable from the adjacent VS.&#xD;
      Fortunately, as MRI represents the current means of diagnosing and characterising VS, adding&#xD;
      an additional DTT sequence to a patient's scan does not represent a significant burden (only&#xD;
      approximately 10 additional minutes of scanning time to acquire the DTT data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several groups (Choi et al., Taoka et al., Gerganov et al., Zhang et al. and Song et al.)&#xD;
      have used DTT to delineate the course of the facial nerve in patients with VS and the&#xD;
      majority have reported high success rates (&gt;90% agreement with operative findings). However,&#xD;
      many of these studies employed 'deterministic' DTT, which has drawbacks that limit its&#xD;
      reliability in the setting of small fibre tracts with complex geometry. In particular, it is&#xD;
      unable to accurately track fibres that cross, split or merge because the technique assumes&#xD;
      that adjacent voxels have similar vectors. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose&#xD;
      using the newer 'probabilistic' DTT technique that calculates a vector for each voxel&#xD;
      analysed. It therefore has the capacity to account for complex geometries, such as those&#xD;
      encountered in the facial nerve, particularly where its course is heavily distorted by tumour&#xD;
      tissue. Zolal et al. used this technique in 21 patients with VS, resulting in an agreement&#xD;
      rate of 81% for the position of the facial nerve and 33% for the cochlear nerve (Zolal et&#xD;
      al.). However, there is an ongoing need for further studies in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project seeks to clarify the accuracy, reproducibility and practicality of probabilistic&#xD;
      DTT in locating the facial nerve pre-operatively. If the technique proves accurate, it will&#xD;
      potentially help with pre-operative planning and avoidance of facial nerve injury during VS&#xD;
      surgery. Additionally the project seeks to clarify associated practical issues; in&#xD;
      particular, the inter-observer/intra-observer variability (i.e. whether the reading&#xD;
      radiologists agree with each other and themselves when analysing DTT images), whether the&#xD;
      facial nerve position can be partially inferred on conventional sequences (comparing this&#xD;
      with DTT) and whether adjacent nerves (such as the vestibulocochlear nerve) can be&#xD;
      identified, which may further help with surgical preoperative planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that preoperative advanced probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography&#xD;
      (DTT) will accurately demonstrate the position of the facial nerve relative to extrameatal&#xD;
      portion of a vestibular schwannoma. It is proposed that the accuracy will be superior to&#xD;
      previous studies in which deterministic DTT has been used to demonstrate the position of the&#xD;
      facial nerve. This pre-operative mapping has the potential to decrease the rates of facial&#xD;
      nerve injury during vestibular schwannoma surgery and allow for increased resection of the&#xD;
      tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective cohort observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study eligibility and outcome measures, please see the relevant sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMAGE ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI In addition to standard imaging assessment, further image analysis will be performed&#xD;
      offline using MRTrix 3.0 (www.mrtrix.org) in tensor probabililty mode. The presence of one or&#xD;
      more cranial nerve tracts will be determined by their consistent depiction following their&#xD;
      systematic interrogation with varying anisotropy thresholds. There will be a qualitative&#xD;
      assessment of cranial nerve position will be achieved by dividing the circumference of the&#xD;
      extrameatal vestibular schwannoma into segments.The assessment will be performed by two&#xD;
      observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference standard:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position of the facial nerve with respect to the extrameatal portion of the vestibular&#xD;
      schwannoma will be assessed at surgery will be achieved by dividing the circumference of the&#xD;
      extrameatal vestibular schwannoma into multiple segments in the same manner as above. This&#xD;
      assessment will be made independently of the results of the pre-operative probabilistic DTT&#xD;
      (the neurosurgeon recording the data will be blinded to the DTT findings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation based upon a sample size of 32, assuming a true kappa coefficient of 0.9;&#xD;
      the 95% confidence interval will have a width of 0.26 (0.77 - 1.03). The number (32) also&#xD;
      reflects the number of cases that we expect to recruit over a 2-3 year period.&#xD;
