      SCI Thrive is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of SCI Thrive (6 week&#xD;
      Peer-Led Online Self-Management Program) to improve quality of life and self-efficacy for&#xD;
      individuals with SCI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With spinal cord injury (SCI), individuals are at a greater risk for a number of chronic&#xD;
      health conditions. Research suggests that these health conditions reduce quality of life for&#xD;
      individuals with SCI and decrease social engagement. Many of these health conditions are in&#xD;
      fact preventable by early detection, behavioral changes, and early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-management programs have emerged as an adjunct to traditional health care services based&#xD;
      management of chronic conditions. Self-management programs provide necessary knowledge, and&#xD;
      skills, but ultimately focus on the central role of the individual in balancing medical&#xD;
      management, maintaining life roles and community engagement, and managing emotional distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond self-management strategies alone, more evidence now exists for increasing&#xD;
      self-management and knowledge of health related resources for individuals with SCI through&#xD;
      peer support. Face-to-face peer support programs have been found to improve self-efficacy and&#xD;
      reduce the occurrence of medical complications. Additionally, peer support is positively&#xD;
      associated with social participation and life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an online, peer led self-management program can&#xD;
      lead to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An improvement in of quality of life for people with spinal cord injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase in confidence in your ability to achieve goals (self-efficacy) and community&#xD;
           participation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess if improvements last 3 months after completion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate participant satisfaction with the program and the materials&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide to take part in this study, you will first be asked to complete an online&#xD;
      survey which should take about 20 minutes. You will then be randomized (like flipping a coin)&#xD;
      in the treatment group or the control group. If you are in the treatment group, you will&#xD;
      begin the online program. If you are in the control group, you will be asked to wait 6 weeks&#xD;
      before beginning the program. After 6 weeks, both groups will take a second online survey. If&#xD;
      you are in the control group, we will ask if you want to take part in the online program. If&#xD;
      you do, you will have one additional survey upon completion of the online program. 3 months&#xD;
      after completion of the online program, we will contact you to complete the final online&#xD;
      survey. Each of these surveys should take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first survey will ask some information about you and your background. The first survey&#xD;
      and the last two will also ask questions about how you manage your health with a spinal cord&#xD;
      injury, how satisfied you are in various aspects of your life, how much you get around, how&#xD;
      you spend your time, and interact with people. Some of the most sensitive questions ask about&#xD;
      satisfaction with income, relationships, and sexual activity. You may refuse to answer any&#xD;
      question in the surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you take part in the online self-management program, you will work through a different&#xD;
      educational module each week. These will include modules on goal setting, thinking strategies&#xD;
      and distraction, alternative thoughts, problem solving and decision tools, communication and&#xD;
      advocacy, applying to your own goals, and relaxations exercises for each session. Each module&#xD;
      should take approximately 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6 week program, there will be at lease three video/telephone conferences with the&#xD;
      peer leader and the other participants. The goal of the weekly conference is for participants&#xD;
      to discuss the materials, what aspects are working or not working for them, provide their&#xD;
      individual perspectives, and support each other. These conferences will last no longer than 1&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
