    <textblock>
      Patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) often suffer from spinal cord swelling&#xD;
      inside the thecal sac, which contains the spinal cord and surrounding fluid, leading to&#xD;
      increased pressure on the spinal cord tissue and decreased spinal cord blood flow at the site&#xD;
      of injury. The combination of increased pressure and decreased blood flow causes vascular&#xD;
      hypo-perfusion of the spinal cord and exacerbates the severity of injury. This is also&#xD;
      referred to as secondary injury. Thus, knowledge of spinal cord hypo-perfusion would allow&#xD;
      the treating physician to optimize the hemodynamic condition of patient with acute spinal&#xD;
      cord injury and potentially improve functional outcome. We plan to use contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS) to determine decrease of blood flow in the spinal cord at the site of&#xD;
      injury, during the routine surgery that these patients require to decompress and stabilize&#xD;
      their injured spine. This may help us to determine the efficacy of certain treatments in&#xD;
      improving blood flow and patients suffering from tSCI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the Harborview Emergency room with acute traumatic spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (tSCI) will be recruited to undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) during routine&#xD;
      surgery for decompression and stabilization of their injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) develops in two phases. The primary injury is&#xD;
      characterized by direct mechanical destruction of cells, nerve fibers and blood vessels. The&#xD;
      secondary injury phase represents the downstream biological effects of the loss of blood flow&#xD;
      in the injury center as well as significant hypoperfusion in the surrounding penumbral zone.&#xD;
      This process is associated with cytotoxic spinal cord edema, which causes a rise of tissue&#xD;
      pressure within the contused spinal cord. While experimental studies demonstrate that spinal&#xD;
      cord tissue damage due to primary injury is often remarkably limited, the cascade of&#xD;
      biochemical and molecular processes that comprise secondary injury often exacerbate and&#xD;
      define the extent of injury to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, two routinely performed clinical treatment strategies aim to mitigate the&#xD;
      effects of secondary injury by improving the local tissue perfusion of the contused spinal&#xD;
      cord. First, surgical decompression of the spinal cord is recommended within 24 hours after&#xD;
      injury, as it may improve functional outcome. Second, trauma guidelines recommend maintenance&#xD;
      of the mean arterial blood pressure at 85 - 90 Hg for the first 7 days after acute spinal&#xD;
      cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these interventions and a tremendous research effort to develop neuroprotective&#xD;
      therapies targeting the hypoperfused &quot;rescue-able&quot; penumbral zone, there are no clinically&#xD;
      efficacious techniques to improve functional outcome following tSCI. We believe that a lack&#xD;
      of clinical biomarkers for hypoperfused &quot;rescue-able&quot; penumbral zone is a main road block for&#xD;
      the development of novel therapeutic procedures and therapies. This motivates a search for a&#xD;
      biomarker for tSCI that can guide surgical and critical care interventions. We seek to&#xD;
      develop an ultrasound-based biomarker for tSCI that is sensitive to the underlying tissue&#xD;
      pathology and predictive of clinical outcomes.&#xD;
