    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of Regorafenib in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma (GBM) who have progressed on bevacizumab.&#xD;
      Regorafenib is FDA approved administered as monotherapy during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      22 total patients are expected to participate in this study. Even though a participant may&#xD;
      meet all the criteria for participation, it is possible that they will not be enrolled in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
