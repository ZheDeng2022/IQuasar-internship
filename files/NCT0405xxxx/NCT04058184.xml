  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's main research question will be investigating whether or not there is a&#xD;
      significant difference in Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) as well as startle response probability&#xD;
      and magnitude between contact and noncontact youth sports players. The study team will test&#xD;
      these questions using a controlled laboratory scenario in which the presentation of startle&#xD;
      stimuli can be observed, measured, and quantified in order to compare the results between the&#xD;
      two sample populations. During preliminary testing, the study team can predict that there&#xD;
      will be no significant differences between contact sports players and noncontact sports&#xD;
      players in their startle reactivity and level of exhibited PPI. Based on previous literature,&#xD;
      the study team hypothesizes that those in the contact sports group will experience greater&#xD;
      startle reactivity and less PPI than those in the noncontact sports group when they are&#xD;
      tested at the end of their sports season. Using this information, the present study will&#xD;
      allow for additional understanding of the neurological and physiological behaviors associated&#xD;
      with subconcussive head impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess and determine whether prepulse inhibition in youth contact sports&#xD;
      players and non-contact sports players, both before and after a sports season, will&#xD;
      significantly differ. Measures will include the startle magnitude, startle probability,&#xD;
      reaction time, and accuracy of tone detection responses.&#xD;

      Our main research question will be investigating whether or not there is a significant&#xD;
      difference in PPI, as well as startle response probability and magnitude between contact and&#xD;
      noncontact youth sports players. The study team will test these questions using a controlled&#xD;
      laboratory scenario in which the presentation of startle stimuli can be observed, measured,&#xD;
      and quantified in order to compare the results between the two sample populations. During&#xD;
      preliminary testing, the study team can predict that there will be no significant differences&#xD;
      between contact sports players and noncontact sports players in their startle reactivity and&#xD;
      level of exhibited PPI. Based on previous literature, the study team hypothesizes that those&#xD;
      in the contact sports group will experience greater startle reactivity and less PPI than&#xD;
      those in the noncontact sports group when they are tested at the end of their sports season.&#xD;
      Using this information, the present study will allow for additional understanding of the&#xD;
      neurological and physiological behaviors associated with subconcussive head impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess and determine whether prepulse inhibition in youth contact sports&#xD;
      players and non-contact sports players, both before and after a sports season, will&#xD;
      significantly differ. Measures will include the startle magnitude, startle probability,&#xD;
      reaction time, and accuracy of tone detection responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a case-control study, examining the contact sports players as the&#xD;
      testing sample and the noncontact sports players as the control sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will arrive and hear an introduction of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants (and their parent/guardian if under the age of 18) will read and sign an&#xD;
           informed consent and/or informed assent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a series of questionnaires prior to electrode placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Health History Questionnaire will be completed first to determine participant&#xD;
                eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The STAI will be completed next to be used for further analysis in the data&#xD;
                compilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have three electrodes placed on the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Two electrodes will be placed underneath the left eye as the nasal and temporal&#xD;
                electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  One electrode will be placed on the left temple as the ground electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  These electrodes connect to the Biopac apparatus, the software that measures the&#xD;
                participant's EMG activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The procedure of the study will be thoroughly explained to the participants. They will&#xD;
           be instructed to wear headphones that will deliver the acoustic startle stimuli and to&#xD;
           remain as still and quiet as possible during the startle blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There will be a total of two startle blocks: baseline and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The baseline startle block will consist of a combination of prepulses at 70&#xD;
                decibels of 800 and 1000 Hz frequency tones for a duration of 30 milliseconds&#xD;
                presented with an onset of 120 milliseconds prior to the presentation of the&#xD;
                startle stimulus of 100 decibels of broadband noise for 50 milliseconds on some&#xD;
                trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The testing block will also consist of prepulses at 70 decibels of 800 and 1000 Hz&#xD;
                frequency tones for a duration of 30 milliseconds presented with an onset of 120&#xD;
                milliseconds prior to the presentation of the startle stimulus of 100 decibels of&#xD;
                broadband noise for 50 milliseconds on some trials. For the testing block,&#xD;
                participants will be asked to respond on a keypad when they hear the lower prepulse&#xD;
                tone of 800 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Startle stimuli will be presented via headphones. Startle stimuli will be presented&#xD;
                from the Superlab software program which will run from the testing room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the testing block, the electrodes will be removed from the participant's skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be thoroughly debriefed on the aims of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in the MRI suite of Wake Forest Baptist Health. A single room&#xD;
      within the suite will be designated for the PPI testing, in order to control for external&#xD;
      noise factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the consent process, subjects will be asked to fill out a brief health history&#xD;
      questionnaire. This is for the purpose of determining the subject's eligibility to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Subjects will also be asked to complete an STAI form, and this will&#xD;
      be used later during data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last approximately one hour. The introduction and consent process will take&#xD;
      about 10 minutes. The questionnaire process is expected to take about 10 minutes. The&#xD;
      application of sensors should take about 10 minutes. The testing process, including the&#xD;
      explanation of both startle blocks, should last about 20 minutes. The sensor removal and&#xD;
      debriefing process will last about 10 minutes.&#xD;
