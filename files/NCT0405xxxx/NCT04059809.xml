      A prospective single blind controlled randomized trial to evaluate the superiority of&#xD;
      photobiomodulation (PBM) using LED-therapy in reducing the prevalence of radiodermatitis in&#xD;
      breast cancer compared to usual local care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world, the most common among women in&#xD;
      Brazil and accounts for approximately 25% of new cases of cancer in women. One of the pillars&#xD;
      of treatment is the radiotherapy, being able to generate a toxic effect in the neoplastic&#xD;
      cells and also deleterious in healthy cells, with early and late side effects, being&#xD;
      radiodermatitis one of these affections. Moreover, radiodermatitis may cause discontinuation&#xD;
      of radiotherapy until the skin is able to receive the appropriate dose. Photobiomodulation&#xD;
      (PBM) is a non-invasive, a-thermal treatment modality based on the effect of light in&#xD;
      biological systems leading to the activation of epithelial healing through the modulation of&#xD;
      several metabolic processes through photochemical reactions. PBM use in an oncologic setting&#xD;
      has become an interesting object of study in recent years and even though there are different&#xD;
      possibilities for the use in breast cancer and physicians are not yet familiar with this&#xD;
      therapy. Several in vitro studies with different cell types ranging from keratinocytes,&#xD;
      endothelial cells and fibroblasts have been performed showing that PBM is capable of&#xD;
      enhancing cell migration, proliferation, local metabolism, inducing collagen synthesis and&#xD;
      secretion of growth factors, self-regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and cellular apoptosis, aiding in the recovery of the dermis and epidermis. The aim of this&#xD;
      study will be to evaluate the superiority of the use of photobiomodulation using LED-therapy&#xD;
      in relation to the development of radiodermatitis in breast cancer compared to usual local&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will included 110 women after informed consent will be randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups. There will be 11 groups of 10 envelopes each, where each group will contain a code&#xD;
      that allocates patients in group A (05 patients) and group B (05 patients). After the&#xD;
      allocation of the 10 patients, a new envelope group will be available until the total number&#xD;
      of patients scheduled for this study is reached (110, 55 in each group). Group A (GA) will be&#xD;
      the control group of usual care according to the orientation of the radiation therapy clinic&#xD;
      responsible for the radiotherapy treatment and with the use of the PBM device switched off.&#xD;
      Group B (GB) will be the intervention group, which in addition to the usual care oriented in&#xD;
      the radiotherapy clinic responsible for the radiotherapy treatment will use the attached PBM.&#xD;
      Both groups will use a pair of glasses that will block the visualization of the light emitted&#xD;
      by the PBM device, precisely so that they do not know in which research group it is located.&#xD;
      Treatment will be done twice weekly, Tuesday and Thursday. The Photobiomodulation will be&#xD;
      with the Cicatrillux (CosmedicalÂ®) LED that contains 36 red light emitters in a 10x12 cm&#xD;
      neoprene plate with 650 nm LED wave length whose optical spot diameter is 5 mm and with an&#xD;
      average wave length of 2 ~ 5 mw for 10 minutes that will be placed over the area that will be&#xD;
      irradiated for 10 minutes; the LED board will be wrapped in a plastic film that will be&#xD;
      changed between each use. Both, the control group and the intervention group, will be&#xD;
      evaluated for radiodermatitis by the oncologist who accompanies them and by a nurse, and both&#xD;
      evaluators will not know in which group the person evaluated belongs. Concomitant to the&#xD;
      radiotherapy sessions, both groups will be evaluated by a clinical and sociodemographic&#xD;
      questionnaire, by the &quot;Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System&quot; (BRFSS), by the&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire (DASH) by the Analog Visual Scale&#xD;
      for Pain, Radiodermatitis Assessment through the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG),&#xD;
      application of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Breast Cancer-Specific&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaire questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23) and the European Organization&#xD;
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-30), all questionnaires have already been&#xD;
      translated and validated into the Portuguese language. The classification of radiodermatitis&#xD;
      and pain assessment will be repeated 90 days after the start of radiotherapy. A descriptive&#xD;
      and comparative analysis of the intervention groups will be performed in relation to the&#xD;
      selected variables. The evaluation of the outcomes will be performed by intention to treat&#xD;
      and by adherence to the protocol, through relative risk, and 95% confidence interval. To&#xD;
      analyze the data will be used &quot;Statistical Package for Social Sciences&quot; (SPSS) v.23 Demo&#xD;
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, United States). The McNemar test will be used to compare pain&#xD;
      levels between groups. For inter-group assessments of the proportion of radiodermatitis, the&#xD;
      chi-square test will be used to compare the intervention and control of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to describe the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
      of the studied population; to evaluate the incidence of radiodermatitis in people with breast&#xD;
      cancer, immediately after and 90 days post-radiotherapy according to study intervention&#xD;
      group; to evaluate the adherence and satisfaction to treatment with PMB using LED-therapy in&#xD;
      people with breast cancer; to compare the occurrence of pain and its graduation according to&#xD;
      the intervention group, immediately after the radiotherapy and in the follow-up of 90 days in&#xD;
      people with breast cancer; to evaluate the quality of life of people submitted to&#xD;
      radiotherapy for breast cancer according to the intervention group and changes in&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are women older than 18 years with histological diagnosis of breast&#xD;
      cancer who underwent conservative surgery or mastectomy, without immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction, treated with conventional radiotherapy referred by the oncologist who&#xD;
      accompanies her regularly and who have availability of 20 minutes before the radiotherapy&#xD;
      session to CORSB Radiation Therapy and Megavoltage to apply the LED-therapy and accept to&#xD;
      participate in the research signing the Free and Informed Consent Term (TCLE). Patients who&#xD;
      have undergone mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction and those who suffer from&#xD;
      collagen diseases will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that photobiomodulation can stop the progression of&#xD;
      radiodermatitis or lead to a faster cure, in turn, would have beneficial effects on the&#xD;
      quality of life of these people. Then, it is expected that, at the end of radiotherapy&#xD;
      sessions, people treated with therapy would have less severe skin reactions and higher&#xD;
      quality of life when compared to people in the control group.&#xD;
