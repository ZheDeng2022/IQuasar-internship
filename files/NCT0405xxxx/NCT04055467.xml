  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will help fill gaps in existing research by determining if&#xD;
      nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers show changes in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor&#xD;
      (nAChR) availability when compared to matched historical controls using positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging and the radioactive ligand [18F]-ASEM&#xD;
      (3-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-6 [18F]fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide), an α7&#xD;
      nAChR antagonist. The study will also explore whether α7 nAChR availability influences&#xD;
      clinically relevant measures of tobacco abstinence (e.g., withdrawal and craving, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment), self-reported cigarettes per day, and time to relapse during an 8-day quit&#xD;
      attempt during which smokers can receive escalating payments contingent upon providing&#xD;
      objective evidence (breath CO and urinary cotinine) of smoking abstinence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this basic clinical research study is to examine the role of the&#xD;
      alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in tobacco use disorder. nAChRs are the&#xD;
      primary site of action for nicotine (the main psychoactive component of tobacco). The most&#xD;
      common types of nAChRs are heteromeric nAChRs containing beta2 subunits and homomeric nAChRs,&#xD;
      which contain only alpha7 subunits. It is currently unknown if or how chronic tobacco use&#xD;
      affects alpha7 nAChR in humans. The investigators' working hypothesis is brain alpha7 nAChR&#xD;
      density associated with chronic nicotine exposure and the development of tobacco use disorder&#xD;
      may be influence severity of tobacco craving and withdrawal during early smoking abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed group sample sizes are 18 tobacco smokers (accrual) and 18 nonsmokers (drawn from&#xD;
      historical and contemporary controls in ongoing studies). Media-recruited male and female&#xD;
      heavy smokers will be assessed for study inclusion/exclusion criteria using a structured&#xD;
      diagnostic interview and a standard battery of instruments, as well as a medical exam to&#xD;
      determine general health. Study candidates also provide breath and urine samples to determine&#xD;
      biomarkers of tobacco use (breath carbon oxide and urinary cotinine levels), other drug use&#xD;
      (breath alcohol and urine toxicology) and for females a pregnancy test. To ensure there are a&#xD;
      sufficient number of subjects, 60 subjects will be screened for study eligibility and&#xD;
      assessed for matching criteria (age, race and sex). Groups (smokers vs. non-smokers) will&#xD;
      include equal numbers of males and females. In addition, male and female smokers will be&#xD;
      matched for tobacco use disorder severity using symptom counts (DSM 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be enrolled in an outpatient protocol completed at the Behavioral&#xD;
      Pharmacology Research Unit (BPRU) at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, and at the&#xD;
      Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) PET imaging Center. Abstinent smokers (as verified by CO and&#xD;
      cotinine, see below) will complete an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a PET scan&#xD;
      with the alpha-7 nAChR radiotracer [18F]-ASEM. Matched historical controls will have&#xD;
      completed the MRI and PET scans previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco users will receive contingency management incentive payments for verified smoking&#xD;
      abstinence (Intervention 2, behavioral counseling). Smokers will continue in the study after&#xD;
      the PET scan and complete an 8-day practice quit attempt. To evaluate smoking abstinence and&#xD;
      lapse behavior, smokers will be asked to complete study six visits with a practice quit&#xD;
      attempt. Smoker will receive the incentive intervention for smoking abstinence. At each&#xD;
      visit, smokers will provide carbon monoxide (CO) and urine samples, and complete assessment&#xD;
      instruments to self-report on daily symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and craving, and number&#xD;
      of cigarettes smoked. The incentive intervention is a validated, established intervention for&#xD;
      smoking cessation. At each visit, smokers will receive escalating incentive payments&#xD;
      contingent upon provision of samples that meet study defined abstinence criteria. The&#xD;
      incentive earning schedule starts at $9 on day 1 of abstinence and increases by $1.50 for&#xD;
      each day of verified abstinence to $19.50 on day 8. To boost the incentive for abstinence,&#xD;
      provision of samples that meet bonus abstinence (cotinine &lt;100 ng/ml day 8) results&#xD;
      additional $10 or $20 bonus payments. The incentive earnings schedule includes allowance for&#xD;
      a slip, and a reset contingency to allow smokers to retry the quit attempt and complete the&#xD;
      study. This incentive earnings schedule with resets is of high magnitude to reinforce&#xD;
      abstinence, and increase participant retainment. The number of days in the quit attempt (8)&#xD;
      yields a sufficient sample to examine both withdrawal and biomarkers (CO and cotinine) to&#xD;
      quantify number of days in which use of any nicotine occurred vs. days participants were&#xD;
      compliant in maintaining abstinence. These data will be utilized to explore the relationship&#xD;
      of alpha7-nAChR availability to these clinically meaningful measures of tobacco use and&#xD;
      abstinence.&#xD;

    <measure>Total withdrawal score on the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report form has a 15-item list of symptoms where subjects rate subjects' symptoms severity on a scale of 0-4. Validated symptoms for tobacco withdrawal in smokers will be used for the study to quantify total withdrawal symptoms at baseline (smoking as usual), when compared to symptoms over Visits 1-6 during the quit period. Maximum score for validated symptoms is 36.</description>

    <measure>Craving/Urge to smoke as determined via the Questionnaire of Subjective Urges (QSU)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QSU is a 10-item questionnaire to measure craving/urges to smoke. For each item, subjects rate how strongly the subject feel &quot;right now&quot; on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Items are summed to yield two factor scores, Factor 1 Intention/desire to smoke (maximum score =35), and Factor 2: Relief of negative affect and Urgent desire to smoke (maximum score=35). QSU is collected at baseline (smoking as usual) and Visits 1-6 during the quit period.</description>

    <measure>Number of days of smoking abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days abstinent will be determined from counting number of CO-and cotinine-verified abstinence days. Abstinence will be defined as negative breath carbon oxide (CO)6ppm or lower AND urinary cotinine decreased by 25 percent from prior sample or &lt;100 ng/ml.</description>

    <measure>Negative mood as determined by the Positive and negative affect scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of two 10-item mood scales to provide independent measures of positive and negative affect. Maximum score for negative affect subscale = 10. Scores for negative affect subscale when smoking as usual, will be compared to days of CO and/or cotinine verified abstinence.</description>

    <measure>Attention as assessed by Connors continuous performance task</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this computerized task, a stimuli are presented, and subjects are instructed to respond as fast as possible to a specific target stimuli (X) and refrain from responding to more rarely occurring non-target stimuli (non-X). Inattention is indicated by high numbers of omissions and long reaction times. Omissions result from the failure to respond to target letters (i.e., non-Xs); omissions and reaction times when smoking as usual will be compared to those on visits 1-6 during the quit attempt abstinence days.</description>
