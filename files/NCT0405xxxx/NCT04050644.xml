      To compare treatment with preservative-free dexamethasone 0.1% (Monofree Dexamethason) and&#xD;
      diclofenac 0.1% (Dicloabak) eye drops versus preserved dexamethasone 0.1% (Maxidex) and&#xD;
      diclofenac 0.1% (Voltaren Ophtha) eye drops after cataract surgery in terms of postoperative&#xD;
      inflammation, iatrogenic dry eye disease and cystoid macular edema.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is a standardized procedure yielding excellent visual outcomes in most&#xD;
      patients. According to Daien et al., the incidence of cataract surgery in 2012 in France was&#xD;
      11/1000 person-years. Although there are few complications related to the surgery, patients&#xD;
      often experience ocular discomfort in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative treatment usually includes topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and&#xD;
      topical steroids for four weeks to control anterior chamber inflammation, to relieve ocular&#xD;
      pain after surgery and to reduce the incidence of cystoid macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is the most common eye drop preservative and is associated with&#xD;
      several ocular adverse effects, including dry eye and ocular surface inflammation. Moreover,&#xD;
      in two clinical trials comparing the effects of BAK-containing and preservative-free eye&#xD;
      drops, anterior chamber inflammation was reported in response to BAK after 1 month of&#xD;
      exposure. Finally, besides the fact that intra-ocular inflammation increases the risk of&#xD;
      macular edema, there is some evidence in the literature suggesting that BAK may also&#xD;
      contribute to the development of macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of these well-established detrimental effects of preservatives, pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry has invested in the development of preservative-free eye drops in the past decade,&#xD;
      which has led to preservative-free alternatives for almost all the eye medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate whether omitting preservatives from the&#xD;
      postoperative topical treatment after cataract surgery can reduce symptoms and signs of&#xD;
      ocular surface disease, intra-ocular inflammation and the incidence of cystoid macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally ocular microbiome research is added to our study because of its known&#xD;
      correlation with the ocular immunity. Although the ocular surface is continuously colonized&#xD;
      by a commensal microbial community, the healthy ocular surface is not in an inflammatory&#xD;
      state. This phenomenon suggests that there is an interplay between the ocular surface&#xD;
      microbiome and innate immune mechanisms, which prevents inflammatory responses against&#xD;
      commensal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      St Leger et al. used a murine model to reveal the presence of a commensal, Corynebacterium&#xD;
      mastitidis, on the ocular surface. Corynebacterium mastitidis elicited an IL-17 response from&#xD;
      ƔΔT-cells, facilitating recruitment of neutrophils to the ocular surface and secretion of&#xD;
      antimicrobial peptides in the tears. These findings suggest the presence of a functional&#xD;
      resident microbiome on the ocular surface which contribute to immune homeostasis and protects&#xD;
      the ocular surface from pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our expert in the area of ocular microbiome research is affiliated with the department of&#xD;
      biochemistry and microbiology of the University of Ghent.&#xD;
