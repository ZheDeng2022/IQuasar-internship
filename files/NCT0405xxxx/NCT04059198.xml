&#xD;
          2. Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within&#xD;
             6 months of enrollment date with no evidence of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
             (HCC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Not on any antiviral medications for at least 6 months. If a subject is hepatitis B e&#xD;
             antigen (HBeAg)-negative, they will be eligible if they have not received antiviral&#xD;
             medications for at least 3 months. Antiviral medications include lamivudine,&#xD;
             telbivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, entecavir, IFN therapies of any type, and all other&#xD;
             medications with potential antiviral activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. HBV DNA &gt;2000 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative subjects and &gt;20,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-positive&#xD;

          7. ALT &lt;5× ULN and ≤200 U/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)&#xD;
             documented within the 24-hour period prior to the first dose of IP. If the urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test is positive, a follow-up serum test is required for confirmation&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study&#xD;
             treatment. Men with female partners who are of childbearing potential must agree that&#xD;
             they or their partners will use a highly effective method of contraception throughout&#xD;
             the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study treatment. Male subjects must not&#xD;
             donate sperm throughout the study and for 3 months after discontinuing study&#xD;

               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are hormonal contraceptives (oral,&#xD;
                  injectable, patch, intrauterine devices), male partner sterilization, or total&#xD;
                  abstinence from heterosexual intercourse, when this is the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the subject. Note: The double-barrier method (eg, synthetic condoms,&#xD;
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), periodic&#xD;
                  abstinence (such as calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation), withdrawal (coitus&#xD;
                  interruptus), lactational amenorrhea method, and spermicide only are not&#xD;
                  acceptable as highly effective methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form (ICF);&#xD;

          3. Evidence of advanced fibrosis as defined by Fibroscan at the Screening Visit of ≥8&#xD;
             kPa. If Fibroscan is not available, subjects with both a Fibrotest ≥0.65 and aspartate&#xD;
             transaminase (AST):platelet ratio index (APRI) ≥1.0 are excluded (subjects will not be&#xD;
             excluded if only 1 of the Fibrotest or APRI results is higher than allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Laboratory parameters not within defined thresholds:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. White blood cells &lt;4000 cells/μL (&lt;4.0×109/L)&#xD;

                  Gilbert's disease can be included if direct bilirubin is within normal limits.&#xD;
                  Subjects with an AFP &gt;50 ng/mL but &lt;500 ng/mL can be included if CT scan or MRI&#xD;
