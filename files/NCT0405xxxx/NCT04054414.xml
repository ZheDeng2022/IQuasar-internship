    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, multicentric, randomized, double blind, parallel, saline controlled&#xD;
      Phase II clinical study to compare the safety and efficacy of PMZ-1620 (INN: Sovateltide)&#xD;
      therapy along with standard supportive care in patients of acute spinal cord injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is projected to be third largest killer in the developing world by 2020, with a large&#xD;
      number of these injuries comprising of traumatic spinal cord injury. People with spinal cord&#xD;
      injuries (SCI) are two to five times more susceptible to die than people without an injury.&#xD;
      More than 80% cases of SCIs occur among young people between the ages of 20 and 45 years and&#xD;
      majority of sufferers are male. In developed countries, the incidence of spinal injuries&#xD;
      varies from 20 to 50 per million. Every year about 250,000 to 500,000 number of SCI cases are&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are hidden stem cells in the brain, which becomes active following injury to the spinal&#xD;
      cord. Intravenous administration of PMZ-1620 (sovateltide) augments the activity of neuronal&#xD;
      progenitor cells in the spinal cord to repair the damage by formation of new mature neurons&#xD;
      and blood vessels. In addition, PMZ-1620 has anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sovateltide is an endothelin B (ETB) receptor agonist (previously used names IRL-1620,&#xD;
      SPI-1620 and PMZ-1620; International Non-proprietary Name (INN) approved by WHO is&#xD;
      sovateltide). Activation of ETB receptors with PMZ-1620 produces neurovascular repair and&#xD;
      remodeling or neuroregeneration.&#xD;

    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Statistically relevant changes in clinical progression of ASCI as measured by ISNCSCI scoring at one, two and three months after treatment. The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) or more commonly referred to as the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS), is a universal classification tool for Spinal Cord Injury based on a standardized sensory and motor assessment. Ranges from A to E where A = Complete and no sensory or motor function is preserved and E = Normal sensory and motor functions</description>

    <measure>Changes in walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Statistically relevant changes in WISCI Score at one, two and three months after treatment. This test assesses the amount of physical assistance needed, as well as devices required, for walking following paralysis that results from SCI. It rank orders the ability of a person to walk 10 meter after a spinal cord injury from most to least severe impairment. A score from 0 to 20 is assigned, level 0: patient is unable to stand and/or participate in walking and level 20 patient ambulates with no devices, with brace and no assistance.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Statistically relevant changes in SCIM score at one, two and three months after treatment. Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) scale is used to measure the disability to specifically address the ability of SCI patients to perform basic activities of daily living independently. The SCIM scores range from 0 to 100 where where a score of 0 defines total dependence and a score of 100 is indicative of complete independence.</description>

    <measure>Changes in MRI/CT</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in MRI/CT, before (baseline) and three months after treatment. Radiological evidence of transaction of spinal cord will be recorded by CT or MRI scan. In addition, edema, contusion, extent of spinal cord damage will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in electromyography (EMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in EMG, before (baseline) and three months after treatment. Changes in nerve conduction parameters are recorded from the peroneal, tibial, and sural nerves. The presence of spontaneous activity (SA), including fibrillation and positive sharp waves are recorded in muscle groups vastus medialis, iliopsoas, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, and lumbar paraspinals. A decrease in nerve conduction parameters are indicative to greater severity. A high degree of abnormal SA on electromyographic testing represents the presence of muscle membrane instability.</description>
