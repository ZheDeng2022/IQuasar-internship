  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-center Phase II clinical trial for patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibodies, such&#xD;
      as sintilimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chidamide and azacitidine may respectively&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking histone deacetylation and DNA methylation enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving chidamide and azacitidine with sintilimab these three drugs&#xD;
      may work better than single drug or combination of two drugs in treating patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the complete response rate (CRR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the correlation between the expression of PD-L1, CD4, CD8, CD68 in tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and the efficacy of combined therapy in relapsed or refractory peripheral&#xD;
      T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
