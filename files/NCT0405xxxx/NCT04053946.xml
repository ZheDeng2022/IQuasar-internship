  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 64-patient, 90-day, open -label study on adult patients undergoing below knee&#xD;
      amputation for various etiologies. The objective of this study is to assess surgical wound&#xD;
      healing and wound bioburden using combination treatment of Next Science SurgX™ Antimicrobial&#xD;
      Wound Gel and BlastX™ Antimicrobial Wound Gels as compared to standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, 90 day, open-label study of patients undergoing below the&#xD;
      knee amputation (BKA) with primary closure or completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present for BKA with primary closure or completion will have had a pre-op&#xD;
      medical evaluation prior to being screened against the protocol's inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. If criteria are met, patients will be presented with the option to participate in&#xD;
      the study and informed consent procedures will be carried out, in compliance with currently&#xD;
      applicable participants' rights and safety regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 64 participants, with up to 70 participants, may be enrolled. A participant&#xD;
      requiring bilateral BKA will be excluded. Eligible subjects will need to complete the study&#xD;
      to meet the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that the study enrollment period will last approximately eighteen months, and&#xD;
      the duration of each participants' participation will be three months. Visits in the&#xD;
      treatment portion of the study will be carried out at day 0, 3, 14, 21, and 28 days with a&#xD;
      scheduling window of 3 days before or after each due date. A phone call follow-up will be&#xD;
      conducted at 60 days post-surgery with a window of 7 days before or 14 days after to inquire&#xD;
      about the incision (appearance of incision or any noted changes since prior study visit), and&#xD;
      overall health of the participant. All participants, regardless of treatment arm, will&#xD;
      complete Visit 6 (90 day follow up) with a scheduling window of 7 days before or 21 days&#xD;
      after. The key parameters of the study include: percentage of surgical wound area reduction,&#xD;
      time patients are deemed ready prosthetic healing, and microorganism type and amounts.&#xD;
      Bacterial identification and quantification will occur at days 0, 14, and 28 for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <description>Following amputation, SurgX™ will be applied directly to the surgical incision in the operating room under sterile conditions and covered with SOC dressing. The surgical dressing will not be removed until post-operative day 3, except if deemed necessary by the treating surgeon. At that time, direct application of the BlastX™ to the incision will be placed, then covered with a SOC dressing. BlastX™ will be applied every day and covered with SOC dressing.</description>
