    <textblock>
      Removal of infected dentin contaminated with bacteria and remaining affected dentin detected&#xD;
      as firm is the conventional strategy for the management of cavitated caries lesions.&#xD;
      Recently, this strategy is termed as selective removal to firm dentin (SRFD) and seems to&#xD;
      increase the potential risk of pulp exposure or loss of pulp vitality for deep caries lesions&#xD;
      radiographically extending ¾ of dentin tissue. Alternatively, selective removal to soft&#xD;
      dentine (SRSD) that refers to removal of caries tissue at the periphery of the cavity to firm&#xD;
      dentin and remaining caries tissue detected as soft or leathery in proximity with the pulp&#xD;
      might be a less invasive excavation method for deep caries lesions to maintain pulpal health.&#xD;
      However, information on clinical advantages or disadvantages of SRSD and SRFD excavation&#xD;
      methods is sparse and mostly rely on studies conducted for primary teeth. Moreover, clinical&#xD;
      trials are needed to demonstrate the combined effect of carious removal strategies and&#xD;
      calcium silicate-based materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is comparison of clinical success rates of SRSD and SRFD techniques in&#xD;
      posterior deep caries lesions. The primary outcome of the study is comparison of clinical&#xD;
      success of SRSD and SRFD techniques by clinical and radiographic examination after 3 months,&#xD;
      6 months, 1 year and 2 years. The secondary outcome of the study is to investigate whether or&#xD;
      not calcium silicate-based materials have an effect on the success rate of the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been growing number of studies questioning conventional caries&#xD;
      tissue removal, especially for deep caries lesions (1). In the concept of conventional caries&#xD;
      tissue removal, 'affected dentin' and 'infected dentine' are widely used terms which have&#xD;
      been defined by Massler (2) in 1960s. According to this concept, removal of infected dentin&#xD;
      contaminated with bacteria and remaining affected dentin detected as firm suggested for the&#xD;
      management of cavitated caries lesions. Recently, this removal technique is termed as&#xD;
      selective removal to firm dentin (SRFD) and seems to increase the potential risk of pulp&#xD;
      exposure or loss of pulp vitality for deep caries lesions radiographically extending ¾ of&#xD;
      dentin tissue (3). In case of pulp exposure, direct pulp capping is the treatment of choice&#xD;
      for a tooth with a vital pulp and without any inflammation predictors such as prolonged&#xD;
      bleeding. However, according to results of a long term (5-10 years) retrospective study&#xD;
      evaluating the treatment outcome of direct pulp capping with calcium hydroxide, 44.5% in the&#xD;
      5-yr group and 79.9% in the 10-yr group had a postoperative root canal treatment or an&#xD;
      extraction (4). Similarly, another restrospective study showed that over the first year after&#xD;
      direct pulp capping with calcium hydroxide , almost 10% and, after 5 years, nearly 20% of the&#xD;
      teeth had an unfavourable treatment outcome (5).According to results of these studies,&#xD;
      survival rate of directly capped pulp tissue with calcium hydroxide seems to decrease over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Biodentine (BD; Septodont, St Maur-des-Fosses, France), which is a calcium&#xD;
      silicate-based material, has gained popularity for pulp capping treatment. The success rate&#xD;
      of Biodentine reported to be 91.7% after 3 years in a recent prospective longitudinal&#xD;
      randomized controlled study of vital permanent teeth with deep caries (6). Except from the&#xD;
      material of choice for pulp capping, some other strategies such as selective removal to soft&#xD;
      dentin (SRSD) has been recently recommended for the management of deep caries lesions with&#xD;
      the aim of reducing the risk of pulp exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accorging to report of International CariesConsensus Collaboration (ICCC) group SRSD is&#xD;
      strongly recommended in deep cavitated lesions extending into ¾ of dentin tissue. Soft&#xD;
      carious tissue is left over the pulp to avoid pulpal exposure and peripheral enamel and&#xD;
      dentine are prepared to hard dentine, to provide hermetic sealing and durability of the&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, there are very few studies concerned with the clinical success of SRSD,&#xD;
      incomplete caries removal (ICR) or partial caries removal (PCR). In a long term (10 years)&#xD;
      prospective cinical study, the success rates of PCR technique has been reported as, 90% after&#xD;
      3 years, 82% after 5 years and %63 after 10 years (7). In another clinical study comparing&#xD;
      24-month pulp health outcomes of PCR and total caries removal (TCR) in primary molars, no&#xD;
      significant diffrence between the two removal techninues and reduced risk for pulp exposure&#xD;
      with PCR technique has been reported (8). In a recently published review, it has been&#xD;
      reported that SRSD seems to be the best option for the treatment of deep caries lesions and&#xD;
      the remaining caries tissue close to the pulp seems not to interfere the longevity of the&#xD;
      restorations (9).Nevertheless, not much scientific evidence on clinical success of SRSD and&#xD;
      SRFD excavation methods for deep carious lesions in permanent teeth could be found in the&#xD;
      currently available literature. Moreover, clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the&#xD;
      combined effect of carious removal strategies and calcium silicate-based materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is comparison of clinical success rates of SRSD and SRFD techniques in&#xD;
      posterior deep caries lesions of permanent teeth. This study will be carried out as a&#xD;
      prospective randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial, with 2 parallel groups. Potential&#xD;
      patients attending to Istanbul Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul with deep&#xD;
      posterior caries lesions will be invited to the study. The patients meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be recruited and randomized into SRSD group and SRFD group by block&#xD;
      randomization of 2.1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving their consent to take part in the study, defined clinical procedure for each&#xD;
      group will be performed. In SRFD group (Goup B), after caries removal to firm dentin calcium&#xD;
      silicate based material (Biodentine) will be applied. If the excavations led to pulp&#xD;
      exposure, pulp-capping with calcium silicate based material will be performed and this&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to another group (Group PC).The patients in SRSD group will be&#xD;
      randomized into two subgroups as Group A and Group C. In group A after caries removal to soft&#xD;
      dentin calcium silicate based material (Biodentine) will be applied. In group C after caries&#xD;
      removal universal adhesive material will be applied without calcium silicate based material&#xD;
      placement. All the restorations will be performed by the same operator using the same&#xD;
      universal adhesive and resin composite material. The observers (two independent observer) and&#xD;
      the patients will be blinded for the actual intervention performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is comparison of clinical success of SRSD and SRFD&#xD;
      techniques by clinical and radiographic examination after 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2&#xD;
      years. The secondary outcome of the study is to investigate whether or not calcium&#xD;
      silicate-based materials have an effect on the success rate of the treatment. Statistical&#xD;
      comparisons will be performed between Group A and Group B for the primary outcome and between&#xD;
      Group A and Group C for the secondary outcome.&#xD;
