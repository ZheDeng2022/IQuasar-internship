  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label pilot study seeks to investigate the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in&#xD;
      persons with chronic anorexia nervosa (AN). Psilocybin has previously been demonstrated to&#xD;
      decrease depression and anxiety and increase long-term positive behavior change in other&#xD;
      populations. The investigators seek to determine whether similar changes can be safely&#xD;
      produced in people with AN when psilocybin is administered in a supportive setting with close&#xD;
      follow-up. The investigators' primary hypotheses are that psilocybin is safe to administer in&#xD;
      people with AN, that it will reduce measures of anxiety and depression, and that it will lead&#xD;
      to increased quality of life. The investigators will also assess a number of exploratory&#xD;
      measures related to eating disorder pathophysiology.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week post final psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-report questionnaire that assesses both anxiety (7 questions) and depression (7 questions). Each question is scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0-3, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health related quality of life as assessed by the Eating Disorder Quality of Life Scale (EDQLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months post final psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 40-item self-report measure of health related quality of life that is specifically developed for eating disorder populations. Each question is rated on a 5 point scale from 1-5, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post final psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 28-item self-report score that measures severity of eating disorder symptoms across four domains that each make up a sub-scale: dietary restraint, eating concern, weight concern, and shape concern. A global score is calculated by averaging sub-scale scores. Sub-scale and global scores range from 0-6 with higher scores indicating higher severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post final psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>This is clinician-administered interview that measures severity of eating disorder symptoms across four domains that each make up a sub-scale: dietary restraint, eating concern, weight concern, and shape concern. A global score is calculated by averaging sub-scale scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post final psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of body mass calculated from height and weight (Kg/m^2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anorexia Nervosa Stages of Change Questionnaire (ANSOCQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post final psilocybin session</time_frame>
    <description>The ANSOCQ is a 20-item self-administered questionnaire that places respondents in one of the five stages of change based on Prochaska and DiClemente's model. The maximum raw score is 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of motivation. An overall classification of the stage of change is obtained by dividing the raw score by 5.</description>
