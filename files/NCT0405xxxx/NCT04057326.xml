  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a randomized, double-blind, placebo involved and multi-center clinical&#xD;
      trial. All subjects are assigned to 2 groups, including Oryz-Aspergillus Enzyme and&#xD;
      Pancreatin tablet group (treatment group) and the placebo group (control group). Treatment&#xD;
      group includes 99 subjects, while control group includes 33 subjects. They receive&#xD;
      investigational drug 2 tablets/times, tid, p.o. for 180 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  A total of 132 subjects with cirrhosis were divided into 3 subgroups by Child-Pugh&#xD;
           score, which were Child-pugh Class A, B, and C, respectively. Each subgroup includes 44&#xD;
           subjects, which were randomly assigned to the Oryz-Aspergillus Enzyme and Pancreatin&#xD;
           tablet group (treatment group) and the placebo group (control group) in a ratio of 3: 1&#xD;
           (33: 11).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have signed the Informed Consent Form and are eligible for the entry&#xD;
           criteria will be randomly assigned to either the Oryz-Aspergillus Enzyme and Pancreatin&#xD;
           tablet group or the placebo group. No matter which group the subjects is assigned,&#xD;
           he/she would receive treatment drugs through oral administration for 180 days, during&#xD;
           which the participant will not take any investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The differences in nutritional status between treatment group and control group will be&#xD;
           compared in 90 and 180 days by MAMC and SGA.&#xD;

    <measure>1. Change in nutritional status by Mid-Arm Muscle Circumference (MAMC) evaluation, the unit of MAMC is centimeter(cm).</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The change in nutritional status of subjects at 180 days was evaluated by MAMC. MAMC, as a marker of lean muscle mass, is calculated using the standard formula: MAMC = MAC-(3.14 x TSF thickness).&#xD;
MAC: mid-arm circumference TSF : triceps skinfold thickness</description>

    <measure>2. Change in nutritional status by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) evaluation.</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The change in nutritional status of subjects at 180 days was evaluated by SGA Form.&#xD;
The nutritional status of the subjects was improved if any of the index reached the &quot;effective&quot; standard.</description>
