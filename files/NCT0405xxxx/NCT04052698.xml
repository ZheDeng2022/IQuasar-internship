    <measure>Total annualized bleeding rate (TABR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total annualized bleeding rate (TABR) will be calculated as the total number of spontaneous bleeds, traumatic bleeds, menstrual bleeds of majority severity, and other bleeds occuring in the time period between the first dose of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) and the Study Completion Visit, divided by the duration (in years) between the first dose of IMP and the Study Completion Visit. Surgery periods, and BEs occuring within these surgery periods, will be excluded from the calculation of TABR. Similar calculation rules will be applied for the computation of the TABR during the previously documented on-demand treatment regimen.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of Wilate by monitoring the number and type of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) throughout the study. An AE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient (any unfavorable and unintended sign or symptom), and a SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, life-threatening event, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or suspected transmissions of an infectious agent ('important medical events').</description>

    <description>Efficacy of Wilate in the treatment of breakthrough BEs based on the proportion of BEs successfully treated with Wilate. Treatment efficacy will be assessed at the end of a BE by the patient using predefined criteria of 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Moderate' or 'None'. All effectiveness ratings assessed as either &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; will be considered &quot;successfully treated&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of Wilate in surgical prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy of Wilate in surgical prophylaxis based on the proportion of surgeries successfully treated with Wilate. Efficacy will be assessed by the surgeon at the end of surgery and by the hematologist at the end of the postoperative period using predefined criteria of 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Moderate' or 'None'. In addition, an overall assessment using the 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Moderate' or 'None' scale taking both the intra- and postoperative assessments into account will be made at the end of the postoperative period by the investigator based on an algorithm.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL assessment based on the results from the PROMIS-29 survey to monitor and evaluate the physical, mental, and social health in all patients, using a scale of a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 10. The survey covers seven domains from the most relevant areas of self-reported health (depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance and ability to participate in social roles and activities) for the majority of people with chronic illness.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using a 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36vs)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL assessment based on the results from the SF-36v2 questionnaire to measure functional health and well-being in patients ≥16 years. SF-36v2 ranks 8 different domains using a scale standardized with a scoring algorithm to obtain a score ranging from 0 to 100. The eight health domains include physical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health problems (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE) and general mental health (MH). Higher scores indicate better health status, and a mean score of 50 has been articulated as a normative value for all scales.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using a 10-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL assessment based on the results from a SF-10 parent-completed questionnaire for patients ≥6 and &lt;16 years of age, in order to score physical and psychosocial health. SF-10 uses norm-based scoring where scales have a standardized mean value of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <measure>Joint health status assessed using Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 6 consecutive months preceding either the baseline visit of the study completion visit</time_frame>
    <description>Joint health status will be assessed using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), which has been specifically validated for the assessment of the clinical outcome in VWD. HJHS evaluates six index joints to produce a score between 0-124. Higher scores indicate worse joint health.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual bleeding assessed using Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding information from each menstrual period while in this study will be collected using the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC). The PBAC will be provided to all female patients of child-bearing potential. The data documented in the PBAC and the investigator-calculated final score will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). The PBAC score is from 0 onwards, with a score of &gt;100 defining abnormal coagulation and heavy menstrual bleeding (&gt;80ml of blood loss per menstrual cycle).</description>

    <description>Produced from the plasma of human donors, Wilate is presented as a powder or solvent for intravenous injection containing normally 500 IU or 1000 IU human VWF and human FVIII per vial. The ratio between VWF ristocetin co-factor activity (VWF:RCo) and FVIII:C is 1:1. The product contains approximately 100 IU/ml human VWF when reconstituted with 5ml/10mL water for injection with 0.1% polysorbate 80.&#xD;
The specific activity of Wilate is ≥67 IU VWF:RCo/mg protein. The injection or infusion rate should not exceed 2-3mL per minute.</description>
