      This study will evaluate whether earlier intervention with vitamin D in stage II/III chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease will prevent or delay secondary hyperparathyroidism. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      vitamin D or placebo at study entry and will be followed for a period of one year. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that subjects given vitamin D will have lower PTH and higher 25(OH)D after 1&#xD;
      year compared to placebo. Additionally, there will be less subjects who progress into&#xD;
      secondary hyperparathyroidism in the vitamin D treated group compared to the placebo treated&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is important to maintain normal calcium homeostasis and optimal bone health (1, 2).&#xD;
      The synthesis of vitamin D and its metabolism to 1,25(OH)2D is regulated by parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (PTH), serum calcium, and phosphorus levels. In response to low serum calcium level,&#xD;
      serum PTH activates alpha-1-hydroxylase for increased 1,25(OH)2D production in the kidney and&#xD;
      also enhances tubular reabsorption of calcium (3). The higher levels of 1, 25(OH)2D results&#xD;
      in increased intestinal calcium absorption (4). Increased serum phosphorus levels which&#xD;
      occurs in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) results in inhibition of the&#xD;
      1-alpha-hydroxylase, which results in decreased 1, 25(OH)2 D production, decreased intestinal&#xD;
      calcium absorption leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism with increased PTH levels.&#xD;
      Circulating 1,25(OH)2D levels begin to fall when the glomerular filtration rate is less than&#xD;
      40 mL/min occasionally even less than 80 mL/min (11) and almost always significantly reduced&#xD;
      in subjects with end-stage renal failure (12). Furthermore, in CKD, decreased renal mass also&#xD;
      results in decreased expression of 1-alpha-hydroxlase and less production of 1,25(OH)2D which&#xD;
      also exacerbates secondary hyperparathyroidism (5-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in CKD there are three processes that lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. 1)&#xD;
      decreased renal mass leading to decreased production of 1,25(OH)2D leading to a compensatory&#xD;
      rise in PTH to further enhance production of 1,25(OH)2D 2) inhibition of the renal&#xD;
      1-alpha-hydroxylase by accumulating phosphorus levels leading to decreased 1,25(OH)2D which&#xD;
      also leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism. 3) increased phosphorus leads to lower ionized&#xD;
      calcium leading to increased parathyroid hormone secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Untreated secondary hyperparathyroidism can lead to renal osteodystrophy (9) and increased&#xD;
      mortality due to cardiovascular disease (10). Prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism can&#xD;
      lead to bone resorption and eventually autonomous parathyroid hormone secretion termed&#xD;
      tertiary hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D status is one of the major factors that may prevent progression of secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD. Insufficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D further&#xD;
      exacerbate secondary hyperparathyroidism by not providing adequate substrate for the renal&#xD;
      1-alpha-hydroxylase for conversion to the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D. A recent&#xD;
      cross-sectional study on patients with moderate to severe CKD not yet on dialysis therapy&#xD;
      from 12 geographically diverse regions of the United States has shown that only 29% and 17%&#xD;
      of them had sufficient level, respectively (13). Vitamin D status is easily corrected. In our&#xD;
      previous study we concluded that weekly cholecalciferol supplementation was an effective&#xD;
      treatment to correct vitamin D status in patients with CKD stages III and IV (14). However,&#xD;
      PTH levels did not return to normal. Therefore, it is likely that earlier intervention with&#xD;
      vitamin D is necessary to prevent rather than to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism. This is&#xD;
      the major question that is being evaluated in this study. Can intervening with vitamin D at&#xD;
      an earlier stage of chronic kidney disease result in decreased incidence of secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism?&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Overall Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess that if improving and maintaining an optimal&#xD;
      25(OH) D level ( by National Kidney Foundation should be greater than 30ng/ml) (15) in people&#xD;
      with stage II/III Chronic Kidney disease would delay the progression of secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism and translate into improved markers of bone turnover&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: 1) To determine in a double blind, randomized study whether supplementation with&#xD;
      50,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) given weekly for 12 weeks followed by maintenance&#xD;
      cholecalciferol 50,000 IU every other week would improve and maintain vitamin D status in CKD&#xD;
      patients stage 2/3 compared to placebo at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) To determine whether early intervention with vitamin D therapy further decreases PTH&#xD;
      levels after 12 weeks of therapy and 12 months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: 1) To determine whether early treatment with vitamin D results in improving levels&#xD;
      of bone turnover markers- tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b(TRAP5b), procollagen&#xD;
      Type 1 N-Terminal propeptide (PINP), serum C-Telopeptide and Alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
