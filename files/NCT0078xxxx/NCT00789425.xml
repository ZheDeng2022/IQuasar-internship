      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the intake of a daily dosage of&#xD;
      standardized olive extract provides any protection against bone loss.&#xD;

      Apart from estrogen deficiency, the early postmenopausal period is also characterised by an&#xD;
      increasing inflammatory and oxidant status, which further contributes to the development of&#xD;
      osteoporosis/osteopenia. The link between systemic inflammation and osteoporosis has only&#xD;
      been established recently as it was found that higher circulating hsCRP levels are associated&#xD;
      with lower bone mineral density in both healthy pre- and postmenopausal women. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it was already known for a long time that one of the most important cytokines implicated in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of various metabolic bone diseases, including postmenopausal osteoporosis,&#xD;
      is interleukin (IL)-6, which is produced by osteoblasts, monocytes and T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olive oil is the principle fat source of the traditional Mediterranean diet, a diet that has&#xD;
      been associated with a low incidence of some diseases, including coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      osteoporosis. In addition to the main ingredient (ie. oleic acid) extra virgin olive oil also&#xD;
      contains phenolic compounds, such as oleuropein- and ligstroside-aglycones and their&#xD;
      derivatives. They are formed in olives by enzymatic removal of glucose from the polar parent&#xD;
      compound oleuropein-glycoside. A Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil supplies 10 - 20 mg of&#xD;
      phenols per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main metabolic attribute of oleuropein is that it exerts both antioxidant and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activity by lowering the levels of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1,&#xD;
      IL-6 or TNF-alpha. By inhibiting osteoclast activity, this may result in lowering the rate of&#xD;
      bone resorption and, at least in part, protect against osteoporosis development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulated as a capsule it is expected that the compliance and tolerability will be improved&#xD;
      compared to the liquid administration. The present study is designed to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of 250 mg of a standardized extract of olive polyphenols per day on bone loss in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with decreased bone mass (osteopenia) .&#xD;
