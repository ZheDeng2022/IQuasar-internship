      Central line associated bloodstream infection (CL-ABI) is an important and preventable cause&#xD;
      of nosocomial infections and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 5 to 26% of patients experience an infectious complication from their central&#xD;
      venous catheter [1]. In the United States, it is estimated that nearly 50,000 patients&#xD;
      develop central line associated bloodstream infections in the ICUs annually, at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 5 infections per 1000 catheter days [2] and as many as 15,000 deaths annually.&#xD;
      Central line associated bloodstream infections are also associated with increased hospital&#xD;
      and ICU lengths of stay in the ICU (2). Estimates of the cost of CL-ABI to hospitals range&#xD;
      from $25,000 to $65,000 per patient [3, 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centers for Disease Control have published guidelines for the prevention of CL-ABI that&#xD;
      represent a collaborative effort by a multidisciplinary coalition of professional&#xD;
      organizations that provide evidence based recommendations to prevent catheter related&#xD;
      infections [5]. The interventions emphasize five distinct practices, including: education and&#xD;
      training of healthcare providers who place and care for catheters, utilizing maximum sterile&#xD;
      barrier precautions during catheter placement, skin preparation using 2% chlorhexidine,&#xD;
      avoiding routine replacement of central lines as a strategy to reduce infection, and using&#xD;
      antiseptic or antibiotic coated lines in the event that infection rates remain high despite&#xD;
      adherence to the above measures [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated impressive reductions in CL-ABI from the application of&#xD;
      these strategies, ranging from 18 to 100% reductions and realizing significant reductions in&#xD;
      mortality and cost [2]. The simple introduction of maximum sterile barrier precautions to&#xD;
      insert central lines has been observed to dramatically reduce infection rates for over a&#xD;
      decade [6]. However, the CDC's guidelines, despite their seeming simplicity, have been found&#xD;
      to be frequently insufficiently applied, whether by ignorance or omission [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past 12 months there have been a total 24 documented central venous line (CVL)&#xD;
      infections at SLRHC with cumulative rate of infection of 3.8 per 1000 central line days.&#xD;
      These infection rate figures are above the benchmark experience. For SLRHC the cost incurred&#xD;
      over the past 12 months is estimated to be $1,080,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training and education of healthcare personnel and the utilization of maximum sterile&#xD;
      precautions are two important areas. Residents still most frequently learn central line&#xD;
      placement techniques by the &quot;see one, do one, teach one&quot; method, which by its very definition&#xD;
      allows for a multitude of techniques in practice. While this teaching theoretically includes&#xD;
      the utilization of maximal sterile precautions for central line placement, the focus of&#xD;
      teaching, and of residents' anxieties, is most often focused on the proper placement of the&#xD;
      line, not the sterile technique used to place it. Guzzo et al found that mentors of trainees&#xD;
      performing CVC placements in both emergent and non-emergent situations were significantly&#xD;
      less likely to consistently utilize maximum sterile precautions [8]. Furthermore, in a study&#xD;
      of a video-based training on sterile technique in CVC insertion in a trauma resuscitation&#xD;
      unit that evaluated only non-emergent CVC placements, a total of 5 cases of central-&#xD;
      catheter- related bacteremia were reported on just 68 patients, and even with video based&#xD;
      training, 26% of residents continued to have infractions in their compliance with sterile&#xD;
      precautions [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical simulators allow residents to practice skills in a realistic and interactive&#xD;
      environment that minimizes risk to patients. Studies have found simulation to be an effective&#xD;
      means for teaching skills as diverse as ACLS and airway management to laparoscopic surgical&#xD;
      skills [10,11,12]. Additionally, the use of audio-visual equipment in a medical simulator to&#xD;
      record a resident's performance gives valuable firsthand feedback that is otherwise not&#xD;
      available, as it allows residents to visualize their own missteps [13]. This is hypothesized&#xD;
      to be of particular value in the proper acquisition of physical skills such as maximum&#xD;
      sterile precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, the Department of Surgery has recently approved a training policy in&#xD;
      aseptic technique during central venous access placement (see attached copy). All GS&#xD;
      residents will be trained in MBP techniques in the Sim Lab. Training will include baseline&#xD;
      assessment of residents skills in maintaining maximum sterile precautions using a&#xD;
      standardized scoring tool, videotape training, short exam, and individual simulated&#xD;
      debriefing on performance of correct MBP with follow up assessment and training as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to collect data prospectively on all GS residents who will undergo evaluation and&#xD;
      training in maximum barrier precaution during CVC placement. Data will be reviewed and&#xD;
      analyzed for future research publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      C METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Surgery (GS) residents will be undergoing evaluation and training in MBP according to&#xD;
      their department training policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. All GS residents undergoing evaluation and training in MBP during CVC placement as per&#xD;
      department policy are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. All data collected for the purpose of Education and Quality Improvement on all GS&#xD;
      residents, who are undergoing evaluation and training (as per standard department policy) in&#xD;
      MBP during CVC placement will be reviewed and analyzed after being deidentified for the&#xD;
      purpose of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Waiver of Subject informed consent and HIPPA authorization is requested as this is a&#xD;
      minimal risk study and the data and thus conclusions would be greatly improved by using the&#xD;
      data from all subjects. There could be a selection bias if we only used the data from the&#xD;
      residents who felt they had done a good job. Other criteria needed to waiver of subject&#xD;
      informed consent and HIPPA authorization are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Minimal risk study: This is an observational, non-interventional study. The research&#xD;
           part of the study is the prospective data collection for the purpose of analysis of the&#xD;
           aggregate data and possible publication. Training of residents in MBP as per described&#xD;
           protocol is set according to approved hospital policy for the purpose of quality&#xD;
           improvement. The only risk to the subject is the potential loss of confidentiality, and&#xD;
           the investigators will minimize that risk by deidentifying the data as described below&#xD;
           in section III (Confidentiality) and all research data will be deleted once the six&#xD;
           month follow-up has been completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is no reason to believe that waiving the informed consent will affect the rights&#xD;
           and welfare of the subjects enrolled since these subjects will not be identified by name&#xD;
           or any form of identity. Also, all subjects will be informed that final project results&#xD;
           that include all subjects will be reviewed as a group and no personal identifications&#xD;
           will be included in the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This research may not be carried out without the waiver as the results and thus&#xD;
           conclusions would be greatly improved by using the data from all subjects. There could&#xD;
           be a selection bias if we only used the results from the residents who felt they had&#xD;
           done a good job&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This research may benefit the subjects directly by understanding the limitations of&#xD;
           previous training (or lack of) in MBP if any noted after analyzing the results, and is&#xD;
           likely to yield generalizable knowledge that would be of benefit for subjects with&#xD;
           similar conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. This area of research is directly related to the condition of any potential subjects who&#xD;
           might not be able to give consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Whenever appropriate the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information&#xD;
           after participation as it has been stated in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Protections will be taken to protect the confidentiality of subjects as outlined below&#xD;
           in the Confidentiality section D. Information sheet will be provided to all residents&#xD;
           participating in this project explaining the purpose of this project, confidentiality&#xD;
           protection when data is potentially reported, and E. GS residents may have repeated&#xD;
           performance (3-6 months) in MBP technique for central line placement individually at the&#xD;
           discretion of their residency program director. If so, data collected will be analyzed&#xD;
           and reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aggregate data will be kept secured as part of the research database and will be password&#xD;
      protected. No supervisor will have access to this aggregate data and he / she will not be&#xD;
      able to compare any individual resident's performance to the rest of the group in the&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sessions in the sim lab are videotaped automatically. All videotapes sessions titles are&#xD;
      not identified by name but coded (i.e sim session medical code session 6 June 08). All&#xD;
      videotapes are reviewed periodically and deleted except for few that are kept for educational&#xD;
      purpose. These videotapes are identified by subject study number and phase only (i.e. CVLN 01&#xD;
      phase 1). In this project, videotaping of all subjects performances is for the purpose of&#xD;
      training, and quality improvement. The research part of this project involves review of the&#xD;
      data collected by the instructor on the assessment tool and is unrelated to videotaping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Data Analysis The overall performance score of MBP technique, including the overall&#xD;
      maximum and the seven components will be analyzed. The effects of simulation based training&#xD;
      on performance, realized in performance score improvement over baseline, will be evaluated&#xD;
      using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant&#xD;
