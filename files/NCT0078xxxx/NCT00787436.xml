  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of cirrhosis has a symptomatic and asymptomatic stage. The symptoms&#xD;
      include the development of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding. The&#xD;
      development of portal hypertension represents a critical transition point in the natural&#xD;
      history of cirrhosis, contributing to, or directly responsible for all of these events. It is&#xD;
      defined by an increase in intrahepatic vascular resistance to portal venous inflow, with the&#xD;
      subsequent development of collateral vessels, such as esophageal or gastric varices. As&#xD;
      portal pressures rise over time, however, the resulting increase in variceal size and wall&#xD;
      tension translates into an increasing likelihood of rupture and bleeding, leading to death in&#xD;
      about 30% of patients. Over the last twenty years, data have emerged regarding the role of&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNFÎ±) in portal hypertension from animal models as well as in vitro&#xD;
      experiments. Portal hypertension is a condition characterized by vasodilatation and a&#xD;
      hyperdynamic circulation, driven by relative overproduction of nitric oxide23. In animal&#xD;
      trials using inhibitors of TNF it has been shown to decrease the development of the&#xD;
      hyperdynamic circulatory state and portal pressure.24-25 Based on these data, investigators&#xD;
      have examined the role of TNF inhibition with thalidomide. Significant improvement in&#xD;
      blocking the development of the hyperdynamic circulation and portal pressures was&#xD;
      demonstrated.26 Human trials have also show the efficacy of thalidomide in reducing portal&#xD;
      pressures. In that these trials have shown promising results further investigation is&#xD;

      Treatment duration with thalidomide will be for 16 weeks, beginning in the hospital setting&#xD;
      immediately after the index bleed, and clinical follow-up additional six months. Follow-up in&#xD;
      both the hepatology, outpatient clinic area and the endoscopy suite will occur. Step wise&#xD;
      thalidomide dosing will be 100 mg/d once a day at night. If no evidence of toxicity is noted&#xD;
      after 5 doses, the dose will be increased to 200 mg/d, and continued on that dose as an&#xD;
      outpatient until completion of the study protocol at 16 weeks. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      daily while inpatients, and subsequently at two-week intervals upon discharge. Females of&#xD;
      child-bearing potential will be seen weekly for the first month and must have a confirmed&#xD;
      negative pregnancy test prior to being dispensed the next one week supply of study drug.&#xD;
      After the first month, females of child-bearing potential will be seen every two weeks as&#xD;
      will all other subjects. Standard follow-up medical care after esophageal variceal bleeding&#xD;
      in patients who have undergone endoscopic therapy will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      follow-up endoscopy at regular intervals until variceal obliteration, using either endoscopic&#xD;
      variceal ligation (EVL) or sclerotherapy titrated dose of a nonselective beta blocker&#xD;
      (propranolol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit, patients will be assessed for development of any interim outcome of&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients will initially be followed daily while hospitalized. outpatient visits will occur&#xD;
      every two-week intervals upon discharge. Standard follow-up medical care after esophageal&#xD;
      variceal bleeding in patients who have undergone endoscopic therapy will include:&#xD;

      for TIPS, liver transplantation or death. In addition, patients and their families will be&#xD;
      questioned for any evidence of potential toxicity as assessed by using the CTC Toxicity grade&#xD;
      version 3, or adverse outcomes by one of the study investigators as well as a nurse&#xD;
      coordinator, using a standardized questionnaire along with a regular clinical&#xD;
