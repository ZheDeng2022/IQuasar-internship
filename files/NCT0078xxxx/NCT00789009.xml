  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate HIV infection and associated conditions by monitoring infected&#xD;
      patients. The study will also serve as a means for recruiting HIV-infected individuals to&#xD;
      NIAIDs ongoing clinical and laboratory studies and supporting the institute s infectious&#xD;
      disease training program by providing Infectious Disease fellows with ongoing training in the&#xD;
      management of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with suspected or confirmed HIV infection who live in the&#xD;
      Washington, D.C., metropolitan area may be eligible for this study. Physician referral is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center a minimum of once every 3 to 4 months for&#xD;
      evaluation with a physical examination; blood tests for research purposes, safety, immune&#xD;
      status and viral load; and response to any treatment they may be receiving. Other procedures,&#xD;
      such as a biopsy, are done only as needed for standard medical practice, and informed consent&#xD;
      is obtained before any such procedure is done. Treatment offered is consistent with standard&#xD;
      medical practice; no experimental treatments are offered under this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective natural history study with ongoing monitoring of HIV&#xD;
      infection and HIV-related disease processes. The overall protocol Objective is to determine&#xD;
      the long-term clinical outcome of treated HIV infection and investigate aspects of the host&#xD;
      immune response that may predict outcomes. Minimal studies scheduled for each visit include:&#xD;
      monitoring of immune status and viral load, routine safety laboratory tests, and collection&#xD;
      of blood for research and storage. Medical treatment of HIV infection will be provided in&#xD;
      accordance with standard medical practice. Specific HIV treatment regimens will be in&#xD;
      accordance with standard medical practice and not constitute research.&#xD;

        The first subgroup will consist of patients recruited from the Washington DC metropolitan&#xD;
        area who will receive long-term care for their HIV infection through the NIAID/CCMD HIV&#xD;
        clinic. The second subgroup will consist of patients with known or suspected HIV infection&#xD;

        diagnose or exclude HIV disease, assistance with the diagnosis or management of acute&#xD;
        HIV-related problems. This latter subgroup of patients will be followed on a short-term (12&#xD;
        months or less). Following discharge from the protocol, Group II patients will be returned&#xD;
        to the care of their referring physicians.&#xD;

        the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-infection as documented by positive HIV ELISA and Western Blot or positive assay&#xD;
             for HIV RNA (serum or plasma). Patients may also be included if they have laboratory&#xD;
             or clinical evidence suggestive of possible HIV-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 years or older.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Group I patients are required to have a primary care provider outside NIH to manage&#xD;
             non-HIV medical problems. Group II patients must have a referring physician or clinic&#xD;
             that will continue to manage HIV and non-HIV medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
