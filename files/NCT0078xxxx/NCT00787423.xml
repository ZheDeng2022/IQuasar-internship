  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in developing more accurate methods to assess environmental&#xD;
      influences on psychological stress and drug use. One key to a more accurate assessment of&#xD;
      environmental influences is minimizing the delay between exposure and reporting. Portable&#xD;
      devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and global positioning system (GPS) units&#xD;
      may be able to provide a more real-time image of these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the use of PDAs to measure stress and drug use, and GPS units to assess the&#xD;
      effects of neighborhood environment in an outpatient treatment population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals from 18 to 75 years of age who are current heroin users seeking treatment&#xD;
           for addiction and who spend most of their time in Baltimore city.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to visit the research and treatment center at least three&#xD;
           times per week for regular tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be in the study for approximately 28 weeks (7 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A series of three laboratory session examining responsiveness to standardized stressors&#xD;
           will occur both early in treatment and will be repeated late in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will undergo 18 weeks of daily methadone maintenance. Urine samples will be&#xD;
           collected three times weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To track drug use, stress, and geographical location (a measure of environmental risk),&#xD;
           each participant will carry a PDA and a GPS unit for 16 of the 18 weeks. Participants&#xD;
           will make entries (1) each time that they use a drug and (2) each time they feel&#xD;
           overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed more than usual. Participants will also make three&#xD;
           random-signal-triggered recordings per day and one brief (end of day) recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective self-report questionnaires on drug use and stress will be given regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 18 weeks of methadone maintenance, participants will discontinue carrying the PDA&#xD;
           and GPS unit and will have the choice of transferring to a community clinic or&#xD;
           undergoing a 10-week taper from methadone at the research clinic. Participants who stay&#xD;
           for the taper will continue to provide urine samples, but only once a week.&#xD;

      Background. This protocol arose in response to NIH s Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI).&#xD;
      There is no genetic component to this protocol (update: no genetics initially but added by&#xD;
      amendment in February 2013); rather, the goal is to develop field-deployable measures of&#xD;
      environmental influences (stressors, drug exposure, etc.) that can ultimately be used in&#xD;
      studies of gene-environment interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To use smartphones as electronic diaries (EDs) and passive data collection tools&#xD;
      to measure geographical location, physical activity, social interactions, stress and drug&#xD;
      use; Global Positioning System (GPS) units to assess geographical location; biological&#xD;
      samples for genetic testing; Daysimeters and Dimesimeters to assess circadian rhythm;&#xD;
      AutoSense and Health Tag to collect ambulatory physiological and activity data in real time;&#xD;
      social media language to assess content associated with stress and drug use; and to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of mobile HIV/STD Risk Reduction (HIVRR) or&#xD;
      stress-reduction intervention with feedback from Health Tag delivered via ED in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. Opioid-dependent outpatient adults (up to 500 enrolled; up to 400&#xD;
      completers). Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60% minorities (mostly&#xD;
      African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design. A natural-history study of stress (both personal and environmental) and&#xD;
      drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. Participants will undergo 22 weeks of Office-based Opiate Treatment (OBOT) at&#xD;
      Archway clinic or methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (henceforth buprenorphine ) maintenance&#xD;
      elsewhere, and will be offered at least 8 weeks of methadone or buprenorphine taper (weeks&#xD;
      23-30). OBOT buprenorphine will be administered twice weekly in the clinic, with additional&#xD;
      doses given to take at home. Social media language will be collected at baseline and weekly&#xD;
      during the study. To track drug use, stress, physical activity, social interactions, and&#xD;
      geographical location (a measure of environmental risk), each participant will carry an ED&#xD;
      and a GPS unit or wireless smartphone for up to 16 weeks. Event-triggered entries will be&#xD;
      initiated by participants (1) each time that they use a drug and (2) each time they feel&#xD;
      overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed more than usual. Participants will also make 3&#xD;
      random-signal-triggered recordings per day and one brief end of day recording. We will&#xD;
      compare these ecological momentary assessment (EMA) results with more traditional assessments&#xD;
      of drug use and stress: (1) urine will be collected two or three times weekly during weeks&#xD;
      1-22 and once weekly during the optional methadone or buprenorphine taper (weeks 23-30), (2)&#xD;
      retrospective self-report questionnaires on drug use and stress will be given regularly, and&#xD;
      (3) laboratory session examining responsiveness to a standardized stressor will occur during&#xD;
      the 4th -6th week. Blood draws and anthropometric measurements to assess allostatic load (a&#xD;
      physiological marker of long-term cumulative stress) and blood samples will be obtained for&#xD;
      genetic analysis during the 2nd -4th week. After week 12, we will also assess the impact of&#xD;
      opioid agonist treatment on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which is involved&#xD;
      in modulating stress. After 18 weeks of opioid agonist maintenance, participants will begin&#xD;
      an additional 4 weeks of maintenance, during which they will not carry the wireless&#xD;
      smartphone or ED and GPS unit unless they are participating in a secondary study that&#xD;
      includes those measures. At the end of 22 weeks, participants will have the choice of&#xD;
      transferring to a community clinic or undergoing an eight-week taper at the Archway clinic.&#xD;
      Individuals receiving treatment in other programs may participate in the treatment elsewhere&#xD;
      arm of the study. In this arm, ED and GPS data will be collected for 8 weeks; urine drug&#xD;
      screens will be collected three times weekly. Secondary studies: Up to 70 participants will&#xD;
      be asked to wear the Daysimeter and an Actigraph activitymonitor wristwatch for 18 days (two&#xD;
      72-hour intervals repeated three times) and the Dimesimeter daily (24 hours/day) for 16 weeks&#xD;
      (completed September 2015). Up to 80 participants will be asked to wear the AutoSense for&#xD;
      four 1-week periods, including during laboratory sessions. Up to 40 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the mHIVRR evaluation program for 4 weeks during the Maintenance Phase (completed&#xD;
      October 2013). Up to 100 participants will be asked to wear a SleepProfiler during 7 nights&#xD;
      to assess sleep architecture (completed March 2019). Up to 50 participants will be asked to&#xD;
      wear the Health Tag for up to 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures: (1) EMA reports of drug use and psychosocial stress, and (2)&#xD;
      real-time assessment of environmental risk exposure as measured via integration of GPS data&#xD;
      with neighborhood psychosocial indicators. Data for the methadone and buprenorphine groups&#xD;
      will be analyzed separately for the primary outcome measures and combined as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of using (1) the&#xD;
      Daysimeter/Dimesimeter and Actigraph to collect real-time field data on light exposure and&#xD;
      its impact on circadian rhythms, and (2) the Autosense to collect real-time field data on&#xD;
      physiological function. Also, to (3) combine Daysimeter/Dimesimeter data with&#xD;
      electronic-diary data to determine whether heroin/cocaine users experience circadian&#xD;
      disruption and, if so, how this disruption is related to psychosocial stress and illicit drug&#xD;
      use, (4) combine Autosense data with electronic-diary data to determine if physiological&#xD;
      responses to triggers can be used to inform drug relapse prevention efforts, (5) To determine&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of interactive mHIVRR software programs to deliver&#xD;
      counseling and HIV education, and to determine whether they reduce HIV-related risk via&#xD;
      increased HIV/STD knowledge, (6) to determine if the HPA axis is normal after at least 3&#xD;
      months of opioid agonist treatment, (7) to incorporate genetic characteristics as predictors&#xD;
      of EMA and GMA data and other behavioral measures, (8) to assess how objectively measured&#xD;
      sleep quality is associated with EMA-reported psychosocial stress and reward responsiveness,&#xD;
      and with geographical exposure to stressful and rewarding environments, (9) to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of using a more up-to-date EMA interface and device, and to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between opioid withdrawal symptoms and successful taper from methadone or&#xD;
      buprenorphine maintenance and (10) to obtain qualitative data on participants perceptions of&#xD;
      their environments, in order to inform future work and to help explain why participants seem&#xD;
      to do better in more disordered environments. (11) To evaluate the feasibility of using the&#xD;
      Spire Health Tag to infer emotional state from respiratory status, with the eventual goal&#xD;
      (not an aim in this protocol) of providing a just-in-time intervention to relieve stress and&#xD;
      anxiety. (12) to determine the feasiblilty of using passively collected smartphone data to&#xD;
      assess physical activity and social interactions to infer daily behaviors, such as physical&#xD;
      movement (activity, mobility patterns) and social interactions (computer-mediated&#xD;
      communications), (13) to describe and analyze differences in the frequency and content of&#xD;
      dialogue on social media to determine the words or phrases associated with drug use; drug&#xD;
      treatment; recovery; and risk and protective factors for drug use (e.g., stress levels,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, social support).&#xD;
