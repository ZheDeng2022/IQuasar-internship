  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is designed to compare two types of images; magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound (TRUS) to see which one performs more accurately&#xD;
      for the image-guided insertion of Fiducial Markers(FMs) within the tumour. Though effective&#xD;
      for guiding FM placement at the poles of the prostate gland due to excellent visualization of&#xD;
      the prostatic boundaries, TRUS may not be ideally suited for marking the GTV. Conventional&#xD;
      TRUS is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for accurate visualization of&#xD;
      intra-prostatic tumor. A new interventional MRI technique enables needle guidance to the&#xD;
      gross tumour Volume (GTV) for FM placement. It is of particular importance that both&#xD;
      techniques be evaluated to enable which one is more effective so that it can be implemented&#xD;
      in the designs of future trials involving dose-escalation to prostate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of dose escalation strategies in prostate cancer over the last decade has relied&#xD;
      on high accuracy in target delineation, localization and radiation delivery. Improved&#xD;
      biochemical control with acceptable levels of toxicity (specifically rectal) has been&#xD;
      achieved by stringently monitoring the location of the prostate during the course of&#xD;
      radiation treatment. Studies in the early 1990's demonstrated that daily bony alignment was a&#xD;
      poor surrogate for prostate gland location. Since then, various strategies have been devised&#xD;
      to localize the prostate precisely during treatment. Of these, Transrectal Ultrasound&#xD;
      (TRUS)-guided gold fiducial marker (FM) insertion and x-ray imaging of markers has been a&#xD;
      broadly successful approach. TRUS guidance has been used for fiducial marker insertion within&#xD;
      the prostate since 1985 in various centers throughout the world and has also been a standard&#xD;
      practice in PMH since 1997 in men undergoing radical external beam radiotherapy. A&#xD;
      retrospective comparative study of 106 patients evaluating the relative accuracy of&#xD;
      endorectal MRI and TRUS in detecting the location of tumor reported an improved performance&#xD;
      of endorectal MRI especially in the base and midgland regions. Over the last few years,&#xD;
      mounting experience in the interpretation of prostate MRI, and addition of physiologic&#xD;
      imaging sequences has further improved the performance of MRI in detecting and localizing the&#xD;
      GTV.&#xD;
