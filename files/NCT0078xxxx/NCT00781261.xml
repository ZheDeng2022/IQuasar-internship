      Osteonecrosis of the hip is an important cause of musculoskeletal disability and finding&#xD;
      therapeutic solutions has proven to be challenging. Osteonecrosis means death of bone which&#xD;
      can occur from the loss of the blood supply or some other means. Although any age group may&#xD;
      develop osteonecrosis, most patients are between 20 and 50 years old. The most common risk&#xD;
      factor is a history of high steroid treatment for some medical condition. The next most&#xD;
      common associated condition is a history of high alcohol use. There are some cases of&#xD;
      osteonecrosis that occur in patients that are otherwise completely healthy with no detectable&#xD;
      risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the earliest stage of the disease, x-rays appear normal and the diagnosis is made using&#xD;
      MRI. The advanced stages of osteonecrosis begin when the dead bone starts to fail&#xD;
      mechanically through a process of microfractures of the bone. As the disease progresses, the&#xD;
      surface begins to collapse until, finally the integrity of the joint is destroyed. A wide&#xD;
      range of surgical treatments with variable success rates have been proposed for the treatment&#xD;
      of the osteonecrosis to preserve joint integrity, including core decompression, whereby the&#xD;
      venous hypertension that ensues is lessened and revascularisation may be induced leading to&#xD;
      bone repair. Nonsurgical treatment options are limited and usually result in a poor&#xD;
      prognosis. Early stage disease can be treated with protected weight bearing and&#xD;
      physiotherapy, however some studies have shown protected weight bearing to be associated with&#xD;
      a greater than 85% rate of femoral head collapse. Unfortunately most studies indicate that&#xD;
      the risk for disease progression is greater with nonsurgical treatment than with surgical&#xD;
      intervention. There are no established pharmaceuticals for the prevention of treatment of&#xD;
      osteonecrosis. Evidence is increasing that the nitrogen containing bisphosphonates may be&#xD;
      beneficial in the treatment of osteonecrosis. One bisphosphonates (alendronate) has been&#xD;
      evaluated in 60 patients diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the hip. Recent clinical studies&#xD;
      have shown very promising results. All patients had symptomatic improvement after one year.&#xD;
      Although the follow up time ranged from 3 months to 5 years, only 6 patients progressed to&#xD;
      the point of needing surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteonecrosis (ON) of the hip is an important cause of musculoskeletal disability and finding&#xD;
      therapeutic solutions has proven challenging. Patients who are affected with ON are often&#xD;
      relatively young, usually in the third to sixth decade of life. ON of the hip is an&#xD;
      increasingly common cause of musculoskeletal disability. It can cause pain with or without&#xD;
      loss of function of the joint and often ends in substantial use of health care resources and&#xD;
      disability. ON of the hip usually progresses to severe destruction of the femoral head with&#xD;
      resultant degeneration of the hip joint, in most cases requiring joint replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis has been made easier using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however no&#xD;
      common satisfactory therapy has been developed for the early stage of the disease. Early&#xD;
      surgery aimed at preserving the femoral head has been proposed, such as vascularised fibula&#xD;
      grafting. However, the results of this invasive technique do not seem to be widely&#xD;
      reproducible, and more minor interventions such as core drilling have high failure rates.&#xD;
      Evidence is increasing that the nitrogen containing bisphosphonates may be beneficial in the&#xD;
      treatment of ON. Data from clinical trials with patients with ON of the hip suggested that&#xD;
      the bisphosphonate alendronate would reduce pain and disability and may reduce progression to&#xD;
      femoral head collapse that usually would require surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study we aim to determine the efficacy of bisphosphonate therapy (zoledronic acid)&#xD;
      versus placebo for reducing pain and disability in ON of the femoral head necrosis&#xD;
      (palliative endpoint) and to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate therapy versus placebo&#xD;
      in reducing progression to femoral head collapse and the need for surgical intervention&#xD;
      (therapeutic endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a 2-armed double-blind randomised trial of a) zoledronic acid 5mg&#xD;
      annually for 3 doses b) placebo drug infusions. Participants will be recruited primarily from&#xD;
      rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons from multiple centres in Australia. We plan to&#xD;
      include 4 major centres in capital cities in Australia and each centre would recruit&#xD;
      approximately 30 participants. Potential participants who meet the eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be identified by their treating Rheumatologists or Orthopaedic surgeons, followed by a&#xD;
      screening assessment conducted by the study research staff. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomised prior to the start of treatment. Prior to treatment, the study research staff will&#xD;
      perform a baseline assessment over the phone, including demographic details, age, sex,&#xD;
      duration of symptoms, medical history including prior surgery, trauma and medication use and&#xD;
      known risk factors for ON. Furthermore at baseline, the Rheumatologists or Orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeon will perform a clinical evaluation using a slightly modified Harris Hip Score (HHS).&#xD;
      The study research staff will contact the participants every 6 months to monitor the&#xD;
      participant's condition and evaluate pain and disability. Additionally the participants will&#xD;
      have a clinical evaluation and MRI scan at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This novel clinical research protocol will aim to provide further evidence of the protective&#xD;
      value of alendronate or zoledronic acid in patients with ON of the hip. It will determine&#xD;
      whether bisphosphonates slow the progression of symptoms as well as the progression to total&#xD;
      collapse of the hip. Additionally it will seek to answer questions regarding the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness and also cost-effectiveness of the use of bisphosphonates in early disease. The&#xD;
      results of this study can lead to change in treatment of early disease ON and delay and&#xD;
      possibly prevent surgical intervention.&#xD;
