  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate whether, in patients diagnosed with Vertical&#xD;
      Heterophoria, the symptoms of dizziness, headache and / or anxiety are reduced or eliminated&#xD;
      when a kind of correction called vertical prism is added to the patient's normal eye glass&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will involve giving the patient two pairs of glasses (one pair containing the&#xD;
      baseline prescription with vertical prism (Standard Treatment Glasses) and the other pair&#xD;
      containing the baseline prescription but without vertical prism (Placebo Glasses)) to&#xD;
      demonstrate which pair of glasses is most effective in reducing the symptoms of dizziness,&#xD;
      headache and / or anxiety in these patients.&#xD;
