    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion administered over 3 minutes of&#xD;
      either ORG 28611 (SCH 900111), 0.12 mg/kg morphine sulphate, or placebo, within 6 hours after&#xD;
      dental surgery, when they experience moderate to severe dental pain. Patient will then be&#xD;
      evaluated with pain assessments at Baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes; and 2&#xD;
      through 8 hours or before rescue medication is needed.&#xD;
