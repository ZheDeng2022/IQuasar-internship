      RATIONALE: A Web site for stem cell transplant health information and support may be&#xD;
      effective in helping parents improve their health-related knowledge, skills, and quality of&#xD;
      life, which may also improve their children's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying a Web-based stem cell transplant support&#xD;
      system to see how well it works compared with standard care in families of young patients&#xD;
      undergoing a stem cell transplant.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability of a Web-based Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT-)&#xD;
           Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (HSCT-CHESS) to mitigate the impact of a&#xD;
           child's HSCT on the health-related quality of life, family functioning, knowledge,&#xD;
           skills, and processes of care of the accompanying parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the potential mechanisms of action of HSCT-CHESS in improving outcomes in&#xD;
           these parents, in terms of parental activation, social support and/or coping skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the impact of HSCT-CHESS on the health-related quality of life of the&#xD;
           pediatric HSCT patient, as reported by the parent and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT) recipients (ages 2 months-18 years) and accompanying parents are asked to complete a&#xD;
      baseline assessment battery by the start of transplant conditioning (the 'run-in' period). If&#xD;
      either member of the participating dyad fails to complete all study measures* during this&#xD;
      time period, the dyad is withdrawn from the study. The dyads are randomized into 1 of 2&#xD;
      intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Measures will not be collected from pediatric patients under 5 years of age at&#xD;
      baseline or follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Each dyad receives institution-specific usual care for 6 months, which typically&#xD;
           includes psychosocial support for the HSCT recipient and individualized or group&#xD;
           education and support for the accompanying parent during the peri-transplant period.&#xD;
           They also receive the Web-based Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT-)&#xD;
           Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (HSCT-CHESS) intervention for 6 months.&#xD;
           Accompanying parents also may identify a companion to receive access to the HSCT-CHESS&#xD;
           Web site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HSCT-CHESS Web site provides ready access to accurate information and resources about&#xD;
      pediatric HSCT, practical tips, organizational tools, and other supportive services for use&#xD;
      during the transplant process. While the Web site is designed primarily for use by the&#xD;
      accompanying parent, it also includes some resources for child and adolescent HSCT recipients&#xD;
      that the parent may choose to share. In addition to collecting data for later analysis, the&#xD;
      Web site tracking system allows for further tailoring of information and support for the&#xD;
      user, principally by time post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Each dyad receives institution-specific usual care for 6 months as described in&#xD;
           arm I. Accompanying parents also receive a book from the Blood and Marrow Transplant&#xD;
           Information Network (BMT InfoNet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dyad completes quality-of-life assessment (Child Health Ratings Inventory&#xD;
      [CHRIs]-General and CHRIs-HSCT) at day 45, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and CHRIS-General at&#xD;
      baseline. The accompanying parent provides demographic information at baseline and 6 months&#xD;
      and completes Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression screening at baseline and 6&#xD;
      and 9 months. The accompanying parent also completes other measures for family and individual&#xD;
      coping, social support, process of care, and Internet use at baseline and 6 and 9 months.&#xD;
