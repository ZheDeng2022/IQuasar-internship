      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effectiveness of methadone maintenance for treatment of heroin addiction has been&#xD;
           well established. However, patients maintained on methadone may relapse to cocaine use,&#xD;
           even when they are enrolled in a comprehensive treatment program. Relapse has been&#xD;
           attributed to several factors, including drug-associated environmental stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aripiprazole is a drug used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but it may have&#xD;
           other uses. Research has shown that aripiprazole can reduce cocaine-seeking behavior in&#xD;
           rats, and it has been investigated for use in treating amphetamine dependence. More&#xD;
           research is needed to determine whether aripiprazole can prevent relapse to cocaine use&#xD;
           in patients being treated with methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine whether aripiprazole prevents relapse to cocaine use more effectively than&#xD;
      placebo in cocaine-abstinent patients maintained on methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who are current cocaine users seeking methadone&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last up to 41 weeks, with four phases of treatment and a follow-up&#xD;
           evaluation. Three times a week, participants will be asked to report illicit drug use&#xD;
           and provide urine and breath samples. Throughout the study, participants will receive&#xD;
           individual counseling in weekly 40 60 minute sessions. Other samples and tests will be&#xD;
           scheduled as required by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be stabilized on daily methadone over the first 14 days of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 1 14: Participants will receive vouchers for regular cocaine-free urine samples.&#xD;
           Those who successfully complete this phase will continue to the next part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 13 27: Participants will receive either aripiprazole or placebo along with their&#xD;
           methadone. During this part of the study, participants will keep electronic diaries to&#xD;
           record cocaine use or craving and to record data on mood and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 28 33: Participants will stop taking the aripiprazole or placebo, but will&#xD;
           continue the methadone treatment. Participants will continue to use the electronic&#xD;
           diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 34 41: Participants will have the choice of transferring to a community clinic or&#xD;
           gradually reducing doses of methadone to end the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for a follow-up visit and urine sample 6 months after the end&#xD;
           of the study.&#xD;

      Background. Though methadone effectively treats opioid dependence in polydrug users, some&#xD;
      abstinent patients relapse to maladaptive use of cocaine during treatment. Relapse may be&#xD;
      triggered by cocaine-associated cues. Work in a rodent relapse model has demonstrated that&#xD;
      the atypical neuroleptic drug aripiprazole (Abilify), a partial agonist at dopamine D2&#xD;
      receptors, can block relapse to cocaine use induced by cocaine-associated environmental&#xD;
      stimuli or by priming doses of cocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goals. To determine whether aripiprazole prevents relapse to cocaine use more&#xD;
      effectively than placebo in cocaine-abstinent patients maintained on methadone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. A total of up to 275 opioid-dependent outpatients abusing cocaine and&#xD;
      opioids (110 evaluable) will be enrolled. Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%&#xD;
      minorities (mostly African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods. The study will be a randomized double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      with two treatment groups (55 per group): aripiprazole (15 mg oral daily) and placebo. All&#xD;
      patients will receive standard treatment (methadone daily and individual counseling weekly)&#xD;
      for 39 weeks. To establish abstinence prior to aripiprazole induction, contingent vouchers&#xD;
      will be given for each cocaine-negative urine specimen during the first 12 weeks (weeks&#xD;
      1-12). Participants who are abstinent from cocaine during weeks 11 and 12 will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive aripiprazole or aripiprazole placebo in weeks 13 through 27 (induction, weeks 13&#xD;
      and 14; taper, week 27). From weeks 28-33, participants will receive methadone and counseling&#xD;
      only, and then will be offered assistance to transfer to another program; those who do not&#xD;
      transfer will undergo an 8-week methadone detoxification. The primary outcome measures will&#xD;
      be time to relapse and longest duration of cocaine abstinence. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      evaluating whether the treatment groups differ in self-reported changes in drug use and&#xD;
      proportion of drug-negative urine specimens. In addition, drug use, drug craving, stress, and&#xD;
      HIV-risk behaviors such as injection practices will be assessed via electronic diaries&#xD;
      (ecological momentary assessment, EMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society. Participants will receive methadone, drug&#xD;
      counseling, and contingency-management therapy. The methadone, counseling, and voucher&#xD;
      interventions are likely to reduce participants use of heroin and cocaine and HIV risk&#xD;
      behaviors. Aripiprazole may reduce the incidence of relapse to cocaine use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants. Participants may experience side effects from aripiprazole and&#xD;
      methadone and discomfort during withdrawal from methadone and aripiprazole. Methadone could&#xD;
      raise serum levels of aripiprazole via inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolic pathways. The EMA&#xD;
      component of the study may generate some assessment burden.&#xD;
