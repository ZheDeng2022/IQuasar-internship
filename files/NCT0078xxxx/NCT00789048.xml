      Goal of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To check the viability of &quot;Operating Table Position Simulating Radiographs&quot;, while&#xD;
           positioned on the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether knowledge about the angles displayed on this radiograph (pelvic&#xD;
           tilt) influences the accurate positioning of the acetabular cup during the Total Hip&#xD;
           Replacement procedure.&#xD;

      Type of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power study has been calculated in order to define the sample size. The results indicated&#xD;
      that the following sample size will suffice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group: 50 consecutive patients undergoing a primary total hip replacement&#xD;
           procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: 50 consecutive patients undergoing a primary total hip replacement&#xD;
           procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age&gt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Candidate for primary total hip replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Agrees to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patient doesn't agree to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the research group and in the control group will undergo an &quot;Operating&#xD;
      Table Position Simulating &quot; radiograph of the pelvis. The radiograph will be done in the&#xD;
      following manner: the patient will be potisioned on the non-operated side in such way that&#xD;
      his pelvis is perpendicular to the table. The legs are flexed in 30 degrees at the hip joints&#xD;
      and 30 degrees at the knees. The plate with a grid will be placed behind the pelvis in a&#xD;
      device with notches (which can be used to measure the angles later). After the total hip&#xD;
      replacement the patients will undergo an A-P radiograph of the hip joints while lying on the&#xD;
      back with the hip joints bent to 30 degrees to overcome the forward tilt of the pelvis. All&#xD;
      of the radiographs will be performed in the presence of an orthopedic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be the first group of patients. Their radiographs will be stored in a&#xD;
      standalone file with controlled access rather than the general PACS system. The file will be&#xD;
      opened only when the study is over. The radiologist will control the file and be responsible&#xD;
      for this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will be the next group of patients. In this group the radiographs will be&#xD;
      saved in the general PACS system. The radiographs with measurement of the lateral inclination&#xD;
      of the pelvis, while lying in an &quot;Operating Table Position&quot; will be shown to the chief&#xD;
      surgeon on the day of surgery or one day prior to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both chief surgeons will not know about the study until the end of it. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, a comparison of both groups' acetabular cup angles will be done. The angles will be&#xD;
      measured twice. The first measurement will be done by a senior orthopedic surgeon&#xD;
      specializing in joint replacement operations. The second one will be done by a senior&#xD;
      radiologist specialized in skeletal radiology. If a difference of 5 degrees or more is found&#xD;
      between the two measurements, a third measurement will be done by a third examiner.&#xD;
