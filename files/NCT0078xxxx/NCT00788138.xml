  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency is common in patients with cystic fibrosis. The investigators study&#xD;
      will examine a large dose of vitamin D given to patients who have cystic fibrosis and are&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for a pulmonary exacerbation to determine whether vitamin D can&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes and whether the dose given is correct. The investigators hypothesis&#xD;
      is that vitamin D therapy will improve production of anti-microbial peptides and will&#xD;
      increase bacterial killing of microorganisms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency is common in CF patients. Treatment of vitamin D insufficiency in CF&#xD;
      patients requires large doses of vitamin D. Adequate vitamin D status in CF is important for&#xD;
      skeletal health and the prevention of osteoporosis. In addition to skeletal benefits of&#xD;
      vitamin D, recent evidence has demonstrated that vitamin D plays an important role in the&#xD;
      regulation of the immune system by increasing anti-microbial peptides in the lung and other&#xD;
      barrier sites. Whether improving vitamin D status in CF patients would enhance the immune&#xD;
      system has not yet been explored in a clinical study. This would have significant clinical&#xD;
      impact in CF care since vitamin D status remains undertreated, especially in the setting of&#xD;
      infection. The hypothesis of this proposal is that rapid correction of vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficiency will result in improved innate immunity by increasing production of&#xD;
      anti-microbial peptides resulting in more effective killing of bacteria. To address our&#xD;
      hypothesis, the following two aims are proposed: 1) To evaluate the effect of rapid&#xD;
      correction of vitamin D insufficiency as an adjunctive therapy on production of&#xD;
      anti-microbial peptides in acute respiratory exacerbation in CF patients 2) To determine the&#xD;
      effect of vitamin D treatment on bacterial killing in acute respiratory exacerbation in CF&#xD;
      patients and to correlate with free LL-37 levels in sputum. The long term objective of this&#xD;
      proposal and of our research group is to study the role of nutrition including vitamin D to&#xD;
      improve the immune system in the setting of infection in CF.&#xD;

        Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Study subjects must be patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and seen at the Emory&#xD;
             University Cystic Fibrosis Center who are admitted to Emory University Hospital for an&#xD;
             acute pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis as determined by their primary cystic&#xD;
             fibrosis physician or emergency room physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
