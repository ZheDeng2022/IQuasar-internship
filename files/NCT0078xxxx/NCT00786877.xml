  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At our field site in southern Nepal, acute respiratory illness (ARI) has been a leading cause&#xD;
      of mortality among young children. Besides immunization there is little evidence for&#xD;
      effective primary preventive approaches for ARI on a population basis. Low birth weight is&#xD;
      highly prevalent in this population as well affecting approximately 30% of live born infants.&#xD;
      Low birth weight is a key determinant of neonatal mortality and has also been resistant to&#xD;
      cost-effective interventions in resource poor settings. Given the lack of appropriate&#xD;
      interventions for poor, rural areas in developing countries and the strong observational&#xD;
      association between open burning of biomass fuel sources and ARI in young children and low&#xD;
      birth weight, we have designed a community-based randomized trial to determine if reductions&#xD;
      in household indoor smoke exposure can reduce the incidence and duration of acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory infections in children &lt;36 months of age and low birthweight among newborn&#xD;
      infants. Household indoor smoke reduction will be accomplished by replacing the current cook&#xD;
      stove in the household with a locally appropriate, inexpensive model that is more efficient&#xD;
      and vented to the exterior. In addition, we will assess the impact on respiratory function&#xD;
      and symptoms among adults in the household. The project has 2 phases. Phase 1 is a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized, community-based, step-wedge trial of cookstove replacement in a rural&#xD;
      population of southern Nepal. Households will be randomized to receive replacement of their&#xD;
      cook stove with an appropriately designed, efficient stove that is vented to the exterior at&#xD;
      different time periods during the course of the study. An initial period of surveillance for&#xD;
      ARI and low birth weight will establish a baseline rate for all clusters. This will be&#xD;
      followed by the randomized, serial replacements of cook stoves over a 12 month period.&#xD;
      Surveillance will continue throughout this period and for an additional 6 -18 months&#xD;
      depending on when the stove was replaced. Phase 2 is a individually randomized trial in a&#xD;
      subset of households that will receive either the improved biomass stove from phase 1 or a&#xD;
      LPG stove and gas. Follow-up for phase 2 will be for 12 months with the same outcomes as&#xD;
      phase 1. Measurement of indoor air particulate concentration will be conducted in all&#xD;
      households before and after stove replacement. The analysis for both phases will focus on&#xD;
      estimating the impact on incidence of ARI in children and low birth weight among live births&#xD;
      as a result of stove replacement. Approximately 4200 children 1-35 months of age will be&#xD;
      required to observe a minimum 10% reduction in risk of ARI with 90% power in phase 1. Given&#xD;
      the expected number of live births to occur in these clusters, we can detect a 50 gram&#xD;
      difference in birthweight with over 90% power and a type I error of 5%. Phase 2 will have&#xD;
      lower power (total of 1800 households).&#xD;
