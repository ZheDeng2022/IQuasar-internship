    <textblock>
      Given that sedentary behavior is associated with T2DM, the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether subjects with T2DM have a significant disincentive to performing exercise&#xD;
      (due to greater perceived effort) . This study will prospectively compare the perceived&#xD;
      exercise effort between T2DM and non-diabetic women while adjusting for potential confounders&#xD;
      including baseline physical activity. This study will also assess whether perception of&#xD;
      effort is associated with physiologic parameters related to exercise effort. Finally, we have&#xD;
      3 hypothesis-generating exploratory aims designed to screen for additional psychological and&#xD;
      physiologic parameters that may increase perceived effort in those with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: At the same absolute workload (e.g., 30 watts) and the same relative workloads,&#xD;
      it is a greater effort for women with T2DM to exercise than for non-diabetic women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine differences in subjective perceived effort of bicycle exercise&#xD;
      at low-to-moderate workloads in sedentary women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) vs.&#xD;
      non-diabetic sedentary women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: There will be a significant association between RPE and the physiologic&#xD;
      measures related to work intensity (e.g., relative work intensity and tau2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: In the same populations as SA1, to determine the strength of association&#xD;
      during bicycle exercise between subjective perceived effort and physiologic measures related&#xD;
      to work intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 1: In the T2DM group described in SA1, to determine the strength of&#xD;
      association during bicycle exercise between subjective effort and additional physiologic&#xD;
      measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 2: In the T2DM group described in SA1, to determine the strength of&#xD;
      association during bicycle exercise between subjective effort and psychologic measures&#xD;
      related to perception of effort.&#xD;

      During the first visit, blood will be drawn for measurements of overall health (complete&#xD;
      blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel), glucose and insulin levels, lipid levels,&#xD;
      plasma FSH concentration, and HbA1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On two separate visits, blood samples will be drawn from a warmed IV site to measure muscle&#xD;
      metabolites which change with exercise (e.g., glucose, calcium, lactate, H+, K+, and HCO3-)&#xD;
      and may be associated with muscle pain or fatigue.&#xD;

        Twenty-five sedentary post-menopausal women with uncomplicated T2DM (of duration â‰¤ 10&#xD;
        years) between the ages of 50-70 and twenty-five sedentary non-diabetic post-menopausal&#xD;
        women between the ages of 50-70 will be recruited.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sedentary women not participating in a regular exercise program (&gt; one bout of&#xD;
             exercise per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If subject has diabetes, must be uncomplicated T2DM and &lt; 25 years since T2DM&#xD;
             diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ages of 50-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI of 25-35&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects can only be taking the following oral hypoglycemic drugs: metformin,&#xD;
             sulfonylureas or sitagliptin. Use of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medications is&#xD;
             not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with T2DM will be accepted for study only if they have total glycosylated&#xD;
             hemoglobin levels (HbA1C) &lt;8% (adequate control) on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control subjects must have HbA1C &lt; 5.5% and a fasting blood glucose of &lt;100 mg/dl&#xD;
             suggesting no significant insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women must be post-menopausal, documented by menstrual history and follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smokers will be excluded since smoking can impair CV exercise performance but&#xD;
             people who have quit smoking for at least 1 year will be accepted for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of comorbid conditions will be confirmed by history, physical examination and&#xD;
             laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In general, people will be excluded with any condition which could limit exercise&#xD;
             performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with clinically evident distal symmetrical neuropathy, determined by&#xD;
             evaluation of symptoms (numbness, paresthesia) and signs (elicited by vibration,&#xD;
             pinprick, light touch, ankle jerks), will be excluded from further study as neuropathy&#xD;
             may limit exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with autonomic dysfunction (&gt;20 mm fall in upright BP without a change in&#xD;
             heart rate) will be excluded as well, due to associated limitations of exercise&#xD;
             performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons will be excluded if they have evidence of heart disease by history (Prior&#xD;
             heart attack or bypass surgery, heart failure, or significant valvular disease) or&#xD;
             abnormal resting electrocardiogram (EKG) consistent with prior infarct or latent&#xD;
             ischemia (unless cardiovascular stress imaging or catheterization shows they do not&#xD;
             have coronary artery disease). We will also exclude subjects with left or right bundle&#xD;
             branch block on resting EKG (precludes recognition of ischemic EKG changes with&#xD;
             exercise) or abnormal exercise EKG (&gt; 1 mm ST segment depression 80 msec out in the ST&#xD;
             segment for 3 consecutive beats).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons with angina or any other exercise-limiting cardiovascular, pulmonary or&#xD;
             musculoskeletal symptoms will be excluded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of systolic blood pressure &gt;150 at rest or &gt;250 with exercise or diastolic&#xD;
             pressure &gt;95 at rest or &gt;105 with exercise are also grounds for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with proteinuria (urine protein &gt;200 mg/dl) or a creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl,&#xD;
             suggestive of renal disease will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with total cholesterol &gt;220 mg/dl, low density lipoprotein &gt; 130 mg/dl, or&#xD;
             triglycerides &gt; 250 mg/dl will be excluded given the potential insulin resistance and&#xD;
             endothelial dysfunction associated with these cholesterol parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects taking the following medications will be excluded: insulin, oral hypoglycemic&#xD;
             agents other than those stated in inclusion criteria, estrogen-containing hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy including the &quot;estring&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control subjects who have an immediate family member with type 2 diabetes will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
