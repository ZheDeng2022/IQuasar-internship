  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most prevalent genetic disease of haemoglobin.The underlying&#xD;
      abnormality in the red blood cell (RBC) of SCD is the presence of abnormal sickle cell&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbS), which, when deoxygenated, becomes relatively insoluble, forms aggregates&#xD;
      with other hemoglobin molecules within the RBC and causes rigid deformation of the cell.&#xD;
      Acute pain vaso-occlusive crisis, strokes and acute chest syndrome are the main acute&#xD;
      complications, sometimes life-threatening, often leading to organic and functional squeal.&#xD;
      Although the common SS form of SCD is a unique gene disorder, the range of the clinical&#xD;
      severity is remarkably wide and striking, suggesting that clinical polymorphism is due to&#xD;
      modifier genes and environmental factors.Most of the research efforts have been focused on&#xD;
      the biology of haemoglobin and of the red cells. Meanwhile, the complex pathophysiology of&#xD;
      SCD is undoubtedly influenced by the many physiologic functions of the vascular wall. In line&#xD;
      with this hypothesis are several reports of increased circulating levels of&#xD;
      endothelium-derived surface molecules in SCD patients suggesting marked endothelial stress in&#xD;
      SCD. Similarly, other processes that involve the endothelium, such as leukocyte adhesion and&#xD;
      activation, may play a role in vascular occlusion. This accumulation of data raises the&#xD;
      unanswered question of the mechanisms of endothelium maintenance and regeneration in SCD.&#xD;
      Through these mechanisms, it is likely that function or dysfunction of the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium contributes to the overall vascular pathobiology of this disease, which includes&#xD;
      recurrent vaso-occlusions, stroke, leg ulcers, chronic organ ischemic damages, and&#xD;
      neovascularizing retinopathy that affect nearly one-half (48%) of the surviving patients by&#xD;
      the fifth decade.Thus, our groups have combined their respective clinical and biological&#xD;
      expertises to test the hypothesis that SCD is a condition of specific endothelial stress and&#xD;
      dysfunction upon chronic and Paracystic abnormal interactions with circulating cells and&#xD;
      abnormal oxygen delivery to tissues. Specifically, we hypothesize that chronic endothelial&#xD;
      stress with detachment of activated endothelial cells require increases mobilisation of the&#xD;
      Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) that maintain endothelial homeostasis to avoid major&#xD;
      thromboembolic events and vasospasm. Inappropriate mobilisation or maturation of the EPCs in&#xD;
      SCD may participate to the severity of the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the bone marrow, a reservoir of EPCs does exist, which can be mobilized into circulation&#xD;
      when needed, for example during ischemia, a situation which may occur in sickle cells&#xD;
      disease. These cells are able to reach distant targets and to participate to the&#xD;
      neovascularisation processes necessary for tissue and vascular healing. Conversely,&#xD;
      abnormalities of the maturation, mobilization or homing processes would contribute to the&#xD;
      thrombotic and ischemic risks associated to ischemia. Furthermore, vascular stress such that&#xD;
      encountered in SCD leads to the detachment of endothelial cells from the vessels. The number&#xD;
      of detached mature circulating endothelial cells (CEC) seems to be related to vascular&#xD;
      hurting. The balance between EPCs and CECs would thus be informative of the vascular&#xD;
      condition in patients during the progression of the disease. A relatively high level of EPCs&#xD;
      would indicate a prominence of a healing neoangiogenesis or vasculogenesis process, while&#xD;
      increasing levels of CECs would be indicative severe progression of the disease. Our studies&#xD;
      and those published by others indicate that the number of EPCs in peripheral blood is tightly&#xD;
      regulated. Indeed, mediators of inflammation could participate to EPC mobilization and to&#xD;
      their recruitment to the diseased areas by local activation of the vascular endothelium. In&#xD;
      this context, sickle cells disease provokes transient occlusion episodes, leading to a&#xD;
      situation of chronic ischemia in different organs, sometimes with acute episodes. This&#xD;
      suggests defect of the maintenance of the vascular integrity in these target organs.Within&#xD;
      this project, we will compare the number of EPCs and CECs in 25 SCD patients and 25 normal&#xD;
      individuals in search of a correlation with the severity of the disease. SCD patients with&#xD;
      potential confounding factors that may alter endothelial physiology (drugs, blood&#xD;
      transfusions, hydroxyurea therapy) are excluded. In addition, we will analyse and compare in&#xD;
      culture and in vivo the phenotypic and functional characteristics of EPCs obtained from&#xD;
      patients and controls. We have a working bilateral hypothesis, since we do not know whether&#xD;
      SCD subjects have appropriate angiogenic balance (high EPCs/CEC ratio with functional EPCs)&#xD;
      to face the situation of endothelial activation and tissue hypoxia induced by SCD. Therefore,&#xD;
      we will quantitatively and qualitatively study several distinct biological steps:1. Evaluate&#xD;
      the number of colonies generated by the EPCs in culture and their kinetics of appearance in&#xD;
      patients (major end point)2. Enumerate EPCs and CECs by flow cytometry using a specific set&#xD;
      of markers (CD133, CD146, KDR).3. Measure of the plasma concentrations of PlGF, VEGF, EPO,&#xD;
      ET-1, modulators of angiogenesis.4. Test of correlations between these respective&#xD;
      characteristics of EPCs with clinical vascular abnormalities of the disease (retinopathy&#xD;
      assessed by angiography, nephropathy, leg ulcers) and severity of vaso-occlusive crisis&#xD;
      assessed by number and length of hospitalizations during the previous year and during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
