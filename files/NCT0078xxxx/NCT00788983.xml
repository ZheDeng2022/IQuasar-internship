      Validate Non-Motion SpO2 Accuracy from 70%-100% of various pulse oximeter/ sensor&#xD;
      combinations and various OEM pulse oximeter modules and sensor combinations during induced&#xD;
      hypoxia (desaturation).&#xD;

      The testing is conducted on 12 healthy, consenting, non-smoking subjects in accordance with&#xD;
      the IRB approved Protocol. The subjects shall be distributed across both genders and a range&#xD;
      of skin tones as equally as practical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An arterial line will be placed in the radial artery of each subject's right arm, and sensors&#xD;
      will be attached to each subject. The subjects will be placed in a semi-supine position and&#xD;
      allowed to breathe through a mouthpiece while the nose is blocked with a nose-clip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxia will be induced by on each subject, as levels of oxyhemoglobin saturation (between&#xD;
      70% and 100%) are achieved by breathing mixtures of nitrogen, room air and carbon dioxide.&#xD;
      Inspired O2 concentration will be adjusted breath-by-breath using a computed saturation,&#xD;
      based on end-tidal PO2 and PCO2, as sampled by a mass spectrometer. Predicted levels of&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin saturations will be attained and held stable. At a minimum of sixty seconds&#xD;
      into each plateau, a 0.5cc waste blood draw through the arterial line, followed by the first&#xD;
      1.0cc sample blood draw. After approximately thirty additional seconds, the second 1.0cc&#xD;
      sample blood draw will be taken. The samples will immediately be analyzed by a Radiometer&#xD;
      OSM-3 multi-wavelength co-oximeter and recorded. The SpO2 data from the oximeters will be&#xD;
      collected via a laptop computer. Concurrent with the end of each blood draw, a marker will be&#xD;
      generated on the laptop computers to identify the event.&#xD;
