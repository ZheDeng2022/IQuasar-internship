  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sapropterin dihydrochloride (subsequently referred to as sapropterin) (Kuvan®) was approved&#xD;
      by the FDA for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia in 2007. Preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      studies and post-marketing surveillance have not demonstrated any specific cardiovascular&#xD;
      concerns with sapropterin (Kuvan®). Nonetheless, nonantiarrhythmic drugs may have the&#xD;
      potential to prolong QT interval, leading to potentially fatal ventricular tachycardias,&#xD;
      including torsades de pointes. As part of the post-marketing commitment, a thorough QT/QTc&#xD;
      study will be conducted according to ICH guidelines.&#xD;
