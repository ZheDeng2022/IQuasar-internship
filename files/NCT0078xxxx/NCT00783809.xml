  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma patients are at risk for serious head trauma. The consequences of serious head trauma&#xD;
      are often life altering. Currently, the only method available to rapidly assess the severity&#xD;
      of head injury and need for neurosurgical intervention is the CT scan. This time consuming&#xD;
      test requires transportation of a potentially unstable patient to the CT scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal in traumatic brain injury is to identify early those patients who may&#xD;
      require neurosurgical intervention. Brain swelling (elevated intracranial pressure) is&#xD;
      transmitted to the eye and this can be measured with ultrasound. The investigators hypothesis&#xD;
      is that this test will rule out significant elevations in intracranial pressure and perform&#xD;
      as well as CT scan in doing this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study aims to demonstrate that ultrasound of the optic nerve is as good as&#xD;
      CT scan in ruling out clinically significant elevations in pressure within the brain. After&#xD;
      consent has been obtained, any trauma patient who has an indication to undergo CT scan of the&#xD;
      brain will also undergo ultrasound of the eye. A radiologist will then review the CT scans to&#xD;
      determine if signs of elevated intracranial pressure are present. The investigators hope to&#xD;
      demonstrate that a bedside ultrasound performed in the trauma suite is reliable for ruling&#xD;
      out the possibility of elevated intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Update August 2009** Currently, deferred consent has been obtained from our REB allowing us&#xD;
      to defer consent for this intervention of minimal risk. As well, REB has also approved phone&#xD;
      consent in the interim.&#xD;
