      The purpose of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish and evaluate a system for collection of filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood&#xD;
           stem cells from National Marrow Donor Program donors (NMDP) donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety among NMDP donors of filgrastim administration and PBSC leukapheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and efficacy of filgrastim-mobilized PBSC in unrelated donor&#xD;
           hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the acceptability of stem cell donation by filgrastim stimulated apheresis in&#xD;
           normal donors&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many years, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been used to successfully treat&#xD;
      leukemias, other hematologic conditions and congenital disorders. The first unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplants were performed in the late 1970s, but this procedure did not become widely&#xD;
      available until the development of several consolidated unrelated donor registries around the&#xD;
      world. The National Marrow Donor Program, established in 1987, is the world's largest&#xD;
      registry and currently lists more than 7 million donors. Since its beginning, NMDP has&#xD;
      facilitated more than 30,000 unrelated transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not a licensed indication, considerable experience has been accumulated concerning&#xD;
      administration of filgrastim to normal adults. Most of these adults were volunteer research&#xD;
      subjects or donors of PBSC for use in related donor transplants. Beginning in February 1997,&#xD;
      filgrastim stimulated PBSC have been collected from NMDP donors under protocol. The protocol&#xD;
      (locally referred to as G2) began under an NMDP-sponsored Investigational New Drug (IND)&#xD;
      application filed with FDA for collecting PBSC for a second donation following an initial&#xD;
      donation of bone marrow. In 1999 a second protocol was opened (locally referred to as G1) as&#xD;
      requests for PBSC as a primary donation source became more common. In 2005 the two protocols&#xD;
      were combined to eliminate redundancy and provide for ease of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol establishes and evaluates a system to supply peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)&#xD;
      products for use in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The&#xD;
      protocol describes processes for donor identification, education and evaluation. Procedures&#xD;
      for administration and monitoring of the stem cell mobilizing agent filgrastim are included.&#xD;
      The protocol also describes procedures for the collection of PBSC products by leukapheresis&#xD;
      and includes provisions for long term donor follow-up.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. PBSC donors must meet the same criteria as NMDP marrow donors. These criteria are set&#xD;
             forth in the Donor Center Manual of Operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Confirmatory pregnancy test must be performed within 15 days of collection and prior&#xD;
             to the start of filgrastim administration; this may require more than one test to be&#xD;
             performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy or uninterruptible breastfeeding. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication&#xD;
             under this protocol. Women who are breastfeeding must be willing and able to interrupt&#xD;
             breastfeeding during the administration of filgrastim and for two days following the&#xD;
             final dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sensitivity to filgrastim or to E. coli-derived recombinant protein products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatic diseases and thyroid disorders.&#xD;
             Exception: As with bone marrow donations, donors with a history of thyroid disease who&#xD;
             have undergone successful therapy may be suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of iritis or episcleritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Thrombocytopenia &lt; 150 x 10^9/L (&lt; 150,000/uL) at baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current treatment with lithium. Drug interactions between filgrastim and lithium,&#xD;
             which may potentiate the release of neutrophils, have not been fully evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Positive Hemoglobin-Solubility (e.g., SickleDex or equivalent) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Donors receiving experimental therapy or investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Positive pregnancy test collected/reported prior to start of filgrastim.&#xD;
