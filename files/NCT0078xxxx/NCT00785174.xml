    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has become now a widely used treatment modality in ICU and&#xD;
      emergency services to deal with respiratory failure.1 NIV has the potential to improve&#xD;
      ventilatory assistance while avoiding endotracheal intubation and its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first publications of Meduri2 and Brochard3 the number of studies on the NIV has&#xD;
      been growing and developing and this technique becomes one of the major progress in the field&#xD;
      of respiratory assistance. Decompensation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is&#xD;
      certainly the least questionable indication of the NIV. However, indication of the NIV is&#xD;
      inexorably spreading to other types of acute respiratory insufficiency, including acute&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE).4 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most&#xD;
      currently used non-invasive ventilation usually performed without the use of a ventilator.&#xD;
      NIV using pressure support (NIPSV) combined pressure support (inspiratory aid) and positive&#xD;
      expiratory pressure as in CPAP. Based on physiological ground, NIPSV would be more performant&#xD;
      than CPAP to improve ventilatory parameters and reduce the work breathing in APE. However,&#xD;
      this issue is not settled yet. Number of meta-analysis over the last 2 years were devoted to&#xD;
      the comparison of CPAP and NISPV,5 so that the scientific evidence is still far from&#xD;
      established. In addition, it is not sur that patients enrolled in these studies are&#xD;
      representative of all patients with APE. The fact that they were included solely on the basis&#xD;
      of clinical criteria, the risk of overlap with other diagnoses is not negligible. Thus the&#xD;
      use of markers of heart failure as the BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) would be very useful.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the possible deleterious effect of NIPSV on myocardial perfusion is a&#xD;
      problem that has not been definitively resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the efficacy and safety of the NIPSV with those of CPAP in patients presenting&#xD;
           to the emergency department with CPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the two procedures in subgroups of patients with hypercapnia and high BNP&#xD;
           concentration.&#xD;

      Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is defined as an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the&#xD;
      pulmonary microcirculation resulting from postcapillaire hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct consequence is extravasation of fluid in the alveolar and interstitial tissue,&#xD;
      leading to acute hypoxemia and a decrease in lung compliance. The decrease in lung&#xD;
      compliance, increased airway resistance (interstitial and bronchial edema) and hypoxemia will&#xD;
      cause an increase in work of breathing. The imbalance between the ability of respiratory&#xD;
      muscles to generate effective gas exchange and exaggerated ventilatory load can lead to&#xD;
      respiratory muscle fatigue requiring use of mechanical ventilation through endotracheal&#xD;
      prosthesis. In addition, the increase in inspiratory muscles work during the CPE generates&#xD;
      very important pleural depression, which increases transmural pressure and left ventricular&#xD;
      afterload and thus increases pulmonary edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPAP is a non-invasive ventilation mode most currently used CPE. It is usually obtained&#xD;
      via a mask and an expiratory valve to maintain constant pressure in the circuit. No&#xD;
      inspiratory assistance is provided to the patient. The BOUSSIGNAC valve is currently used in&#xD;
      clinical practice as an adjunct to the pharmacological treatment of CPE.The effect of CPAP is&#xD;
      mainly linked to its ability to recruit zones that are collapsed during expiration. • NIPSV&#xD;
      combines a positive expiratory pressure to ventilatory assistance pressure during inspiration&#xD;
      delivered by a ventilator. It corresponds to a CPAP associated with inspiratory assistance,&#xD;
      and thus, it is likely to improve the ventilation parameters, and in particular to reduce&#xD;
      respiratory work more efficiently than CPAP alone.These beneficial physiological effects of&#xD;
      NIPSV were well demonstrated during the decompensation of COPD ; they wait to be confirmed&#xD;
      during CPE. Physiological studies have shown that the NIPSV is more effective in terms of&#xD;
      reducing the work of breathing in CPE. However, none of the 7 published randomized studies&#xD;
      has shown superiority of the NIPSV compared to CPAP in terms of reducing mortality and&#xD;
      intubation requirement&#xD;
