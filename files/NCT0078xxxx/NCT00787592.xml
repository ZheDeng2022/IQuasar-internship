      The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of children with burn injury with&#xD;
      regard to the utilization of Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream and Collagenase ointment. The&#xD;
      primary outcome variable will be need for skin grafting. The specific aim of the study is to&#xD;
      prospectively collect data to determine if SSD is superior to Collagenase with regard to&#xD;
      avoiding the need for skin grafting.&#xD;

      During the treatment of burns, the wounds must be repeatedly debrided to remove loose and&#xD;
      adherent dead tissue (eschar) until it is determined that the wound will require skin&#xD;
      grafting for coverage or that the wound will re-epithelialize. The eschar associated with&#xD;
      burn injury eventually will separate from the burn bed through proteolytic enzymes that are&#xD;
      produced naturally in the skin or by colonizing bacteria. During this acute treatment&#xD;
      timeframe, agents are used that can help with removal of the eschar. SSD is an antimicrobial&#xD;
      agent that sterilizes the wound, thus preventing infection and allowing the natural&#xD;
      proteolytic enzymes in the skin to act on the eschar leading to separation during the&#xD;
      mechanical debridement treatment regimen. SSD was initially introduced in the 1960's and has&#xD;
      been a mainstay of treatment for the care of burns since. It is currently used in the CMH&#xD;
      burn unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collagen is a protein that is highly present in skin (~75% of dry weight of skin), and is the&#xD;
      dominant protein that must be divided to allow for eschar separation. Collagenase is an&#xD;
      exogenous enzyme that breaks down native and denatured collagen. Collagenase will not however&#xD;
      breakdown healthy, normal collagen. Collagenase is FDA approved for the treatment of burns&#xD;
      and is now used by many burn units including the burn unit at CMH. Currently, in this&#xD;
      institution, both SSD and collagenase are being used for the removal of eschar.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there has not been a properly performed prospective randomized comparison of&#xD;
      these two regimens in children, despite the widespread use of both regimens. Because of the&#xD;
      uncertain data regarding these approaches, as well as the fact that we currently perform both&#xD;
      approaches here, we feel that there is equipoise in regard to the techniques. We plan to&#xD;
      perform a prospective randomized trial comparing SSD and Collagenase in children that sustain&#xD;
      burns and are admitted to CMH for debridement of their burns. We have reviewed our historical&#xD;
      experience using collagenase and SSD. Utilizing the need for skin graft rates from this&#xD;
      historical population, a sample size of 75 patients in each arm has been calculated. This&#xD;
      sample size calculation was performed using a standard alpha and beta of 0.05 and 0.8,&#xD;
      respectively, and assumes a 10% attrition rate. The primary endpoint for this study will be&#xD;
      the need for skin grafting in children that sustain a burn of sufficient depth to require&#xD;
      admission and debridement of eschar.&#xD;
