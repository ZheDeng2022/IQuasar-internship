      Tuberculosis is a disease caused by a bacterium (a germ) that can cause illness in any organ&#xD;
      of the body, but most frequently causes disease of the lungs. TB is short for tuberculosis.&#xD;
      Treating TB requires several months (usually 6 months) of treatment, with the first 2 months&#xD;
      being intensive treatment with usually four medicines. Treatment is needed to keep the&#xD;
      infection from getting worse and to prevent death from TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D is a hormone present in the human body to manage levels of some essential&#xD;
      electrolytes such as calcium and phosphate. Vitamin D is important for bone formation and&#xD;
      prevention of bone breakdown (osteoporosis) as the investigators age. There is also new&#xD;
      evidence that links vitamin D to function of our immune system as well. Even though our&#xD;
      bodies can make vitamin D and can also obtain vitamin D from our diet, most adults,&#xD;
      especially patients with tuberculosis have low vitamin D levels (are vitamin D deficient)&#xD;
      that need to be corrected. Full correction of low vitamin D levels requires 6 weeks or more&#xD;
      of weekly vitamin D supplements. There are several benefits to correcting vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency (better bone health, better balance of calcium and phosphate), but it is not known&#xD;
      whether correcting vitamin D deficiency will lead to a better immune response to&#xD;
      tuberculosis. Preliminary data does suggest that vitamin D increases the levels of an&#xD;
      antimicrobial molecule (cathelicidin LL-37) in the body, possibly leading to better immunity&#xD;
      against tuberculosis. The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the relationship&#xD;
      of vitamin D levels in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis to levels of LL-37&#xD;
      cathelicidin in sputum and whole blood. The results of this study are needed in preparation&#xD;
      for larger studies that will evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy to standard medical treatment for tuberculosis.&#xD;

      1.0 Introduction and Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis remains an enormous public health problem and a major cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality throughout the world. The WHO estimates that 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis&#xD;
      occurred worldwide in 2005, along with 1.6 million TB related deaths. New challenges in TB&#xD;
      control include the HIV epidemic, as well as the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and&#xD;
      extremely drug resistant (XDR) strains of tuberculosis which are associated with high&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. While cure rates for drug susceptible TB can reach the &gt;90% range&#xD;
      given the appropriate infrastructure to diagnose and treat patients, cure rates for MDR-TB&#xD;
      are much lower and, at best, approach 60% according to the latest estimates by WHO. In many&#xD;
      parts of the world, second line drugs to treat MDR-TB are not available. Not only is there an&#xD;
      urgent need for novel TB treatment regimens, but adjunctive therapeutic modalities need to be&#xD;
      explored with the goal of maximizing clinical response for both patients with drug&#xD;
      susceptible and drug resistant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of vitamin D as primary or adjunctive TB therapy has a long history. Therapeutic&#xD;
      doses of oral vitamin D supplementation for TB treatment were first pioneered in the 1950's&#xD;
      by Jacques Charpy, who noted excellent results in cutaneous TB disease. Subsequently, vitamin&#xD;
      D has been used as both primary and adjunctive therapy in pulmonary tuberculosis, but this&#xD;
      practice fell out of favor as effective antimycobacterial chemotherapy became widely&#xD;
      available in the latter half of the twentieth century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in vitamin D as an effective&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy in tuberculosis. Recent reports indicate that vitamin D may have a&#xD;
      pronounced immunomodulatory role in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis within the human host.&#xD;
      It is well known that areas of granulomatous inflammation in TB are sites of increased&#xD;
      vitamin D production stemming from activated macrophages and Th1 lymphocytes within the&#xD;
      granuloma Recently, the immunomodulatory function of increased vitamin D levels at sites of&#xD;
      TB involvement has been demonstrated, in that 1,25(OH)2D, the active metabolite form of&#xD;
      vitamin D, has been found to induce antimycobacterial activity in vitro in both monocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One proposed pathway for this observed immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D in TB infection&#xD;
      involves the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways of the innate immune system. Liu et&#xD;
      al demonstrated that macrophage TLR binding of M. tuberculosis antigen upregulates the&#xD;
      expression of cellular 1 hydroxylase, resulting in higher levels of active 1, 25(OH)2D. It&#xD;
      was also shown that 1, 25(OH)2D in turn binds the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), which&#xD;
      activates a downstream signaling cascade resulting in the upregulation of several aspects of&#xD;
      the innate immune response, including the induction of a newly described anti-microbial&#xD;
      peptide LL-37, a cathelicidin. Cathelicidins, in addition to their broad spectrum&#xD;
      antimicrobial activity, also possess chemotactic properties for neutrophils, monocytes and T&#xD;
      cells, among other functions within the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this mechanism of action for vitamin D was demonstrated in vitro, little clinical work&#xD;
      has been done to validate this piece of knowledge in clinical practice and in the care of TB&#xD;
      patients. As proxy for in vivo studies, subsequent experiments by Liu et al evaluated&#xD;
      induction of cathelicidin by TLR activation of macrophages in sera from African American and&#xD;
      Caucasian subjects. These experiments demonstrated failure to induce detectable levels of&#xD;
      cathelicidin mRNA in samples from African American patients, who are known to be&#xD;
      significantly more vitamin D deficient than Caucasians due to difference in vitamin D&#xD;
      production in the skin. The difference in cathelicidin mRNA levels was corrected upon&#xD;
      supplementation of deficient sera to therapeutic levels of 25(OH)D3 prior to TLR stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the preliminary results of these in vitro studies, we propose a clinical pilot&#xD;
      investigation of the relationship between vitamin D levels and cathelicidin production in TB&#xD;
      patients. It is well known that the majority of TB patients are deficient in vitamin D, but&#xD;
      it is unknown whether the deficiency has functional consequences for treatment response and&#xD;
      relapse rates. While recent in vitro data suggests that vitamin D supplementation of recent&#xD;
      TB contacts does improve their immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis as measured in&#xD;
      whole blood assays, clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation in latent or active TB&#xD;
      disease have not been undertaken. In preparation for larger trials that would be needed to&#xD;
      address this clinical question, we propose that the clinical relationship between physiologic&#xD;
      levels of vitamin D supplementation and effect on cathelicidin production within the host&#xD;
      needs to be studied, given recent suggestions from in vitro studies that ability to generate&#xD;
      adequate cathelicidin levels may have an impact on quality and effectiveness of host immune&#xD;
      defense against M. tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Overall Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the relationship of 25-hydroxy vitamin&#xD;
      D levels in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis to levels of LL-37/cathelicidin in&#xD;
      sputum, saliva, and whole blood.&#xD;
