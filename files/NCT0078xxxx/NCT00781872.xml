  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although, effective immunotherapies for MS exist which downregulate the anti-myelin&#xD;
      reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of the disease, there is no effective means today&#xD;
      to stop the progression of disability and induce remyelination. Neuronal stem cells were&#xD;
      shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through&#xD;
      transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with&#xD;
      promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in&#xD;
      neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC)&#xD;
      were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative&#xD;
      effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of&#xD;
      chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for&#xD;
      clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and&#xD;
      therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the&#xD;
      cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant&#xD;
      transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show&#xD;
      that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both&#xD;
      intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further&#xD;
      neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and&#xD;
      restoration of neuronal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment&#xD;
      with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted&#xD;
      cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle&#xD;
      (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly&#xD;
      evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type&#xD;
      of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the&#xD;
      path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;

      This study, is designed as a phase 1/2 open-safety clinical trial. At its first phase, 15&#xD;
      consenting patients with MS are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients fulfilled the following 4 inclusion criteria for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the clinical criteria of Poser et alfor definite MS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. men and nonpregnant women aged 25 to 65 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. duration of disease longer than 5 years; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. failure to respond to the currently available and registered agents for MS (ie,&#xD;
           interferons, glatiramer acetate [Copaxone], and immuno-suppressors), as manifested by an&#xD;
           increase of at least 1 degree in the EDSS score during the past year or the appearance&#xD;
           of at least 2 major MS relapses during the same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients who were treated with cytotoxic medications (ie, cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
           mitoxantrone, and azathioprine) during the 3 months before the trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients with significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure or any other disease that&#xD;
           may interfere with the ability to interpret the results of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. patients with an active infection; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. patients who showed severe cognitive decline or were unable to understand and sign the&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration is performed under short general anesthesia with puncture from the&#xD;
      posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or a right lateral&#xD;
      position. Approximately 200 mL of bone marrow inocula are obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSC Preparation and Culture A culture of purified MSCs is prepared under aseptic conditions&#xD;
      (positively pressurized clean rooms) using filtered sterilized Dulbecco modified Eagle medium&#xD;
      with low glucose lev- els (Qiagen, Valencia, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine&#xD;
      serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- nystatin solution (all from Biological&#xD;
      Industries, Kibbutz Beit- Haemek, Israel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal cells are cultured for 40 to 60 days, until they reach confluency, and then&#xD;
      harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide-containing medium in liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      (-196°C). At 2 weeks, a sample is taken for sterility testing and quality control. After&#xD;
      sterility confirmed, the MSCs are transferred to the laboratory on dry ice, thawed in a 37°C&#xD;
      water bath, and washed twice with normal saline solution to remove any residual dimethyl&#xD;
      sulfoxide. The cells are then resuspended in normal saline at a concentration of 10x106/mL to&#xD;
      15x106/mL. Two-thirds of the total number of cells (usually 60x106 to 100x106) are injected&#xD;
      intrathecally, and one-third, intravenously. A sample of the cells to be injected is tested&#xD;
      by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis; cells (98%) should express the surface&#xD;
      markers characteristic of MSCs (CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and be negative for CD34,&#xD;
      CD45, and CD14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol All patients receive an intrathecal injection via a standard lumbar&#xD;
      puncture (mean of 1 million cells per Kg of body weight) and an intravenous injection of&#xD;
      0.3-1 million cells per kg, intravenously..&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extension phase is scheduled for patients completing the first phase of this trial as an&#xD;
      open prospective study with repeated intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous MSC&#xD;
      in patients from the initial trial and 10 additional ones (total up to 24 patients) with&#xD;
      progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive or&#xD;
      relapsing-progressive). Patients should be defined as failures to first and second lines of&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatments experiencing deterioration (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS&#xD;
      scale) during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major&#xD;
      relapse without sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of&#xD;
      body weight, intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or&#xD;
      IV-injections of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the&#xD;
      trial is 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety&#xD;
      assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month&#xD;
      6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS)&#xD;
      analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune&#xD;
      activation or of regulatory cell phenotype.&#xD;
