  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study designed to look at ultrasound images of the joint&#xD;
      at baseline and over time, and investigate whether there is a correlation between ultrasound&#xD;
      images and progression of disease. The researchers wish also to see if ultrasound can be used&#xD;
      as a tool to predict progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis in patients with early disease who&#xD;
      have not taken biologics therapy. In addition, the researchers wish to investigate whether&#xD;
      peripheral blood &quot;biomarkers&quot;can be identified that predict the progression of erosive&#xD;
      disease in early rheumatoid arthritis, with the intention of testing the most promising&#xD;
      biomarkers in future clinical trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female adults aged 18 years or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has a diagnosis of RA according to the revised 1987 criteria of the&#xD;
             American College of Rheumatology (ACR) with onset of symptomatology of less than 3&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient is seropositive for rheumatoid factor (IgM RF measured by agglutination&#xD;
             assay) and / or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (measured by ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has provided signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission&#xD;
             to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions&#xD;
             and restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect both the&#xD;
             subject's participation in the study or outcome of the study. These diseases include&#xD;
             but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal&#xD;
             disease, haematological disease, neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or prior use of biologic drugs ( anti- tumour necrosis factor alpha drugs or&#xD;
             rituximab)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. As a result of the medical interview, physical examination or screening&#xD;
             investigations, the physician responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject's RA does not have a clearly recordable time of onset (within a 6 month&#xD;
             period) as determined by either the notes or from the history taken from the patient&#xD;
             by the physician responsible&#xD;
