      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of Xolair® (omalizumab) in people&#xD;
      with asthma taking Advair Diskus®. The study will look at the effects of Xolair® on lung&#xD;
      function using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans after asthma symptoms are&#xD;
      induced with a special substance called methacholine. This study is only taking place at&#xD;
      UCLA, where about 13 subjects will be enrolled. Participation requires 10-14 visits over&#xD;
      about 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive an albuterol inhaler to use as needed for immediate relief of symptoms&#xD;
      and fluticasone 250 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg or fluticasone 500 mcg/salmeterol 50 mcg (Advair&#xD;
      Diskus® 250/50 or 500/50) to be taken twice daily. At certain visits, they will be given&#xD;
      Xolair® injections followed by various assessments, including CT scans and lung function&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

      This is a prospective pilot study evaluating the effect of omalizumab on the small airways of&#xD;
      moderate to severe asthmatic individuals who are not fully controlled on&#xD;
      fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 or 500/50 mcg 1 puff bid. After screening, all subjects will be&#xD;
      placed on fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 or 500/50 mcg 1 puff bid for a 6-week run-in.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be evaluated for level of asthma control. Individuals with total control&#xD;
      of their asthma (no daytime or nighttime symptoms, no rescue use of short-acting inhaled&#xD;
      beta-agonist, normal PEF, no unscheduled office visits, no ER visits) will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Subjects without total asthma control will then have baseline studies performed to&#xD;
      include HRCT of the chest before and after a methacholine challenge test (MCT), spirometry,&#xD;
      closing volume, inspiratory capacity, symptom scores, asthma questionnaires, exhaled NO&#xD;
      (performed at different expiratory flow rates to estimate alveolar NO) and blood work for&#xD;
      evaluation of eosinophils and ECP, and banked serum. Subjects who meet acceptable criteria&#xD;
      for omalizumab dosing based on serum IgE levels and body weight and the presence of atopy (at&#xD;
      least one positive skin test to a common environmental allergen) will then receive omalizumab&#xD;
      in addition to fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 or 500/50 mcg 1 puff bid for sixteen weeks.&#xD;
      Subjects will be seen every 2-4 weeks during the sixteen-week treatment phase to receive&#xD;
      injections as prescribed and every 4 weeks to measure spirometry, inspiratory capacity, and&#xD;
      to evaluate the level of compliance. After the sixteen-week treatment phase subjects will&#xD;
      again undergo HRCT of the chest before and after a MCT [in the case where the follow-up&#xD;
      methacholine responsiveness is diminished (improved) a mid-scan will be performed at the&#xD;
      prior (target) methacholine dose and the challenge then continued to a maximum dose of 16&#xD;
      mg/ml and a third scan done], spirometry, closing volume, inspiratory capacity, exhaled NO at&#xD;
      different expiratory flow rates (to estimate alveolar NO) and blood work for evaluation of&#xD;
      eosinophils and ECP and banked serum.&#xD;
