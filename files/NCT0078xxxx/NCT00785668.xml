    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single dose pharmacokinetic/safety study in male and female&#xD;
      asthmatic subjects. Subjects will receive a single dose of 10 mg of AER 001 administered as a&#xD;
      dry powder using a handheld device. The goals of this study are to understand the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and safety of AER 001 administered as a dry powder in mild to moderate&#xD;
      asthmatics.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single centre, single dose PK/safety study in male and female asthmatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 10 subjects will be dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments will be administered by dry powder inhalation using a handheld device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will attend the Unit for screening and if eligible return to the Unit on the&#xD;
           day of dosing (Day 1). Subjects will be required to stay overnight in the Unit and will&#xD;
           be discharged on Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On study Day 1, subjects are to receive a single administration of AER 001. N.B.&#xD;
           Screening will take place within 28 days prior to administration of AER 001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of AER 001 administered as a dry&#xD;
      powder in mild to moderate asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To investigate the safety of AER 001 administered as a dry powder in&#xD;
      mild to moderate asthmatics.&#xD;
