      The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap&#xD;
      initiative to develop a computerized system measuring patient-reported outcomes in&#xD;
      respondents with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics. In the&#xD;
      first four years of its existence, the PROMIS network developed item banks for measuring&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes in the areas of pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical&#xD;
      function, and social functioning. During the item banking process, the PROMIS network&#xD;
      conducted focus groups, individual cognitive interviews, and lexile (reading level) analyses&#xD;
      to refine the meaning, clarity, and literacy demands of all items. The item banks were&#xD;
      administered to over 20,000 respondents and calibrated using models based on item response&#xD;
      theory (IRT). Using these IRT calibrations, computerized adaptive test (CAT) algorithms were&#xD;
      developed and implemented. The network has designed a series of studies using clinical&#xD;
      populations to evaluate the item attributes, examine their utility as CATs, and validate the&#xD;
      item banks. More information on the PROMIS network can be found at www.nihpromis.org.&#xD;

      This is a longitudinal clinical validation study of the PROMIS physical function, fatigue,&#xD;
      and pain impact short forms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients will&#xD;
      complete assessments at two points: baseline and 6 months post-baseline. The responsiveness&#xD;
      of six PROMIS static forms (physical function [HAQ, PF-10, 10 and 20 item short forms],&#xD;
      fatigue, and pain impact) will be evaluated for change over the 6-month period. Physical&#xD;
      function change scores will be contrasted with established Legacy physical function&#xD;
      instruments. The test of &quot;responsiveness&quot; is defined as the ability of the instrument to&#xD;
      detect change after major treatment intensification, self-reported improvement in&#xD;
      functioning, or positive changes in patient global scores. The order of presentation of forms&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to eliminate questionnaire fatigue or other order effects as&#xD;
      factors. We will also evaluate the test-retest reliability of four PROMIS static forms (HAQ&#xD;
      and PF-10 physical function, fatigue, and pain impact) in a random subsample of patients at&#xD;
      1-week post-baseline. In addition, we will evaluate convergent validity of PROMIS measures of&#xD;
      physical function by comparing self-report with observation of performance of physical&#xD;
      function tasks in a subsample of patients randomly selected from the local geographic region.&#xD;
