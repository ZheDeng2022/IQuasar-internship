      Current therapies for metastatic colorectal cancer only prolong life for approximately 2&#xD;
      years. A more innovative therapy that prolongs life significantly or even cures is needed.&#xD;
      Bone marrow transplantation is a curative therapy for patients with leukemias and lymphomas.&#xD;
      Tumor eradication in the case of transplantation of the patient's own marrow (autologous&#xD;
      transplantation) is based on the intensive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy used for&#xD;
      conditioning. Tumor eradication in the case of transplantation using the marrow of a normal&#xD;
      donor is based on both tumor reduction from conditioning and the immune elimination of tumor&#xD;
      cells by T cells in the donor transplant that recognize the foreign tissue antigens expressed&#xD;
      by the tumor cells and kill these cells. The use of bone marrow transplantation to treat&#xD;
      tumors other than leukemia and lymphoma has been limited, and studies of transplantation of&#xD;
      the patient's own marrow for the treatment of advanced /metastatic breast cancer have not&#xD;
      conclusively shown benefit beyond conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Strober lab developed a preclinical model that effectively treated colon cancer&#xD;
      in mice by combining immunotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation in order to&#xD;
      markedly augment the anti-tumor potency of immunotherapy. They used the CT26 colon cancer as&#xD;
      the therapeutic target either as a single subcutaneous tumor nodule, as a disseminated tumor&#xD;
      in the lungs and peritoneum, or as a metastatic tumor in the liver depending on the route of&#xD;
      administration of the tumor cells in BALB/c mice. Mice were vaccinated mice with established&#xD;
      primary tumors or disseminated/ metastatic disease with irradiated tumor cells mixed with the&#xD;
      adjuvant CpG, and found that vaccination alone had no effect on tumor growth. Similarly&#xD;
      radiation conditioning of tumor bearing hosts followed by transplantation of bone marrow and&#xD;
      spleen cells or purified T cells and hematopoietic stem cells from unvaccinated donors of the&#xD;
      same strain had no effect. In contrast, radiation conditioning of mice followed by&#xD;
      transplantation of hematopoietic and immune cells from donors of the same strain vaccinated&#xD;
      with tumor cells and CpG cured almost all subcutaneous primary as well as disseminated and&#xD;
      metastatic tumors in the hosts. A similar result was obtained after autologous&#xD;
      transplantation of hematopoietic and immune cells from tumor bearing mice that had been&#xD;
      vaccinated after tumor establishment. Investigation of tumor infiltrating cells showed that&#xD;
      the injected donor T cells do not accumulate in the tumors unless the host has been&#xD;
      irradiated before injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this model, we have assembled a team of Stanford University faculty members with&#xD;
      expertise in gastrointestinal cancers, immunotherapy, radiation oncology, and bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation in the Departments of Medicine and Pathology to translate the preclinical&#xD;
      findings into a Phase I safety and feasibility clinical study for the treatment of 10&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Resected tumor cells will be irradiated and mixed&#xD;
      with CpG to create a vaccine. Patients will receive subcutaneous vaccination at weeks 1 and 2&#xD;
      after resection. Six weeks later, immune T cells and then G-CSF &quot;mobilized&quot; purified blood&#xD;
      progenitor cells will be harvested from the blood and cryopreserved. If needed patients will&#xD;
      receive chemotherapy for tumor reduction. When disease is controlled off chemotherapy,&#xD;
      patients will receive a conditioning regimen of fludarabine (30mg/m2 daily x 3 days) followed&#xD;
      by intensive fractionated total body irradiation. The dose of fTBI will be escalated using a&#xD;
      3+3 design to ensure safety and will range from 400 to 800 gray. The patient will then&#xD;
      undergo hematopoietic and immune cell rescue. They will undergo a third vaccination within&#xD;
      7-14 days after transplant. Thereafter, serial monitoring of tumor burden will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune monitoring will occur before and after vaccination as well as after transplantation.&#xD;
      Tests will include in vitro anti-tumor immune responses of T cells (proliferation,&#xD;
      cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion etc.) to stimulation with whole tumor cells and tumor cell&#xD;
      lysates pulsed on to antigen presenting cells, anti-tumor antibody responses, and immune&#xD;
      reconstitution after transplantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As the third most common cancer in incidence and second in mortality, colorectal cancer (CRC)&#xD;
      significantly impacts the lives of many Americans.1 In 2008, it is estimated that 148,810&#xD;
      cases will be diagnosed and 49,960 patients will die from this disease. Approximately 20% of&#xD;
      patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis. The introduction of more effective&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens and biologically targeted agents over the last few years has led to&#xD;
      considerable improvement in treatment options for metastatic CRC yet median survival&#xD;
      approximates only 2 years. Resection of the primary tumor when clinically indicated followed&#xD;
      by combinations of oxaliplatin or irinotecan with intravenous or oral 5-FU, leucovorin, and&#xD;
      bevacizumab for first-line therapy of metastatic CRC is standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004, Goldberg and colleagues established FOLFOX4 as the standard of care chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen in metastatic CRC when they demonstrated its superiority over two older regimens, IFL&#xD;
      (bolus 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan) and IROX (irinotecan/oxaliplatin), in terms of prolonging&#xD;
      median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and increased response.2&#xD;
      FOLFOX4 increased median survival time to 19.5 months compared to 15 months and 17.4 months&#xD;
      for IFL and IROX respectively (p= .0001; HR .66, 95% CI 0.54-0.82). Time to progression was&#xD;
      also significantly increased to 8.7 months compared to 6.9 and 6.5 months (p=.0014).&#xD;
      Furthermore FOLFOX-4 effected a 45% overall response rate compared to 31% (p=.002) and 35%&#xD;
      (p=.03) for IFL and IROX respectively. It also induced significantly less associated grade; 3&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and dehydration than the other two regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hoping to improve this regimen further, capecitabine, an oral pro-drug of 5-FU, was&#xD;
      introduced. It has significant advantages over infusional 5-FU including ease of&#xD;
      administration with its oral formulation, lack of infusion-related toxicities, and decreased&#xD;
      duration of hospitalization and clinic time. Multiple trials have pitted capecitabine-based&#xD;
      therapies against infusional 5-FU regimens and have shown comparable efficacy.3-8 Overall&#xD;
      toxicity profiles are also comparable between the two regimens with the exception of less&#xD;
      myelosuppression and more hand-foot syndrome with capecitabine compared to the&#xD;
      infusional-5-FU-based regimens. Thus, in clinical practice, CAPOX (capecitabine-oxaliplatin)&#xD;
      is largely considered to be a comparable regimen to FOLFOX, with significantly more&#xD;
      convenient administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of targeted therapies that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the 5-FU/LV regimens have further increased&#xD;
      survival. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, was approved for metastatic CRC in&#xD;
      2004 after the pivotal phase III trial, AVF2107g, showed a significant improvement in OS from&#xD;
      15.6 months to 20.3 months (HR for death, 0.66, p &lt;0.001) with the addition of bevacizumab to&#xD;
      IFL.9 PFS and response were also significantly increased from 6.2 months to 10.6 months&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.001) and 34.8% to 44.8% (p= 0.004) respectively. The first phase III trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the combination of bevacizumab with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX-4 or CAPOX),&#xD;
      NO16966, demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab improved PFS by 1.4 months (9.4 vs.&#xD;
      8.0 months, HR 0.83, p=.0023) but overall response rates were similar.10 Median OS also&#xD;
      increased from 19.9 months in the placebo group to 21.3 months in the bevacizumab arm but was&#xD;
      not statistically significant (HR 0.89, p=.077).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab, a mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody to EGFR, has also shown promise in&#xD;
      metastatic CRC.11, 12 The BOND trial, a multicenter randomized phase II trial showed a&#xD;
      significant doubling of response rate and a 2.6 month increase in PFS with the combination of&#xD;
      irinotecan-cetuximab over cetuximab alone in the second line setting, but no difference in&#xD;
      median OS.11 These results led the FDA to approve cetuximab in February 2004 for second-line&#xD;
      treatment either as a monotherapy in those who cannot tolerate irinotecan or in combination&#xD;
      with irinotecan in those who do not have a response to irinotecan alone. The CRYSTAL trial, a&#xD;
      phase III multicenter randomized trial also demonstrated that cetuximab holds promise in the&#xD;
      first line setting.13 In this trial (n=1217), the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI&#xD;
      significantly increased response rate by 6% (46.9% vs. 38.7%, p=0.005) and PFS by 1.9 months&#xD;
      (p=0.036). Trials evaluating the first line use of cetuximab with oxaliplatin-based regimens&#xD;
      appear promising and are ongoing.14, 15 When using cetuximab, the presence of K-RAS mutations&#xD;
      must be considered. Activating mutations in the K-RAS gene are present in 40-45% of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients.16 The presence of these mutations correlates with a worse outcome&#xD;
      and a lack of response to cetuximab in patients with advanced chemotherapy-refractory CRC.17,&#xD;
      18 Even with these new agents and improved combinations, median survival for metastatic CRC&#xD;
      patients remains less than 2 years with less than 5%surviving to 5 years.19 Furthermore, one&#xD;
      can expect 20% of patients to progress within 4-6 months.10 Better regimens and treatments&#xD;
      are greatly needed to impact this pervasive and fatal disease.&#xD;
