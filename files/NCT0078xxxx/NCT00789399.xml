      This trial is a prospective, single-center Phase II randomized study to demonstrate the&#xD;
      superior efficacy of Fondaparinux Sodium subcutaneous injections in patients undergoing CABG&#xD;
      surgery (isolated and redo isolated) versus treatment with placebo. All consecutive patients&#xD;
      scheduled for CABG surgery that meet the general inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be considered for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients will be randomized on the day of admission prior to their CABG surgery&#xD;
      into one of two groups. One group will be randomized to the placebo while the second group&#xD;
      will receive 2.5 mg Fondaparinux Sodium injections. Both groups will receive routine&#xD;
      mechanical prophylaxis as determined by the treating physicians. Group randomized to receive&#xD;
      Fondaparinux Sodium will receive a 2.5 mg SQ daily drug dose starting 12 +/- 2 hours&#xD;
      post-wound closure or the following day in the morning (at the discretion of the&#xD;
      cardiothoracic surgeon). The second dose would be administered 24 hours later and the dosing&#xD;
      will then be once a day. The group randomized to placebo will receive subcutaneous equivolume&#xD;
      isotonic saline at the same time points described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized will receive a 2.5 mg dose of Fondaparinux Sodium or placebo&#xD;
      subcutaneously for a total of 3-9 days post CABG with day 1 being the day of surgery. The&#xD;
      drug will be discontinued if the patient is discharged before day 9. If the patient stays for&#xD;
      more than 9 days inside hospital, a duplex would be obtained per protocol and further DVT&#xD;
      prevention measures would be instituted per the discretion of treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed daily while hospitalized for any symptoms and adverse reactions and&#xD;
      will undergo laboratory testing (CBC, PT/INR, PTT and UA) as specified in the protocol.&#xD;
      Post-op day 3-9(no later than 2 days after the last preventive drug dose) patients will&#xD;
      undergo the protocol specific lower limb venous duplex scan and earlier if symptomatic.&#xD;
      Patients will also be contacted (phone/office visit) for follow-up 25-35 days post CABG to&#xD;
      assess for signs or symptoms of deep venous thrombosis or thromboembolism and for any&#xD;
      potential complications.&#xD;

      Background Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a&#xD;
      formidable risk in view of various predisposing factors including restriction of activity,&#xD;
      history of myocardial infarctions in such patients, presence of multiple predisposing&#xD;
      baseline demographic characteristics and risk factors including advanced age and smoking. The&#xD;
      reported incidence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using duplex ultrasound (DUS)&#xD;
      is significant and varies from 16 to 48%, most of the thrombi being calf vein. (1,2,3) The&#xD;
      incidence of symptomatic VTE based chiefly on retrospective data ranges from 0.5 to 3.9% for&#xD;
      VTE, 0.3 to 0.5% for DVT, 0.2 to 3.9% for PE, and 0.06 to 0.7% for fatal PE. (2-10)The&#xD;
      absolute number of affected patients may be significant since the number of such procedures&#xD;
      performed every year in the US alone is huge. According to the American Heart Association's&#xD;
      Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics - 2008 Update, 469,000 surgical revascularizations were&#xD;
      done in the US in 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients including those with congestive&#xD;
      heart failure have been well demonstrated with up to 60% reduction in VTE risk. (11) The&#xD;
      patients who undergo CABG have similar risk profiles and hence should be evaluated with&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic thromboprophylacic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CABG patients, the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice&#xD;
      Guidelines (8th Edition), 2008, (12) does recommend routine prophylaxis with low molecular&#xD;
      weight heparin (LMWH), low dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), or optimally used bilateral&#xD;
      graduated compression stockings (GCS) or intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). The&#xD;
      guidelines are based on moderate to low quality evidence and the strength of these&#xD;
      recommendations is weak as there have been no randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale In CABG patients, the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines (8th Edition), 2008,(12) recommend routine prophylaxis with LMWH, LDUH,&#xD;
      or optimally used bilateral GCS or IPC. The guidelines are based on moderate to low quality&#xD;
      evidence and the strength of the recommendation is weak as there have been no randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials. Optimally used stockings may not be applicable to many CABG patients&#xD;
      because of saphenous vein harvesting and hence pharmacologic means are preferable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fondaparinux is a pentasaccharide with an efficacy and safeties shown to be equal to or&#xD;
      better than LMWH and thus may be a preferred agent for VTE prophylaxis. (13-18)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of Fondaparinux&#xD;
      Sodium over placebo for the prevention of VTE in Patients undergoing Coronary Bypass Graft&#xD;
      Surgery (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Cumulative incidence of all VTE (defined as symptomatic and asymptomatic deep-vein&#xD;
      thrombosis, fatal and non-fatal pulmonary embolism, or both) up to day 11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary efficacy end-point and VTE up to day 35&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Major bleeding event up to day 11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Safety Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative major and minor bleeding event up to day 11&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deaths, requirement of transfusions and other adverse events up to day 35&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This trial is a phase II, prospective, single-center, assessor and&#xD;
      patient-blinded, placebo controlled, randomized study to demonstrate the superior&#xD;
      thromboprophylactic efficacy of Fondaparinux Sodium subcutaneous injections in patients&#xD;
      undergoing CABG surgery versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The primary efficacy objectives include an assessment of the cumulative rate of&#xD;
      all VTE (defined as DVT or fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism or both) up to 11 days post&#xD;
      CABG. The primary safety objectives include the assessment of the frequency and occurrence of&#xD;
      all major bleeding events post-operatively up to day 3-11. Finally, the secondary efficacy&#xD;
      objective will include cumulative VTE events and assessment of the components of VTE while&#xD;
      the secondary safety objective will include an assessment of the frequency of non-major&#xD;
      bleeding events up to day 3-11 as well as all cause deaths, need for transfusion and other&#xD;
      monitored adverse events till day 35. The inclusion of safety is mainly for descriptive&#xD;
      purposes because the study is not be powered for safety end points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy endpoints will determine Fondaparinux Sodium's ability over placebo&#xD;
      to prevent VTE while assessing the bleeding risk in this study population. A randomized&#xD;
      control is needed because a head to head comparison of Fondaparinux Sodium and placebo is&#xD;
      being planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate time to complete study enrollment is 2 years. This estimation is based on the&#xD;
      number of subjects needed for the study and the rate of CABG surgery performed at the&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
