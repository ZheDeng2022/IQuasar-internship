      Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rationale for Timing of the premeal insulin administration - In type 1 diabetes, very&#xD;
      little, if any, endogenous insulin is available to handle the carbohydrate load which very&#xD;
      rapidly enters the circulation after the start of a meal. In non diabetic individuals, a&#xD;
      complex array of physiological events occurs prior to eating (often called the cephalic phase&#xD;
      of insulin secretion) which prepares the pancreas for immediate release of preformed insulin&#xD;
      when any meal related increase in blood glucose occurs. This rapid insulin secretion prepares&#xD;
      the tissues (primarily muscle and liver) to take up glucose very rapidly and thereby prevent&#xD;
      severe hyperglycemia in the postprandial state. Since significant absorption of all short&#xD;
      acting insulins (e.g. insulin lispro, aspart, or glulisine) from the subcutaneous tissue does&#xD;
      not occur for 15 minutes following injection (26), this delay often results in postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. If the patient happens to be hypoglycemic prior to the meal, this delay can be&#xD;
      advantageous, but if he/she is hyperglycemic, then severe postprandial hyperglycemia may&#xD;
      result. A rationale solution to this problem would be to time the short acting insulin&#xD;
      injection based on the premeal blood glucose, but aside from our one pilot study addressing&#xD;
      this strategy, no clinical study has been published supporting this approach. Our grant&#xD;
      application is designed to correct this deficiency and provide the scientific data to support&#xD;
      this addition to intensive insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We studied the effect of Timing a fixed dose of rapid acting insulin lispro (Humalog™) in&#xD;
      twelve type 1 diabetic subjects who were all made hyperglycemic prior to a standardized&#xD;
      diabetic meal (11). In all studies, the dose of insulin of 0.15U/kg (~10 units) remained&#xD;
      constant and represented a typical dose utilized by type 1 diabetic patients prior to an&#xD;
      evening meal. Each of the twelve diabetic volunteers participated in all four study arms (48&#xD;
      total studies). The insulin lispro was given at the following times: 1) 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
      meal time (-30 minutes), 2) 15 minutes prior to the meal time (-15 minutes), 3) at the meal&#xD;
      (0 minutes), and 4) 15 minutes after the meal was begun (+15 minutes). As is shown in Figure&#xD;
      1, a normal postprandial glucose excursion was observed when the insulin was taken 15 minutes&#xD;
      prior to the meal. No postprandial excursion was observed when the insulin was taken 30&#xD;
      minutes prior to the meal. This is the desirable outcome in a hyperglycemic individual. Of&#xD;
      particular interest is the fact that when the insulin lispro was taken right at mealtime&#xD;
      (which is the most common pattern in type 1 diabetic patients), significant postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia was observed. Figure 2 provides the integrated postprandial glucose excursion&#xD;
      (above and below baseline) over the entire 5½ hour study and reflects the data in Figure 1.&#xD;
      This study strongly supports the injection of insulin lispro at least 15 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      meal when premeal hyperglycemia is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be certain that the absorption of insulin lispro was not different between the four&#xD;
      studies which might account for the difference in postprandial glucose excursion; we measured&#xD;
      free insulin levels during all four research studies. As is shown in Figure 3, when the&#xD;
      insulin excursion concentrations are superimposed on each other for each study, no difference&#xD;
      in insulin absorption occurred between the four insulin administration protocols. This data&#xD;
      strongly supports the concept that timing of the insulin injection prior to the meal has a&#xD;
      major effect on glucose kinetics following a meal. Utilization of Timing in an Intensive&#xD;
      Insulin Therapy regimen should have a major beneficial effect of suppressing postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and reducing A1C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of approximately eight&#xD;
      months duration per patient. The volunteers will be screened and then randomized to either a&#xD;
      Timing protocol (continuing with their Intensive Insulin Therapy regimen) or continuing their&#xD;
      usual Intensive Insulin Therapy. All volunteers will utilize Continuous Glucose Monitoring&#xD;
      every other month in order to provide data on the magnitude of postprandial hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      the incidence of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin Timing Algorithm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our preliminary data (24), we will utilize the following algorithm to time the&#xD;
      premeal insulin administration dose: 1) premeal blood glucose &gt;250 mg/dl = take insulin 30&#xD;
      min before the meal, 2) premeal blood glucose between 250 and 150 mg/dl = take insulin 15&#xD;
      minutes before the start of the meal, 3) premeal blood glucose between 150 and 75 mg/dl =&#xD;
      take insulin at the start of the meal, and 4) premeal blood glucose &lt; 75 = take insulin 15&#xD;
      min after the start of the meal. Participants will remain on their current insulin to&#xD;
      determine if the the timing algorithm is indeed effective. The advantages of this algorithm&#xD;
      are that it is very easy to remember and practical for the typical patient with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. It is designed to keep the glucose between 100 mg/dl and 150 mg/dl. It will reduce&#xD;
      the postprandial glucose excursion when most needed, i.e. when the premeal glucose is&#xD;
      abnormally high and prevent hypoglycemia when the premeal glucose is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our pilot data are the only data available in the literature that assesses the effect of&#xD;
      timing of the pre-prandial short acting insulin dose. As detailed above, this pilot study was&#xD;
      short term so did not include any assessment of changes in A1C. Since A1C is the primary&#xD;
      endpoint in the proposed study, we had to estimate the change in A1C that would have occurred&#xD;
      with the changes we observed in the integrated postprandial excursion (figure 1 above).&#xD;
      Assuming that the postprandial glucose excursion is responsible for 50% of the A1C value&#xD;
      (above the normal concentration of 5.5%) as has been estimated in type 1 diabetic patients&#xD;
      (16,17), then the variance and mean change in integrated glucose excursion was used to&#xD;
      estimate the change in A1C that would be expected in the proposed study. From this data, we&#xD;
      calculated that an improvement of A1C of 1% (the difference in A1C between the control Arm A&#xD;
      and the intervention Arm B would require 16 subjects per group to provide a power of 90% to&#xD;
      detect this difference at a p&lt;0.01. In order to control for a maximum drop out rate of 20%,&#xD;
      we will recruit and randomize a total of 40 volunteers for each group (a total of 80&#xD;
      subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for this study will be the difference in A1C levels between experimental&#xD;
      Arm A (volunteers not utilizing Timing ) and Group B (volunteers utilizing Timing). This&#xD;
      comparison will provide the net effect of Timing and the direct measure of the change in&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycemia. In addition, several sub analyses will be done. This comparison&#xD;
      will control for any positive effects that Continuous Glucose Monitoring may have on A1C. In&#xD;
      addition, we will integrate the area under the five hour postprandial glucose curve as&#xD;
      provided each day by the Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data for the primary meal of the day&#xD;
      (as stated by the patient - usually supper). This data will provide a mechanism of any&#xD;
      improvement in A1C observed. Finally, as an indirect assessment of changes in postprandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, changes in 1, 5-anhydroglucitol (Glycomark™) will be measured every month. We&#xD;
      will utilize an &quot;intention to treat analysis&quot; to analyze the data obtained. Analysis of data&#xD;
      will be done using NCSS computer software (42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If our pilot study is validated by the proposed randomized clinical trial in this grant&#xD;
      application, a new parameter for control of postprandial glucose will become available for&#xD;
      the patient with type 1 diabetes. To date, this concept has not been utilized by healthcare&#xD;
      providers because no one has demonstrated that Timing will result in a reduction of A1C. Our&#xD;
      proposed grant application is designed to obtain the data that will make the use of Timing an&#xD;
      integral part of a glucose control algorithm. Our results are not restricted to type 1&#xD;
      diabetic patients who utilize insulin lispro since all of the short acting insulin analogs&#xD;
      exhibit approximately the same absorption insulin profile (26), Participants will remain on&#xD;
      their current insulin regimen. If our hypothesis is proved correct, i.e., that the correct&#xD;
      Timing of the premeal insulin bolus will reduce the A1C by an average of 1% in type 1&#xD;
      diabetic individuals with A1Cs between 7.0% and 9.0%, then according to data generated by the&#xD;
      Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a significant reduction in the microvascular and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications of diabetes will occur. In addition, the successful completion of&#xD;
      this study will provide a stimulus to examine the Timing of premeal insulin in other groups&#xD;
      of diabetic patients, including type 2 diabetic patients on insulin therapy, pregnant women&#xD;
      with gestational diabetes, and children with type 1 diabetes. Finally, in this day and age of&#xD;
      continuing increases in health care costs, the inclusion of Timing will not add any&#xD;
      additional financial cost to the diabetic patient's intensive insulin therapy regimen.&#xD;
