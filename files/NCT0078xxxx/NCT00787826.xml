             medications, physical examination, and laboratory tests on their charts and be&#xD;
             medically cleared for participation by an investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject must be willing to return for all follow-up visits on days 1 and 2, between&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subject must agree to report any adverse event which may or may not be associated with&#xD;

          3. Clinically significant abnormal lab results including evidence of hepatitis C,&#xD;
             hepatitis B carrier state, or elevated liver function tests (two times the normal&#xD;
             range or at the discretion of the PI).&#xD;
