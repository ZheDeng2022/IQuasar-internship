  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Internet Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (ICDSMP) is a pilot study of our&#xD;
      existing, previous approved, Chronic Disease Self-Management Program Online. The online&#xD;
      programme will be offered to 300 people with chronic disease in South Australia and evaluated&#xD;
      for effectiveness, as well as satisfaction of both the South Australian peer facilitators and&#xD;
      the participants with chronic disease. All participants will be recruited by the State of&#xD;
      South Australia, after which they will complete informed consent and a questionnaire on a&#xD;
      secure website housed at Stanford. They will take a 6-week online self-management program in&#xD;
      groups of 20-25, and they fill our additional online questionnaires at 6 month and one year.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine if the ICDSMP can be effective in the diverse population of South&#xD;
      Australia. We hope that this online workshop will provide South Australians easy access to&#xD;
      the Chronic Disease Self-Management Workshop. If successful, this program or similar programs&#xD;
      could be made broadly available. The workshop being offered on the internet will offer this&#xD;
      program as an alternative mode of service delivery to support self-management education for&#xD;
      chronic diseases and will become an integral part of high quality primary health care in the&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A potential subject will learn of the project through advertisement done by existing&#xD;
           community CDSMP providers or by websites or online newsletter provided by State of South&#xD;
           Australia. The announcements will direct them to the study website at Stanford, where&#xD;
           they will read a description of the project and leave their names and email addresses if&#xD;
           they are interested in participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When enough people are on the wait list to fill an online workshop, Stanford will send&#xD;
           an email with a unique URL for each potential participant to log on, complete the&#xD;
           informed consent, and fill out the baseline questionnaire. They will create their own&#xD;
           username and password during this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Once 24 people have enrolled, they will be assigned to a workshop and receive an email&#xD;
           detailing when the workshop starts and inviting them to log on to familiarize themselves&#xD;
           with the online environment and meet their moderators and other classmates online.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. They will start the 6-week workshop with each session starting a week apart with new&#xD;
           content. They are expected to log on 2-3 times per week, for a total time of about 2&#xD;
           hours. They may log on more often if they wish, and they are not required to log on at&#xD;
           any specific time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The workshop consists of didactic/interactive web pages, 4 discussion boards, an&#xD;
           internal anonymous message center, a section of personalized tools that are available&#xD;
           only to the individual participant and Stanford staff, and a help section. Each workshop&#xD;
           is facilitated by 2 trained peer moderators, supervised by Stanford staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The moderators offer help to those who may be confused by the goal setting exercise, for&#xD;
           example, to give feedback to participants' progress, and to remind people to log on if&#xD;
           they have not. They monitor for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. After the end of the 6-week workshop, participants will be able to log into the workshop&#xD;
           to review the past 6-weeks' participation and print out any useful workshop materials&#xD;
           for future reference&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. 6 months after the end of the 6-week workshop, participants will complete a follow up&#xD;
           questionnaire, and again at 1 year.&#xD;
