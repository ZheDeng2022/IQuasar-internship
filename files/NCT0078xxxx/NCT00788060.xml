  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, Phase Ib study of Sunitinib and RAD001 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      RCC. The study design is a phase I interpatient dose-escalation with a dose expansion at the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with metastatic RCC . In the dose escalation&#xD;
      portion, patients will be treated with sunitinib, given in an intermittent schedule (2 weeks&#xD;
      of daily dosing followed by one week off drug. RAD001 will be given daily. Escalation of both&#xD;
      drugs will occur as tolerated. Treatment will be arbitrarily divided into 3-week cycles, with&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determined by Cycle 2 Day 0.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Escalation of both drugs will occur as tolerated. Treatment will be arbitrarily divided into&#xD;
      3-week cycles, with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determined by Cycle 2 Day 0. Dose levels&#xD;
      will be evaluated one at a time beginning with 3 patients. If 1/3 patients demonstrate DLT&#xD;
      (as defined in section Complete), then enrollment will proceed to the next dose level. 1/3&#xD;
      patients develops a DLT, then 3 more patients will be accrued to this dose level. If 0-1/6&#xD;
      patients demonstrate DLT, then enrollment will proceed to the next dose level. However, if 2&#xD;
      or more patients out of 6 demonstrate DLT at a dose level, then enrollment will proceed at&#xD;
      the next lowest dose level. The highest dose level not resulting in greater than 1/6 DLT will&#xD;
      be considered the MTD. Dose expansion will then proceed at this dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the maximum tolerated dose has been established for this regimen a dose expansion of 20&#xD;
      patients with metastatic RCC will be undertaken. Up to 10 patients with a positive FDG- PET&#xD;
      scan at baseline (defined by 1 or more target lesions demonstrating an SUV &gt; 5.0) will begin&#xD;
      treatment per Figure 2B. Patients 1-10 will begin Sunitinib on Day 0 and begin RAD001 on Day&#xD;
      14 after repeat FDG-PET scan. Patients 11-20, will have a 2 week lead-in period of RAD001 and&#xD;
      will begin Sunitinib 2 weeks later on Day 0. After repeat FDG-PET scan. Both groups of&#xD;
      patients will repeat PET scan at Day 14 of cycle 2. Patients with negative FDG PET scans (SUV&#xD;
      &lt; 5.0 in all lesions) will not undergo repeat scanning. Patients will undergo evaluations for&#xD;
      tumor response every 12 weeks with appropriate measurement studies (CT, MRI, bone scan). In&#xD;
      the setting of a mixed response (progressive disease in 1 or more lesions but continued&#xD;
      regression or stable disease below baseline in other lesions) patients may continue on study&#xD;
      if it is determined by the PI, treating physician and patient that there is ongoing clinical&#xD;
      benefit to the patient.&#xD;
