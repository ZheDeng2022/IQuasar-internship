    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study that used both an&#xD;
      active control (fexofenadine) and a placebo control to evaluate desloratadine 5 mg once daily&#xD;
      during a 15-day treatment period. The active treatments and placebo were allocated in a 2:2:1&#xD;
      ratio.&#xD;

             to record symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant medications, and&#xD;
             adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have met the following at the Screening Visit: total symptom score (TSS) of 6 or&#xD;
             greater (not including congestion), with 2 or more symptoms rated as moderate (2) or&#xD;
             severe (3) and no symptom rated as very severe (4) during the 12 hours prior to this&#xD;
             visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have met the following on the morning of the Baseline Visit: symptom severity score 7&#xD;
