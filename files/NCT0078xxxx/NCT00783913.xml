      This study will determine if electrical brain stimulation during movement practice can&#xD;
      improve the ability of stroke patients to reach for objects more than movement practice&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 85 years old who have had a stroke may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of two study groups: movement training with active&#xD;
      (tDCS) or movement training with sham (tDCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo 1-hour movement training and (tDCS) sessions twice a day, 5 days a&#xD;
      week, for 3 weeks. For these sessions, subjects will sit in front of a computer screen that&#xD;
      shows a target (round dots) and a cursor (a line). Participants will be instructed to move&#xD;
      the cursor to various targets on the computer screen as fast and as accurately as possible,&#xD;
      controlling the position of the cursor by moving their arm, which will rest on a mechanical&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive real or sham (tDCS) during the movement training sessions. For&#xD;
      (tDCS), electrode sponges soaked in tap water are placed on the scalp and forehead. A small&#xD;
      electrical current is passed between the electrodes. The stimulation lasts 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have the following tests four times during the study - 1) before starting&#xD;
      movement training 2) (tDCS) during the course of training and (tDCS), 3) after completing&#xD;
      training and (tDCS), 4) and 3 months after completing training and (tDCS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of&#xD;
      the brain. Functional MRI (fMRI) shows what parts of the brain are used when a task is&#xD;
      performed. For the test, the subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the&#xD;
      scanner. A computer screen can be seen from inside the scanner. During the scan, subjects may&#xD;
      be asked to do the study task or to lie still for up to 20 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement and function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of arm stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moving the arms actively and against resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Picking up objects and moving them as quickly as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing daily living tasks like buttoning, dressing and walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing tasks while wearing a glove that monitors the position of the arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completing questionnaires on ability to perform daily activities or other movements and&#xD;
           level of tiredness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS uses a magnet to stimulate the brain in way that is different from (tDCS). This study&#xD;

      Individuals who have suffered a stroke may benefit from the development of new rehabilitative&#xD;
      interventions that can improve motor recovery after a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that active training on a complex&#xD;
      upper extremity visuomotor task combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) used to activate the affected hemisphere improves functionality during reaching of the&#xD;
      affected upper-extremity in comparison to training combined with sham tDCS in stroke&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include chronic (more than 3 months) stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a factorial design in which all subjects will undergo several sessions&#xD;
      of complex visuomotor task training of the upper extremity. One half of the patients will&#xD;
      undergo anodal transcranial direct current stimulation during the first 20 minutes of each&#xD;
      training session, while the control subjects will have sham stimulation applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for the study is accuracy during completion of a reaching task.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint for the study will be the end of 3 weeks of training (15 days).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint measures include timing of reach, kinematic, and functional measures.&#xD;
      These measures will be taken at the end of training and at a 3 month follow-up.&#xD;
