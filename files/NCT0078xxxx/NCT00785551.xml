  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 ml/min or &gt;50&#xD;
      to 80 ml/min, respectively) on the pharmacokinetic profile of quinine and its active&#xD;
      metabolite, 3'-hydroxyquinine, will be investigated. Safety and tolerability in healthy&#xD;
      subjects versus those with mild to moderate renal impairment will be compared, as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since many of the adverse events associated with quinine are dose-related, it is important to&#xD;
      consider how varying degrees of renal dysfunction alter quinine pharmacokinetics possibly&#xD;
      warranting dosage adjustment in these patients. This study will compare the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of quinine in patients with normal, mild or moderate renal impairment. Eighteen non-smoking&#xD;
      males and female volunteers between 18-65 years of age weighing at least 60 kg with BMI&#xD;
      between 18- 40 kg/m2 will be divided into 3 groups of 6 subjects each based on renal function&#xD;
      as defined (6 normal, 6 mild impairment, 6 moderate impairment). Subjects will be confined to&#xD;
      the study unit during the entire 5 day study period beginning on the evening of Day -3. To&#xD;
      confirm renal function classification, creatinine clearance will be measured via 24-hour&#xD;
      urine collection from 7am Day -2 until 7am Day -1. On day 1, after a fast of at least 8&#xD;
      hours, each patient will receive a single 648 mg dose of quinine sulfate. Blood and urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      quinine and its active metabolite, 3'-hydroxyquinine) in the three study groups. Subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored regarding adverse effects throughout study participation.&#xD;
