  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, it is not clear whether the gene expression&#xD;
      profile exhibited by circulated peripheral blood cells and that expressed by the inflamed&#xD;
      synovium mirror one another. Understanding this relationship would be useful not only in&#xD;
      potentially having a relatively non-invasive means to predict response to therapy but it&#xD;
      might be useful in better understanding differences in RA expression amongst patients with&#xD;
      this disease, thus perhaps assisting in target identification through a better understanding&#xD;
      of disease processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting approximately&#xD;
      1% of the adult population. The disease is characterised by inflammation of synovial tissue&#xD;
      (ST) in multiple joints, which often leads to destruction of joint integrity, contributing to&#xD;
      serious functional impairment and disability. The contributors to its pathology include joint&#xD;
      inflammation, abnormal cellular and humoral responses, and synovial hyperplasia.&#xD;
      Ultrasonography is a powerful, non-invasive, and feasible way to evaluate synovial&#xD;
      hyperplasia and guide its collection by biopsy.&#xD;
