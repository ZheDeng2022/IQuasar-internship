      Many people who are obese also have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes-all&#xD;
      conditions that can increase the risk of heart disease. This study will evaluate two programs&#xD;
      that aim to encourage weight loss among obese people who are at risk for developing heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes are all conditions that increase a&#xD;
      person's risk of developing heart disease. Many people with these conditions are also&#xD;
      overweight, and it is recommended that such people lose weight to reduce their risk of heart&#xD;
      disease. Previous weight loss studies have mainly examined in-person weight loss programs and&#xD;
      not Web- or e-mail-based weight loss programs. In addition, the primary care providers of&#xD;
      participants in these previous studies typically had no direct involvement in the programs.&#xD;
      This study will compare two weight loss programs-an In-Person Directed (IPD) program, which&#xD;
      is primarily comprised of in-person visits with health counselors, and a Call-Center Directed&#xD;
      (CCD) program, which uses only telephone, Web sites, and e-mail to contact and counsel&#xD;
      participants. These two programs will also be compared against a self-directed weight loss&#xD;
      program, which will act as a control group. The ultimate purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the IPD, CCD, and self-directed programs at increasing weight loss and&#xD;
      reducing risk factors in obese people at risk of developing heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll overweight adults who have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or&#xD;
      diabetes. Participants will attend a baseline study visit for weight and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements. They will then be randomly assigned to participate in one of the following&#xD;
      three programs for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. IPD Program: This program will be directed by health counselors from Johns Hopkins&#xD;
           University. For Months 1 to 3, participants will attend a group or individual meeting&#xD;
           with a counselor each week. For Months 4 to 6, meetings will be held three times a&#xD;
           month; after Month 6, meetings will occur twice a month. Some of these meetings may be&#xD;
           held over the phone or by e-mail. Participants will keep a food and exercise diary and&#xD;
           they will enter their weight and calorie consumption on the study Web site. Study&#xD;
           researchers will provide participants' doctors with relevant information on&#xD;
           participants' weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CCD Program: This program will be directed by counselors from Healthways, Inc., a&#xD;
           company that assists individuals in managing their medical problems. All contacts will&#xD;
           occur by phone, e-mail, or the Web; there will be no in-person visits. Participants will&#xD;
           be able to review weight loss information on the study Web site. For Months 1 to 3,&#xD;
           participants will contact their counselors each week. For Months 4 to 6, contact with&#xD;
           study counselors will occur at least once a month; after Month 6, contact with study&#xD;
           counselors will occur every other month. Participants will keep a food and exercise&#xD;
           diary and they will enter their weight and calorie consumption on the study Web site.&#xD;
           Study researchers will provide participants' doctors with relevant information on&#xD;
           participants' weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-Directed Program: In this program, study staff will meet with participants once at&#xD;
           the beginning of the study, at which time participants will receive written information&#xD;
           about losing weight. Participants will also receive access to a study Web site that has&#xD;
           information about weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend study visits at Months 6, 12, and 24 and at the end of the&#xD;
      study, which is anticipated to be in February 2011. Study researchers will also collect&#xD;
      information by phone at Month 18. At each study visit, participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires; provide blood samples; and undergo measurements of weight, waist, and blood&#xD;
      pressure. A portion of blood may be stored for future studies; this will be optional.&#xD;
