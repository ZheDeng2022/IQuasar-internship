      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and tolerability of an experimental&#xD;
      drug, Chemophase, a combination of recombinant human hyaluronidase, (an investigational&#xD;
      synthetic enzyme also known as rHuPH20), and mitomycin (MMC) in the treatment of superficial&#xD;
      bladder cancer when instilled intravesically immediately after TURBT (transurethral resection&#xD;
      of bladder tumor).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened and enrolled prior to undergoing standard of care TURBT for known&#xD;
      or suspected Stage Ta, T1 or Tis bladder cancer of any histological grade requiring TURBT and&#xD;
      who are believed to be candidates for IPOP intravesical chemotherapy regardless of the need&#xD;
      for further intravesical therapy. Within 6 hours after completion of TURBT, patients will be&#xD;
      administered a single IPOP intravesical instillation of Chemophase with a one-hour dwell&#xD;
      time. At the end of the one-hour dwell time, the patient will be asked to fully void or, if&#xD;
      an intravesical catheter has been left in place, the bladder will be fully drained via the&#xD;
      catheter. Patients will return at 1 and 2 weeks post instillation for follow up visits for&#xD;
      safety and for a cystoscopy at day 85 (per standard of care). Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      assessed through physical examinations, vital signs, cystoscopy, hematology (CBC), adverse&#xD;
      event reporting, and measurements of plasma levels of MMC.&#xD;
