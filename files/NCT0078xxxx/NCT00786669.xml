    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and of adding bevacizumab to the&#xD;
      established regimen of vincristine, oral irinotecan, and temozolomide (VOIT) and see what&#xD;
      effects it has in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A recent Children's Oncology Group study evaluated the 3-drug combination of vincristine,&#xD;
      oral irinotecan, and temozolomide (VOIT), and found it to be safe and tolerable in pediatric&#xD;
      patients. This VOIT regimen may be useful for a variety of childhood cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data suggests that the beneficial effects of irinotecan can be improved by giving&#xD;
      it with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works against a protein called&#xD;
      &quot;vascular endothelial growth factor&quot; (VEGF). In cancer treatment, it is used to reduce tumor&#xD;
      growth by blocking the formation of new blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the drugs used in this study have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for use in adults with certain cancer types. However, the combination of drugs in this&#xD;
      study is considered experimental because the FDA has not approved them to be used together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each drug has been given by itself to children before, and the combination of temozolomide,&#xD;
      irinotecan, and vincristine has been given to children in more than one clinical trial. This&#xD;
      is the first study in which all four of the drugs (vincristine, oral irinotecan,&#xD;
      temozolomide, and bevacizumab) will be given together to children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 pediatric patients will receive therapy. The previously established bevacizumab dose&#xD;
      of 15 mg/kg will be administered by intravenous infusion on day 1 at the start of every&#xD;
      3-week course. Intravenous vincristine will be given on day 1, oral irinotecan on days 1-5,&#xD;
      and oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Courses will be repeated as frequently as every three&#xD;
      weeks in patients who do not have evidence of disease progression and who have adequate&#xD;
      recovery from previous courses. Cephalosporin antibiotics will be used to reduce&#xD;
      irinotecan-associated diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored on the study for toxicity and response for up to 6 courses.&#xD;
