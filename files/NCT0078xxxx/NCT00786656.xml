      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Studies suggest that cancer patients diagnosed and treated in a facility with&#xD;
           multi-specialty care and clinical research may live longer and have a better quality of&#xD;
           life than patients treated elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NCI Community Cancer Centers Pilot Program (NCCCP) is a 3-year program to test the&#xD;
           concept of a national network of community cancer centers to expand cancer research and&#xD;
           deliver the most advanced cancer care to Americans in their own communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pilot program includes a survey of cancer patients receiving care at the pilot&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain an understanding of the experiences of adult patients who receive services at&#xD;
           the NCCCP pilot sites and assess if and how their experience changes over the study&#xD;
           period. Data about the following are collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients information needs and awareness of the NCCCP program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical trials experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Access to health care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perspectives on patient-provider communication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experiences with patient navigation, self-management, medical decision-making and&#xD;
           survivorship&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction with care and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 21 years or older at the time of diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment at the cancer center for at least 3 months since July 1, 2007&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants complete a 25-minute questionnaire covering the care they received at their&#xD;
           cancer center, their experience with making medical appointments and how long they&#xD;
           waited to see the doctor. The survey includes information on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Services at the cancer center&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Getting needed care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assistance for patients and their families&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Communication with the cancer care team&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care after finishing treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health and medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Background information (demographics)&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Community Cancer Centers Pilot Program (NCCCP), http://ncccp.cancer.gov, is a&#xD;
      three-year pilot program to test the concept of a national network of community cancer&#xD;
      centers to expand cancer research and deliver the latest, most advanced cancer care to a&#xD;
      greater number of Americans in the communities in which they live.The pilot program is&#xD;
      designed to encourage the collaboration of private-practice medical, surgical, and radiation&#xD;
      oncologists, with close links to NCI research and to the network of 63 NCI-designated cancer&#xD;
      Centers principally based at large research universities. NCI contracted with RTI&#xD;
      International (ww.rti.org) to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the NCCCP pilot program&#xD;
      using multiple methodologies, including a survey of cancer patients receiving care at the&#xD;
      pilot sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the patient survey is to gain an understanding of the clinical experiences of&#xD;
      adult patients who receive services at the NCCCP pilot sites and to assess if and how their&#xD;
      experience change over the pilot period. Specifically, the survey instrument seeks to collect&#xD;
      data about patients information needs and awareness of the NCCCP program; clinical trials&#xD;
      experience; access to health care; perspectives on patient-provider communication; and&#xD;
      experiences with patient navigation, self-management, medical decision making, and&#xD;
      survivorship; as well as their satisfaction with care and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the ten participating Centers will create a de-identified electronic file of all&#xD;
      patients who meet the inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. living patients who are listed on a NCCCP site s cancer registry;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cancer patients age 21 years and older at the time of sampling; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. cancer patients who had 1or more cancer treatment outpatient visits at their Cancer&#xD;
           Center since July 1, 2007 for the 1st round of data collection, and since July 1, 2009&#xD;
           for the second data collection. Center will create this file using their cancer registry&#xD;
           and assign each individual a unique identification (ID) number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each file containing the universe of eligible patients will be sent to RTI, from which 475&#xD;
      patients from each Center s list will be randomly selected. RTI will send a list back to each&#xD;
      Center indicating which 475 patient IDs were selected for inclusion in the survey. The Center&#xD;
      staff will match selected patient back to their master list using the Study ID number to&#xD;
      identify patients included in the survey. RTI will deliver 475 pre-paid patient survey&#xD;
      packets to each Center. The packets will include all required items except a Patient&#xD;
      Notification Letter, which is a cover letter introducing the study and provides instructions&#xD;
      on how to complete the survey. To protect patient privacy, Center staff will be responsible&#xD;
      for generating the mailing labels and personalized Patient Notification Letter, and mailing&#xD;
      the packets.&#xD;
