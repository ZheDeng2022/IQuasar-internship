      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from DNA or a gene-modified virus may help the body build an&#xD;
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as imiquimod, may&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Applying&#xD;
      topical imiquimod to the cervix may be an effective treatment for cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia. Giving vaccine therapy together with imiquimod may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy and&#xD;
      to see how well it works when given with or without imiquimod in treating patients with grade&#xD;
      3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety, tolerability, and feasibility of pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA&#xD;
           vaccine and TA-HPV vaccine with or without imiquimod in patients with human&#xD;
           papillomavirus (HPV)16-positive grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of this regimen on histology, based on the regression of cervical&#xD;
           intraepithelial neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility and safety of study immunotherapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the quantitative changes in cervical HPV viral load in these patients&#xD;
           following study immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in lesion size.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cellular and humoral immune response to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate local tissue immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate measures of immune response with clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate measures of immune response with those observed in the preclinical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate if the efficacy of the prime-boost vaccination can be improved with the&#xD;
           cervical application of imiquimod.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of TA-HPV vaccine (groups 1-3 only). Patients are&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 5 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 1-3: Patients receive pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA vaccine intramuscularly&#xD;
           (IM) in weeks 0 and 4 and TA-HPV vaccine IM in week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Patients receive topical imiquimod applied to the cervix once in weeks 0, 4,&#xD;
           and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 5: Patients receive pNGVL4a-Sig/E7(detox)/HSP70 DNA vaccine and TA-HPV vaccine as&#xD;
           in groups 1-3, and imiquimod as in group 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients experiencing no improvement of their lesions at week 15 undergo standard cone&#xD;
      resection of the squamocolumnar junction. If there is either 1) regression of the size of the&#xD;
      lesions by colposcopy and/or 2) no CIN3 lesions detected by colposcopy/biopsy and Pap smear&#xD;
      and/or 3) significant decrease of HPV viral load, patients are followed until week 28. At&#xD;
      that time, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) resection is performed if there is&#xD;
      a CIN3 lesion detected by colposcopy/biopsy or suspected by Pap smear. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      LEEP are followed until week 32. Patients not undergoing LEEP are followed until week 41 to&#xD;
      confirm CIN3 regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tissue samples are collected periodically to measure immune response via ELISA,&#xD;
      determine viral load and identify co-infecting HPV types via reverse-line blotting, and&#xD;
      analyze lymphocytes via flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients (3 in groups 1 and 2, 12 in groups 3 and 5, and 6&#xD;
      in group 4) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
