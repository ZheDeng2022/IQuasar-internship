    <textblock>
      This study will look at how tumors in the chest and abdomen move when you breathe. Your&#xD;
      doctors are studying if extra 4D CT scans and instructions on how to breathe can help predict&#xD;
      this type of movement and improve the accuracy of radiation treatment. 4D CT scans are&#xD;
      approved by the FDA. A 4D CT scan is different from a regular CT because it moves slower and&#xD;
      takes more pictures. It takes pictures of the way your body moves when you breathe. This&#xD;
      gives doctors more pictures of your body so that they can match your pictures to the way you&#xD;
      breathe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, instructions on how to breathe will be visual and audio. Visual instructions&#xD;
      will be given to you on a computer screen. You will hear audio instructions through a&#xD;
      speaker.&#xD;

      JUSTIFICATION Among the various sites affected by cancer, statistics show that lung cancer is&#xD;
      the leading cause of death among both men and women. One major reason for this is that the&#xD;
      treatment of lung cancer has not improved drastically in the past few years. Lung tumors are&#xD;
      also potentially difficult to treat with radiation therapy due the patients' respiration&#xD;
      motion causing the tumor to be mobile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1) Detrimental effects of respiration motion Respiration motion affects all tumor sites in&#xD;
      the thorax and abdomen, although the disease of most prevalence and relevance for&#xD;
      radiotherapy is lung cancer. Many studies have been performed to study lung-tumor motion and&#xD;
      methods to compensate for this motion during radiation treatment imaging, planning and&#xD;
      delivery. The significance of the respiration motion compensation techniques is to reduce the&#xD;
      mobility of the tumors and thereby reduce the dose to the surrounding normal structures. If&#xD;
      no motion compensation methods are used then a margin must be added to ensure adequate&#xD;
      coverage of the tumor. Large margins results in radiation delivered to a larger volume of&#xD;
      critical structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2) Compensation techniques Methods that reduce respiration induced intrafraction motion&#xD;
      include active breathing control, voluntary breath-hold, deep inspiration breath-hold,&#xD;
      respiratory gated techniques, and 4D or tumor-tracking techniques.1-6 Active breathing&#xD;
      control and the deep inspiration breath hold involves the patient holding their breath. While&#xD;
      these may improve the reproducibility of the position of the tumor within the lung, it is not&#xD;
      feasible for all patients especially those that have a compromised respiratory function.&#xD;
      Respiratory gating techniques involves turning on the beam during only a small window of the&#xD;
      respiratory cycle. Thus respiratory gating reduces the intrafraction motion but does not&#xD;
      totally eliminate it. During respiratory gating, since the beam is turned on and off based on&#xD;
      the respiration signal, the treatment time may increase up to 35-40% compared to a regular&#xD;
      treatment. Since the patient has to spend more time on the table, this could introduce more&#xD;
      errors due to patient movement on the table. 4D or tumor tracking techniques has it own share&#xD;
      of issues as is discussed in the following paragraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A3) During 4D radiotherapy (4DRT) delivery the tumor is continuously tracked with the&#xD;
      radiation beam as they move throughout the respiratory cycle. The benefits of 4DRT are a&#xD;
      reduction in dose to the healthy lung tissue and/or an increase in dose to the tumor. The&#xD;
      gains from 4DRT are clinically measurable, though much development is needed in the various&#xD;
      steps of 4DRT i.e. CT image acquisition, planning and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 4D CT image acquisition, images are acquired during different respiration states of&#xD;
      normal breathing.7-9 The quality of images acquired by using the 4D CT image acquisition is&#xD;
      limited by patients respiration pattern. Since the images are sorted based on the patients&#xD;
      respiration motion, any change in pattern could lead to the images being sorted to a&#xD;
      different part of respiration. This effect is reflected as an artifact on the CT image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target volumes along with respiration motion can be determined by contouring the target in&#xD;
      the various respiratory states thus obtaining a volume that encompasses an entire breathing&#xD;
      cycle. The efficacy and accuracy of 4D CT will be maximized when patients breathe&#xD;
      reproducibly. However it is well-known that respiration motion varies not only from one day&#xD;
      to the next but also during one fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A4) Effect of irregular breathing For 4D CT, minimizing the variation of patient breathing&#xD;
      within a treatment fraction and from fraction to fraction, i.e., increasing the&#xD;
      reproducibility of patient breathing, is important. Large variation in patient respiration&#xD;
      motion and irregular breathing lead to artifacts in the CT images as shown in. However,&#xD;
      respiration motion amplitude and period vary with time and from patient to patient because of&#xD;
      various anatomic and physiologic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A5) Possible solutions Biofeedback/coaching techniques are being increasingly embedded in the&#xD;
      behavioral treatment of patients with lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. For respiratory gating, several studies suggest that&#xD;
      verbal prompts improve respiration reproducibility. Kini et al.12 concluded that audio&#xD;
      prompts improve the stability of respiration frequency of the patient but does not maintain&#xD;
      the range of respiratory motion, whereas visual prompts control only the regularity of the&#xD;
      displacement and the frequency is not reproducible. Based on the results of Kini et al.12,&#xD;
      combined audio-visual biofeedback was devised to improve the reproducibility of respiration&#xD;
      motion. Recently Neicu et al.13 described results of audio and visual prompting and&#xD;
      demonstrated improvement in the efficacy of so-called synchronized moving aperture radiation&#xD;
      therapy, using respiratory traces from single-patient and volunteer sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      George et al.14 concluded based on a 24-patient, multisession study that audio-visual&#xD;
      biofeedback can significantly reduce residual motion variability for a given duty cycle, thus&#xD;
      potentially improving the accuracy of respiratory-gating. From the results of this study it&#xD;
      was seen that audio-visual biofeedback reduced motion by 0.5 cm (0.29 to 0.24 cm) for exhale&#xD;
      breathing and 1.5 cm (0.46 to 0.36 cm) for inhale breathing.&#xD;
