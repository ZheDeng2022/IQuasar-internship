    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of (a) quetiapine XR and (b) mirtazapine&#xD;
      on sleep when given as an antidepressant (monotherapy). We hypothesize that (a) quetiapine XR&#xD;
      has an immediate and lasting positive effect on sleep in depressed patients which does not&#xD;
      differ from the impact of mirtazapine on sleep in this group of patients; (b) in the context&#xD;
      of a secondary objective, we expect an antidepressant effect of quetiapine XR which is&#xD;
      equivalent to that of mirtazapine.&#xD;
