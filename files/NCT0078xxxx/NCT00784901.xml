      Purpose: To study the associations between visual functions and the retinal tomography&#xD;
      detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: retrospective, non-randomized and non-comparable study Material: Medical&#xD;
      recordings of the RP patients who visited the Out-Patient Department of Ophthalmology in NTUH&#xD;
      during June, 2003 to June, 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: By reviewing charts of the RP patients, the investigators will categorize RP&#xD;
      patients into different types according to the loci of the pathological change in their&#xD;
      retina evaluated by opththaomoscopy. And the investigators will collect the data of their&#xD;
      visual functions including visual acuity, visual field, Arden ratio of electrooculography,&#xD;
      and color sense discrimination. Then, according to the OCT map, the investigators will&#xD;
      analyze the retinal thickness by dividing the macular area into foveal area, inner ring and&#xD;
      outer ring. Finally, the investigators will analyze the relationships between visual&#xD;
      functions and retinal thickness in different macular areas in different types of RP patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: The investigators expect that retinal tomographies may different among&#xD;
      different types of RP. And the retinal tomographic change may correspond to the change of a&#xD;
      certain kind of visual function. Hence, according to the thickness of a specific area in&#xD;
      macula, the investigators may anticipate that some visual dysfunction may exist.&#xD;

      The diagnosis of RP was according to the typical clinical history of night blindness,&#xD;
      characteristically findings of &quot;bone-spicule&quot; change in the fundus, and varying degrees of&#xD;
      peripheral visual field constriction. According to the affected loci in the fundus, we&#xD;
      defined a typical type of RP as the retinal pathological change was around the banded area&#xD;
      outside the main vascular arcs, and a central variant of RP stood for those with bone-spicule&#xD;
      change appeared at the macula.[17] The exclusion criteria included eyes with histories of&#xD;
      trauma, intraocular laser treatment, intraocular surgery, presence of retinal diseases, high&#xD;
      degree of myopia with refraction more minus than -8.0 D or hyperopia with refraction more&#xD;
      than +5.0 D. Patients with systemic diseases that may affect retina like diabetes or&#xD;
      hypertension were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity was examined with a Snellen visual chart with a calibrated luminance. Then&#xD;
      according to the equation that Snellen VA equals to 1/MAR (MAR= minimal angle of resolution),&#xD;
      Snellen VA was converted into logMAR for statistics. For calculation, visual acuity of hand&#xD;
      motion was converted into 20/2000 and light perception was converted into 20/20000 of Snellen&#xD;
      fraction. Visula field examination was evaluated using Goldmann kinetic perimetry with&#xD;
      varying sizes and illuminations of testing light spots. Then the degree of the widest visual&#xD;
      field isopter was recorded. EOG: is used to assess function of retinal pigment epithelium.&#xD;
      During dark adaptation, resting potential decreases slightly and reaches a minimum (&quot;dark&#xD;
      trough&quot;). When the light is on, the resting potential increases (&quot;light peak&quot;). The ratio of&#xD;
      light peak voltage versus dark trough voltage is known as the Arden ratio. The EOG was&#xD;
      performed with pupil dilated, first in the dark for 15 minutes, and then in the light for 15&#xD;
      minutes and the Arden ratio for analysis was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color sense discrimination test was evaluated using Farnsworth Munsell 100-Hue test (Munsell&#xD;
      FM 100, X-Rite, USA). Each patient arranged four trays of colored caps in hue order. There is&#xD;
      a predetermined sequence for each tray. The closer the patient's arrangement is to the&#xD;
      correct sequence, the better the patient's color sense discrimination. The Farnsworth-Munsell&#xD;
      100-Hue Test Scoring Software was used to score the results of Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue&#xD;
      Test. The results are displayed in polar or linear format, and the total error score was&#xD;
      recorded for calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT was performed with the ultimate commercial OCT units (OCT3, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc,&#xD;
      Dublin, CA) to measure the macular thickness under papillary dilatation by an experienced&#xD;
      examiner. The retinal thickness was calculated using OCT retinal mapping software (version&#xD;
      6.1 a), which measured thickness of nine divided macular regions after six scans with 6 mm&#xD;
      long centered on the patient's fixation point by means of an inner fixation target (Figure&#xD;
      1), and expressed as a color-coded map. Internal fixation was essentially chosen due to&#xD;
      better reproducibility. We defined the foveal area as the area centered at fixation with a&#xD;
      diameter of one millimeter, the inner ring as the area between circles with diameter of one&#xD;
      and three millimeters, and outer ring as the area between circles with diameter of three and&#xD;
      six millimeters (Figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We analyzed and compared the patients' characteristics, results of visual function tests and&#xD;
      macular tomography in these two groups of RP. Then we tried to find out if there were&#xD;
      correlations between macular tomography and visual function tests&#xD;
