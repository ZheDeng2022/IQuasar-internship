      Data will be extracted from the NTUH medical records database, geocoded according to the&#xD;
      street address so that the case number, incidence, etc could be mapped. The spatial data&#xD;
      would be used to detect aggregation of TB cases, existence of &quot;hot spots&quot; and then determine&#xD;
      if they may merit further investigation or may have occurred by chance. The results from&#xD;
      these GIS-based analyses would address local variations in TB incidence and transmission.&#xD;

      This is a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based retrospective study. Data will be&#xD;
      extracted from the NTUH medical records database, including the date of notification, sex,&#xD;
      birth date, residence address, etc of each tuberculosis case. Each case will be geocoded to&#xD;
      generate spatial coordinates for mapping purpose based on the street address and postal code.&#xD;
      To protect the privacy of these patients, the personal identification data of TB patients,&#xD;
      including name and ID numbers, will not be encoded. The encoded data file will also be&#xD;
      strictly kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease mapping is the usual means of presenting descriptive geographic data on disease&#xD;
      occurrence and creating accurate maps of disease morbidity and mortality. Maps convey instant&#xD;
      visual information on the spatial distribution of disease and can identify subtle patterns&#xD;
      which may be missed in tabular presentations. The purpose is to display variations in&#xD;
      ill-health (for example, related to the underlying sociodemography), formulate etiologic&#xD;
      hypotheses, aid surveillance to detect areas of high disease incidence, and help place&#xD;
      specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In detecting the spatial patterns of the points geocoded from the addresses, point pattern&#xD;
      analytical methods are used. Quadrat Analysis is one of them. This method evaluates a case&#xD;
      distribution by examining how its density changes over space. The density measured by Quadrat&#xD;
      Analysis is then compared with the density of a theoretically constructed random pattern to&#xD;
      see if the case distribution in question is more clustered or more dispersed than the random&#xD;
      pattern. Another one is Nearest Neighbor Statistic, which is derived from the average&#xD;
      distance between cases and each of their nearest neighbors and captures information on cases&#xD;
      between quadrats. Using ordered neighbor statistic can evaluate the pattern at different&#xD;
      spatial scales. A case pattern is said to be more clustered if its observed average distance&#xD;
      between nearest neighbors is found to be less than that of a random pattern. Ripley's K&#xD;
      statistic is an extension of the ordered neighbor statistics, which can be used to depict the&#xD;
      randomness of a case distribution over different spatial scales and capture the&#xD;
      characteristic of local variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure and test how dispersed/clustered the case locations are with respect to their&#xD;
      attribute values, e.g. socioeconomic status, spatial autocorrelation can be performed. If&#xD;
      significant positive spatial autocorrelation exists in a case distribution, cases with&#xD;
      similar characteristics tend to be near each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For polygon data in interval or ratio form, such as the tuberculosis incidence of different&#xD;
      districts, Moran's I index, Geary's Ratio and the G-statistic can be used. Moran's I uses the&#xD;
      mean of the attribute's data values as the benchmark for comparison when neighboring values&#xD;
      are evaluated; Geary's Ratio is based on a direct comparison of neighboring values;&#xD;
      G-statistic is based on the concept of spatial association or cross-product statistics and is&#xD;
      capable of detecting the presence of hot spots or cold spots. In case of spatial&#xD;
      heterogeneity, i.e. the magnitude of spatial autocorrelation varies over space, modified&#xD;
      versions of the previous three statistics can be used to evaluate spatial association at the&#xD;
      local scale.&#xD;
