      The purpose of this study will be to establish the safety profile and the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of the anti-VEGFR-1 monoclonal antibody IMC-18F1 administered weekly, every other&#xD;
      week, or every three weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to&#xD;

    <description>Cohorts 1-4 will receive IMC-18F1 intravenously for 4 weekly infusions, followed by a 2-week observation period. Cohort 5 will receive IMC-18F1 intravenously every other week for the first 6 weeks of therapy. Cohort 6 will receive IMC-18F1 every 3 weeks for the first 6 weeks for therapy. The starting dose in Cohort 1 will be 2mg/kg. The maximum dose of IMC-18F1 will not exceed 16mg/kg administered every week, 15mg/kg administered every other week, and 20mg/kg administered every 3 weeks. Dose escalation of 100% (2 x previous dose) if no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed in the first three patients within a cohort during the initial 6-week therapy period. Dose escalation increment will be reduced to 50% (1.5 x previous dose) following the occurrence of either grade 2 or higher AEs in 2 or more patients that are possibly, probably, or definitely-related to study medication or one DLT during the initial 6-week therapy period. No intrapatient dose escalation is allowed.</description>
