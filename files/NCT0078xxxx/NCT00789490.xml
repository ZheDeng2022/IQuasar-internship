  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficiencies of iron and folic acid during pregnancy can lead to adverse outcomes for the&#xD;
      fetus, thus supplements are recommended. Adherence to current tablet-based supplements is&#xD;
      documented to be poor. Recently a powdered form of micronutrients has been developed which&#xD;
      may decrease side-effects and thus improve adherence. However, before testing the efficacy of&#xD;
      the supplement as an alternate choice for supplementation during pregnancy, the&#xD;
      bioavailability of the iron needs to be determined. The objective of this study is to measure&#xD;
      the relative bioavailability of iron and folic acid from a powdered supplement that can be&#xD;
      sprinkled on semi-solid foods or beverages versus a traditional tablet supplement in pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal addresses the issue of the bioavailability of the supplement SuppleFem as&#xD;
      compared to the current standard supplement Materna during pregnancy in Canadian women. In&#xD;
      recognition of the difficulties Canadian women face in order to meet their iron (27 mg/day)&#xD;
      and folic acid (600 µg/day) requirements from dietary sources alone during pregnancy, Health&#xD;
      Canada currently recommends that an iron/folic acid supplement be taken by all women during&#xD;
      pregnancy. However, because of issues related to adherence, many pregnant women do not&#xD;
      fulfill the Health Canada recommendation. Adherence is largely influenced by the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal side-effects associated with the use of iron tablets or pills, as well as&#xD;
      the nausea and vomiting common during the first trimester. It is estimated that&#xD;
      approximately10% of women discontinue the use of iron because of adverse effects while others&#xD;
      use less than a daily dose. Women suffering from indigestion and heart-burn&#xD;
      (gastro-esophageal acid reflux) associated with the use of iron supplements commonly&#xD;
      discontinue their use and many find it difficult to swallow pills when nauseated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioavailabilities of iron and folic acid in supplements may be an area of concern,&#xD;
      primarily due to the higher requirements during pregnancy. Materna® contains a large quantity&#xD;
      of calcium (250 mg), whereas Sprinkles contains none. A study by Hallberg, et al. (1991)&#xD;
      showed that adding as little as 165 mg of calcium to a meal reduced the absorption of iron by&#xD;
      50-60% in wheat rolls. In addition, a study by Koren, et al. (2004) showed that after&#xD;
      adjusting for dose, the iron absorbed from one maternal iron supplement containing calcium&#xD;
      was statistically less as compared to one without calcium. A study by Rossander-Hultén et al&#xD;
      (1991, as cited by Sandröm, 2001) found that zinc has the potential to inhibit iron&#xD;
      absorption in supplements but not when zinc is added to food . The iron supplement contains&#xD;
      25mg of zinc whereas SuppleFem contains only 5.5mg. There are no reported interactions&#xD;
      between folate and other nutrients. However, there is evidence that folate bioavailability&#xD;
      may be influenced by the amount ingested. While pregnancy does increase the demand for&#xD;
      folate, the amount in SuppleFem is compliant with the current DRI guidelines at 600µg,&#xD;
      whereas the iron supplement contains 1000 µg. Currently, there is not enough research to&#xD;
      indicate whether unmetabolized folic acid poses any health risks .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new natural health product, &quot;SuppleFem Sprinkles&quot;, was designed to address the issues with&#xD;
      adherence. Sprinkles are single-dose sachets (like small packets of sugar) containing&#xD;
      micronutrients in a powder form (iron as ferric pyrophosphate, folic acid and other&#xD;
      micronutrients), which are easily sprinkled onto any foods or liquids prepared in the&#xD;
      household. Any semi-solid food or liquid can be fortified by their addition. Sprinkles are&#xD;
      meant to be added once daily to any semi-solid foods eaten in the home (eg: pureed fruits,&#xD;
      orange juice or oatmeal), or mixed into a liquid. The efficacy of Sprinkles to prevent anemia&#xD;
      in pregnant women has not previously been demonstrated, however, in the past five years,&#xD;
      seven community-based trials in four different countries have examined the efficacy of&#xD;
      Sprinkles in both infants and young children in developing countries xii, xiv, , , , , Before&#xD;
      adherence can be measured as a primary outcome, however, it must be shown that there is no&#xD;
      significant difference in the bioavailability of the ferric pyrophosphate in the SuppleFem®&#xD;
      compared to the iron in the leading iron supplement thus showing that SuppleFem is as&#xD;
      efficacious as standard treatments. If the new delivery system proves to be non-inferior to&#xD;
      the leading iron tablets, then adherence to this new natural health product can be examined&#xD;
      at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective- The primary objective of this study is to determine whether or not the&#xD;
      powdered formulation of micronized ferric pyrophosphate in SuppleFem® (to be mixed with&#xD;
      liquids or food) is as bioavailable as the iron in the standard recommended pregnancy&#xD;
      supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective- The secondary objective of this study is to compare the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability (ratio of AUCs for serum folate over an 8 hour period) of folic acid&#xD;
      following a single dose of Materna® or Sprinkles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crossover design of the study will allow each subject to act as their own control. Since&#xD;
      the interventions will be given in therapeutic dosage rather than a larger pharmaceutical&#xD;
      dose it is anticipated that there should be no carryover effect to the next intervention. The&#xD;
      washout periods between treatments will be one week each. It is anticipated that the study&#xD;
      will begin September 1, 2005 and would last for a period of 6 to 9 weeks. Duration of study&#xD;
      for each subject will be 3 weeks. Patients will be enrolled in the trial upon their answering&#xD;
      of a posted advertisement. During the initial encounter, the prospective subjects will be&#xD;
      informed as to the purpose of the trial, how the trial will be conducted, what their time&#xD;
      commitment will be and any possible potential for harm This information will be explained by&#xD;
      the study coordinator and informed consent will be obtained if the patient is agreeable.&#xD;
      Subjects will fill out a baseline questionnaire detailing their supplement use as well as&#xD;
      other demographic information before commencing the study. Prior supplement use should not&#xD;
      impact on the relative bioavailability of either supplement since the crossover design will&#xD;
      ensure prior use will impact on both treatments equally. Visit number one will determine&#xD;
      diurnal variation values for the serum iron as well as establish iron status. Individuals in&#xD;
      each of the groups will then be randomly allocated to either SuppleFem® or Materna® by&#xD;
      selecting coloured poker chips from a bag to assign equal probability for each subject to&#xD;
      fall into either of the two treatments. Two colors will be chosen to represent the two&#xD;
      interventions. The chips will be placed in an opaque bag by the study coordinator and&#xD;
      subjects will be asked at the commencement of the second visit (first intervention) to&#xD;
      withdraw a chip from the bag as part of the randomization process. The colour will identify&#xD;
      which intervention group the subject will be placed in. For visit number three, subjects will&#xD;
      receive the opposite treatment from the one they took in visit two. Subject blinding is not&#xD;
      possible due to the physical forms of the interventions; Materna is a large pill whereas&#xD;
      Sprinkles are a granular powder. This study will be highly controlled and subjects will be&#xD;
      closely observed while ingesting the supplements to ensure that the entire precisely measured&#xD;
      amount is consumed. Further, serum measurements are objective in nature and cannot be&#xD;
      influenced by the subject.&#xD;
