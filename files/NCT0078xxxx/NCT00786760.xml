  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the natural history of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      infection in men. The study will also find out what factors are linked to HPV in men&#xD;
      including other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If participants test positive for&#xD;
      syphilis, gonorrhea or chlamydia, we are required by law to report the results to the Florida&#xD;
      Department of Health. Participants will be able to get free medical treatment from the&#xD;
      Florida Department of Health for these STDs. Participants will be given a written report of&#xD;
      the results of the STD testing.&#xD;

      The study protocol will include a pre-enrollment run-in visit, a baseline visit (enrollment),&#xD;
      and 8 additional visits after enrollment scheduled 6 months apart. Intervals of every 6&#xD;
      months were chosen to insure that both acquisition and loss of infections may be assessed, as&#xD;
      studies in women indicate that median duration of oncogenic infections ranges between 7-9&#xD;
      months. Informed consent will occur during the run-in visit. The run-in and follow-up visits&#xD;
      will include questionnaire administration, visual inspection of the skin and external&#xD;
      genitalia, and the collection of urine, blood, oral cells, and penile skin samples If&#xD;
      anogenital lesions are present at any of the clinic visits, they will be sampled as well.&#xD;

    <description>The first specific aim is to establish the cohort of 3000 men ages 18 - 44 years who will be examined every 6 months for 4 years. To assess potential biases introduced by the run-in visit, Pearson's χ² test of association will be used to compare cohort participants and non-participants who attended the run-in visit with respect to known and potential HPV risk factors and HPV status. All analyses will be conducted using Intercooled STATA (StataCorp. 2001. Stata Statistical Software: Release 8.2 SE College Station, Texas: Stata Corporation).</description>

    <measure>Incidence Rates of Specific HPV Type Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years per participant</time_frame>
    <description>The second specific aim is to determine the incidence and persistence of type-specific HPV infections. Estimates of the incidence rates of specific HPV type infection will be calculated on the basis of the number of cases in which a given type is detected for the first time in men who tested negative for that HPV type at baseline.</description>

      This study will create a specimen repository with which to test future novel hypotheses&#xD;
      related to HPV infection among men. To assess other genetic, infectious, or environmental&#xD;
      factors that may influence acquisition and persistence of HPV infections in men, whole blood,&#xD;
      serum, exfoliated penile cell samples, and oral cells will be stored in aliquots for future&#xD;
      analyses as funding becomes available. Using banked specimens preserved for DNA, RNA, and&#xD;
      protein analyses, we will be able to assess novel biomarkers such as methylation status of&#xD;
      oncogenic HPV, polymorphisms in genes involved in innate immunity (e.g., TLR genes), and mRNA&#xD;
      of the E6 and E7 HPV oncoproteins in the future.&#xD;
