      The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is an NIH Roadmap&#xD;
      initiative to develop a computerized system measuring patient-reported outcomes in&#xD;
      respondents with a wide range of chronic diseases and demographic characteristics. In the&#xD;
      first four years of its existence, the PROMIS network developed item banks for measuring&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes in the areas of pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical&#xD;
      function, and social functioning. During the item banking process, the PROMIS network&#xD;
      conducted focus groups, individual cognitive interviews, and lexile (reading level) analyses&#xD;
      to refine the meaning, clarity, and literacy demands of all items. The item banks were&#xD;
      administered to over 20,000 respondents and calibrated using models based on item response&#xD;
      theory (IRT). Using these IRT calibrations, computerized adaptive test (CAT) algorithms were&#xD;
      developed and implemented. The network has designed a series of studies using clinical&#xD;
      populations to evaluate the item attributes, examine their utility as CATs, and validate the&#xD;
      item banks. More information on the PROMIS network can be found at www.nihpromis.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the experience and impact of having&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF). In particular, we hope to develop better questionnaires that&#xD;
      can measure heart failure patients' quality-of-life.&#xD;

      This project will assess the validity (including responsiveness) of selected Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instruments in patients with severe CHF who&#xD;
      receive heart transplants. The following is a list of goals for this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the responsiveness of PROMIS domain scores by comparing scores in patients&#xD;
           with severe heart failure before and after a clinically significant event (heart&#xD;
           transplant). The specific PROMIS domains assessed are physical functioning, fatigue,&#xD;
           satisfaction with discretionary social activities, depression, and global health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the responsiveness of a disease-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
           measure, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), the Medical Outcomes Study&#xD;
           Short Form-36 Vitality subscale (SF-36v2), and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect cross-sectional and longitudinal data on traditional clinical measures of&#xD;
           heart failure outcome (6-minute walk test and New York Heart Association [NYHA] class)&#xD;
           that can inform the definition of a minimally important difference (MID) for the PROMIS&#xD;
           domains of physical functioning, fatigue, satisfaction with discretionary social&#xD;
           activities, depression, and global health.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical and patient-reported assessments will be performed at baseline and 8-12 weeks 86 (end of study). Clinical indicators of functioning will include the New York Heart 87 Association (NYHA) classification and the six-minute walk test. We will include the 88 Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), a disease-specific measure of health-89 related quality of life (HRQOL), as a point of reference for understanding the relative 90 validity (including responsiveness) of the PRPROMIS item banks. Instruments will include 91 PROMIS computerized adaptive tests (CATS).</description>
