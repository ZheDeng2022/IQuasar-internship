      The main purpose of this study is to learn which educational method is most helpful to&#xD;
      patients and their family members when they consider whether to pursue live donor kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible for a kidney transplant usually get information in the transplant&#xD;
      clinic about two types of kidney transplants - one where the kidney comes from a dead donor&#xD;
      and one where the kidney comes from a healthy living donor. Patients are given this&#xD;
      information by a transplant nurse or doctor and then encouraged to discuss it with family&#xD;
      members and friends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we are trying to see if changing how and where we give patients this&#xD;
      information makes a difference in how patients and their family members think about live&#xD;
      donor kidney transplantation. So, we are looking at whether getting the information in the&#xD;
      transplant clinic - either alone or in a group - is the same or different than getting the&#xD;
      same information in your home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is only recruiting African American patients. This is being done because African&#xD;
      Americans have a higher likelihood of developing chronic kidney disease and needing a kidney&#xD;
      transplant than patients of other races. However, they wait longer for a kidney transplant&#xD;
      and die at a higher rate on the waiting list because they are less likely than other patients&#xD;
      to receive a live donor kidney transplant. We want to see which educational approach works&#xD;
      best with African American patients and their families.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10 million people in the United States. Diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease contribute to most cases of&#xD;
      CKD. Those with CKD who become dialysis-dependent are considered to have ESRD. The incidence&#xD;
      of ESRD has increased dramatically over the last decade and is estimated to be 338 per&#xD;
      million population. Adults with ESRD are known to experience significant mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity, and there is evidence of significant health disparities between Whites and ethnic&#xD;
      minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ESRD, the waiting&#xD;
      list and waiting time for deceased donor transplantation are expanding exponentially. Live&#xD;
      donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) remains a viable option for patients, yet more than half&#xD;
      of all wait-listed patients, especially minorities, do not pursue LDKT. Therefore, programs&#xD;
      designed to further expand LDKT, especially those targeting minority populations, are needed&#xD;
      given the current and projected shortage of deceased donor organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research program is to improve education provided to African&#xD;
      Americans and, thereby, increase rates of LDKT. The objective of this application is to&#xD;
      determine the relative effectiveness of three strategies for increasing LDKT in African&#xD;
      Americans. In a recently completed HRSA-funded (2002-2006) randomized clinical trial, we&#xD;
      demonstrated that a home-based LDKT intervention program was superior to standard&#xD;
      clinic-based education in increasing LDKT rates at one transplant center. The proposed study&#xD;
      seeks to replicate and extend the evaluation of a home-based (HB) educational intervention in&#xD;
      an African American patient population. The central hypothesis is that a HB intervention&#xD;
      yields higher LDKT rates relative to other interventions in African Americans. This&#xD;
      hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of strong preliminary data. The rationale for the&#xD;
      proposed research is that, by identifying the interventions most likely to yield higher LDKT&#xD;
      rates in African Americans, we can further develop and refine the interventional methodology&#xD;
      that will allow the most effective education to be disseminated to all kidney transplant&#xD;
      programs. We are especially well-prepared to conduct the proposed research due to the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary nature of the research team, as well as the expertise and experience of the&#xD;
      team in developing LDKT and live donation educational materials, implementing and evaluating&#xD;
      novel LDKT interventions, conducting LDKT research with African Americans, and producing&#xD;
      meaningful outcomes. Specifically, the research team includes investigators who are funded in&#xD;
      the conduct of ESRD, kidney transplantation, and organ donation research and who are&#xD;
      dedicated to the scientific advancement of LDKT. Also, the research will be conducted in an&#xD;
      environment that is conducive to the successful completion of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate our central hypothesis and to accomplish the objective of the proposed study, we&#xD;
      plan to pursue the following two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Determine the clinical effectiveness of three separate LDKT educational&#xD;
      approaches with African American patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we found that an LDKT educational intervention delivered in the patient's home and&#xD;
      that involved both patients and their invited guests (family, friends, community leaders) was&#xD;
      an effective strategy for increasing LDKT, especially in African Americans. This is a very&#xD;
      different educational approach than what is used in most transplant centers, which typically&#xD;
      involves either group-based (patients and whomever accompanies them to clinic) meetings or&#xD;
      individual patient sessions. Based on the work summarized in the Preliminary Studies section,&#xD;
      the working hypothesis in this study is that patients randomized to a Home-Based (HB)&#xD;
      intervention will demonstrate more favorable outcomes relative to patients randomized to a&#xD;
      Group-Based (GB) intervention conducted in the transplant clinic or to a Standard Care (SC)&#xD;
      condition in which individual patients are education in the transplant clinic. Specifically,&#xD;
      relative to the GB or SC educational approaches, the HB intervention will demonstrate...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: A higher proportion of enrolled patients with LDKTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: A higher proportion of enrolled patients with live donor inquiries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.3: A higher proportion of enrolled patients with live donor evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.4: A higher number of potential donors educated, per patient. Hypothesis 1.5:&#xD;
      More improvement in live donation knowledge. Hypothesis 1.6: More improvement in live&#xD;
      donation concerns. Hypothesis 1.7: More willingness to initiate live donor discussion with&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Determine the sociodemographic, medical, and donation-specific variables that&#xD;
      are most strongly associated with pursuing LDKT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the work summarized in the Preliminary Studies section, the working hypothesis is&#xD;
      that LDKT status (primary outcome: yes/no) will vary significantly by sociodemographic,&#xD;
      medical, and donation-specific variables. Specificallyâ€¦ Hypothesis 2.1: The following patient&#xD;
      characteristics will be significantly associated with having received LDKT: male, younger,&#xD;
      dialysis-dependent, more live donor inquiries, more knowledge about live donation, fewer&#xD;
      concerns about live donation, and more willingness to initiate live donation discussion with&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
