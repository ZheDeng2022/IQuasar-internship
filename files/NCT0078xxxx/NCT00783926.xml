    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the dose-related safety and immunogenicity of six&#xD;
      different dose levels of inactivated, Vero cell-derived reverse genetic reassortant&#xD;
      A/H5N1/Indonesia/05/2005 influenza vaccine in a healthy young adult population. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive 2 vaccinations (21 days apart) at the dose to which they were assigned. Blood will be&#xD;
      drawn from all subjects for serum antibody determination on Days 0, 21, 42 and 180. Body&#xD;
      temperature will be measured daily for 6 days following vaccination. Injection site reactions&#xD;
      and systemic reactions will be monitored throughout the entire 180 days of the study. Safety&#xD;
      data obtained at 7 days after the first vaccination for all dose levels in Cohort 1 will be&#xD;
      reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee and a recommendation will be obtained whether to&#xD;
      proceed to the second vaccination of Cohort 1 and to the first vaccination of Cohort 2.&#xD;
