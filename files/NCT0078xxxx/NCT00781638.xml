  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children aged up to 18 years with moderately active Ulcerative Colitis (PUCAI:35-64) will&#xD;
      receive one weekly Adacolumn® apheresis treatment over 5 consecutive weeks, followed by up to&#xD;
      3 optional Adacolumn® apheresis treatments over 3 consecutive weeks. Primary end point is&#xD;
      PUCAI at Week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main part of the clinical investigation will be continued by a one year follow up for&#xD;
      responders.&#xD;

      The individual clinical investigation period will be 12 weeks per patient. If the patient&#xD;
      will take part in the follow up, the individual clinical investigation period will be 64&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive one weekly Adacolumn® apheresis over 5 consecutive weeks. The treating&#xD;
      investigator may decide to add up to 3 treatments based on his judgment.&#xD;

    <description>The medical device Adacolumn® (CE-Mark Certificate G1 07 01 366 76013) is an adsorptive type extracorporeal apheresis column. It has been shown to effectively improve clinical and endoscopic signs and symptoms in UC in adults by removing granulocytes and monocytes and by changing the Cytokine production.</description>
