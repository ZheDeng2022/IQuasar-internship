  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells&#xD;
      are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to assess&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of low molecular weight sulfated dextran (LMW-SD) on&#xD;
      post-transplant islet function in people with type 1 diabetes who have responded to intensive&#xD;
      insulin therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type I diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic disease in which the&#xD;
      pancreas produces insufficient insulin to properly regulate blood sugar levels. Hypoglycemia,&#xD;
      or low blood sugar, and hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar, can lead to significant&#xD;
      complications in people with type 1 diabetes. Intensive insulin therapy has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of chronic complications in people who achieve near normalization of&#xD;
      glycemia. However, this therapy is labor intensive, difficult to implement, and associated&#xD;
      with an increased frequency of severe hypoglycemia. Transplantation of islets from a healthy&#xD;
      pancreas has been successful in restoring normal blood sugar levels and has led to initial&#xD;
      insulin independence in people with type 1 diabetes. Rejection of these islets by the&#xD;
      recipient's immune system, however, can make the treatment ineffective. An immune response&#xD;
      known as instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) results in the disruption of&#xD;
      islet integrity and islet loss within an hour of transfusion. LMW-SD inhibits IBMIR by&#xD;
      preventing the cascade that triggers it, when combined with pancreatic islets. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of LMW-SD given with islet transfusion and&#xD;
      post-transfusion along with immunosuppressive therapy, including mycophenolate mofetil or&#xD;
      sirolimus, tacrolimus or cyclosporine, and thymoglobulin or basiliximab, on the success of&#xD;
      islet transplantation in people with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last for 1 year after the final islet transplant. Participants may receive up&#xD;
      to 3 islet transplants while participating in this study. Participants eligible for this&#xD;
      study will have clinic visits every 6 months. Once a preparation of islets becomes available,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to Arm 1 or Arm 2. Participants in Arm 1 will receive&#xD;
      LMW-DS during and for 5 hours after infusion. Participants in Arm 2 will receive heparin at&#xD;
      the time of infusion. In addition, all participants will receive anticoagulation prophylaxis&#xD;
      agents consisting of Klexzane® (Enoxaparinsodium) and Trombyl® or Albyl-E® (Acetylsalicylic&#xD;
      acid). All participants will also receive the oral immunosuppression medications consisting&#xD;
      of mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus and tacrolimus or cyclosporine throughout the study. In&#xD;
      addition, they will receive intravenous thymoglobulin on days -2, -1, day 0 (transplant), +1,&#xD;
      and +2 for the first transplant or intravenous basiliximab at the time of transplant and on&#xD;
      Day 4 for the second and third transplant. Enbrel® (Etanercept) will be given to all&#xD;
      participants for anti-inflammatory therapy. Islet infusions will occur at the hospital and&#xD;
      will be given intravenously. Participants will be eligible to receive second and third islet&#xD;
      infusions if previous infusions fail and they continue to meet the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      After each infusion, study visits will occur on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 75 and Months 6&#xD;
      and 12. At these visits, physical exams and blood collection will occur. At some visits,&#xD;
      urine collection will also occur.&#xD;
