      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of topical ALT-2074&#xD;
      applied twice daily for 28 days for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to evaluate the safety of topical ALT-2074 applied twice&#xD;
      daily for 28 days for treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary objectives will be to provide visual documentation of the improvement of psoriatic&#xD;
      plaques treated with ALT-2074 using digital photography, and to determine the extent of&#xD;
      systemic absorption of topically applied ALT-2074 based on a pharmacokinetic measurement of&#xD;
      blood concentration.&#xD;

    <description>Two psoriatic plaques of similar surface area and severity will be identified for each subject. ALT-2074 will be applied topically twice daily to 1 of the 2 target plaques, and the placebo control to the other plaque for a period of 28 days in amounts sufficient to cover the entire surface area of the target plaque, extending to 1 cm outside of the plaque border.</description>

&#xD;
          3. In otherwise good general health and free of any disease or physical condition which&#xD;
             might impair evaluation of plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Plaque psoriasis treatable area &lt;10% BSA. (Subject palm size is equivalent to 1% of&#xD;
             BSA.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have 2 well-matched plaques (target plaques) of approximately 3 to 8 cm by 3 to 8 cm&#xD;
             in size in areas on the right and left or front and back, at sites other than the&#xD;
             knees, below the knees, elbows, head, face, scalp, palms, and intertriginous areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A Combined Psoriasis Severity Score (CPSS) &gt; 6 for each target plaque at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing to avoid prolonged exposure of the treatment area to ultraviolet radiation&#xD;
             (natural and artificial) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
