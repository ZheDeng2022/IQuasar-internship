      The purpose of this research study is to find out how blood sugar levels change during the&#xD;
      day and night in people living with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and then to compare that with&#xD;
      people who do not have a spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As people with SCI get older they become more likely to develop health problems, just like&#xD;
      everyone else. However, SCI increases the risk of certain problems. The amount of time&#xD;
      post-SCI can also increase the risk of certain problems. This research project will focus on&#xD;
      identifying the patterns of changes in blood sugar levels after SCI. Sugar in the blood is&#xD;
      the important source of energy for the body. Too much sugar in the blood is known as&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and not enough sugar in the blood is known as hypoglycemia. Under healthy&#xD;
      conditions, the amount of sugar in the blood is automatically regulated so that a steady&#xD;
      level is maintained. After SCI, however, this automatic regulation is damaged. The likelihood&#xD;
      of experiencing too much or too little blood sugar is increased. Over time, having too much&#xD;
      blood sugar can lead to the development of diabetes. In just the opposite situation,&#xD;
      individuals with SCI can begin to experience more frequent episodes of too little blood&#xD;
      sugar, which can lead to acute emergency situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pattern of how blood sugar levels change during a typical 24-hour time period in persons&#xD;
      with SCI is not known. There may be unknown factors that affect blood sugar levels. In order&#xD;
      to find out that information, this study will involve continuously monitoring blood sugar&#xD;
      over a 3-day period in a variety of persons with SCI. A non-invasive, wireless monitoring&#xD;
      system will be attached to the abdomen. This system records blood sugar levels every 5&#xD;
      minutes. The information gathered from this observational study is vital to the understanding&#xD;
      of how SCI alters the regulation of sugar levels in the blood and to the subsequent medical&#xD;
      management of this population.&#xD;
