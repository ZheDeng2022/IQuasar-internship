    <textblock>
      In Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) chemotherapy induces only low CR/VGPR rates and&#xD;
      response duration is limited. In addition, WM patients are often elderly, partly not&#xD;
      tolerating chemotherapy related toxicities. Thus, innovative approaches are needed which&#xD;
      combine excellent activity and tolerability in WM. Chemotherapy-free approaches are highly&#xD;
      attractive for this patient group. Based on its high activity and favorable toxicity profile&#xD;
      in indolent B-NHL such as CLL, Venetoclax was approved for the treatment of this diseases by&#xD;
      the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). First data in relapsed/refractory WM have&#xD;
      documented high activity and low toxicity of Venetoclax also in WM, including patients with&#xD;
      prior Ibrutinib treatment or patients carrying CXCR4 mutations. Ibrutinib itself has high&#xD;
      activity and a relatively low toxicity profile in WM, but has also major disadvantages: the&#xD;
      main disadvantage is the need to apply this drug continuously. Furthermore, Ibrutinib&#xD;
      efficacy depends largely on the genotype with a substantial drop in major responses and PFS&#xD;
      in the presence of CXCR4 mutations and non-mutated MYD88. In particular the need of&#xD;
      continuous treatment for Ibrutinib has prevented that Ibrutinib has become the standard of&#xD;
      care outcompeting conventional Rituximab/chemotherapy. This is reflected in current&#xD;
      guidelines such as the NCCN and the ESMO guidelines, which still see immunochemotherapy as a&#xD;
      backbone of treatment, largely because of the advantage of a timely fixed application. Data&#xD;
      in CLL in the relapsed as well as in the first line setting have convincingly shown that in&#xD;
      contrast to Ibrutinib Venetoclax is highly efficient also when used in a timely defined&#xD;
      application scheme over 12 months in combination with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab. Data&#xD;
      documented deep responses including molecular responses and a highly significant advantage&#xD;
      over immunochemotherapy in large international Phase III trials, changing the standard of&#xD;
      care in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this the hypothesis is that timely fixed application of the combination of&#xD;
      Venetoclax and Rituximab induces significantly superior treatment outcomes compared to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and Rituximab (DRC) in patients with treatment naïve WM, regardless of the&#xD;
      genotype. A confirmation of this assumption in the proposed trial will change the standard of&#xD;
      care in WM.&#xD;

&#xD;
      This study is an International phase II explorative, multicenter, open label, and randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of an open labeled, stratified 1:1 randomization between Arm A and Arm&#xD;
      B for de novo WM patients in need of treatment (phase II). Stratification factors are MYD88&#xD;
      and CXCR4 status (positive vs. negative). A stratified central block randomization will be&#xD;
      used. The central randomization service will be used to avoid predictability of the treatment&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to explore the efficacy of Venetoclax plus Rituximab versus&#xD;
      Dexamethasone/Cyclophosphamide/Rituximab in the treatment of de novo WM patients (Arm A vs.&#xD;
      Arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients are planned to be recruited for this study at 30 sites in Germany and France.&#xD;
