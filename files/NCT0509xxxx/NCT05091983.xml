      This study offers to determine whether adolescent patients with a restrictive eating disorder&#xD;
      have variations in their sensoriality compared to a control group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are a frequent reason for consultation in pediatrics at all ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they are small, children may have an orality disorder. There are multiple potential&#xD;
      causes for this disorder: psychogenic, oropraxic but also sensory. The treatment is then&#xD;
      adapted to the patient, with, among other things, an orientation towards professionals&#xD;
      trained in sensory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As they grow up, adolescents are particularly at risk of developing eating disorders, which&#xD;
      are pathologies that correspond to a biopsychosocial model of understanding that includes&#xD;
      psychogenetic, neuroendocrine and immune factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite major advances in the understanding of this disease, the sensory dimension for these&#xD;
      patients is still little studied and is not taken into account in the treatment proposed to&#xD;
      adolescents suffering from eating disorders.&#xD;

    <description>Comparison of average Sensory Processing Scale Inventory (SPSI) scores between the two groups This questionnaire focuses on sensoriality. It allows the definition of over or under-reactive sensory profiles. It is made of two lists (list #1 : 73 items ; list #2 : 29 items).&#xD;
The SPSI questionnaire is in English. For this reason, a group of experts from La Maison de Solenn met to translate it into French being as faithful as possible to the original questionnaire. Each checklist has its own score, the result is the sum of the points obtained (one point for YES, zero points for NO) (6).&#xD;
Two groups will be formed: a group with eating disorders and a control group. The questionnaire will be answered only once and will be proposed to the participant at the end of a consultation at the Maison de Solenn for his usual follow-up or during a hospitalization (full time hospitalization or in day hospital).</description>

This measure of severity will assess whether there is a relationship between the severity of the ED and the severity of the sensory disorders.</description>

        The participants were all recruited at the Maison de Solenn, Cochin - Paris, a service&#xD;
        specialized in the treatment of eating disorders for adolescents. The participants in the&#xD;
        control group are patients followed in this center for another reason than an eating&#xD;
        disorder. The participants were recruited in consultation, in day hospital or in complete&#xD;
        hospitalization.&#xD;
