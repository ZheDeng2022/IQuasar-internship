  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this retrospective study is to confirm the efficacy and safety results obtained in&#xD;
      the NAPOLI-1-study, when Onivyde® in combination with 5-FU/LV is used in real-life practice&#xD;
      in Belgium. The data needed to do so will be obtained using information that is routinely&#xD;
      collected as part of patient's medical care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis with a 5-years survival of only 1-2%.&#xD;
      This arises from the fact that it is typically diagnosed late, when curative resection is&#xD;
      impossible. These patients are thus restricted to chemotherapy, with gemcitabine-based&#xD;
      therapies being the standard of care for patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC). However, even after second or subsequent lines of&#xD;
      therapy, disease progression is inevitable. Therefore, the need for new treatment options is&#xD;
      high. Recently, the advantage of using nanoliposomal irinotecan (Onivyde®) in combination&#xD;
      with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (5-FU/LV) over the use of 5-FU/LV alone was demonstrated&#xD;
      in a phase-3 randomized clinical trial (NAPOLI-1 trial). As this study showed significant&#xD;
      improvement on overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure,&#xD;
      overall response rate and tumor marker CA19-9 response, on October 14 2016 this therapy was&#xD;
      approved by the EMA to be used for patients with mPDAC previously treated with&#xD;
      gemcitabine-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While randomized clinical trials, like the NAPOLI-1 trial, are considered the reference&#xD;
      standard for comparing the efficacy and safety of treatments, these studies do not always&#xD;
      reflect the everyday clinical practice. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Onivyde® in real-life practice in Belgium. This information would be&#xD;
      very valuable to determine the value of the drug and improve the knowledge of the actual use&#xD;
      of Onivyde® after marketing authorization.&#xD;
