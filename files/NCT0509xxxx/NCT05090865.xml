  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at the impact of the potassium content in fruits and vegetables, on serum&#xD;
      potassium concentrations in people with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a randomized&#xD;
      crossover design. Participants will receive home delivery of fruit and vegetables with either&#xD;
      higher or lower potassium content in a random order. Clinical chemistry markers from blood&#xD;
      and urine samples, blood pressure, physical functioning and health related quality of life&#xD;
      will be assessed throughout the duration of the trial. This study will also measure their&#xD;
      physical functioning, using a chair stand test. The results of this study could change the&#xD;
      dietary recommendations for people with CKD related to potassium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The kidney is a primary site of potassium regulation in the body. Hyperkalemia, elevated&#xD;
      serum potassium, occurs in approximately 10% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      and is associated with elevated all-cause mortality. To minimize the risk of hyperkalemia,&#xD;
      individuals with CKD are told to restrict dietary potassium. This recommendation is based on&#xD;
      very-low quality evidence. Dietary potassium restrictions can negatively impact quality of&#xD;
      life, and may put participants at risk of nutritional deficiencies so they should be based on&#xD;
      good quality evidence. There is a need for high quality randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      investigating the impact of dietary potassium modification on serum potassium concentrations&#xD;
      in people with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the impact and safety of dietary potassium liberalization using&#xD;
      fruit and vegetables on serum potassium concentrations in people with CKD. In this 16-week&#xD;
      study, the investigators will test if changing the amount of potassium people with CKD are&#xD;
      eating with fruits and vegetables changes the amount of potassium in their blood. The&#xD;
      investigators will do this by providing people with fruits and vegetables that are either&#xD;
      high or low in potassium for a period 6 weeks. Then these same participants will be provided&#xD;
      with fruits and vegetables that they didn't receive in the first 6 weeks, for 6 weeks in what&#xD;
      is called a randomized crossover design. In a randomized crossover design everyone gets both&#xD;
      treatments, but the order they get them in is chosen at random, like a coin toss. Thirty&#xD;
      participants, will be recruited to this study. The investigators will measure blood potassium&#xD;
      during the study and see if it changes due to the change in potassium in the fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables provided. The investigators think that changing the amount of potassium that&#xD;
      participants eat through fruit and vegetables will not lead to a different level of potassium&#xD;
      in the participants blood, and that having higher potassium fruit and vegetables in the diet&#xD;
      may lead to an increase in the participants quality of life. This study's results could&#xD;
      change the dietary recommendation given to people living CKD and potentially allow them to&#xD;
      eat a greater variety of food.&#xD;
