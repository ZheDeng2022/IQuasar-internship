  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have recurrent herpes labialis,&#xD;
      also known as cold sores. This is a type of viral infection that causes redness and blisters&#xD;
      on the mouth and lip and that recurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes labialis is caused by a virus called the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The infection is&#xD;
      spread when a person comes into direct contact with someone else who has the infection. Once&#xD;
      a person becomes infected with HSV, the virus multiplies and spreads, which can cause redness&#xD;
      and blistering on the mouth and lip. The blisters crust over and heal. Once healed, the virus&#xD;
      is said to go into an &quot;inactive&quot; phase. This means the virus does not cause any symptoms, but&#xD;
      still remains in the body. HSV can then become &quot;active&quot; again. This means causing cold sore&#xD;
      lesions to reappear. HSV can become active in different ways. Some of these include when a&#xD;
      person has a fever, comes into contact with strong sunlight or has a condition that lowers&#xD;
      one's immune system It can also happen during a woman's menstrual cycle, also called a&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about the available treatment called&#xD;
      acyclovir 50mg buccal tablet. acyclovir 50mg buccal tablet is used for treating viral&#xD;
      infections. It sticks to the inside of the mouth and directly treats the infected area. This&#xD;
      helps stop the HSV from multiplying and spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to gather additional data on acyclovir 50 mg tablet, an&#xD;
      available treatment for herpes labialis. It is a buccal tablet that sticks to the gum inside&#xD;
      the mouth and directly treats the infected area to help stop the HSV from multiplying and&#xD;
      spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to compare the efficacy of acyclovir 50 mg buccal tablets&#xD;
      versus placebo in the treatment of herpes labialis. A placebo is a treatment that looks like&#xD;
      the study medicine but does not have any medicine in it. Study participants will include&#xD;
      those who have had at least 4 episodes of herpes labialis within the past 12 months prior to&#xD;
      joining the study. To compare the study treatments, the researchers will measure the&#xD;
      &quot;duration of episode&quot; (DOE) for each participant. DOE is amount of time it takes for symptoms&#xD;
      to disappear and for herpes labialis lesions to heal after taking the study treatment. A&#xD;
      doctor will look at the participants' symptom scores and facial images to determine the DOE.&#xD;
      Assessments will be done over a period of 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in this study will take either acyclovir 50mg buccal tablet or the placebo&#xD;
      as a tablet by mouth 1 time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 2 week treatment phase and a 12 month follow up phase. The participants in&#xD;
      this study will not be required to visit the study site. Instead, the participants will have&#xD;
      virtual meetings with the study doctors from their homes using the internet. During the&#xD;
      treatment phase, there will be 2 meetings. Throughout the follow up phase, the doctors will&#xD;
      call the participants 4 times. Each participant will be in the study for about 20 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment phase of the study, the participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take their blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check their mouth health through a questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take pictures of their face and herpes labialis symptoms During the whole study the&#xD;
           participants will answer questions about how they are feeling, what medications they are&#xD;
           taking, and what adverse events they are having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors will keep track of any adverse events. An adverse event is any medical problem&#xD;
      that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen&#xD;
      in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be related to the study&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

      Participants will be randomly assigned one of two treatment groups - acyclovir 50 mg buccal&#xD;
      tablet or a placebo buccal tablet. Face images as well as symptom scores will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline, treatment initiation and over the next 14 days. Participants will automatically&#xD;
      transition to the Follow-up Phase. Participants will be in contact with the sites using&#xD;
      weekly virtual check-ins with the e-diary/App with the purpose reporting any adverse events,&#xD;
      concomitant medications , or new outbreaks of herpes labialis.&#xD;
