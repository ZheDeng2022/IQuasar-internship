    <textblock>
      An interactive web-based decision aid for shared decision making: birth choice after cesarean&#xD;
      in Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Taiwan has a high national caesarean rate coupled with a low vaginal birth after&#xD;
      caesarean (VBAC) rate. Studies suggest that pregnant women do not receive sufficient&#xD;
      information about birth choices after caesarean in Taiwan and shared decision making (SDM) is&#xD;
      not an expectation. Chen conducted a pilot study. Improvements in knowledge for the decision&#xD;
      aid group were larger than for the usual care group, although differences between groups were&#xD;
      not statistically significant. An interactive multimedia technology and humanity&#xD;
      communication may provide opportunities to increase engagement and support women during&#xD;
      decision consultations. Following previous pilot study, the study aims to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an interactive web-based birth decision aid for SDM in pregnant women who&#xD;
      have had a previous cesarean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A quantitative approach will be conducted with a randomized pre-test and post-test&#xD;
      experimental design in a medical center in northern Taiwan. Participants who have had one&#xD;
      previous CS will be recruited at 14-16 weeks. A total of 172 women will be completed a&#xD;
      baseline survey and will be randomly allocated to either the intervention (usual care plus an&#xD;
      interactive web-based birth decision aid ) or usual care (general maternal health booklet)&#xD;
      group. A follow up survey at 35-38 weeks measured change in decisional conflict, knowledge,&#xD;
      birth preference and decision aid acceptability. Actual birth outcomes and satisfaction will&#xD;
      be assessed one month after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contributions/ Implementation of clinical practice The study will potentially increase women&#xD;
      and obstetricians to support VBAC and SDM. The interactive decision aid tool may reduce&#xD;
      time-consumption for health education. Linking web-based data analysis of AI into medical&#xD;
      record can be beneficial for clinical practice and research in the future.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sequential mixed methods approach was conducted based on the Ottawa Decision Support&#xD;
      Framework (ODSF). The current study will represent Aim 4 (Intervention implementation phase),&#xD;
      comprising two stages. Stage 1 involves a randomized pre-test and post-test experimental&#xD;
      design. Decisional conflict, knowledge, birth preference, and decision aid acceptability are&#xD;
      assessed. Stage 2 consists of a survey, actual birth outcome and satisfaction are assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a medical center in northern Taiwan. The medical center offers&#xD;
      24-hour system of the designated obstetrician. Using purposive sampling, the selection&#xD;
      criteria include women who are medically eligible for VBAC in the study site, had experienced&#xD;
      one previous CS, 14-16 weeks' gestation, had at least a half year interval between current&#xD;
      pregnancy and the previous birth and are fluent in English or Mandarin. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      included women with multiple pregnancy, previous classic CS or myomectomy, and/or pregnancy&#xD;
      with high risk of complications (for example, women who had risk factors such as&#xD;
      hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, epilepsy, threatened premature labor, or another&#xD;
      pre-existing medical problem).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the study commencing, the research team will conduct online discussions to clarify&#xD;
      the research protocol. Eligible participants will be provided information about the study by&#xD;
      the principal researcher and signed a written consent. Using computer permuted block&#xD;
      randomization, participants will be allocated to control group (usual care) and intervention&#xD;
      group (usual care plus the interactive web-based birth decision aid). After administering the&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire, women will be allocated to the intervention group and give&#xD;
      instructions by the principal researcher on how to log in the interactive birth decision aid&#xD;
      platform/App. All participants confirm preferred mode of birth with their obstetrician prior&#xD;
      to completing the second questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maternal health booklet, produced by Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health&#xD;
      and Welfare, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, will be provided to all women. The booklet consists of&#xD;
      58 pages, presenting 5 &quot;Dos&quot; and 5 &quot;Don'ts&quot; during pregnancy. 5 &quot;Dos&quot; content included (1) Do&#xD;
      receive prenatal exams according to schedule; (2) Do take good care during pregnancy; (3) Do&#xD;
      recognize pregnancy complications; (4) Do know the signs of premature birth; (5) Do know the&#xD;
      signs of labor. 5 &quot;Don'ts&quot; content included (1) Do not smoke or drink; (2) Do not be exposed&#xD;
      to secondhand smoke; (3) Do not take medication without doctor's orders; (4) Do not choose a&#xD;
      C-section in order to pick the time of birth; (5) Do not use drugs (52). There is very&#xD;
      limited information relevant to mode of birth choice after caesarean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the intervention group will receive both usual care and decision support (an&#xD;
      interactive web-based birth decision aid ). The interactive web-based birth decision aid will&#xD;
      be modified from Professor Allison Shorten (English audio). We add communication aid at the&#xD;
      beginning of platform/App. The communication aid comprises two components: components 1-how&#xD;
      to participate in SDM and apply three talk to work together with clinicians (10 minutes) ;&#xD;
      component 2-practice communication skill (10 minutes). Women will be assisted to create a&#xD;
      unique username and password for secure decision aid access and its features and functions&#xD;
      will be demonstrated. Intervention women will be invited to access the decision aid at home.&#xD;
      All women are allowed to have many opportunities to access and use the decision aid during&#xD;
      their pregnancy and will be recorded. They are encouraged to use the decision aid during&#xD;
      recruitment and gestation visit in the Outpatient Department of Obstetrics. The principal&#xD;
      researcher will provide 2-3 online consultations for individual women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three primary and two secondary outcome measures. Primary outcome measures are&#xD;
      decisional conflict, knowledge, birth preference and decision aid acceptability. Decisional&#xD;
      conflict score (DCS)includes 16 questions in 5 sub-scale. Using the 5-point Likert 5 rating,&#xD;
      from &quot;strongly agree&quot; ( 0 points) to &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (4 points). Knowledge measurement&#xD;
      consists of a 15-item questionnaire asking participants to answer ''true,'' ''false,'' or&#xD;
      ''unsure'' to a series of statements regarding risks and benefits of each birth mode.&#xD;
      Previously tested Cronbach α for this questionnaire was = 0.67.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are actual birth outcome and satisfaction. Satisfaction with&#xD;
      decision scale (SWD) included six questions to measure women's satisfaction with their&#xD;
      decision, using the Likert 5 rating, from &quot;strongly agree&quot; (5 points) to &quot;strongly disagree&quot;&#xD;
      (1 points). Women have higher scores indicating increased SWD. Cronbach's α previously tested&#xD;
      was 0.88.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using G-POWER 3.1.9.2 software, sample size was calculated. Based on estimates from a&#xD;
      previous pilot study, effect size=.40, a total of sample size 156 provides α = .05 and power&#xD;
      = .80. To allow for preterm deliveries, mal-presentations, and losses to follow-up, an&#xD;
      increase in the desired number by 10 percent would be 172.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women will be invited to participate in the study when they attend prenatal&#xD;
      examination at the 14-16 weeks' gestation visit in the Outpatient Department of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology. After participants sign written consent for participation, women will be&#xD;
      allocated to either the intervention group or control group. All participants will complete&#xD;
      &quot;personal basic information&quot;, &quot;decision conflict scale&quot; and &quot;knowledge scale&quot; in a quiet&#xD;
      room. After completion of questionnaires, an interactive birth decision aid platform/App will&#xD;
      be provided for intervention group women to discuss with their families at home. Individual&#xD;
      consultations will be provided for intervention group women, by the principal researcher, at&#xD;
      least twice during the 17-34 weeks' gestation period. All participants will complete&#xD;
      &quot;decision conflict scale&quot; and &quot;knowledge scale&quot; and &quot;decision aid acceptability at 35-38&#xD;
      weeks' gestation. A follow-up is held one month after birth. Postnatal women will be asked&#xD;
      about &quot;actual birth outcomes '' and complete a &quot;satisfaction&quot; questionnaire when they attend&#xD;
      their postnatal examination visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data is managed and analyze using IBM SPSS Version 26.0. In terms of DCS and&#xD;
      knowledge scores, matched pairs t-tests are used to compare differences between groups in&#xD;
      change between pre and post test scores.&#xD;
