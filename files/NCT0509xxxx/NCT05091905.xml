  <brief_summary>

      This will be a randomized comparison of continuous local anesthetic infusion with patient&#xD;
      controlled boluses (PCA) to patient-titratable automated boluses with patient controlled&#xD;
      boluses (PCA) for popliteal-sciatic perineural catheters. The overall goal is to determine&#xD;
      the relationship between method of local anesthetic administration (continuous with PCA vs.&#xD;
      titratable intermittent dosing with PCA) for popliteal-sciatic perineural catheters and the&#xD;
      resulting pain control. The investigators hypothesize that, compared with a traditional&#xD;
      fixed, continuous basal infusion initiated prior to discharge, perineural local anesthetic&#xD;
      administered with titratable automated boluses at a lower dose and a 5-hour delay following&#xD;
      discharge will (1) provide at least noninferior analgesia during the period that both&#xD;
      techniques are functioning; and, (2) will result in a longer overall duration of&#xD;
      administration [dual primary end points].&#xD;

      Specific Aim: to determine the relationship between method of local anesthetic administration&#xD;
      (continuous with PCA vs. titratable intermittent dosing with PCA) for popliteal-sciatic&#xD;
      perineural catheters and the resulting pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that, compared with a traditional fixed, continuous&#xD;
      basal infusion initiated prior to discharge, perineural local anesthetic administered with&#xD;
      titratable automated boluses at a lower dose and a 5-hour delay following discharge will (1)&#xD;
      provide at least noninferior analgesia during the period that both techniques are&#xD;
      functioning; and, (2) will result in a longer overall duration of administration [dual&#xD;
      primary end points].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, controlled investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: Consenting adults undergoing painful foot and/or ankle surgery with a planned&#xD;
      popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter insertion will be offered enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block placement: The nerve block site will be cleaned with chlorhexidine gluconate and&#xD;
      isopropyl alcohol (ChloraPrep One-Step, Medi-Flex Hospital Products, Inc., Overland Park, KS,&#xD;
      USA), and a clear, sterile, fenestrated drape applied. The ultrasound probe will be readied&#xD;
      for use and placed to visualize the short-axis (cross-section) of the target nerve. A skin&#xD;
      wheal will be raised at the catheter-placement needle's anticipated point of entry. An 8.9&#xD;
      cm, 17-gauge, insulated needle (FlexTip, Arrow International, Reading, PA, USA) will be used&#xD;
      to place all perineural catheters. The catheter-placement 17G needle will be inserted through&#xD;
      the skin wheal, advanced in-plane beneath the US transducer and directed toward the target&#xD;
      nerve. Normal saline (1-2 mL) will be administered via the needle to open the space around&#xD;
      the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flexible non-stimulating perineural catheter (FlexTip, Arrow International, Reading, PA,&#xD;
      USA) will be inserted 2-3 cm past the needle tip. After catheter insertion, Ropivacaine 0.5%&#xD;
      (20 mL) will be administered via the catheter under ultrasound visualization. Sensation in&#xD;
      the tibial and peroneal nerve distributions will be checked for anesthetic effect up to 15&#xD;
      minutes following initial local anesthetic bolus. A &quot;successful&quot; regional block will be&#xD;
      defined as sensory- and motor-block onset in all expected nerve distributions within the 15&#xD;
      minutes following the local anesthetic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A saphenous nerve block with ropivacaine 0.5% may or may not be provided, depending on the&#xD;
      surgical procedure, per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative: The initial local anesthetic bolus may provide complete surgical anesthesia&#xD;
      for the procedure. Patients who desire a general anesthetic or experience a partial block&#xD;
      that is not adequate for surgical anesthesia will receive a general anesthetic, per standard&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: (1) titratable&#xD;
      automated intermittent bolus or (2) continuous infusion in a computer generated 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      using opaque envelopes opened only after successful catheter insertion is documented within&#xD;
      30 minutes of the local anesthetic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Procedures: Following completion of the procedure in the operating room, an&#xD;
      infusion pump (Infutronix, Natick, Massachusetts) with a 500 mL ropivacaine 0.2% reservoir&#xD;
      will be attached to the perineural catheter. For patients in the continuous infusion group,&#xD;
      the pump will provide a 6 mL/h basal infusion and a 4 mL patient-controlled bolus with a&#xD;
      30-minute lockout (standard at UCSD). For patients in the titratable automated intermittent&#xD;
      bolus group, the pump will provide an automatic 8 mL bolus once every 2 hours and have a 4 mL&#xD;
      patient-controlled bolus with a 30 minute lockout. In addition, for those in the titratable&#xD;
      automated intermittent bolus group, the infusion pump will be set in a &quot;pause&quot; mode that&#xD;
      delays initiation of the automated bolus doses by 5 hours (this can be over-ridden by&#xD;
      patients if they would like to initiate their perineural infusion earlier than 5 hours).&#xD;
      Lastly, subjects in the titratable automated intermittent bolus group will be able to titrate&#xD;
      the volume of their automated bolus up or down within the range of 1-16 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per standard of care, the pump will not administer more than 20 mL during each hour (below&#xD;
      the current institutional maximum). Prior to discharge, the functioning of the infusion pump&#xD;
      will be explained, so that they understand that they should push the bolus button if they&#xD;
      have pain. This is accurate regardless of which treatment group the patient is randomized to,&#xD;
      ensuring that all subjects will receive adequate analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Subjects will be contacted via phone for the 9 days following surgery to&#xD;
      collect information regarding surgical pain (Numeric Rating Scale of 0 to 10, with &quot;0&quot; being&#xD;
      no pain and &quot;10&quot; being the worst pain ever experienced), analgesic use, sleep disturbances,&#xD;
      infusion side effects, and satisfaction with pain control. When 500 mL has been infused or on&#xD;
      Day 8-whichever comes first-subjects will remove the catheter and place the pump in a&#xD;
      pre-addressed and -stamped package for return [note that it is standard of care for patients&#xD;
      to remove the catheters at home; but, listed as experimental here due to the timing of&#xD;
      catheter removal which will be later than is standard of care due to the experimental local&#xD;
      anesthetic administration protocol].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Acquisition. Data will be gathered from the patients' electronic medical record, by&#xD;
      telephone follow-up, and from the memory of each infusion pump. Subjects will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone for the 9 days following surgery. Data will be recorded on paper Case Report Forms,&#xD;
      including: patient name, medical record number, age, sex, height, weight, surgical procedure,&#xD;
      data of procedure, anesthesiology attending overseeing/placing catheter, randomization&#xD;
      number, whether a femoral/saphenous block was placed, if the catheter was placed per&#xD;
      protocol, if the block set up successfully, intraoperative fentanyl, morphine and dilaudid,&#xD;
      and the time of infusion initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: This study will be powered for two primary end points: (1) the average pain level&#xD;
      measured with the Numeric Rating Scale queried on postoperative day 1; and (2) the duration&#xD;
      of treatment from when the infusion pump was initially turned on until the local anesthetic&#xD;
      reservoir was exhausted [recorded by the infusion pump memory]. The dual hypotheses will be&#xD;
      tested with a serial testing strategy, such that Hypothesis 2 will not be formally tested&#xD;
      unless the conclusion of Hypothesis 1 is at least &quot;noninferiority&quot;. Following the approach&#xD;
      described in Althunian et al, noninferiority will be assessed by comparing the lower limit of&#xD;
      the 95% confidence interval for the difference (CB minus AB) on the NRS (range: 0 to 10) to a&#xD;
      pre-specified noninferiority margin of 1.7 NRS units. This will provide evidence that the&#xD;
      analgesia provided by the novel automated boluses is no worse than 1.7 NRS units compared to&#xD;
      CB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of the randomized groups will be summarized with means, standard&#xD;
      deviations, and quartiles. Balance between groups will be assessed following the approach&#xD;
      described by Schober, et al. Specifically, standardized differences will be calculated using&#xD;
      Cohen's d whereby the difference in means or proportions is divided by the pooled standard&#xD;
      deviation estimates. Any key variables (age, sex, height, weight, and BMI) with an absolute&#xD;
      standardized difference &gt;0.47 (based on Austin, 2009 with 1.96×√(2/n)=0.47) will be noted and&#xD;
      included in a linear regression model to obtain an estimate of the treatment group&#xD;
      differences adjusted for the imbalanced covariate(s). If residuals from the linear regression&#xD;
      indicate violations of key assumptions (i.e. homoscedasticity or Guassian distribution), data&#xD;
      transformations and/or alternative generalized linear models will be applied as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will also be analyzed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, or linear models (or&#xD;
      generalized linear models) as appropriate with covariates for any imbalanced covariates. No&#xD;
      multiplicity adjustments will be applied for these analyses. End points will be analyzed for&#xD;
      each day (e.g., opioid consumption on Day 2) as well as all days combined (e.g., cumulative&#xD;
      opioid consumption Days 1-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate: Power is simulated based on the distribution of pain measured with the&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) observed in the &quot;Above bifurcation&quot; group in Monahan, et al.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators simulate NRS scores from a discrete distribution as depicted&#xD;
      in Figure 2. This results in an expected interquartile range 1 to 4, and a median of 3 NRS&#xD;
      units. The investigators simulated 1000 trials in which the two groups, n=35 per group, were&#xD;
      assumed to follow the same discrete distribution, submitted each trial to a&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and derived 95% confidence intervals (Bauer 1972; Hothorn, et al.&#xD;
      2008). Out of the 1000 trials, 792 (79.2%) correctly resulted in a conclusion of&#xD;
      non-inferiority; suggesting that the probability that the trial correctly concludes&#xD;
      non-inferiority is about 80% when the groups follow exactly equivalent distributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the test for Hypothesis 1 concludes noninferiority, the investigators will test for a&#xD;
      difference in overall duration of administration again using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
      Power is approximated by a two-sample t-test calculation. Assuming a standard deviation of&#xD;
      SD=37 hours (corresponding to an interquartile range of 50 to 100 hours), the investigators&#xD;
      expect that a sample size of n=35 provides 80% power to detect a mean group difference of 25&#xD;
      hours with a two-sided alpha of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total enrollment: 70 subjects plus 30 for misplaced catheters or subjects otherwise unable to&#xD;
      be randomized; and subjects who withdraw. This allows for a possible total of 100 subjects.&#xD;
