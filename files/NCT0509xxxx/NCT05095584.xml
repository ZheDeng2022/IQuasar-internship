  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians are routinely required to make decisions about fall risk among lower limb&#xD;
      prosthesis users. For these decisions, clinicians should use valid, reliable, quantitative,&#xD;
      and multidimensional measures of balance test for individuals with lower-limb amputations.&#xD;
      The objective of this study was therefore to establish, validity and reliability for 3 meter&#xD;
      backward tests administered to established unilateral lower-limb amputations. This study&#xD;
      included a total of 30 lower limb amputees [age (18-65) years]. 3 Meter Backward Walking&#xD;
      Test, Rivermead Mobility Index, Timed Up and Go test (TUG) was applied to the patients. The&#xD;
      second evaluation (retest) was carried out by the same physiotherapist two days following the&#xD;
      first evaluation (test) in order to measure test-retest reliability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputees (LLA) were recruited from local prosthetic clinics. The inclusion&#xD;
      criteria were as follows: unilateral transtibial or transfemoral amputation due to traumatic,&#xD;
      dysvascular, or oncologic causes, 18 years of age or older, one or more years of using a&#xD;
      prosthesis (i.e., established users), and could walk independently for minimum 10 m).&#xD;
      Patients unable to ambulate at least 10 m without an upper extremity assistive device (e.g.,&#xD;
      cane), have an orthopedic or neurological disease that might influence balance, with&#xD;
      complications to their contralateral leg (e.g., joint replacement, arthritis, or wounds),&#xD;
      have the severe vision and hearing impairment, amputation of a second limb and individuals&#xD;
      with stump wounds and gait problems were not enrolled in the research. This study was&#xD;
      conducted as a &quot;test-retest&quot; design and the psychometric properties of the 3-m backward walk&#xD;
      test were examined in LLA. The Rivermead Mobility Index, 3-m backward walk test, Berg Balance&#xD;
      Scale, Timed Up, and Go test was applied to the patients. An experienced physiotherapist&#xD;
      performed all these tests. In order to measure test-retest reliability, the second&#xD;
      evaluations (retest) were carried out by the same physiotherapist two days following the&#xD;
      first evaluation (test). The same evaluator collected data in order to avoid the inter-rater&#xD;
      variability error rate between the evaluations. The patient was evaluated at one time of the&#xD;
      day for test and retest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were asked to walk backward within the 3-meter distance marked with black bands&#xD;
      on the floor. Participants were asked to walk backward as soon as possible with the &quot;walk&quot;&#xD;
      command, to stop at the end of 3 meters, and the elapsed time was recorded in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals were allowed to look back if they wanted to. To prevent the individual from&#xD;
      falling during walking backward and to support the individual, the physiotherapist who made&#xD;
      the evaluation walked with an amputee. Measurements were made 3 times and the average time&#xD;
      was recorded. During walking backward, there is a greater feeling of insecurity compared to&#xD;
      walking forward and causes fear of falling. Therefore, the therapist stood approximately half&#xD;
      a meter behind the patient during the test.&#xD;
