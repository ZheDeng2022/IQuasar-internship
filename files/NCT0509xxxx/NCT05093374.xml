      The purpose of this study is to implement quantitative assessment tools for the treatment of&#xD;
      active neovascular AMD patients in a real-world setting in order to provide advantages for&#xD;
      both patients (treatment burden) and healthcare system (scheduling visits/treatments).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a significant burden to health care&#xD;
      systems in industrialized countries. Due to its chronic nature, continuous follow-up and&#xD;
      treatment is needed to prevent significant loss of visual function in patients with nAMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in the pathomechanisms of nAMD&#xD;
      and large multicenter trials have shown that intravitreal application of substances which&#xD;
      intercept the VEGF pathway can interrupt the progression of nAMD and improve the visual&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As every single injection bears the risk of sight-threatening complications and increases the&#xD;
      financial burden to health care providers, several studies have tested different treatment&#xD;
      regimens, to decrease the number of applicated injections without compromising the gains in&#xD;
      visual acuity. Thereby, strict protocols have been compared to flexible &quot;as needed&quot; regimens&#xD;
      (pro re nata, PRN) and regimens with proactive increments of injection intervals (treat and&#xD;
      extend, T&amp;E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have indicated that the outcome of anti-VEGF treatment is better in standardized&#xD;
      clinical trials than in so-called &quot;real world settings&quot;. This is explained by tight exclusion&#xD;
      criteria of sponsored trials, the shorter follow-up time and the small number of patients&#xD;
      that are treated per center, resulting in a better standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRN as well as T&amp;E management showed disadvantages such as significant less vision gain in&#xD;
      PRN and possible over treatment in T&amp;E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, additional treatment criteria were described to improve the patients care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in diagnostic precision by SD-OCT using automated algorithms to accurately measure&#xD;
      fluid volumes in all compartments are solid tools to determine disease activity. They allow&#xD;
      to precisely quantifying the impact of therapeutic parameters on disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter study analyses have shown that the amount of intraretinal fluid has a significant&#xD;
      effect on vision outcome. Subretinal fluid or Pigmentepithelial detachment have been&#xD;
      described to be less important. These findings were the basis for designing an efficient&#xD;
      point-of-care management. Automated quantification of the fluid amount using artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) may serve as a reliable and objective method to determine the personalized&#xD;
      point-of-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prove the efficacy of point-of-care management, prospective studies in real-world settings&#xD;
      are required. More data is required to assess the outcome of real-world settings and find&#xD;
      ways to improve treatment results, when larger amounts of patients are treated and less&#xD;
      resources are available for decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to implement quantitative assessment tools for the treatment of&#xD;
      neovascular AMD patients in a real-world setting in order to provide advantages for both&#xD;
      patients (treatment burden) and healthcare system (scheduling visits/treatments).&#xD;
