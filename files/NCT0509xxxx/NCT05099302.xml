  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental study to determine the&#xD;
      effect of cartoon in reducing pre-operative fear in children aged 4-10 years who came to the&#xD;
      operating room. The data of the study were obtained from children between 4-10 years old who&#xD;
      came to Mersin University Hospital Operating Room Unit between 1 July and 30 August 2020. The&#xD;
      sample size was determined as a total of 116 children, including 58 children for each group.&#xD;
      &quot;Observation Form, Children's Fear Scale (CFS), Tablet Computer, Stopwatch&quot; was used for data&#xD;
      collection. The data were evaluated using percentage, mean, standard deviation, chi-square, t&#xD;
      test, Anova and Tukey advanced analysis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cartoons group; When the children came to the operating room waiting room, the first&#xD;
      stopwatch was started as soon as they entered the room to determine the length of stay in the&#xD;
      waiting room, and it was turned off while they were entering the operating room with the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. Thus, the total length of stay in the room was determined and recorded. The&#xD;
      second stopwatch was started as soon as the child began to cry, and was turned off when the&#xD;
      crying stopped. Thus, the crying time of each child was also evaluated. After each parent&#xD;
      signed the Informed Consent Form, the Interview and Observation Form was filled. Then the&#xD;
      child's heart rate was measured and recorded. The child's fear level was evaluated separately&#xD;
      by the child, parent and observer via CFS and recorded in the data collection form. After the&#xD;
      initial assessment was completed, the child was asked if he wanted to watch cartoons. &quot;Snow&#xD;
      Queen&quot; for girls who want to watch cartoons and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; cartoons for boys started to be&#xD;
      watched by tablet. The period of watching cartoons lasted until the child left the waiting&#xD;
      room. The heart rate was measured just before the child left the waiting room at the time of&#xD;
      surgery. The level of fear was evaluated separately by the child, parent and observer via CFS&#xD;
      and recorded in the form. Then, the child was taken to the operating room with the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and observer. Parents are separated from their children in the waiting room.&#xD;
      After the child who came to the operating room was taken to the operating table, the pulse&#xD;
      rate and the level of fear were evaluated and recorded by the observer via CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: All processing steps were carried out similarly to the cartoon group. In this&#xD;
      group, the option of playing toys was offered instead of cartoons.&#xD;

      The research will be carried out in the Operating Room Unit of X University Hospital. There&#xD;
      are 20 surgical specialists, eight anesthesiologists, 35 nurses, 25 anesthesia technicians,&#xD;
      30 support personnel, and personnel working in 13 different areas (such as secretary,&#xD;
      consumables warehouse manager) in the operating room unit. The personnel working in the unit&#xD;
      working in shifts work in shifts between 08.00-16.00, 16.00-08.00 and 16.00-24.00. There are&#xD;
      16 operating rooms in total in the operating room unit. Apart from these rooms, there are&#xD;
      pre-operative patient waiting room, pre-operative pediatric waiting room and postoperative&#xD;
      patient/children's rooms. There are also rest rooms for the personnel working in the&#xD;
      operating room and a 10-bed reanimation unit. The pre-operative pediatric waiting room is&#xD;
      located at the patient admission entrance of the operating room and is not a sterile area. It&#xD;
      has an average size of 40 m2 and includes a television, two beds, two armchairs and toys.&#xD;
      There are cartoon characters and pictures on the walls of the waiting room. Before the&#xD;
      operation, children spend an average of 5-20 minutes in the children's waiting room after the&#xD;
      operation. is brought first. After the necessary procedures are performed by the preop nurse,&#xD;
      the child is taken to the operating room in the presence of an anesthesiologist and&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated with 95% power, with 10% difference at 0.05 significance&#xD;
      level, taking into account the known score (4.53 ± 3.23) with the G*Power 3.1.5 program. The&#xD;
      sample size was determined as 58 children for each group. A total of 116 children were not&#xD;
      reached. At the end of the study, Post Hoc power analysis will also be carried out in order&#xD;
      to determine the adequacy of the number of children included in the study, and if 95% power&#xD;
      is reached, the data collection process will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of control and study groups; The status of the children to be included in the&#xD;
      study in the control or study group will be determined by using &quot;stratification and&#xD;
      randomization methods with blocks&quot;. In the literature, it has been reported that among the&#xD;
      factors affecting the fear and anxiety experienced by children in interventional procedures,&#xD;
      variables such as age, gender and fear of interventional procedure are included. Accordingly,&#xD;
      block randomization will be applied by stratifying the children as &quot;girl and boy&quot; for the&#xD;
      gender variable and &quot;4 years, 5 years and 6 years and over&quot; for the age variable. 58 children&#xD;
      will be included in each of the research groups. During the data collection process, each&#xD;
      child and his/her family will be taken to the operating room waiting room one by one. This&#xD;
      will prevent children from meeting each other.&#xD;
