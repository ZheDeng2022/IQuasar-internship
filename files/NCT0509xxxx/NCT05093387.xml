      This phase I trial studies the effect of SGT-53, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab in treating&#xD;
      patients with triple negative inflammatory breast that has spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). SGT-53 is a gene therapy that changes the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of&#xD;
      patients' tumor cells to make it easier for the immune system to recognize them. SGT-53&#xD;
      targets the TP53 gene, which is frequently mutated in IBC cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving SGT-53,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, and carboplatin may help the control the disease in patients with triple&#xD;
      negative inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess feasibility of transferrin receptor-targeted liposomal p53 cDNA (SGT-53) with&#xD;
      carboplatin and pembrolizumab in metastatic triple negative inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)&#xD;
      with a Combined Positive Score of &gt;=10 in PD-L1 expression, as measured by rate of successful&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess preliminary activity of SGT-53 with carboplatin and pembrolizumab in metastatic&#xD;
      triple negative IBC with a Combined Positive Score of &gt;= 10 in PD-L1 expression, as measured&#xD;
      by clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease&#xD;
      [SD] &gt;= 6 months using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria version&#xD;
      [v] 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of SGT-53 with carboplatin and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic triple negative IBC with a Combined Positive Score&#xD;
      of &gt;= 10 in PD-L1 expression, as measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) v 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive SGT-53 intravenously (IV) over 90-120 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 3, and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 3.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 5 years from the start of study treatment.&#xD;
