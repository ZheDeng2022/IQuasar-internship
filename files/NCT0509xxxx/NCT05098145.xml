    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability and explore&#xD;
      the efficacy of FCR001 cell therapy in adults with rapidly progressive Diffuse Cutaneous&#xD;
      Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc) at risk for organ failure.&#xD;

      The purpose of this multicenter, single-arm study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      and explore the efficacy of FCR001 cell therapy in adults with rapidly progressive dcSSc at&#xD;
      risk for organ failure. It consists of 2 years of treatment and 3 years of follow-up, with&#xD;
      the primary analysis performed at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCR001 is a cell therapy product that is administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, following&#xD;
      nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning. It consists of mobilized peripheral blood cells,&#xD;
      facilitating cells, and αβ T cells. This therapy is designed to induce donor-specific&#xD;
      tolerance by establishing sustained chimerism and to protect against graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GvHD), the major impediment for advancing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell therapy&#xD;
      (HSCT) as a potential therapy in patients.&#xD;
