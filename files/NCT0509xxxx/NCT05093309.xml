      Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Empowering Community&#xD;
      Pharmacists program on pharmacists' knowledge, perceived barriers, attitudes, confidence, and&#xD;
      intentions regarding naloxone services implementation, as well as change in number of&#xD;
      naloxone prescriptions dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 3-month pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018-2019. Alabama&#xD;
      community pharmacists were recruited by email, phone, fax, and mailed postcards and&#xD;
      randomized to intervention (monthly resources/reminders + educational webinar) or control&#xD;
      (monthly resources/reminders + delayed educational webinar). Outcome measures were assessed&#xD;
      via online surveys at baseline (T1), immediately post-intervention (T2), and 3-months&#xD;
      post-intervention (T3), including: naloxone knowledge (percent correct); perceived barriers,&#xD;
      attitudes, and confidence regarding naloxone services implementation (7-point Likert-type&#xD;
      scale, 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree); and number of naloxone prescriptions&#xD;
      dispensed. Mean differences between control and intervention groups from T1-T3 were assessed&#xD;
      using two-way mixed ANOVA and adjusted analyses were conducted using generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations (GEE) with negative binomial distribution (alpha=0.05).&#xD;

Barriers (20-items) were measured using 7-point Likert-type scales (1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree) and informed by Nielsen et al (2016) and Williams' (2013) Opioid Overdose Attitude Scale (OOAS).</description>

    <description>Confidence in performing naloxone dispensing behaviors was measured via online survey.

    <description>Intention to dispense naloxone or perform naloxone services in the next three months was measured via online survey. The 5-item intention construct was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree and informed by an existing intention measure by Urmie et al (2007).</description>

    <description>The number of naloxone prescriptions dispensed over 3 months before and after the intervention was assessed via self-report at T1 and T3. Participants utilized national drug codes (NDCs) within their pharmacy dispensing software to identify naloxone dispensing information.</description>

Participants were mailed naloxone nasal spray and auto-injector training devices prior to attending the online webinar so that they could follow along during demonstrations.</description>
