  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IOL-capsular complex is formed after cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      implantation.Early postoperative mechanical wrapping of the anterior and posterior capsules&#xD;
      plays a significant role in preventing IOL decentration and tilt, as well as formation of the&#xD;
      IOL-capsular complex which reduces the incidence of posterior cataract opacity. Capsular&#xD;
      tension rings were first introduced in the early 1990s for loosening and tightening the lens&#xD;
      bag and maintaining the equatorial contour of the bag after cataract surgery.Today, capsular&#xD;
      tension rings of many different designs are in use.The capsular tension rings can be used in&#xD;
      eyes with fragile and split zonular fibers, as well as pseudoexfoliation, high myopia, Marfan&#xD;
      syndrome, mature cataract and lens subluxation.The capsular tension ring reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of decentration and tilt of the IOL by reducing capsular contraction. In addition,&#xD;
      multi-focus IOL implantation combine with capsular tension ring result in smaller high-order&#xD;
      aberrations in our eyes compared to cataract surgery with multi-focus IOL implantation&#xD;
      alone.For patients with high myopia, they often have a longer axial length and a larger&#xD;
      capsule diameter, which reduces the rotational stability of the IOL and may lead to tilt&#xD;
      ,decentration and displacement of IOL.Currently, there is no literature guidance to compare&#xD;
      the results of cataract surgery combined with or without capsular tension ring implantation&#xD;
      in patients with high myopia.Our hospital has Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography (&#xD;
      SS-OCT,Casia2, TOMEY, Japan), which can accurately photograph the process of IOL capsule&#xD;
      bending and the changes of lens position after cataract surgery. SS-OCT can be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the influence of capsular tension ring on the dynamic changes of IOL-capsular&#xD;
      complex in patients with high myopia after cataract surgery.&#xD;
