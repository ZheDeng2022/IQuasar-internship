      In the Kingasa study, the investigators will use a factorial design in order to evaluate both&#xD;
      an intervention to increase male partner HIV testing and an intervention for pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women living with HIV to provide real-time HIV VL load and ART adherence&#xD;
      counseling. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate a) whether invitations to wellness&#xD;
      visits increase the proportion of male partners who test for HIV and b) whether POC HIV VL&#xD;
      tests increase viral suppression among pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV. The&#xD;
      research team will also assess the impact of providing male counselor phone call follow-up to&#xD;
      men in the wellness visit arm to encourage linkage to HIV care and prevention after HIV&#xD;
      testing. Women will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive a) standard of care interventions with&#xD;
      an invitation letter for male partners for fast-track visit for HIV testing and laboratory&#xD;
      HIV testing for women at enrollment and every 6 months until 12 months postpartum, b)&#xD;
      invitation letter for male partners for fast track visit for HIV testing and POC VL tests for&#xD;
      women at enrollment and every 6 months until 12 months postpartum; c) invitation letter to&#xD;
      male partners for wellness visits and laboratory-based HIV VL testing for women at enrollment&#xD;
      and every 6 months until 12 months postpartum; and d) invitation letter to male partners for&#xD;
      wellness visits and POC viral load testing for women at enrollment and every 6 months until&#xD;
      12 months post-partum. Women who are randomized to receive POC VL will receive same-day ART&#xD;
      adherence counseling and those randomized to receive lab-based VL will receive VL results at&#xD;
      their next visit with ART adherence counseling based on their VL results.&#xD;

      adherence counseling and those randomized to receive lab based VL will receive VL results at&#xD;
      their next visit with ART adherence counseling based on their VL results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in both arms will receive counseling to minimize social harms associated with status&#xD;
      disclosure and HIV testing, and additional counseling and referral to social support services&#xD;
      when social harms occur. Based on the current Ugandan MOH guidelines to offer HIVST to both&#xD;
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women in ANC clinics, women in both arms will be&#xD;
      provided an HIVST to give to their partner if they choose. They will be trained in the use&#xD;
      and interpretation of the HIVST and be given information about HIV testing and prevention and&#xD;
      care services, which she will give to her partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been designed to address the gap in male partner engagement by using&#xD;
      innovative methods to link men to HIV testing, prevention and care, and thus PMTCT outcomes&#xD;
      for women.&#xD;

    <description>POC viral load testing- women randomized to have POC VL at enrollment, delivery and 6 months post-partum, will have a finger prick to obtain whole blood for the Cepheid Xpert HIV-1 RNA cartridge on the Xpert IV machine with results in 90 minutes. Women who are randomized to POC VL who have VL &gt;200 c/ml will receive additional adherence counseling, following the STREAM protocol, [26] to address the challenges that they are having with ART use. At the delivery visit, infants of women in the POC VL arm will also have viral load testing done.</description>
