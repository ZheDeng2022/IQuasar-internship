  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based interventions to improve linkage and outcomes for heart failure (HF) patients&#xD;
      requires input from stakeholders: patients, community health workers (CHWs), healthcare&#xD;
      staff, and health system administrators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research the investigators will assess a CHW intervention designed to improve linkage&#xD;
      to care for HF patients. This intervention was systematically adapted for use in rural Haiti&#xD;
      in a prior study using the Assessment, Decisions, Administration, Production, Topical&#xD;
      Experts, Integration, Training staff, Testing (ADAPT-ITT) framework. The ADAPT-ITT framework&#xD;
      provides 8 sequential phases to adapt interventions and programs to new target audiences. It&#xD;
      has been applied successfully to the adaptation of several interventions for HIV among&#xD;
      under-resourced communities leading to randomized clinical trials. With the first 6 steps of&#xD;
      the ADAPT-ITT framework completed in a prior study, this protocol outlines the training and&#xD;
      testing of the adapted CHW intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to assessing the feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability of the adapted&#xD;
      intervention through participants' feedback, the investigators will assess its efficacy in&#xD;
      improving HF outcomes. The proposed intervention is targeted at both the patient domain -&#xD;
      through improved peer support - and health system domain - by improving health system&#xD;
      navigation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial involving the training of 6 CHWs in a linkage-to-care intervention&#xD;
      and the testing of the intervention on 30 HF patients. In a prior study, the ADAPT-ITT&#xD;
      framework was used to adapt a CHW-based intervention for post-discharge HF patients in Haiti.&#xD;
      This study represents the last two phases of the ADAPT-ITT framework: Training and Testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include adult HF patients (&gt; 18 years of age), hospitalized for&#xD;
      more than 48 hours, discharged from Hôpital-Universitaire de Mirebalais (HUM), without a&#xD;
      prior clinic visit, living in Mirebalais Commune. Patients will be recruited for study&#xD;
      participation shortly before discharge. A comparison group of 30 HF patients will be&#xD;
      recruited and will not participate in the follow up care intervention. Those patients will be&#xD;
      retrospectively identified from the medical record. The comparison group and will not receive&#xD;
      any intervention. Six experienced CHWs will be trained to conduct the linkage to care&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will include study visits in the form of home visits and phone calls&#xD;
      performed by CHWs during which they will remind patients about upcoming visits, ensure&#xD;
      patient has sufficient medications, review medication schedule and provide education as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life of patients will be assessed with the European Quality of Life 5D (EuroQol 5D) level. ThevEuropean Quality (EQ)-5D descriptive system is a preference-based Health-related quality of life (HRQL) measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The answers given to EQ-5D permit to find 243 unique health states or can be converted into EQ-5D index an utility scores anchored at 0 for death and 1 for perfect health. The EQ-5D questionnaire also includes a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), by which respondents can report their perceived health status with a grade ranging from 0 (the worst possible health status) to 100 (the best possible health status).</description>

    <description>SOC after discharge for HF is to notify patients of a follow-up visit at the hospital/clinic - about 7 days after discharge and provide patients about 30 days of medications at discharge. If a patient does not return for a follow-up appointment, there are no systems to track this missed visit, or to trigger active attempts to contact patients. For patients who come back to their scheduled 7-day visit, there is generally a 14-day visit followed by a 28-day visit.</description>
