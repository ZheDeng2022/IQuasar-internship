    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Stomach Intestinal Pylorus Sparing (SIPS)&#xD;
      as a primary bariatric surgery. In addition, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of SIPS&#xD;
      performed as a revisional surgery following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in which adequate weight&#xD;
      loss was not achieved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of an interventional procedure. Results of patients selecting to&#xD;
      undergo the Stomach Intestinal Pylorus Sparing (SIPS) procedure will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the currently offered bariatric weight loss procedures, patients who present&#xD;
      to our bariatric clinic will be presented with information on the SIPS procedure. All&#xD;
      patients interested in pursuing bariatric surgery will undergo a standardized bariatric&#xD;
      surgery evaluation process as standard of care. Patients interested in undergoing SIPS must&#xD;
      meet the following inclusion/exclusion criteria in addition to the established criteria for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SIPS procedure will be performed as an investigational procedure. The SIPS procedure&#xD;
      involves the creation of a standard sleeve gastrectomy over a 36-40 bougie. Division of the&#xD;
      duodenum post-pylorus is performed, followed by the creation of a common channel 300 cm from&#xD;
      the ileo-cecal valve. A hand-sewn anti-side duodenoileostomy is performed and the anastomosis&#xD;
      tested for leaks through use of endoscopic insufflation and under water air leak test.&#xD;
      Incisions are then closed in standard fashion. The SIPS procedure itself is not a separate&#xD;
      surgery but rather a modification to the standard of care surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients electing to enroll in this study will experience the same pre- and postoperative&#xD;
      care provided as standard of care to all bariatric surgery patients. A pre-operative&#xD;
      evaluation is performed to confirm appropriateness for bariatric surgery and includes:&#xD;
      Psychological evaluation, dietary counseling, and testing of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal health. Pre-operative evaluation also consists of blood work to identify or&#xD;
      confirm obesity-related comorbid conditions. Post-operative care provided following bariatric&#xD;
      surgery ensures that patients progress with adequate pain control and appropriate diet&#xD;
      tolerance before hospital discharge while evaluating and monitoring manifestations of&#xD;
      potential complications.&#xD;
