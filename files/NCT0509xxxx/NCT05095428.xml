    <textblock>
      This pilot RCT will test the preliminary efficacy of an intensive group model of Internal&#xD;
      Family Systems (IFS) called the Program for Alleviating and Resolving Trauma and Stress&#xD;
      (PARTS) compared with a Nature-Based Stress Reduction for Trauma Survivors (NBSR-T) attention&#xD;
      placebo control group at reducing PTSD symptom severity measured by Clinician-Administered&#xD;
      PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). In addition, the effects of the interventions on self-reported PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms, disassociation, and disturbances of self-organization (DSO), as well as mechanisms&#xD;
      of emotion regulation, decentering and self-compassion will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot RCT to test the preliminary efficacy of the Program&#xD;
      for Alleviating and Resolving Trauma and Stress (PARTS) compared with a Nature-Based Stress&#xD;
      Reduction for Trauma Survivors (NBSR-T) control group at reducing PTSD symptom severity&#xD;
      measured by Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary clinical outcomes include the effects of the intervention on self-reported PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms (PCL-5; CAT-PTSD), disassociation (MDI), and disturbances of self-organization&#xD;
      (ITQ), as well as mechanisms, emotion regulation (DERS), self-compassion (SCS-SF), and&#xD;
      decentering (EQ-D) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory aims of the study are to investigate the effects on depression (CAT-DI), mental&#xD;
      health (CAT-MH scales), self-trauma fusion (PRISM-D), perceived stress (PSS), internalized&#xD;
      stigma (ISMI), and interoception (MAIA-2). Additional exploratory outcomes include changes in&#xD;
      outcome variables among PTSD subjects with baseline DSO and those without DSO as defined by&#xD;
      the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be unaware of study hypotheses or arms and will be told the study is for stress reduction among people with trauma/PTSD.&#xD;
The staff member responsible for final determination of study eligibility will be blinded to the randomization sequence.&#xD;
The Data Analyst and methodologist will be blinded to participant identity prior to and during randomization and analysis.&#xD;
The PI will be blinded to participant randomization status for the duration of the study.&#xD;
Medical Review Officer: The MRO will not be blinded and will be responsible for advising on adverse events.&#xD;
Independent Evaluators conducting the CAPS-5 assessments will be blinded to the participants' randomization status. To protect this, independent CAPS-5 evaluators will be located separately from group leaders and therapists. In the event of an unintentional unblinding, a new rater will be assigned to assess the relevant participant(s).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline CAPS-5 at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this study is to examine the preliminary efficacy of a live-online version of the PARTS program on PTSD symptoms measured by reduction in CAPS-5 over 16 weeks. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item questionnaire administered by a trained interviewer and is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; assessment for PTSD diagnosis and symptoms as defined by the DSM-5. This measure also assesses the duration of symptoms, impact of symptoms on aspects of the participant's life, and if the participant meets criteria for the dissociative subtype of PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Self-reported PTSD symptoms (PCL-5) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be sent a link to complete the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which is a self-report measure with 20 items, which is designed to measure PTSD symptom severity over the past month as measured by the DSM-5, in combination with additional diagnostic tools.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Self-reported PTSD symptoms (CAT-PTSD) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Disturbances of Self Organization -- International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ-DSO-9) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) is the first instrument designed to capture the ICD-11 PTSD and Complex PTSD (CPTSD) diagnoses. The last 6 items measure DSO symptoms characteristic of ICD-11 CPTSD. Each set of items have 3 severity of impact on functioning questions. The ITQ-DSO-9 includes just the 6 DSO items with 3 severity questions. The ITQ-DSO-9 will be used monthly for self-report of changes in DSO symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Difficulties in Emotion Regulation (DERS) Scale at 16 Weeks</measure>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) at 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SCS-SF is an abbreviated 12-item form of the original 26-item Self-Compassion Scale. This scale evaluates 6 different aspects of self-compassion: Self-Kindness (e.g., ''I try to be understanding and patient toward those aspects of my personality I don't like''), Self-Judgment (e.g., ''I'm disapproving and judgmental about my own flaws and inadequacies''), Common Humanity (e.g., ''I try to see my failings as part of the human condition''), Isolation (e.g., ''When I feel inadequate in some way, I try to remind myself that feelings of inadequacy are shared by most people&quot;), Mindfulness (e.g., ''When something painful happens I try to take a balanced view of the situation''), and Over-Identification (e.g., ''When I'm feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that's wrong.''). The scale is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Almost never; 5 = Almost always), and negative subscale items are reverse scored.</description>
