  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is focused on clinical anatomy of superficial veins of lower limbs. We are mapping&#xD;
      their anatomy via ultrasonography. We are focusing on saphenopopliteal junction and&#xD;
      communicants between small saphenous vein and great saphenous vein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research project is focused on superficial veins of lower extremities, especially their&#xD;
      clinical anatomy. Superficial veins are located within the compartimentum saphenum. The&#xD;
      function of superficial veins is drainage of intradermal and epifascial spaces. Superficial&#xD;
      veins and their function are fundamental in development of chronic venous disorder. These&#xD;
      veins are physiologically connected with deep venous system via perforators but also between&#xD;
      each other via communicanting veins. Communicanting veins between small saphenous vein and&#xD;
      great saphenous vein have not been described yet, particularly because of their variations.&#xD;
      Clinically important is also the saphenopopliteal junction in the fossa poplitea. This region&#xD;
      features many variations, which were described in many studies. Also, the nomenclature of&#xD;
      saphenopopliteal juction is not standardised in comparison to the saphenofemoral junction.&#xD;
      Moreover, many articles are pointing out that there were not specified all potential drainage&#xD;
      ways of the cranial extension of small saphenous vein (extesio cranialis). Articles are&#xD;
      uniform neither in its prevalence nor in its terminology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge of connections between the superficial and deep venous systems as well as&#xD;
      knowledge of communicanting veins between superficial veins is important for diagnosis and&#xD;
      proper treatment of chronic venous disorder. Variabilities of these veins can play&#xD;
      fundamental role in choosing the proper graft for aorto-coronary bypass grafting. The&#xD;
      ununiformed nomenclature of superficial veins, their communicating veins and junctions can&#xD;
      cause misleading preoperative diagnosis and overlooking of these structures in clinical&#xD;
      practise.&#xD;
