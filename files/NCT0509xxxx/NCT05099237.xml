    <textblock>
      The EMBRaCE-GM study is a multi-cohort trial designed to efficiently evaluate the range of&#xD;
      wearable vital signs monitors that could be used to support patients during cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to determine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if continuous vital signs monitoring is feasible during cancer treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if such monitoring is acceptable to patients undergoing cancer treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine what insights could be made with the data obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-cohort study is essential because there are a huge range of vital signs monitors that&#xD;
      could be useful and a method that allows quickly identification of the devices that are most&#xD;
      acceptable to patients and which offer the most useful information to clinicians is needed.&#xD;
      Similarly, the best device may vary according to the specific disease and the treatment a&#xD;
      patient is offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort in the study will investigate a variety of wearable vital signs monitors in&#xD;
      different patient groups undergoing different treatments. A common data collection platform&#xD;
      will be used for all cohorts with a modular design that allows data collection to be adapted&#xD;
      slightly to meet specific needs for each cohort.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1 in 2 people will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime with over 350,000 new&#xD;
      cancer diagnoses per year (UK). Cancer treatment is a complex process. Patients experience a&#xD;
      range of symptoms as a consequence of their disease and their treatment. Sometimes, the&#xD;
      treatment itself can lead to specific life-threatening complications.Patients who recover may&#xD;
      be left with lasting physical and psychological consequences. A third of those who are&#xD;
      suffering from cancer or who have recovered from it classify their health as 'average to&#xD;
      poor' which is double the rate reported by individuals without health problems. There is an&#xD;
      ongoing need to offer patients personalised support through their cancer journey and to&#xD;
      identify and minimise complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This need for personalised cancer care is emphasised in the NHS Long Term Plan (2019). A key&#xD;
      aim of which is to improve cancer survival but with a focus on giving patients 'more control&#xD;
      over their health' through improved self-management. The long-term plan identifies a need for&#xD;
      digitally-enabled care to empower patients and highlights that artificial intelligence (AI)&#xD;
      and digital clinical decision support could play a role in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearable vital signs monitors offer a solution by which patients can be monitored more&#xD;
      frequently and in more detail during cancer treatment. There is a huge variety of wearable&#xD;
      monitors which range from commercially available well-being trackers to CE marked medical&#xD;
      devices. The devices themselves take many forms which may vary in their acceptability to&#xD;
      patients and utility to health care professionals. The parameters which can be monitored&#xD;
      range from traditional vital signs to more holistic measures of sleep, stress and activity.&#xD;
      Such information could help to identify individuals who are recovering well, those who are&#xD;
      experiencing specific symptoms or those who need extra assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of commercial well-being monitors is growing rapidly and monitors are&#xD;
      becoming progressively more sophisticated. Monitors are also increasingly used in medical&#xD;
      research in conjunction with or in place of formal medical devices. This trend has been&#xD;
      highlighted in a recent systematic review in which the authors noted the need for further&#xD;
      research to understand the validity and acceptability of using such devices in an outpatient&#xD;
      healthcare setting. This is particularly true for patients suffering from cancer, where the&#xD;
      vast majority of wearable device research has focused upon exercise trackers, the breast&#xD;
      cancer tumour type and patients who have already completed their cancer treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, the acceptability of such devices to patients has been shown to vary. The COMPARE&#xD;
      study reported that patients are broadly supportive of artificial intelligence (AI) and&#xD;
      wearable devices whilst a study in patient genitourinary cancer found that acceptability of&#xD;
      wearable devices varied between 100% (40-49 years) and 40% (80-89 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The situation is broadly the same for wearable vital signs monitors which are registered as&#xD;
      medical devices. Whilst these devices have been more extensively studied, the majority of&#xD;
      research does not pertain to cancer patients and no specific use case has been identified in&#xD;
      this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, before wearable vital signs monitors can play a role in cancer care it is&#xD;
      essential that the acceptability of the range of devices is formally evaluated in a variety&#xD;
      of cancer types, in a broad demographic of patients, over the duration of cancer treatment&#xD;
      and in a variety of treatment modalities and settings. The investigators aim to understand&#xD;
      the potential of these devices to offer new insights and learn if the information provided&#xD;
      can be useful to patients and healthcare professionals.&#xD;
