  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess sense of control and catastrophic symptom expectations&#xD;
      as targets for Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT- an intervention focused on changing&#xD;
      behaviors and thoughts) for treatment of pediatric psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES,&#xD;
      episodes resembling epileptic seizures but with no medical explanation). 11-18-year-olds&#xD;
      diagnosed with PNES will engage in twelve sessions of ReACT. Sense of control over actions&#xD;
      will be measured by the magic and turbulence task, a well-validated measure of sense of&#xD;
      control. Participants will complete the cold pressor test (CPT) in which participants hold&#xD;
      their hand in cool water for as long as possible up to 3 minutes. Catastrophic symptom&#xD;
      expectations in response to the CPT will be measured by Pain Catastrophizing Scale for&#xD;
      Children (PCS-C) pain tolerance (time with hand in water) and cortisol response. Target&#xD;
      assessments will occur 7 days before treatment, 7 days after 8th treatment session, 7 days&#xD;
      after 12th treatment session, 6 months and 12 months after the 12th treatment session. PNES&#xD;
      frequency will be measured from 30 days before to 12 months after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PNES participants and their parent come to our laboratory for a baseline visit, 4 follow-up&#xD;
      visits and 12 therapy sessions. Half of the participants will be randomized to receive 2&#xD;
      booster therapy sessions. Participants must provide EEG results indicating a diagnosis of&#xD;
      psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial visit, participants and their parent will complete several questionnaires&#xD;
      assessing demographics, mood and suicidality, relationships with friends and family, as well&#xD;
      as past and current PNES symptoms. They will also complete the childhood trauma&#xD;
      questionnaire. The treatment targets (sense of control and catastrophic symptom&#xD;
      expectations), will be measured by the magic and turbulence computer task and pain tolerance,&#xD;
      PCS-C and cortisol response to the CPT, respectively. After completing the CPT, participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a pain relief lotion or a pain sensitivity lotion. Participants&#xD;
      will then repeat the CPT with the lotion applied to their hand. PNES diaries will be&#xD;
      completed to assess PNES frequency over the previous 30 days. The baseline lab visit will&#xD;
      last about 3 hours. Saliva will be collected over 3 time points before and after each CPT to&#xD;
      measure cortisol response to the CPT. Participants will also collect 2 saliva samples 24&#xD;
      hours later to serve as a baseline outside of the laboratory setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then be scheduled to return in one week for their first of 12 sessions&#xD;
      of ReACT. The first ReACT session will last a maximum of two hours, and the following eleven&#xD;
      sessions will be scheduled weekly and will each last one hour. The following 11 sessions are&#xD;
      currently conducted via telehealth due to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess treatment dose, participants will return one week after the 8th treatment session&#xD;
      and 12th treatment sessions. Long-term follow-up at 6 months and 12 months after treatment&#xD;
      will be conducted to complete follow-up assessment of the targets (sense of control and&#xD;
      catastrophic symptom expectations), FS frequency and questionnaires. Each of these sessions&#xD;
      will last 2 hours. PNES frequency will be measured from 30 days before treatment to 12 months&#xD;
      after treatment through PNES diaries completed by the parent and the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, half of the participants will be randomized to receive 2 booster therapy&#xD;
      sessions at 3 months and 9 months after the end of treatment. Each of these sessions will&#xD;
      last one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls are matched to participants with PNES based on age (+ or - 1 year), gender,&#xD;
      race and family income. Healthy controls and their parent come for 1 baseline laboratory&#xD;
      visit and a follow up visit 13 weeks after the baseline visit. The baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      appointments for healthy controls will be identical to the visits for children with PNES.&#xD;
