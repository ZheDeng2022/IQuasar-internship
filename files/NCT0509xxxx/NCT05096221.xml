    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene transfer therapy in boys with DMD. It&#xD;
      is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants who are randomized&#xD;
      to the placebo arm will have an opportunity for treatment with gene transfer therapy at the&#xD;
      beginning of the second year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is ambulatory and from 4 to under 8 years of age at time of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definitive diagnosis of DMD based on documented clinical findings and prior genetic&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to cooperate with motor assessment testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable daily dose of oral corticosteroids for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening,&#xD;
             and the dose is expected to remain constant throughout the study (except for&#xD;
             modifications to accommodate changes in weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  rAAVrh74 antibody titers are not elevated as per protocol-specified requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to gene therapy, investigational medication, or any treatment designed to&#xD;
             increase dystrophin expression within protocol specified time limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormality in protocol-specified diagnostic evaluations or laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any other clinically significant illness, medical condition, or&#xD;
             requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of the Investigator creates&#xD;
             unnecessary risk for gene transfer.&#xD;

        Other inclusion or exclusion criteria could apply.&#xD;
