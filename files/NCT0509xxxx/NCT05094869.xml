      This prospective cohort study is initiated to evaluate the compliance improvement to the&#xD;
      standardized follow-up and clinical management in the population of compensatory hepatitis B&#xD;
      cirrhosis with a mobile health application (APP). Patients were enrolled and divided into APP&#xD;
      self-management group (APP only ) and APP intelligent-management group (APP and online&#xD;
      interaction). The compliance to the standardized follow-up and clinical management (every six&#xD;
      months) under the two clinical management modes would be evaluated and compared with the&#xD;
      history data extracted from the platform of China Registry of Hepatitis B (CR-Hep B).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standardized follow-up and clinical management in the population of compensatory hepatitis B&#xD;
      cirrhosis is important in the prevention of liver cancer. In the clinical practice, follow-up&#xD;
      every six months are usually recommended. This prospective cohort study is initiated to&#xD;
      evaluate the compliance improvement to the standardized follow-up and clinical management&#xD;
      with a health management application (APP). 4000 patients who have registered on the platform&#xD;
      of China Registry of Hepatitis B (CR-Hep B) and been diagnosed as compensatory hepatitis B&#xD;
      cirrhosis would be recruited in the study. They were divided into two groups according to&#xD;
      whether they use the APP and whether there is online interaction between doctors and&#xD;
      patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. APP self-management group (APP only, N=1000): Patients would register on the APP and&#xD;
           visit the clinics according to the routine practice and guidelines. During the study,&#xD;
           the APP would regularly send messages including the follow-up reminder (manually set up&#xD;
           by the patients on the APP), medication reminder, health education knowledge, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. APP intelligent-management group (APP and online interaction, N=3000): Patients would&#xD;
           register on the APP and visit the clinics according to the routine practice and&#xD;
           guidelines. During the study, the APP would regularly send messages including the&#xD;
           follow-up reminder (automatically set up by the APP), medication reminder, health&#xD;
           education knowledge, etc. The doctors will evaluate their disease progression every six&#xD;
           months through the APP and guide patients' clinical practice accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in these two groups would be followed up for 2 years after enrollment. Besides,&#xD;
      history data of another 4000 Patients who have been on the platform of China Registry of&#xD;
      Hepatitis B (CR-Hep B) and been diagnosed as compensatory hepatitis B cirrhosis would be&#xD;
      extracted and serve as the control group (No APP and No online interaction, N=4000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compliance to the standardized follow-up and clinical management (every six months) under&#xD;
      the three clinical management modes would be evaluated.&#xD;
