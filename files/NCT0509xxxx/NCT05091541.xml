  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-armed, open-label,multicenter Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of CT120 in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture CT120. Bridging therapy is allowed&#xD;
      between PBMC collection and lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide was performed for three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single dose infusion of CT120. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum&#xD;
      of 2 years after CT120 infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be&#xD;
      followed for up to 15 years after CT120 infusion.&#xD;
