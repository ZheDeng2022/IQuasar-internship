  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Throughout the course of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 250,000 service members&#xD;
      sustained traumatic brain injuries, mostly characterized as mild traumatic brain injuries&#xD;
      (mTBI) or concussions. While most with mTBI recover over days to weeks, a significant&#xD;
      percentage continue to experience post-concussive symptoms such as headaches, cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties, and dizziness for months to years. As a result, treatment of post-concussive&#xD;
      symptoms after mTBI is of significant importance in the Department of Defense and Veterans&#xD;
      healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that cognitive rehabilitation can be effective for individuals&#xD;
      with mTBI, including Service Members and Veterans with post concussive symptoms. Cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation is a type of treatment in which patients work with a therapist to improve&#xD;
      everyday memory and thinking skills and develop strategies to reduce the impact of cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties in their everyday lives. While these treatments have great potential benefits,&#xD;
      protocols studied to date are time intensive, requiring up to 60 hours of treatment. These&#xD;
      time demands are impractical for many Service Members and Veterans, and place a time-burden&#xD;
      on clinics providing the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study proposes to identify key ingredients of an evidence-based cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol to develop a streamlined version that is feasible and acceptable to&#xD;
      Service Members and Veterans. This briefer protocol will increase the number of Service&#xD;
      Members and Veterans who can access treatment. To accomplish this goal the investigators will&#xD;
      first spend six months analyzing manualized treatments from a successful cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention developed for Service Members. The investigators will analyze&#xD;
      manuals using a framework developed to identify active ingredients in rehabilitation. Based&#xD;
      on those results the investigators will develop a manualized streamlined treatment protocol,&#xD;
      which the investigators will deliver to 25 Service Members and 50 Veterans over 18 months in&#xD;
      person or via telehealth. The investigators will determine feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      this intervention, and collect preliminary efficacy data. The project addresses access to&#xD;
      therapy services and enhanced treatment compliance, a key barrier to participation in&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation by Veterans and Service Members with TBI. Additionally, although&#xD;
      this study focuses on Service Members and Veterans with mTBI, the investigators expect that&#xD;
      this streamlined intervention can also be translated to civilian populations with mTBI.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed work addresses the FY17/18 PH/TBIRP CTRR-CTA Focus Area of Cognitive&#xD;
      Rehabilitation. The study will generate new knowledge about optimal cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      prescription patterns, specifically frequency (number of days), intensity (number of hours&#xD;
      per day), and type (active ingredients). The study outcome will be a treatment protocol&#xD;
      (STAR-C) that can be delivered efficiently and effectively in person or via telehealth, to&#xD;
      minimize functional limitations after mTBI and maximize treatment accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STAR-C study has features of a pragmatic trial: all individuals with mTBI are invited to&#xD;
      enroll, regardless of co-morbidities; the primary outcome is clinically meaningful and does&#xD;
      not require special equipment or tests; aspects of the intervention will be flexible so&#xD;
      clinicians can tailor intervention to their clients; and there are no formal strategies to&#xD;
      ensure compliance. Also consistent with pragmatic trial methods, the investigators will&#xD;
      include individuals from heterogeneous practice settings (DoD and VA), and use&#xD;
      standard-of-care outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a widely acknowledged cause of morbidity among&#xD;
      Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) warfighters. Several recent&#xD;
      studies provide incidence estimates for mTBI among combat deployed troops serving in support&#xD;
      of OEF/OIF. In a recent population cohort study, 4.9% of over 2,500 Army infantry soldiers&#xD;
      reported mTBI with loss of consciousness, and another 10.3% reported mTBI with altered mental&#xD;
      status. In one cross-sectional prevalence study of OEF/OIF Service Members, 12% of the sample&#xD;
      of over 2,200 respondents to a mail survey reported a history consistent with mTBI during&#xD;
      deployment. Recent surveillance data obtained by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center&#xD;
      (DVBIC) from electronic medical records indicate that over the past 10 years, more than&#xD;
      250,000 active duty Service Members have reported sustaining a TBI, with the majority of&#xD;
      these being mild in severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Service Members separate from active duty or reserve duty status, their treatment can&#xD;
      transition to the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which also tracks epidemiologic data.&#xD;
      In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, 7% of Iraq and Afghanistan War Veterans seen in the VHA system&#xD;
      carried a diagnosis of TBI. According to Taylor et al, the prevalence of TBI diagnosis in the&#xD;
      VA healthcare System has remained consistent since tracking began around 2009, despite&#xD;
      changes in incidence in the DoD following the reduction of combat operations in Iraq and&#xD;
      Afghanistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While mTBI is generally associated with a good prognosis for recovery, a percentage of&#xD;
      individuals experience persistent symptoms following mTBI such as headache, dizziness and/or&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties. The frequency of functional cognitive complaints and protracted&#xD;
      course of symptoms are especially common in individuals with mTBI and mental health&#xD;
      comorbidities. Regardless of the exact etiology of the symptoms, long-term cognitive&#xD;
      complaints can impact Service Members' ability to carry out their military duties and&#xD;
      negatively impact military readiness. Given that the central tenet of military medicine is to&#xD;
      maintain force readiness, symptoms that affect a Service Member's ability to carry out their&#xD;
      duties without restriction remain an important focus of treatment within the DoD Healthcare&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those individuals transitioning to the VA Healthcare system, effective treatment of&#xD;
      post-concussive symptoms remains a priority. Taylor and colleagues demonstrated that VA&#xD;
      healthcare utilization and associated costs were higher in individuals with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      TBI compared to those without such a diagnosis (Cohen's d = .40), and although the prevalence&#xD;
      of TBI diagnosis has remained constant, the number of individuals transitioning to the VA&#xD;
      continues to rise. The US Department of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Health Administration&#xD;
      (VHA) have invested significant resources in clinical treatment and treatment research for&#xD;
      mTBI to address this important need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that cognitive rehabilitation can help reduce functional limitations&#xD;
      for individuals with persistent cognitive symptoms after mTBI. This includes evidence from&#xD;
      the recent DVBIC-funded Study of Cognitive Rehabilitation Effectiveness (SCORE). SCORE was a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with four treatment arms: psychoeducational intervention,&#xD;
      computer-based cognitive rehabilitation, therapist-directed cognitive rehabilitation, and a&#xD;
      combination of therapist-directed cognitive rehabilitation plus psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. The largest gains in functional gains were in the last two groups - i.e., when&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation was delivered by a clinician, with or without psychotherapy - and&#xD;
      benefits were maintained 3 months after treatment. SCORE was an important advance in&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation for mTBI, but it had one significant limitation: the study protocol&#xD;
      required 10 hours of individual and group therapy per week for 6 weeks. Such an extended time&#xD;
      commitment limits the number of Service Member s and Veterans who could access treatment and&#xD;
      increases the likelihood of patient dropout before treatment completion. As such, a shorter&#xD;
      version of SCORE would be more practical, but until recently the investigators did not have a&#xD;
      systematic method of identifying elements to retain or omit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new system for classifying rehabilitation treatments, the Rehabilitation Treatment&#xD;
      Specification System, offers a mechanism for streamlining SCORE based on treatment&#xD;
      principles, treatment theory, and empirical evidence. The RTSS was developed by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary group of rehabilitation specialists, to provide a clear and rigorous system&#xD;
      for defining, classifying, and measuring rehabilitation treatments. The RTSS project was&#xD;
      motivated by the lack of information about rehabilitation treatment methods, not only in&#xD;
      research studies but also in clinical practice. While there are several systems for&#xD;
      describing patient and study characteristics, and systems for classifying goals of treatment,&#xD;
      these systems describe the who and what of rehabilitation. The treatments themselves,&#xD;
      however, often are described only in terms of duration of a particular service (e.g., hours&#xD;
      of speech therapy), or by the problems they are intended to treat (e.g., cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation). What these systems do not tell us is the how of rehabilitation: what the&#xD;
      clinician does or provides to a patient in a therapy session. The RTSS is intended to&#xD;
      organize treatments according to these clinician actions, specifically clinician actions that&#xD;
      are known or hypothesized to account for changes in patient functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of the RTSS to SCORE will improve efficiency and effectiveness in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ensuring a match between ingredients and targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identifying themes across treatment activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adding volitional ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Specific Aims/Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aim is to use the RTSS to develop a streamlined version of the SCORE protocol&#xD;
      (STAR-C), and then administer the STAR-C protocol to Service Members and Veterans with mTBI&#xD;
      in person and via telehealth. The long-term goal is to improve access to cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation services for Service Members, Veterans, and civilians with mTBI, to maximize&#xD;
      return to activities and participation in meaningful life roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #1: To identify core ingredients and targets in SCORE and use these to develop&#xD;
           a Core-SCORE protocol that can be delivered 3 hours per week X 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #2: To complete an implementation study of STAR-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective #3: To collect preliminary effectiveness data for a future clinical trial&#xD;
           comparing in-person STAR-C treatment to telehealth delivery. Because access to services&#xD;
           can be a major barrier for Service Members and Veterans, the investigators see this as a&#xD;
           critical next step to increase access to care to Service Members and Veterans, as well&#xD;
           as potential translation to civilian populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose an implementation study, as recommended when a previous&#xD;
      intervention (i.e. SCORE cognitive rehabilitation trial) was successful but in a different&#xD;
      setting than the one of interest. The SCORE results serve as pilot data for this study. The&#xD;
      proposed study has three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I (6 months): Analyze SCORE protocol using the RTSS manual to identify active&#xD;
           ingredients and targets; and develop and manualize STAR-C protocol. Concurrently with&#xD;
           protocol development and manualization, The investigators will complete all regulatory&#xD;
           and Human Subjects procedures required for Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II (18 months): Implement STAR-C. Once patients are referred and pass the&#xD;
           screening, they will be invited to participate in the study and consented using&#xD;
           standard, approved procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase III (6 months): Complete collection of post-intervention implementation outcome&#xD;
           and effectiveness data. Prepare application for a clinical trial comparing in-person to&#xD;
           telehealth delivery of STAR-C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population will be 75 adults with mTBI: 25 active duty Service Members (SMs) from&#xD;
      the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Service at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), and 50 Veterans&#xD;
      from the San Antonio Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center at the South Texas Veterans Health Care&#xD;
      System. mTBI will be defined according to criteria in the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline&#xD;
      for the Management of Concussion-Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and the Ohio State University&#xD;
      TBI Identification Method (OSU TBI-ID). The treatment sample will consist of consecutive&#xD;
      referrals to the clinic who meet inclusion criteria and consent to participate. Although our&#xD;
      target enrollment is 75 individuals, the investigators anticipate that there will be some&#xD;
      expected attrition. To address this issue, the investigators will recruit up to 34 SMs and 68&#xD;
      Veterans to ensure recruitment of the target population.&#xD;
