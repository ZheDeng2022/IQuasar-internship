      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of PF-06882961, administered at 2&#xD;
      steady-state dose levels, on the PK of single doses of atorvastatin (20 mg) or midazolam (5&#xD;
      mg), administered separately, in healthy adult male and female participants (Part A), or an&#xD;
      OC in healthy PM female participants (Part B).&#xD;
