      The objective of this study is to establish reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      to support an FDA premarket approval (PMA) application for the SeQuent® Please ReX™ Drug&#xD;
      Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter as indicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a prospective, randomized, multi-center IDE study comparing the SeQuent&#xD;
      Please ReX to plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). The study will be conducted at up to 30&#xD;
      investigational sites and enroll up to 296 patients with in-stent restenosis of a metallic&#xD;
      coronary stent who are suitable candidates for PTCA procedures. After consent and assessment&#xD;
      of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      SeQuent Please ReX or POBA arm based on a 2:1 randomization ratio. Subjects will return for&#xD;
      follow-up through 5 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note: Bifurcation lesions are not excluded; however, the main branch should be treated per&#xD;
