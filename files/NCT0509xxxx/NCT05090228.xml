      This study investigates damage of the right cardiac chamber in adult patients with a&#xD;
      congenital heart defect involving the pulmonary valve (the heart valve between the right&#xD;
      cardiac chamber and the lungs). The investigators want to investigate if novel, less invasive&#xD;
      techniques are feasible to assess damage of this right cardiac chamber, to improve follow-up&#xD;
      and timing of intervention (valve replacement) in this group of patients.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In congenital heart disease the right heart is often affected, in contrast to acquired heart&#xD;
      disease where the left ventricle and left sided valves are most often affected. In congenital&#xD;
      patients, the right heart problem is most common linked to dysfunction of the pulmonary&#xD;
      valve. In these congenital patients, with defects such as Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), Double&#xD;
      Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV), Pulmonary Valve Atresia, and Ventricular Septum Defect (VSD),&#xD;
      the primary origin of the problem are dysplastic Pulmonary Valves (PV) and Right Ventricle&#xD;
      Outflow Tract Obstruction (RVOTO). Often these valves or obstructions are excised to be&#xD;
      replaced directly or in a later stage. Until the end '90s common therapy was to cut out the&#xD;
      pulmonary valve and leave patients without pulmonary valve for 10 to 20 years. This resulted&#xD;
      in a pendular flow between right ventricle and pulmonary arteries. This works because the&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance is low and therefore inflow is easy. There is also a congenital&#xD;
      group in which the primary problem was left sided, but a right-sided problem is created by&#xD;
      therapy. Since 20 years the Ross procedure is used for congenital aortic valve stenosis. The&#xD;
      pulmonary valve is used in childhood to replace the aortic valve, and needs to be replaced in&#xD;
      adolescence by a homograft (graft with human donor valve).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both these groups (repeat) pulmonary valve replacement is necessary, at some stage, with&#xD;
      an open procedure; Pulmonary Valve Replacement (PVR) or catheter procedure; Percutaneous&#xD;
      Pulmonary Valve Insertion (PPVI), a method available since 2000. Because these valves only&#xD;
      last for 10 to 20 years, timing of intervention is very important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last 10 years efforts have been done to delineate the best moment for pulmonary valve&#xD;
      replacement. The aim is to prevent right ventricular failure due to pressure overload&#xD;
      (stenosis of homograft), volume overload (absence of PV after excision or insufficiency of&#xD;
      homograft) or a combination of pressure- and volume-overload, which is believed to be most&#xD;
      malignant. In the past emphasis was paid to onset of symptoms instead of preventing right&#xD;
      ventricular damage. Because symptoms in right ventricular failure are linked to the 'point of&#xD;
      no return' (when the right ventricle doesn't fully recover after pulmonary valve&#xD;
      replacement), most likely a better strategy is to intervene before symptoms arise. To be able&#xD;
      to make reliable criteria for valve replacement we need to better understand the anatomical&#xD;
      and functional impairments of the right ventricle and link this to histopathological changes.&#xD;
      The investigators believe myocardial fibrosis is correlated to this 'point of no return'. In&#xD;
      the last decades knowledge concerning RV volumes and function, electrocardiographic and&#xD;
      exercise capacity has grown. But, the relation between volumes, function and histopathology&#xD;
      is missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: to investigate functional and histopathological changes of the right&#xD;
      ventricle before and after PVR or PPVI. To investigate if non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      RV-remodeling including CMR-T1rho mapping is possible and validate this with the golden&#xD;
      standard of histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to investigate changes in parameters, using echocardiography,&#xD;
      electrocardiography, biomarkers, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients undergoing&#xD;
      PVR or PPVI.&#xD;
