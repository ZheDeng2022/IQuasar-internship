  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital myopathies (CM) is a large group of muscle disorders, presenting with hypotonia&#xD;
      and non-progressive generalised muscle weakness, which can lead to motor developmental&#xD;
      delay.More than 20 genes can cause CM and currently there is no curative treatment for this&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case reports and a smaller study have previous reported that oral salbutamol has benefited&#xD;
      subjects with different types of congenital myopathies by increasing their muscle&#xD;
      strength.The exact effect of salbutamol in muscle cells isn't exactly known but it has been&#xD;
      hypothesized to have an anabolic effect by triggering different pathways inside the muscle&#xD;
      cells which increase cell proliferation, decrease apoptosis, decreases proteolysis and&#xD;
      increases protein synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is evaluate if daily oral salbutamol can increase the muscle function&#xD;
      and muscle strength in these patients after 6 months on treatment, compared to no treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesise that congenital myopathy subjects treated with daily oral salbutamol will&#xD;
      increase in their motor function measure 32 test (MFM32) with at least 3 points after 6&#xD;
      months of treatment as compared to no treatment. We have calculated that a sample size of 20&#xD;
      subjects is needed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Congenital myopathy subjects will be recruited from the whole of Sweden and the study will be&#xD;
      performed at the Sahlgrenska university hospital in Gothenburg Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects must have clinical symptoms consistent with congenital myopathy and have a&#xD;
      verified mutation in a gene known to cause congenital myopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening period of 6 months the eligible subjects will be randomised into two&#xD;
      groups, group A and group B . During period 1, group A will receive oral salbutamol 3 times&#xD;
      daily and the group B will have no treatment.They will be evaluated after 6 months. Then&#xD;
      after a washout period of 1 month, Period 2 will begin where the groups will cross-over, i.e&#xD;
      group A will have no treatment and group B will receive oral salbutamol 3 times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total each subject will be evaluated 5 times during 19 months with the same battery of&#xD;
      muscle function and strength tests performed each time.&#xD;
