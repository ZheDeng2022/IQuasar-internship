  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who are scheduled to have open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) will be asked to&#xD;
      take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if placing Microlyte (which is a dissolvable sheet&#xD;
      coated in silver) on the surgical incision is better than placing nothing on the surgical&#xD;
      incision when it comes to decreasing the chance of surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on&#xD;
      surgical incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 280 participants will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for about 90 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to assess the impact of Microlyte-AGÂ® (Imbed Biosciences, Fitchburg,&#xD;
      WI), a silver-coated bioabsorbable matrix, on surgical site infection (SSI) on patients&#xD;
      undergoing clean open ventral hernia repair (OVHR) at Carolinas Medical Center/Atrium Health&#xD;
      (Charlotte, NC), Prisma Health-Upstate (Greenville, SC), and Mission Health/HCA Healthcare&#xD;
      (Asheville, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who agree to participate in the study will undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information will be collected, including demographics, past medical and surgical history, and&#xD;
      hospital outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, participants will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups listed&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: The study device will be cut into strips and placed in the surgical incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Nothing will be placed in the surgical incision&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, the surgical incision will then be closed with absorbable sutures, which is&#xD;
      the usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen by the study doctor 30 and 90 days after surgery for a checkup. At&#xD;
      the 30-day visit, participants will have a physical examination, and the study doctor will&#xD;
      check to see if any complications have happened since the last visit. The 90-day follow-up&#xD;
      visit can be done in person or over the telephone and will be done to check and see if there&#xD;
      have been any problems with the healing of the surgical incision.&#xD;
