      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-blinded, randomized study of up to 10 study&#xD;
      subjects undergoing bilateral gynecomastia surgery with Renuvion APR System used as an&#xD;
      adjunct procedure on one side. The study will be conducted at up to 3 investigational centers&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-blinded, randomized study of up to 10 study&#xD;
      subjects undergoing bilateral gynecomastia surgery with Renuvion APR System used as an&#xD;
      adjunct procedure on one side. The study will be conducted at up to 3 investigational centers&#xD;
      in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, the grade of gynecomastia will be recorded by side, male chest measurements will&#xD;
      be taken, and pre-surgery photographs taken in the frontal, lateral, and oblique views.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gynecomastia surgery and Renuvion APR System use will be as per investigator's standard&#xD;
      clinical practice. During the procedure, fat transfer and treatment of the lateral chest&#xD;
      and/or axilla is not allowed. The Renuvion APR System will be used on one side only. The&#xD;
      treated side will be randomized and the patient will be blinded as to which side of the chest&#xD;
      received Renuvion. Procedure data and adverse events will be captured. Endermology is not&#xD;
      allowed post-procedure. Post-procedure compression will be used for 2-3 weeks with a standard&#xD;
      compression vest for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up images, grade of gynecomastia, and male chest measurements will be taken at&#xD;
      D30/D90/D180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All images will be assessed for correct identification of Renuvion-treated side by blinded&#xD;
      Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPR) following the D180 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following study participation, the subject will be offered an optional balancing treatment to&#xD;
      the side not previously treated with Renuvion.&#xD;
