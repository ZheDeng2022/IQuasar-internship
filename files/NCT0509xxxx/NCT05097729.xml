  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to examine the effects of Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (TMS) on hippocampal network connectivity and pain levels in individuals with&#xD;
      pain due to knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) pain is one of the most prevalent causes of chronic pain worldwide.&#xD;
      Symptoms can last from months to a lifetime, severely impacting patients' quality of life.&#xD;
      New strategies - including non-invasive brain stimulation techniques - have shown promise for&#xD;
      sustained pain relief, yet evidence on their reliability and efficacy is limited. Apkarian&#xD;
      et. al have previously shown that the dorsal hippocampus plays a central role in pain&#xD;
      analgesia; thus, the study aim is to test whether non-invasively enhancing dorsal hippocampus&#xD;
      activity is a useful new strategy for pain relief in knee OA patients. This study will&#xD;
      recruit 35 patients with chronic OA pain for &gt; 6 months. Each participant will receive 3&#xD;
      rounds of different treatment modalities in a cross-over manner. Each treatment modality will&#xD;
      consist of 5 daily consecutive rTMS sessions followed by a 2-weeks wash-out period.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be completed prior to and following each intervention, and after each&#xD;
      treatment round. Participants will be trained to use a pain electronic application&#xD;
      (smartphone-based tool to rate pain intensity and mood on NRS scales, as well as indicate&#xD;
      rescue medication use, developed in our lab). They will be asked to use this application for&#xD;
      7-10 days prior to the first round of intervention and during the study duration.&#xD;

    <description>The brain stimulation can be delivery using different devices; in this project a MagPro X100 stimulator connected to a MagPro Cool-B65 liquid-cooled butterfly coil (MagVenture A/S, Farum, Denmark) will be used. Resting motor threshold (M1-rTMS) will be determined during the visit 1 or visit 2 and used along all visits. The rTMS pulse sequences and intensities used are all within the published safety guidelines</description>
