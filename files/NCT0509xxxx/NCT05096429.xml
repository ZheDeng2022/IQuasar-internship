  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this project are to leverage surveillance data to predict future overdose&#xD;
      outbreaks, and to evaluate the impact of a randomized, statewide, community-level&#xD;
      intervention trial to target overdose prevention programs to neighborhoods at highest risk of&#xD;
      future overdose deaths. This study develops and tests an opioid overdose forecasting tool,&#xD;
      which will allow other states to identify and deploy interventions to communities at highest&#xD;
      risk of opioid-related death. The findings from this study have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly improve the allocation of resources to curb the opioid overdose epidemic in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overdose deaths have skyrocketed in the United States since 1999. The epidemic has prompted&#xD;
      widespread federal and state actions, yet the number of people who die of an overdose&#xD;
      continues to increase. In light of the accelerating and rapidly evolving overdose epidemic,&#xD;
      new strategies are needed to identify communities most at risk, and to utilize resources more&#xD;
      effectively to curb overdose deaths. To address these public health priorities, we will&#xD;
      develop a forecasting tool to predict overdose deaths before they occur, and then conduct a&#xD;
      randomized, statewide, community-level intervention to evaluate the impact of resource&#xD;
      targeting based on these predictions. The study will take place in Rhode Island, a state with&#xD;
      the 10th highest rate of overdose fatality in 2016. The study has two phases. First, we will&#xD;
      develop a predictive analytics model that forecasts future overdose mortality at the&#xD;
      neighborhood-level, using publicly available information and data from a multicomponent&#xD;
      overdose surveillance system. This tool, called PROVIDENT (Preventing Overdose using&#xD;
      Information and Data from the Environment) will be used to predict the likelihood of future&#xD;
      overdose deaths in every neighborhood across Rhode Island. As all data to be analyzed as part&#xD;
      of this study is collected through ongoing public health surveillance activities and the use&#xD;
      of protected health information involves no more than a minimal risk to the privacy of&#xD;
      individuals, the institutional review board (IRB) of record approved a waiver of research&#xD;
      participants' authorization for use/disclosure of information about them for research&#xD;
      purposes, in accordance with 45 CFR ยง 164.512(i)(2)(iv). Next, we will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      policy experiment to evaluate whether targeting overdose prevention interventions to&#xD;
      neighborhoods at highest risk reduces overdose morbidity and mortality. The state's&#xD;
      department of health will receive PROVIDENT model predictions for half of the 39 cities/towns&#xD;
      in Rhode Island. Within these cities/towns, the health department will work with stakeholders&#xD;
      to target overdose prevention interventions to neighborhoods with the highest predicted&#xD;
      probability of future overdose deaths. Interventions include efforts to: (1) prevent&#xD;
      high-risk prescribing (through academic detailing and other educational efforts); (2) expand&#xD;
      access to opioid agonist therapy, including buprenorphine and methadone; (3) increase&#xD;
      naloxone distribution (through community and pharmacy-based efforts); and (4) expand&#xD;
      street-based peer recovery coaching and referrals. Control cities/towns will continue to&#xD;
      receive these same interventions, but will not receive information about the neighborhoods at&#xD;
      the highest predicted risk of overdose. Fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose rates in the&#xD;
      control cities/towns will be compared to those that received the PROVIDENT model predictions.&#xD;
      To achieve these aims, we will leverage a unique partnership between an academic institution&#xD;
      and a state's health department, which allows for unprecedented access to and sharing of&#xD;
      population-based overdose surveillance data. Our results will improve public health&#xD;
      decision-making and inform resource allocation to communities that should be prioritized for&#xD;
      evidence-based prevention, treatment, recovery, and overdose rescue services. If found to be&#xD;
      effective, the PROVIDENT forecasting model will be disseminated to other states, which could&#xD;
      adapt the tool to guide resource allocation and maximize public health impact. In sum, this&#xD;
      project is highly responsive to a top research priority of the National Institute on Drug&#xD;
      Abuse, and directly addresses one of the nation's most challenging public health crises.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the municipal-level rate of fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses. Fatal overdoses will be defined as drug-related deaths deemed accidental by a state medical examiner. The location of these overdose events will be aggregated to the city/town level. Non-fatal overdoses will be defined as an Emergency Department (ED) visit for a suspected overdose reported through the state's 48-Hour Overdose Reporting System. Since patient outcomes are recorded, patients who did not survive or who were dead upon arrival will be excluded to avoid double-counting.</description>

An interactive, web-based tool will be developed to visualize the PROVIDENT model predictions. Municipalities assigned to the treatment arm will receive neighborhood risk predictions from the PROVIDENT model, and state agencies and community-based organizations will direct resources to neighborhoods identified as high risk. Municipalities assigned to the control arm will continue to receive surveillance information and overdose prevention resources, but they will not receive neighborhood risk predictions from this study.</description>
