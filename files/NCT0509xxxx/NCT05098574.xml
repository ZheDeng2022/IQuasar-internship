  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the treatment of&#xD;
      Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder comorbid with Bipolar Disorder using combined oral&#xD;
      contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lay Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done with the hope of finding a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      individuals who experience both bipolar disorder and severe premenstrual symptoms. As part of&#xD;
      this clinical trial, participants will receive either a combined oral contraceptive (i.e.&#xD;
      oral birth control pills) as a treatment for severe premenstrual symptoms or a placebo (a&#xD;
      pill without any active components - similar to a sugar pill). People that are enrolled in&#xD;
      this study will either receive the treatment or the placebo for a period of 90 days. During&#xD;
      this time, people that are participating in the study will fill out some questionnaires, and&#xD;
      their mental and physical health will be monitored by the study physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the goals of this study is to also understand whether it is feasible (practical) to do&#xD;
      a larger clinical trial using this treatment in this group of people.&#xD;
