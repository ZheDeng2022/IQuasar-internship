  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effectiveness of a community-based peer advocacy, mutual learning, and&#xD;
      social support intervention (Refugee and Immigrant Well-being Project) to reduce several&#xD;
      negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic that are disproportionately impacting Latinx&#xD;
      and Black populations: psychological distress, financial problems, and daily stressors. In&#xD;
      partnership with five community-based organizations that focus on mental health, legal,&#xD;
      education, and youth issues with Latinx immigrants and African refugees, we will also be able&#xD;
      to examine the effects of people's involvement with community-based organizations and local&#xD;
      and state policy changes on their mental health, economic stability, stressors, and social&#xD;
      support. This is important not only for Latinx and Black populations and the large number of&#xD;
      immigrants and refugees in the United States and worldwide, but also because the intervention&#xD;
      model and what we learn from this study have the potential to alleviate mental health&#xD;
      disparities experienced by other marginalized populations who face unequal access to social&#xD;
      and material resources, disproportionate exposure to trauma and stress, and worse&#xD;
      consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test a multilevel approach to reduce adverse consequences of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic with disparate impacts on Latinx and Black immigrants and refugees by&#xD;
      observing and implementing three nested levels of intervention: 1) an efficacious 6-month&#xD;
      peer advocacy and mutual learning model (Refugee and Immigrant Well-being Project, RIWP); 2)&#xD;
      engagement with community-based organizations (CBOs); and 3) structural policy changes&#xD;
      expected to be enacted in response to the pandemic, such as a state disaster relief proposal&#xD;
      for mixed status Latinx families and expanded statewide health insurance coverage. This&#xD;
      community-based participatory research (CBPR) study builds on a long-standing collaboration&#xD;
      with five community-based organizations (CBOs) that focus on mental health, education, legal&#xD;
      issues, and system change efforts to improve the well-being of Latinx immigrants and African&#xD;
      refugees. By including 240 Latinx immigrants and 60 African refugees recruited from CBO&#xD;
      partners who are randomly assigned to treatment-as-usual CBO involvement or the RIWP&#xD;
      intervention and a random sample comparison group of 300 Latinx immigrants, this mixed&#xD;
      methods longitudinal waitlist control group design study with seven time points over 36&#xD;
      months will test the effectiveness of the RIWP intervention and engagement with CBOs to&#xD;
      reduce psychological distress, daily stressors, and economic precarity and increase&#xD;
      protective factors (social support, critical awareness of/access to resources, English&#xD;
      proficiency, cultural connectedness, and mental health service use). This study will also&#xD;
      test the ability of the RIWP intervention and engagement with CBOs to increase access to the&#xD;
      direct benefits of structural interventions (local/state relief-related policies) for Latinx&#xD;
      and Black immigrants and refugees. Mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will be explored&#xD;
      by testing mediating relationships between primary outcomes and protective factors. We will&#xD;
      also track local/state policy changes and obtain preliminary quantitative estimates of&#xD;
      effects of these structural interventions on psychological distress, stressors, and economic&#xD;
      precarity using propensity score matching. Qualitative interview data from a purposive&#xD;
      subsample of participants and CBO staff will enable additional exploration of mechanisms of&#xD;
      change, the effects of policy interventions on individuals, how CBOs contribute to enacting&#xD;
      policies and helping people benefit from them, and the context of RIWP implementation at each&#xD;
      site. This research is innovative and significant because it employs cutting-edge research&#xD;
      design and intervention strategies to advance the science of multilevel mental health&#xD;
      interventions that aim to understand and address underlying structural inequities and&#xD;
      resulting mental health disparities that have been highlighted and exacerbated by the&#xD;
      pandemic. Thus, this study will contribute not only to reducing the disparate adverse mental&#xD;
      health, behavioral, and socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but also to our&#xD;
      ability to eliminate mental health disparities among Latinx and Black populations.&#xD;

All requests would have to be approved by the Community Advisory Council and would have to demonstrate that the proposed use of the data would contribute to the reduction of mental health disparities (e.g., through improved detection, diagnosis, treatment or prevention of mental illness or through contributing to knowledge of these issues) and would not harm any individuals or communities (e.g., through naïve use of the data that might result in misrepresentation of the experiences of Latinx immigrants or African refugee individuals, families, or communities).&#xD;
