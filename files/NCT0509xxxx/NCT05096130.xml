  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep has a number of health benefits, including memory and learning, vitality and energy as&#xD;
      well as high quality of life levels. Lack of sleep impairs judgment, impacts longevity and&#xD;
      safety, and increases the risk of a number of diseases including obesity, hypertension, heart&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, mood disorders, and impaired immune function. In addition lack of sleep or&#xD;
      disturbance of normal sleep cycle could have a major impact on people's lives and working&#xD;
      performance such as driving. Daily sleepiness is a problem concerning professions with a&#xD;
      non-fixed schedule. Specifically, professional long-haul drivers confront sleepiness problems&#xD;
      and in combination with fatigue, they are prone to driving accidents and other incidents.&#xD;
      Sleep quality and quantity are closed related to fatigue which is one of the most common&#xD;
      reasons for driving and working accidents. In recent years, car accidents involving&#xD;
      professional drives have increased significantly. The main reasons for those accidents were&#xD;
      fatigue and sleepiness due to long hours of driving or difficult working conditions according&#xD;
      to the recent European report (Driver Fatigue in European Road Transport - etf-europe.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle Medicine addresses health risk factors in primary, secondary, and tertiary&#xD;
      prevention of developing disease rather than on acute care and reacting to illness, injury,&#xD;
      and disease. Lifestyle Medicine strategies targeting modifiable risk factors, such as diet,&#xD;
      sleep, stress, and physical activity. By applying those regimes the investigators could&#xD;
      improve physical and mental health levels that can affect the quality of sleep, reducing&#xD;
      daily sleepiness and fatigue, in professional drivers operating coaches and trucks. Any&#xD;
      intervention that could improve alertness and reduce fatigue and sleepiness in those people,&#xD;
      will automatically improve safety, reduce driving accidents and save lives and resources.&#xD;

      Methodology Participants: Professional divers with valid 5th category driving license will be&#xD;
      the target group of this RCT. All participants will sign an informed consent form in order to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Participants will undergo a complete health history and will have&#xD;
      the approval of their attending physician. The study has been approved by the local IRB&#xD;
      Internal Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a randomized clinical trial involving healthy human volunteers.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed before and after a 6-month lifestyle intervention. The current&#xD;
      project consists of 9 interconnected Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Participants will sign the consent form and complete the PARQ health questionnaire&#xD;
      for assessing the readiness to exercise participation followed by the Epworth Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale (SSC) for assessing daily sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Participants that fulfill the inclusion criteria will be scheduled for a full night&#xD;
      Polysomnography test at the sleep unit of the Center of Research and Evaluation of Human&#xD;
      Performance (CREHP) laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: After completing the polysomnography test, participants will complete a 2h OGTT test&#xD;
      for assessing insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. During those two hours, the&#xD;
      participants will complete a series of questionnaires assessing aspects related to&#xD;
      demographics, quality of life, health, and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: After the completion of Step 3, participants will go through a body composition&#xD;
      analysis using the DEXA method followed by a bioimpedance analysis for assessing total body&#xD;
      water levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: After the completion of Step 4, participants will participate in a battery of tests&#xD;
      assessing fitness levels and functional capacity. Physical activity levels will be recorded&#xD;
      using a mobile application for the duration of a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 6: After the completion of Step 5, participants will be scheduled after 2 days for a lab&#xD;
      Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) for the assessment of their levels of daily sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 7: After the completion of Step 6, participants will follow a series of interviews with&#xD;
      certified experts. More specifically,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a registered dietitian will assess nutritional habits and prescribe a corrective diet in&#xD;
           order to improve the participants' nutritional profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a registered psychologist will assess mental health and stress levels and suggest&#xD;
           corrective approaches for improving participants' stress levels and mental capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a registered exercise physiologist will assess fitness levels and prescribe an&#xD;
           appropriate exercise training program for improving cardiovascular fitness and&#xD;
           functional capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a registered sleep coach will assess sleep quality and hygiene and suggest ways for&#xD;
           improving sleep quality and restfulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 8: After completion of Step 7 participants will be given a 24h Blood Pressure (BP)&#xD;
      Holter for assessing the circadian variation of BP and a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) monitor&#xD;
      for assessing HRV during a normal working day (including driving).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 9: After the completion of all steps, participants will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the two groups based on demographic and sleep parameters: the control group (CON) and the&#xD;
      experimental group (EXP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention of the current project includes 6 months of lifestyle&#xD;
      modification counseling based on the guidelines and principles of the European Lifestyle&#xD;
      Medicine Organization (eulm.org). More specifically, counseling will target areas such as&#xD;
      nutrition, exercise, stress, and sleep. A certified specialist will interview and assess all&#xD;
      participants and prescribe the appropriate corrective regimes for improving participants'&#xD;
      lifestyles and reducing cardiovascular risk factors. More particularly, for nutritional&#xD;
      counseling a customized diet will be provided and change every two weeks, for exercise&#xD;
      counseling, a customized supervised exercised training will be provided and change every two&#xD;
      weeks, for psychological counseling, a customized psychological approach will be provided and&#xD;
      reassessed every two weeks and for sleep counseling, a customized sleep hygiene program will&#xD;
      be provided and reevaluated every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Randomization will take place using a randomization computer software.&#xD;
      Randomization will consider parameters such as gender, age, BMI, and sleepiness score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Characteristics: Demographic characteristics include age, gender, race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      education, socioeconomic status, health, disability status, and work-related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: Various validated questionnaires will be used for the assessment of aspects&#xD;
      related to the quality of life and health using the interview method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Health: The PARQ questionnaire will be used for the assessment of the level of&#xD;
      readiness to participate in an exercise training program. The General Health Questionnaire 30&#xD;
      (GHQ30) will be used for the assessment of the general health status of the participants.&#xD;
      Charlson Comorbidity index will be used for the calculation of the comorbidity index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleepiness and Quality of Sleep: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) will be used for the&#xD;
      assessment of the level of sleepiness. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be used&#xD;
      for the assessment of sleep quality and sleep abnormalities. Furthermore, the Karolinska&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale (KSS) will be used for the assessment of alertness and vitality. Finally,&#xD;
      the Daily Sleep Diary will be used for the assessment of the level of sleep quality of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue levels: The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) will be used for the assessment of the level&#xD;
      of general fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life: The SF36QoL questionnaire (SF-36) will be used for the assessment of the&#xD;
      levels of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressive symptoms: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire will be used for the&#xD;
      assessment of depressive symptoms and signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress: The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Work Stress Questionnaire (WSQ) will be used&#xD;
      for the assessment of stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be used for&#xD;
      the assessment of physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driving Skills and Habits: The Driving Habits Questionnaire (DHQ) will be used for the&#xD;
      assessment of driving habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition: The General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (GNKQ) will be used for the&#xD;
      assessment of nutritional knowledge and habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Analysis: Blood samples will be collected after overnight fasting for measurement&#xD;
      of lipids, hormones, and general hematology analysis. Glucose disposal and indices of insulin&#xD;
      resistance will be assessed by an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following ingestion of 75gr of glucose). The insulin&#xD;
      resistance index will be calculated by the OGIS and HOMA-IR equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition: Body composition will be assessed using anthropometric measurements&#xD;
      including BMI, WHR as well as DEXA scans for the assessment of total and regional fat and&#xD;
      lean body mass (Lunar model DPX Madison, WI). Intracellular and extracellular as well as&#xD;
      total body water levels will be measured by bioimpedance using a portable BIA system, (Tanita&#xD;
      BC 543).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Pressure: The circadian blood pressure variation will be assessed using a 24h BP Holter&#xD;
      (GIMA 24HABPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability: Heart Rate Variability will be assessed using a portable ECG designed&#xD;
      to measure all HRV indices (OMRON HCG-801).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Assessment: Quality and quantity of sleep will be assessed by an overnight&#xD;
      Polysomnographic study (PSG). Levels of daily sleepiness will be assessed using the Multiple&#xD;
      Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). MSLT is a full-day test that consists of five scheduled naps&#xD;
      separated by two-hour breaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fitness Assessment Physical Activity: A mobile phone-based steps tracking application will be&#xD;
      used for the assessment of the weekly physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic Capacity: The six-minute walk test (6MWT) will be used for the assessment of Aerobic&#xD;
      capacity and Endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength: 1RM will be used for the assessment for the evaluation of maximum muscle strength.&#xD;
      Also, the sit to stand-60sec (STS60) test will be used for the assessment for testing leg&#xD;
      strength and endurance. Finally, a 5x sit-to-stand test (STS5) will be used for the&#xD;
      assessment of functional lower extremity strength, transitional movements, balance, and fall&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexibility: The Sit and Reach test (S&amp;R) will be used for the assessment of flexibility of&#xD;
      the lower back and hamstring muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handgrip: The handgrip test will be used for the assessment of the maximum isometric strength&#xD;
      of the hand and for arm muscles (Marsden MG-4800 Hand Dynamometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics SPSS statistical software (SPSS 21, Illinois USA) will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre and post within Control (Con) and Exercise (Ex) groups will be examined by using&#xD;
      paired t-test. Correlations between (Con) group and (Ex) group parameters will be examined by&#xD;
      using Spearman correlation. Also, will be examined Δ change values by using an unpaired&#xD;
      t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed using the open-source software G*Power (3.1.9.2) and was used to&#xD;
      calculate the minimum number of participants required to achieve reasonable power (&gt;85%). A&#xD;
      priori compute required sample size analysis revealed that in one of the main parameters&#xD;
      related to the aims of the study (ESS score), the study needs a total sample size of 42&#xD;
      participants (for both groups) in order to have enough power to detect statistically&#xD;
      significant differences between the pre and post-intervention comparisons (within groups ESS:&#xD;
      Effect size dz=0.4783, total sample size=42, t=2.019, Power (1-β err prob)=0.88289). Given an&#xD;
      estimation of a reasonable dropout rate of 20%, it is estimated that a number of 25&#xD;
      participants per group is needed in order to have significant power to achieve meaningful&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
