  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A galectin inhibitor that prevents viral replication of the Sars-CoV-2 virus through blocking&#xD;
      the specific terminal on the surface that enables the virus to enter human cells. This&#xD;
      inhibitor - ProLectin M is a novel substance that is given orally to individuals who have an&#xD;
      infection with Sars-CoV-2 or COVID19 disease. The oral tablet is chewed every hour for the&#xD;
      first 14 days. We hypothesise that patients receiving the active investigational product&#xD;
      (ProLectinM) will have a faster recovery from COVID19 compared to those receiving its&#xD;
      matching placebo. The trial is approved by Institutional Review Board for safety and all&#xD;
      participants will need to provide a written informed consent to volunteer in this trial. The&#xD;
      safety of ProLectin is established as the drug substance is recognised as a safe substance.&#xD;
      However its benefits in relieving patients from the COVID19 infection and providing the&#xD;
      patients faster recovery from its clinical symptoms and prevention of delayed sequelae of the&#xD;
      infection has not been proven yet.&#xD;

             procedures and schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patient having a positive diagnosis for presence of SARS-CoV-2, obtained from a&#xD;
             recently performed rRT-PCR (≤ 3 days) with any 1 of the following: i. Ct value ≤ 25&#xD;
             ii. Hospitalized for having classical (CDC defined) symptoms of COVID-19 (onset ≤ 5&#xD;
             days) iii. High risk category of COVID-19: blood group type A-positive type 2&#xD;
             diabetes, or other chronic disease known to have higher morbidity risk with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
