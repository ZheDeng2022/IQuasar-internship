  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease caused by more than 20 different species&#xD;
      of the protozoan parasite Leishmania. CL generally begins with a papule at the sand fly bite&#xD;
      site, increasing to form a nodule that progresses to ulceration, or a scaly or wart-like&#xD;
      plaque, over a period of 1 to 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact incidence of CL is not known. An estimated 1.2 million cases / year in&#xD;
      approximately 100 countries around the world suffer from different forms of CL. In general,&#xD;
      most lesions become ulcerated during the course of the disease. Among the different species&#xD;
      of the parasite that cause LC, L. tropica from the Old World and L. braziliensis from the New&#xD;
      World are considered the most important due to the severity of the disease they produce and&#xD;
      because they are more difficult to cure with medications currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2010, the World Health Organization has insisted on the need to work on products that&#xD;
      become alternatives for the treatment of CL, especially in products that serve topical&#xD;
      application because with them, the probability of systemic toxicity is lower , increasing&#xD;
      patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the options for topical treatment are natural products that have been, are, and will be&#xD;
      extremely important as sources of medicinal agents. In addition to natural products that have&#xD;
      found direct medicinal application as pharmaceutical entities, many others can serve as&#xD;
      chemical models or templates for the design, synthesis and semi-synthesis of novel substances&#xD;
      for the treatment of human diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arnica montana L. is a plant with anti-echemotic, healing, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and&#xD;
      antineuralgic properties; It is included in the Colombian vademecum of medicinal plants. In&#xD;
      previous studies it has been observed that the contact of the ulcerated skin with the product&#xD;
      for up to 60 days does not generate toxic effects at the local level (application site) or at&#xD;
      the systemic level, so it can be considered safe for use. To date there are no human studies&#xD;
      with CL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Arnica tincture in&#xD;
      individuals with uncomplicated CL, by measuring the occurrence and severity analysis of local&#xD;
      and systemic adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drugs approved in Colombia to treat CL are: Meglumine antimoniate is a drug for&#xD;
      intramuscular use. It has been used since the 1940s and continues to be the drug of first&#xD;
      choice despite its toxicity, difficult administration, and high cost; and the evidence to&#xD;
      support its use for the treatment of CL is sometimes based on qualitative, retrospective, and&#xD;
      uncontrolled observations and some controlled clinical studies. Its efficiency is currently&#xD;
      60 - 70%. Given its extremely high toxicity, intralesional administration has been used, with&#xD;
      good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) is a drug for oral use that has proven to be effective&#xD;
      for the treatment of LC in Colombia. As Miltefosine is potentially teratogenic, it is&#xD;
      contraindicated during pregnancy and requires appropriate counseling of female patients of&#xD;
      childbearing age and their partners in order to avoid pregnancy using appropriate planning&#xD;
      methods up to two months after the end of treatment. Its efficacy ranges from 53% to 91%.&#xD;
      Despite its efficacy, the drug is not currently available in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amphotericin B, in its deoxycholate and liposomal forms, are drugs for intravenous use. Given&#xD;
      its extremely high toxicity, but its high efficacy (greater than 90%), its use is reserved&#xD;
      for complicated cases of CL or visceral and cases that do not respond to meglumine&#xD;
      antimoniate or miltefosine. These available therapeutic options, in addition to being very&#xD;
      few, present many inconveniences for patients, especially related to their toxic effects that&#xD;
      lead patients to abandon treatment. In turn, incomplete treatments increase the risk that&#xD;
      resistance to them will be generated and with it, their effectiveness will decrease in the&#xD;
      population exposed to resistant parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of topical treatments for CL is an option that has been widely explored and is&#xD;
      currently included in the WHO list as an option for situations in which the patient has few&#xD;
      lesions (≤ 4) less than ≤ 4 cm in height. diameter and located in areas of the body that can&#xD;
      be treated topically. The use of antimonials within the lesion, liquid nitrogen or local heat&#xD;
      (thermotherapy) are schemes recommended by the WHO and regionally adapted by the Pan American&#xD;
      Health Organization (PAHO) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO) to countries of the&#xD;
      New World and the Eastern Mediterranean region, respectively. EMRO developed a SOP (Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedure) to prepare injuries and apply local heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are some new approaches to drug discovery, such as combinatorial chemistry and&#xD;
      computer molecular model design, and many drugs are manufactured using synthetic chemistry,&#xD;
      none of these can replace the important role of natural products as most drugs Central&#xD;
      structures or scaffolds for synthetic chemicals are based on natural products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arnica montana L. is a plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is made up of 28 to&#xD;
      32 species. This plant is endemic to central and southern Europe (Pyrenees and Alps),&#xD;
      southern Scandinavia and northern Spain. It is a medicinal plant of ancestral use, recognized&#xD;
      by several countries to alleviate different ailments. Its variety of indications can be&#xD;
      explained by the production of a large number of secondary metabolites; such as&#xD;
      sesquiterpenic lactones, flavonoids or phenolic acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main indication corresponds to its anti-inflammatory activity. Sesquiterpenic lactones&#xD;
      (helenalin and 11-α-13 dihydrohelenaline) are the constituents responsible for this effect,&#xD;
      since these molecules reduce inflammation mediated by the transcription factor NF-kB. There&#xD;
      are other properties demonstrated in the literature such as antioxidant, antimicrobial or&#xD;
      insecticidal activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arnica tincture is a topical preparation based on the plant legally authorized in the&#xD;
      countries of the European community, and it is included in the vademecun of medicinal plants&#xD;
      in Colombia. The research product is the commercial phytotherapeutic product ARNICA TINTURA&#xD;
      Gehrlicher 100 mL manufactured by Gehrlicher Pharmazeutische Extrakte GmbH. (www.&#xD;
      https://www.wer-zu-wem.de/firma/gehrlicher-extrakte.html). According to the European&#xD;
      Pharmacopoeia, the solution is a 70% hydroethanolic tincture prepared from the flowers of&#xD;
      Arnica montana L, and composed at least 0.04% of sesquiterpene lactones. The product will be&#xD;
      imported from Germany through the University of Munster (project co-investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the plant's anti-inflammatory, healing, anti-echemotic, analgesic and antineuralgic&#xD;
      properties, in a previous study the leishmanicidal activity of arnica tincture was evaluated&#xD;
      in vitro for intracellular amastigotes of L. braziliensis and L. tropica. Arnica tincture at&#xD;
      a concentration of 4.8 mg / mL produced a decrease in the parasite load (amount of&#xD;
      intracellular amastigotes) of 91.9% and 99.6% in cells infected by L. braziliensis and L.&#xD;
      tropica, respectively. . The mean maximum Effective Concentrations (EC50) were determined at&#xD;
      2.9 ± 0.13 and 2.7 ± 0.02 respectively, and with selectivity indices&gt; 69 and&gt; 74, for L.&#xD;
      braziliensis and L. tropica, respectively. This activity was validated in in vivo studies in&#xD;
      hamsters experimentally infected with L. braziliensis. Applying the tincture once a day for&#xD;
      30 days produced a 60% cure and for the remaining 40% of the hamsters, a reduction of more&#xD;
      than 80% of the lesions was observed. When applied once a day for 60 days, 75% of the&#xD;
      hamsters were cured and the remaining 25% showed improvements between 70 and 96% regarding&#xD;
      the size of the lesion before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data on weight, clinical appearance and behavior, as well as the histological studies&#xD;
      obtained from the hamster tests allowed to conclude that contact of the ulcerated skin with&#xD;
      the product for up to 60 days does not generate toxic effects at the local level (application&#xD;
      site). nor at a systemic level, so it can be considered safe for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is difficult to calculate accurately, it has been estimated that approximately 2&#xD;
      drops (80uL) of the solution will be used per cm2 in each application. If we consider an&#xD;
      average lesion size of 4 cm2, a maximum of 320 uL is used X 3 times a day X 45 or 30 days =&#xD;
      43,200 uL or 28,800uL (equivalent to 43.2 or 28.8 mL) per lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Arnica tincture in individuals with&#xD;
                uncomplicated CL, by measuring the occurrence and severity analysis of local and&#xD;
                systemic ADs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the therapeutic response of Arnica tincture in individuals with&#xD;
                uncomplicated CL, according to the percentage of individuals with initial clinical&#xD;
                cure on day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Regimen 1: Arnica tincture applied 3 times a day for 30 days (Group 1: 4 weeks) Regimen&#xD;
           2: Arnica tincture applied 3 times a day for 45 days (Group 2: 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the frequency and severity of AEs associated with the use of the Arnica&#xD;
                tincture solution.&#xD;
