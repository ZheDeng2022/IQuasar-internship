  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated industry-supported phase I clinical trial conducted in the&#xD;
      phase I clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Center. The study consists of two parts: dose finding (MTD&#xD;
      (maximum tolerated dose) determination) and dose expansion parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of TTF in combination with cabozantinib (cohort 1) or with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab (cohort 2) in patients with advanced solid tumors involving&#xD;
      the abdomen or thorax will be evaluated. Patients with HCC and renal carcinoma will be&#xD;
      included in cohort 1 and treated with TTF (150 kHz frequency for HCC and 200 kHz for renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma) in combination with cabozantinib. Patients with breast cancer and gynecologic&#xD;
      tumors (ovarian/fallopian, endometrial/primary peritoneal tumors) will be included in cohort&#xD;
      2 and treated with TTF (150 kHz frequency for breast cancer and 200 kHz for gynecologic&#xD;
      tumors) with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the safety and tolerability of TTF, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),&#xD;
      in combination with cabozantinib (Cohort 1) or with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab (Cohort&#xD;
      2) in patients with advanced solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax to the 4&#xD;
      prespecified tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the objective response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival of&#xD;
      TTF in combination with cabozantinib (Cohort 1) or with nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab&#xD;
      (Cohort 2) in patients with advanced solid tumors involving the abdomen or thorax to the 4&#xD;
