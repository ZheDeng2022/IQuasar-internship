  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are therefore interested to explore the effects of VLCD and different&#xD;
      bariatric surgery procedures to changes in the physical deposition of fat in organs which&#xD;
      regulate glucose metabolism (i.e. in the liver, pancreas, muscle) in the earlier (6 weeks)&#xD;
      and intermediate (4 months) period after bariatric surgery, where rate of weight loss at this&#xD;
      stage are similar between the two procedures. Increased understanding of the changes in these&#xD;
      important metabolic organs, will increase the investigators' understanding of mechanism of&#xD;
      diabetes remission following bariatric surgery, their effects on weight loss or changes in&#xD;
      gut hormones levels. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS) are non-invasive, non-ionising techniques. MRI can be used to investigate the body's&#xD;
      physiology and MRS can be used to investigate the body's metabolic processes, so by combining&#xD;
      these two methods the investigators are able to investigate the process of fat reduction and&#xD;
      diabetes remission post gastric surgery without performing any secondary invasive procedures&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effects of a Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD)&#xD;
      followed by two different bariatric surgical procedures, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and&#xD;
      Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) on skeletal muscle, liver and pancreatic fat deposition, ATP flux as&#xD;
      well as cardiac function.&#xD;

      There are NO research interventions, this study is observing a patient's response to clinical&#xD;
      interventions. The below describes the investigators methods of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are listed for surgery by the Bariatric surgical Tier 4 MDT team will be&#xD;
      approached by one of the main care team who may also be a member of the research team during&#xD;
      the ERAS session (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) approximately 6 months before surgery. If&#xD;
      the participants wish to partake in the study the will be then screened for ability and&#xD;
      willingness to undergo MRI in order to prevent any wasting of the patients time and prevent&#xD;
      unnecessary data storage. If eligible and consent is provided, their details will be kept by&#xD;
      the research team to be contacted for further appointment to attend the investigators&#xD;
      University of Nottingham (UoN) research unit based at the Royal Derby Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 main arms to the study, consists of 2 arms, patients undergoing RYGB (group 1)&#xD;
      and Patients undergoing SG (group 2) Within these groups there are category A and B&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category A - Primary Study - Participants who will be used to investigate the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category B - Exploratory sub-study - Participants will be used to investigate the Primary&#xD;
      outcome but also as a pilot set of data for cardiac measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all category A sessions Participants will be asked to attend a session at the Sir Peter&#xD;
      Mansfield Imaging Centre (SPMIC) on the UoN main campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive an MRI and MRS scan, a Blood Test and a liquid mixed meal test&#xD;
      at every session. The mixed meal test is not apart of routine care, in this study it shall be&#xD;
      used to examine the change in participants response to a meal after each clinical&#xD;
      intervention (VLCD and Surgery). Blood samples will be taken by a trained member of staff and&#xD;
      transferred to the Royal Derby Hospital for testing, this is to obtain Glucose, Ghrelin,&#xD;
      C-peptide, glucagon and total and intact glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in category B will be asked to attend sessions at the SPMIC. And will only&#xD;
      receive MRI and MRS scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team will reach out to the patient 2 weeks prior to the commencement&#xD;
      of their VLCD in order to confirm the participants are still interested in participating,&#xD;
      book in the first study session and answer any questions the participants may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 3 and 1 day prior to the commencement of the VLCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI protocol for this session physiology scans of the Chest, Abdomen and Skeletal Muscle&#xD;
      (thigh) and MRS is proton spectroscopy performed on the Liver. Participants will be in the&#xD;
      scanner for no longer than 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Cardiac measures using MRI will be used in planning for Proton and Phosphorus MR&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (MRS). Participants will be offered a break after being in the scanner for 1hour&#xD;
      with a maximum time in the scanner of 2hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 3 and 1 day prior to the Participants Bariatric Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category A:&#xD;

      The MRI protocol for this session is physiology scans for the Chest, Abdomen and Skeletal&#xD;
      Muscle (thigh) and MRS is proton spectroscopy and a 31P (phosphorous) spectroscopy performed&#xD;
      on the Liver. Basic. Participants will be offered a break after being in the scanner for&#xD;
      1hour with a maximum time in the scanner of 2hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Category B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic Cardiac measures using MRI will be used in planning for Proton and Phosphorus MR&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (MRS). Participants will be offered a break after being in the scanner for 1hour&#xD;
      with a maximum time in the scanner of 2hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
