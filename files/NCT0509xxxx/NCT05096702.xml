  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study carried out in Brazil in patients with P. vivax malaria. The&#xD;
      study will be carried out in the municipalities of Manaus (state of Amazonas) and Porto Velho&#xD;
      (state of Rondônia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      G6PD and TQ tests will be provided to health facilities by municipal health authorities using&#xD;
      the common route for the provision of drugs and diagnostics. PQ and other antimalarial drugs&#xD;
      are already available in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designated personnel at the health facilities will be trained to perform the G6PD&#xD;
      quantitative test procedure and the radical healing treatment algorithm by the Lead&#xD;
      Researcher (RP) team and municipal authorities using teaching materials developed by the&#xD;
      sponsors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is based on the secondary use of data routinely collected from all malaria&#xD;
      patients in the Epidemiological Surveillance Information System for Malaria (SIVEP-Malaria)&#xD;
      by the Ministry of Health (MS). Data from all malaria patients are routinely collected&#xD;
      through SIVEP forms by health professionals (HP) and entered into the SIVEP database by the&#xD;
      municipality staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SIVEP form will be adapted by the MS to collect information about the G6PD test, TQ&#xD;
      treatment and signs of hemolysis. The retrospective data from all patients will be entered&#xD;
      into a new database by the municipality staff during the study period and the relevant data&#xD;
      will be automatically exported weekly to the SIVEP database. The study team will only have&#xD;
      access to unidentified data, according to the access levels that will be assigned to each&#xD;
      member in the system. Only the municipality's team will have access to the identified patient&#xD;
      data. In addition to the data collected on the SIVEP forms, the PR team will ask the two&#xD;
      referral hospitals that routinely receive all admissions due to AHA to perform a regular&#xD;
      screening of electronic hospital admission records for patients with signs of AHA (renal&#xD;
      failure, jaundice, blood transfusion, malaria). All identified cases will be investigated&#xD;
      using hospital records and SIVEP forms. Confirmed information about drug-induced AHA will be&#xD;
      linked to the patient record recorded in the database. The PR team will also contribute to&#xD;
      pharmacovigilance training. Physicians at tertiary-level health units will report side&#xD;
      effects through the VigiMed system, from the National Health Surveillance Agency&#xD;
      (ANVISA).Finally, the additional costs of implementing the G6PD and TQ tests will be&#xD;
      collected along with the study at the health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study is based on retrospective data collection, and the adoption of TQ and G6PD&#xD;
      testing will be done by the municipality, the G6PD testing and the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      TQ or PQ will be carried out in accordance with the treatment policy , that is, regardless of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 1st phase (approximately 3 months): Training and provision of G6PD and TQ tests will&#xD;
      initially be limited to 10 high-complexity and intermediate-complexity units (referral&#xD;
      hospitals, hospitals, emergency care units, polyclinics). Data will be collected from&#xD;
      patients with P. vivax treated at these health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be performed after collecting data from 600 patients with P. vivax ≥&#xD;
      16 years, who have not been treated for vivax malaria in the past 60 days, in the study&#xD;
      database in order to decide whether the study can be extended to less complex health units.&#xD;
      The decision will be made by an Independent Study Oversight Committee (CISE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the interim results of Phase 1 are found to be unsatisfactory, CISE may decide not to&#xD;
      extend the study to primary care units until improvements in the educational program are&#xD;
      implemented and/or additional support is provided to health professionals. Additional interim&#xD;
      analyzes will be performed as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - 2nd phase (approximately 9 months): if approved by CISE, the study will be extended to less&#xD;
      complex health units (basic health units, family health units and other primary care&#xD;
      services) and other high and medium complexity of health in the selected municipalities.&#xD;
      After staff training, G6PD and TQ testing will be provided to these health facilities by&#xD;
      municipal health authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this 2nd phase, data will continue to be collected from patients with P. vivax treated&#xD;
      by the 1st phase tertiary care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An additional interim analysis will be performed after data from 600 patients with P. vivax&#xD;
      ≥16 years old, who have not been treated for P. vivax malaria in the past 60 days, from&#xD;
      primary care units are collected in the study database ( approximately 3 months after the&#xD;
      start of the 2nd phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will continue while the interim analyzes are being carried out. Final results will&#xD;
      be analyzed and validated by CISE. The study is expected to take approximately 15 months.&#xD;
