      This long-term follow-up study is a 5-year long-term follow-up study to evaluate long-term&#xD;
      safety in Cellgram-CKD subjects. (refer to ClinicalTrials.gov.Identifier: NCT05042206).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term safety of Cellgram-CKD is evaluated by monitoring whether or not an adverse&#xD;
      event of special interest (AESI) occurs for 5 years from the date of administration in&#xD;
      Cellgram-CKD subjects who voluntarily consented in writing to participate in the long-term&#xD;
