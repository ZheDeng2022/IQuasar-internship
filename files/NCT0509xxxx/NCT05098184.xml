  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)&#xD;
      therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Autologous TILs are expanded from tumor&#xD;
      resections or biopsies and infused i.v. into the patient after NMA lymphodepletion treatment&#xD;
      with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
