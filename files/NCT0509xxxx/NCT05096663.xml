    <textblock>
      This phase II/III Lung-MAP trial studies how well immunotherapy treatment with N-803&#xD;
      (ALT-803) and pembrolizumab working in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to other places in the body (advanced). Natural killer cells, part of our immune&#xD;
      system, are always on alert and ready to defend our bodies from many kinds of infection or&#xD;
      rogue cells, such as those that cause cancer. N-803 (ALT-803) may activate natural killer&#xD;
      cells so that they can stimulate an immune response to help fight cancer. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving N-803&#xD;
      (ALT-803) and pembrolizumab may help shrink and stabilize lung cancer or prevent it from&#xD;
      returning.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall survival (OS) between participants randomized to nogapendekin alfa&#xD;
      (N-803 [ALT-803]) + pembrolizumab versus standard of care therapy. (Primary Resistance&#xD;
      Cohort) II. To compare overall survival (OS) between participants randomized to N-803&#xD;
      (ALT-803) + pembrolizumab versus standard of care therapy. (Acquired Resistance Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare investigator assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) with confirmation of&#xD;
      progression by immune response criteria between the treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare investigator assessed progression-free survival (IA-PFS) by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between the treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the response rates between the arms. IV. To evaluate duration of response&#xD;
      (DoR) among responders. V. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities within each&#xD;
      treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish a blood repository to pursue future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive standard of care consisting of docetaxel intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes on day 1; gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8; pemetrexed IV over 10&#xD;
      minutes on day 1; or ramucirumab IV over 30-60 minutes and docetaxel IV over 30-60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and nogapendekin alfa subcutaneously&#xD;
      (SC) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nogapendekin alfa SC on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have been assigned to S1800D by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)&#xD;
             Statistics and Data Management Center (SDMC). Assignment to S1800D is determined by&#xD;
             the LUNGMAP or S1400 protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable or non-measurable disease documented by computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Measurable disease must be&#xD;
             assessed within 28 days prior to randomization. Non-measurable disease must be&#xD;
             assessed within 42 days prior to randomization. The CT from a combined positron&#xD;
             emission tomography (PET)/CT may be used only if it is of diagnostic quality. All&#xD;
             known sites of disease must be assessed and documented on the Baseline Tumor&#xD;
             Assessment Form (RECIST 1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a CT or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for central nervous&#xD;
             system (CNS) disease within 42 days prior to sub-study randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with spinal cord compression or brain metastases must have received local&#xD;
             treatment to these metastases and remained clinically controlled and asymptomatic for&#xD;
             at least 7 days following stereotactic radiation and/or 14 days following whole brain&#xD;
             radiation, and prior to sub-study randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with spinal cord compression or brain metastases must not have residual&#xD;
             neurological dysfunction, unless no further recovery is expected, and the participant&#xD;
             has been stable on weaning doses of corticosteroids (=&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone or&#xD;
             equivalent) prior to sub-study randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have progressed (in the opinion of the treating investigator)&#xD;
             following the most recent line of therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known sensitizing mutation for which an FDA-approved targeted&#xD;
             therapy for NSCLC exists (e.g. EGFR, ALK gene fusions, ROS1, BRAF, RET, NTRK, and MET&#xD;
             sensitizing mutations), must have previously received at least one of the approved&#xD;
             therapy(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received exactly one line of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy&#xD;
             for advanced disease (stage IV or recurrent, or stage III in certain circumstances&#xD;
             outlined below) given alone or in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
             Participants must have experienced disease progression during or after this regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Continuing the same agent(s) after progression counts as a single line of&#xD;
                  therapy. However, a change or addition in agent(s) after progression (e.g. the&#xD;
                  addition of chemotherapy to anti-PD-1 monotherapy after progression) counts as a&#xD;
                  subsequent line of therapy and would exclude the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For participants who received consolidation anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy&#xD;
                  following concurrent chemoradiation for Stage III disease as their only line of&#xD;
                  anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If they experienced disease progression less than (&lt;) 365 days from the&#xD;
                       first date of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, this counts as the single&#xD;
                       line of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy for advanced disease&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If they experienced disease progression more than or equal to (&gt;=) 365 days&#xD;
                       from the first date of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, this is not&#xD;
                       considered a line of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy for advanced disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have recovered (=&lt; grade 1) from any side effects of prior therapy,&#xD;
             except for alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to safely receive at least one of the investigator's choice&#xD;
             of standard of care regimens, per the current FDA-approved package insert&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Pemetrexed is not FDA-approved for squamous cell NSCLC and must not be used&#xD;
                  to treat participants with squamous cell NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.5 x 10^3/uL (obtained within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             sub-study randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100 x 10^3/uL(obtained within 28 days prior to sub-study&#xD;
             randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL (obtained within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             sub-study randomization). For participants with liver metastases, bilirubin must be =&lt;&#xD;
             5 x IULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) =&lt; 2 x IULN&#xD;
             (within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization). For participants with liver&#xD;
             metastases, ALT and AST must be =&lt; 5 x IULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; the IULN or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 mL/min using&#xD;
             Cockcroft-Gault formula. This specimen must have been drawn and processed within 28&#xD;
             days prior to sub-study randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants' most recent Zubrod performance status must be 0-1 and be documented&#xD;
             within 28 days prior to sub-study randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have history and physical exam must be obtained within 28 days prior&#xD;

             modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and&#xD;
             is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have any history of primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not be pregnant or nursing. Women/men of reproductive potential must&#xD;
             have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method during the study and 4 months&#xD;
             after completion of study treatment. A woman is considered to be of &quot;reproductive&#xD;
             potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
             In addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot; also includes&#xD;
             heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect&#xD;
             of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation. However, if at any point a previously celibate participant&#xD;
             chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of&#xD;
             contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning&#xD;
             contraceptive measures during the study and 4 months after study completion&#xD;
