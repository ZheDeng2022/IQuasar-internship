  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aim to characterise patients admitted to hospital with an acute&#xD;
      respiratory condition, or acute worsening of their chronic lung condition. This will enable&#xD;
      identification of predictors of future risk, as well as develop potential interventions&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational cohort study, recruiting patients who have been admitted to&#xD;
      hospital with an acute respiratory condition. This can include exacerbation of an existing&#xD;
      chronic lung disease such as asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis and&#xD;
      pleural disease, or contracting an acute illness including pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, or&#xD;
      any other respiratory infection. The patients will be screened and recruited whilst still&#xD;
      hospitalised and followed up for one year after discharge. The participants will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline study visit while in hospital, with the option to have further follow up visits (up&#xD;
      to three occasions) in the following year to assess clinical recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be offered the choice to undertake the follow up assessments via any of&#xD;
      the following routes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a telephone consultation or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a face to face visit either in the Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during a research visit from another ethically approved study or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  during routine clinical follow up organised by the hospital clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants can choose not to attend any further follow up visits after discharge. Any&#xD;
      planned clinical follow-up arranged by the hospital team will occur according to clinical&#xD;
      needs. If the participant is re-admitted during the 12 months after enrolment, assessments&#xD;
      identical to the baseline visit can be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final remote visit will be carried out at 12 months post-discharge (+/- 1 month) to collect&#xD;
      data about health care utilisation (e.g. hospitalisation rate, length of stay in hospital,&#xD;
      death rate, antibiotic/steroid prescriptions) from both primary and secondary healthcare&#xD;
      records. The participants are not required to attend this final visit as data will be&#xD;
      collected remotely.&#xD;
