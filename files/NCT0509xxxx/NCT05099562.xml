      Precision Acupuncture in the Treatment of Peripheral Neuropathy After Taxane Chemotherapy in&#xD;
      Breast Cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Associated peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer patients has a significant impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life and treatment compliance. Many studies have shown that acupuncture has a&#xD;
      certain therapeutic effect on peripheral neuropathy. Studies have shown that taxane induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer is related to genetic factors. Based on SNPs related&#xD;
      to peripheral neuropathy, this study screened SNPs related to peripheral neuropathy caused by&#xD;
      taxane drugs, and established a prognostic model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients diagnosed with stage I, II or IIIA breast cancer and experiencing&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy for at least 2 weeks were assessed by the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Cancer Therapy/Gynaecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicityï¼ŒFACT/GOG-Ntx) and the European&#xD;
      Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN&#xD;
      twenty-item scale(EORTC QLQ-CIPN20). Likert level 5 and level 4 scores were used for all&#xD;
      items in the above two scales. The investigators will temporarily divide the study into a&#xD;
      group, and the investigators will increase the group if necessary. Laboratory personnel were&#xD;
      blinded to all clinical and outcome data.&#xD;

    <description>This is a one-arm study. Breast cancer patients with peripheral neuropathy were measured using the FACT/ GOG-Ntx and EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 scales. Our clinical study included breast cancer patients diagnosed with peripheral neurotoxicity caused by taxanes-based drugs who would receive acupuncture treatment. Neurotoxicity was identified based on NCI-CTCAE 5.0 for daily or almost daily numbness in the hands and feet, tingling, and other symptoms of peripheral neuropathy over the past two to three weeks. Blood samples were collected from patients to detect SNP associated with neurotoxicity.</description>

    <description>Patients received standardized acupuncture treatment. A blood sample of genomic DNA storage was taken from the back of the hand between the first and second metacarpals. Genotypes were obtained by oligonucleotide ligation/polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis of peripheral neuropathy-associated SNPs.</description>
