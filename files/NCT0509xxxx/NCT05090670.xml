  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-inflammatory brace technology has demonstrated superior clinical outcomes in the&#xD;
      management of knee osteoarthritis and accelerate recovery time for Major League Soccer&#xD;
      players. Authors have postulated that embedding germanium into cotton garments increases&#xD;
      circulation and augments the inflammatory process through a transdermal micro-electromagnetic&#xD;
      field. In addition to immunomodulatory effects, knee braces immobilize and stabilize the&#xD;
      joint through tactile feedback from the skin. Thus, a germanium-embedded knee brace may&#xD;
      provide inflammatory control to augment pain and edema while concomitantly enhancing&#xD;
      proprioception. Knee Arthroscopy rehabilitation goals during the acute post-operative phase&#xD;
      include diminishment of pain and edema as well as restoration of knee range-of-motion. The&#xD;
      presented study intends to assess the impact of a germanium-embedded knee brace on patient&#xD;
      recovery after Knee Arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center blinded randomized controlled clinical trial to study effectiveness of&#xD;
      germanium-infused knee brace on rehabilitation in patient population undergoing Knee&#xD;
      Arthroscopy. Patients will be randomized into germanium-infused knee brace group and compared&#xD;
      to a replica knee brace group. Inclusion criteria will include skeletally mature individuals&#xD;
      undergoing primary Knee Arthroscopy. Exclusion criteria will include autoimmune disorders and&#xD;
      history of surgery on ipsilateral joint. The presented protocol intends to assess the impact&#xD;
      of a germanium-embedded knee brace on patient recovery after Knee Arthroscopy. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure was chosen for its implications for the design and conduct of the study,1&#xD;
      including well-validated outcome instrument for comparison, facilitation of a priori power&#xD;
      analysis, randomization, and blinding. Secondary outcomes were chosen for their pertinence to&#xD;
      surgeon decision-making during patient rehabilitation.&#xD;
