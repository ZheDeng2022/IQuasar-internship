  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goals of this pilot investigation are to determine 1) the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting home based WBV studies, and 2) to determine if sub-acute home based WBV can&#xD;
      improve a) exercise capacity, b) conduit- and micro- vascular function, and c) skeletal&#xD;
      muscle function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world and many comorbid&#xD;
      conditions (i.e. diabetes, obesity) can affect overall CVD risk. There is increasing interest&#xD;
      into the role that skeletal muscle health plays in mediating CVD risk, particularly in&#xD;
      metabolic disease states (ie. obesity and diabetes). Whole body vibration (WBV) has emerged&#xD;
      as an exercise mimetic that may be more tolerable than traditional modes of exercise, such as&#xD;
      treadmill walking/running or cycling. Similar to traditional exercise modalities, WBV can&#xD;
      elicit beneficial metabolic effects. In fact, a single bout of WBV increases circulating&#xD;
      concentrations of IL-6, which correspond with the normalization of glucose and insulin in&#xD;
      obese individuals. The proposed pilot investigation will provide the foundation to begin&#xD;
      understanding the molecular and physiological mechanisms of how sub-acute WBV can improve&#xD;
      overall CVD risk. We hypothesize that home based WBV will decrease CVD risk by improving&#xD;
      skeletal muscle and vascular function via a decrease in systemic inflammation.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be given a personal vibration plate to take home with them for training which will last for 12 weeks. For the first four weeks, participants will be asked to complete 10 minutes of WBV per day (1 minute on and up to 1 minute of rest), at least 3-4 days per week. At least 24 hours will be recommended in between sessions during weeks 1-4. Beginning at week 5, participants will be asked to increase WBV time to up to 14 minutes and/or reduce the duration of rest. Beginning at week 9, participants will be asked to increase WBV time to up to 20 minutes and/or reduce the duration of rest.</description>
