  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial identifies the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      natural progesterone in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      Progesterone is a type of hormone made by the body that plays a role in the menstrual cycle&#xD;
      and pregnancy. Progesterone may help control tumor growth and spread in patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine that the pharmacokinetics of natural progesterone given to recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma [GBM] patients by subcutaneous injection is consistent with previous&#xD;
      determinations made given subcutaneously using the aqueous formulation of progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety of administering daily subcutaneous natural progesterone for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with recurrent GBMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of stable disease (SD) or better (partial response [PR] or&#xD;
      complete response [CR]) at 8 weeks in eligible patients with recurrent GBM treated with daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous natural progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine and compare the progression free survival of eligible patients with recurrent&#xD;
      GBM compared with matched historical controls treated with a range of standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine and compare the overall survival of eligible patients with recurrent GBM&#xD;
      compared with matched historical controls treated with a range of standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether progesterone receptor levels within the tumor correlates with&#xD;
      response to daily subcutaneous natural progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if other intrinsic tumor factors (mutations and genomic loss/gains)&#xD;
      correlates with response to daily subcutaneous natural progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if the absolute values or changes in the level of serum biomarkers&#xD;
      correlates with response to daily subcutaneous natural progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the quality-of-life (QOL) by validated instruments of eligible patients with&#xD;
      recurrent GBM treated with daily subcutaneous natural progesterone and assess whether this&#xD;
      differs from historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive progesterone subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) for up to 24 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
