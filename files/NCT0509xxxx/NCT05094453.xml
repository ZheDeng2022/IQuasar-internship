      Intubating airway as a new means of intubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is one of the fundamental skills that should be mastered by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. One of the important causes of anesthesia related mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      is difficult airway related events (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key step in endotracheal intubation is the alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal&#xD;
      axes. More recently a 2-curve concept has been proposed, involving a primary (oro-pharyngeal&#xD;
      curve) and a secondary (pharyngo-glotto-tracheal) curve (2). The need to align the visual&#xD;
      axis to these axes is a common reason for poor visualization of the glottis and the&#xD;
      difficulty encountered during endotracheal intubation. Video laryngoscopes (VLS) overcome&#xD;
      this problem by allowing the viewer to see the glottis through a camera attached to a curved&#xD;
      blade (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several video laryngoscopes (VLS) are available in the market to facilitate endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. These devices are precluded by their cost and availability especially in&#xD;
      developing countries (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Borescope is an instrument that is used to see through a small hole. The endoscope camera&#xD;
      diameter is 5.5 mm and the cable is 1 m long with flexible fiber which could be bended as&#xD;
      needed. It is illuminated by circumferentially arranged 6 LED lamps on the head of camera.&#xD;
      The other end of cable is connected to Android smart phone (Samsung galaxy S5) which supports&#xD;
      OTG (on-the-go) function (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universal Serial Bus (USB) borescopes are commonly used in dental procedures as a dental&#xD;
      imaging system(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Borescopes are rugged, waterproof and work on trickle power from USB ports of a laptop,&#xD;
      computer or a Smartphone (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Smartphone provides the power supply and processes the image. The resultant image can be&#xD;
      viewed and recorded in any Smartphone by using a variety of free video capture available&#xD;
      applications. The auto detect feature of Smartphones allows the image to appear as soon as&#xD;
      the USB device is connected, thus requiring minimal time to set up. As the device is&#xD;
      waterproof it can be easily sterilized by soap water and glutaraldehyde (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vadhanan et al. have designed a low-cost VLS (&quot;v-scope&quot;) using a straight Miller blade. They&#xD;
      attached an USB borescope to a Miller's blade by waterproof tapes and connected it to a smart&#xD;
      phone via an USB-OTG (On the go) cable. Interestingly, they compared it to a conventional&#xD;
      Miller blade for intubation and concluded that an ordinary borescope can be used as an&#xD;
      effective VLS which is cost effective, easy to assemble and use and can provide acceptable&#xD;
      glottis views even in the hands of non-experts (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Karippacheril et al described a similar scope, but using a Macintosh blade, in February 2016.&#xD;
      The device used the video processing capabilities of a personal computer to display real&#xD;
      processing present in the ubiquitous smart phone, keeping the initial and recurring costs of&#xD;
      the technique low (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since economic consideration is very crucial in developing countries as ours, this study is&#xD;
      going to test a safe, low cost technique of visually assisted intubation using the Borescope&#xD;
      and Fekry airway instead of the high cost offered by different video laryngoscopes (VLS)&#xD;
      available in the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fekry airway (Oral Intubating Airway; Egyptian Patent 28118):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several modifications and versions of oro-pharyngeal airways are introduced into the market&#xD;
      to facilitate fiberoptic intubation and easy removal of the airway after placement of ETT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fekry airway is a modification of the Williams airway. The modification made to the Williams&#xD;
      airway is that the roof of the proximal cylindrical tunnel is removed thus the airway became&#xD;
      open anteriorly. This modification offers the following advantages: it allows easy one step&#xD;
      insertion of the tube. Also it facilitates the airway removal after ETT insertion without&#xD;
      need to remove the international connection of the ETT (8). Thus Fekry airway can be easily&#xD;
      removed from around the tube while it is connected to anesthesia machine (this reduces the&#xD;
      risk of inadvertent ETT dislodgement during airway removal) (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is introducing a novel way to replace the high cost videolaryngoscopy to be used&#xD;
      for safe educational purposes and management of difficult airway scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the borescope in association with Fekry oral airway will introduce a&#xD;
      new means for low cost, efficient video assisted endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
