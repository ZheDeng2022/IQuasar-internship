  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this observational study is to characterize changes in bone turnover&#xD;
      makers (BTMs), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone microarchitecture in a cohort of nurses&#xD;
      during their first year of night compared to day shift work. The hypothesis is that night&#xD;
      shift nurses will have poorer bone health indices at one year compared to day shift nurses.&#xD;

        We will recruit volunteers from the pool of recently graduated new nurse hires at UCH. We&#xD;
        will target our recruitment towards units that work the night shift (floor/ICU units) or&#xD;
        day shifts (peri-operative and operating room units).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy, nonpregnant adults 20-50 years old who recently (â‰¤6 months) graduated from&#xD;
             nursing school and were hired by University of Colorado Hospital for their first&#xD;
             nursing position&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women to be eligible, they must be premenopausal, on continuous combination oral&#xD;
             contraception, and not breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to travel to/from Anschutz Medical Center for study measurements at&#xD;
             baseline and quarterly for one full year&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-nursing school related shift work 1 year prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current smokers at baseline (or within the previous year of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are concurrently participating in another research protocol that would&#xD;
             influence their safe participation in this study. For example, participants involved&#xD;
             in a study that requires blood draws or ingestion of experimental medication as this&#xD;
             would increase the risk of participation in our study and/or compromise study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant unstable medical or surgical condition within the last year&#xD;
             (treated or untreated), including history of a clinically significant abnormality of&#xD;
             the neurological system (including cognitive disorders or significant head injury) or&#xD;
             any history of seizure (including febrile seizure-sleep loss has been used clinically&#xD;
             to induce seizures in patients with epilepsy). Given the wide range of illnesses that&#xD;
             are encountered in medical practice, it would not be possible to provide a&#xD;
             comprehensive list of each and every disease that could serve as grounds for exclusion&#xD;
             for the subject. However, the following is a list of illness categories that would&#xD;
             certainly be grounds for exclusion: Connective Tissue and Joint Disorders;&#xD;
             Neurologic/cognitive Disorders; Musculoskeletal Disorders; Immune Disorders;&#xD;
             Chronobiologic Disorders; Cardiovascular Disorders; Respiratory Disorders; Kidney&#xD;
             Disorders; Infectious Diseases; Hematopoietic Disorders; Neoplastic Diseases; and&#xD;
             Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported or newly diagnosed medical condition that is still being investigated or&#xD;
             is not under good control, including those identified on screening labs such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Out-of-range values measured on a fasting blood sample: glucose &gt; 100 mg/dl, thyroid&#xD;
             stimulating hormone &lt;0.5 or &gt;5.0 microUnits/ml, abnormal alkaline phosphatase &lt;39 or&#xD;
             &gt;117 U/l, creatinine, or hemoglobin &lt;14.5 g/dl men&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinically significant psychiatric condition, as defined by the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition). Individuals with a history of&#xD;
             most psychiatric illnesses or psychiatric disorders will be excluded, such as but not&#xD;
             limited to depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug dependency, schizophrenic disorders,&#xD;
             and personality disorders (performed by medical history and physician interview).&#xD;
             However, a personal history of limited prior counseling, psychotherapy (e.g., for&#xD;
             adjustment reactions) will NOT be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evaluation of Psychiatric/Psychological Suitability:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to demonstrate a full understanding of the requirements and demands of&#xD;
                  the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Individuals who are unaware of specific psychiatric diagnoses who have a history&#xD;
                  of having been treated with antidepressants, neuroleptic medications or major&#xD;
                  tranquilizers will be excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of anti-depressants or any like therapeutics prescribed by a physician is&#xD;
                  exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with any clinically significant sleep disorder; Diagnosis or symptoms of&#xD;
             sleep disorders (history of significant parasomnia as an adult [night terrors,&#xD;
             frequent sleep walking], insomnia, including but not limited to hypersomnias such as&#xD;
             apnea, periodic limb movements, narcolepsy). Sleep disorders will be screened by&#xD;
             self-report and physician interview including use of validated sleep questionnaires&#xD;
             (PSQI, Epworth sleepiness scale, and Berlin sleep questionnaire for sleep apnea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals on medications known to affect bone turnover (e.g., glucocorticoids,&#xD;
             osteoporosis medications);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dwelling below Denver altitude (1,600 m) 1 month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2 as&#xD;
             this is known to affect CTX measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms of active illness (e.g., fever) at time of enrollment; note - participant may&#xD;
             be studied at a later date if they have not yet started their clinical duties by that&#xD;
             time&#xD;
