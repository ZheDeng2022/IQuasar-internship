      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1 : Regarding the recentness of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation&#xD;
           with an uptake of 20% and according to the first consultative meeting, awareness and&#xD;
           acceptability of PrEP seems to be low in key-populations of Cambodia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2 : Individual, social and structural barriers and facilitating factors of&#xD;
           PrEP implementation as perceived by health workers and community-based organizations&#xD;
           would be similar to what was observed worldwide 4,8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: Some subgroups of key-populations are difficult to reach in health&#xD;
           facilities. Community organizations can play a critical role to provide PrEP&#xD;
           information, initiation and counselling with the support of new technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 4: Community organizations might lack financial, logistical and skill&#xD;
           capacities to deliver PrEP in good conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To qualitatively evaluate the knowledge, awareness, perception, experience and&#xD;
      acceptability of PrEP among key populations (entertainment workers (EW), men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (MSM), transgender women (TW)), and among healthcare and community workers in charge&#xD;
      of key populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand the characteristics, needs and expectations of community-based&#xD;
           organizations (CBOs), in order to define the optimal conditions for community-based PrEP&#xD;
           implementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify tools that could be useful to increase PrEP awareness and acceptability,&#xD;
           especially new technologies (apps, websites)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Qualitative study Focus groups with key-populations, healthcare and community&#xD;
      workers Semi-directive interviews with decision makers and policy makers Estimated enrolment:&#xD;
      10 participants per focus group, 8 focus groups, 80 participants in focus groups, 6&#xD;
      interviewed persons, 86 participants in total&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Men who have sex with men (MSM), entertainment workers (EW), transgender&#xD;
      women (TGW), healthcare workers, community workers, decision and policy makers&#xD;
