      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most encountered fetal malformation. The&#xD;
      incidence of congenital heart disease appears to be about 1 per 100 live born infants and is&#xD;
      even higher in infants who die before term (1). Fetal echocardiography (FE) has evolved from&#xD;
      just the description of the anatomical abnormalities of the heart toward quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of its function, dimension and shape (2). Presently, FE is performed manually by&#xD;
      the sonographer during the second trimester investigation. However, only half of the babies&#xD;
      undergoing surgery within the first year of life have a prenatal detection (3), explaining&#xD;
      the need for an improvement of the fetal cardiac assessment. Many studies showed the presence&#xD;
      of a significant discrepancy between the pre- and postnatal diagnosis of the CHD obtained by&#xD;
      a manually performed FE (4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intelligent Decision Support Systems (ISs) are frameworks that have the capacity to gather&#xD;
      and analyze data, communicate with other systems, learn from experience, and adapt according&#xD;
      to new cases. Technically speaking, ISs are advanced machines that observe and respond to the&#xD;
      environment that they have been exposed to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) (6). This&#xD;
      project aims to foster a cross-fertilization of FE and ISs, which will provide an enormous&#xD;
      potential in developing new fundamental theories and practical methods that rise above the&#xD;
      boundaries of the disciplines involved and lead to new impactful methods that assist medical&#xD;
      practice and discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study to be performed is a cross-sectional study divided into two separated parts: the&#xD;
      training part of the machine learning approaches within the proposed framework and the&#xD;
      testing phase on previously unseen frames and eventually on actual video scans. All pregnant&#xD;
      women in their first and second trimester are considered eligible for the study. Pregnant&#xD;
      women will be admitted for their routine ultrasound examination and monitoring, first time&#xD;
      between 12-13+6 weeks of pregnancy (for the first trimester anomaly scan) and / or between&#xD;
      18-24 weeks of pregnancy (for the second trimester anomaly scan). Two-dimensional evaluation&#xD;
      of each fetal heart will include a cine loop sweep obtained from the from the four-chamber&#xD;
      view plane by moving the transducer cranially towards the upper mediastinum, allowing the&#xD;
      visualization of the following planes: four-chamber view, left and right ventricular outflow&#xD;
      tracts, three vessels and trachea view. All video files saved from the US devices will be&#xD;
      collected into the cloud. Each ultrasound sweep will be split into frames by the&#xD;
      OB-GYN/Cardio (OBC) department. The Data Science / IT department (DSIT) will process the&#xD;
      frames for obeying the anonymization regulations. For key feature identification, the frames&#xD;
      will be grouped by the OBC into the classes that represent the plane views for each&#xD;
      trimester. DSIT will try different state-of-the-art DL pre-trained algorithms on the data set&#xD;
      with plane views. All the recent DL entries will be tailored and tested on the current two&#xD;
      scenarios of key view identification and semantic segmentation. Their performance results&#xD;
      (their prediction against the ground truth marked by the OBC) will be analyzed in comparison&#xD;
      by means of a statistical test. The accuracy-speed equilibrium will be taken into account in&#xD;
      the ranking of the approaches, since the system will finally perform on a video. Once a new&#xD;
      video will be available in practice, the model chosen for the respective task will highlight&#xD;
      the key feature or the segmented region on video and also provide a degree of confidence in&#xD;
      its recognition. The OBC physicians will validate all the intermediary findings at frame&#xD;
      level, as well as the meaningfulness of the video labelling and segmentation. The outcomes of&#xD;
      the model on the first and second trimester videos of the same patient will be compared to&#xD;
      assess the discrepancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database construction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data set for AI analysis will be constructed from images extracted from ultrasound scans&#xD;
      taken in the apical plane. Consequently, a classification problem with four categories&#xD;
      corresponding to the given key views is considered. An additional Other class is appointed&#xD;
      and populated with images of other unimportant frames from the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image preprocessing for fetal heart scans:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step is represented by the extraction performed by converting the image to gray&#xD;
      scale and applying a threshold. In this way, the background noise is discarded. In order to&#xD;
      eliminate the small bridges between the area of interest and other areas in the image,&#xD;
      erosion is applied using a 10x10 pixels kernel. After erosion, besides the area of interest,&#xD;
      several smaller &quot;islands&quot; may appear in the image. The zone of interest has two properties&#xD;
      that distinguish it from the rest of the islands: it always covers the central area of the&#xD;
      image and it has the highest area. In order to eliminate the non-relevant islands, the spots&#xD;
      that cover the central area of the image are first identified, then the spot with the highest&#xD;
      surface coverage is selected. The detected spot is filled, then the dimension is restored by&#xD;
      applying a dilation algorithm, using the same kernel of 10x10 pixels. In order to prevent&#xD;
      losing the fine details around the dilated spot, its convex hull is drawn and filled. In the&#xD;
      end, the generated spot is used as a mask to extract the area of interest from the original&#xD;
      image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three variants of the data collection are considered: the original double-sided (standard +&#xD;
      Doppler) samples, the Doppler single crops and merged image pairs of resulting standard and&#xD;
      Doppler crops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ResNet18 and ResNet50 architectures, with similar setups, are applied for each data set&#xD;
      in turn for evaluating the suitability of the preliminary processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the data collections with cropped images contain representatives from all the initial&#xD;
      images, all sets thus have the same number of items and structure per each class, as well as&#xD;
      for the training, validation and test separations. For an objective evaluation, all images&#xD;
      that are extracted from a patient lie within the same separation of the data set, i.e.&#xD;
      training, validation or test. This occurs even if there were multiple video files for a&#xD;
      patient made at different moments (e.g. weeks apart) in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images are resized to 224 Ã— 224 pixels. The 1cycle policy is used and the implementation&#xD;
      is made using fastai and PyTorch libraries. The initial model weights are taken through&#xD;
      transfer learning, as pretrained on the ImageNet data set. The default options for data&#xD;
      augmentations are used. There are 2 steps involved in the training process, each containing&#xD;
      only 10 epochs. Within the first training session, all layers are frozen, except for the&#xD;
      batch normalization layers and the head of the model. Its choice controls how the weights of&#xD;
      the network are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient and selecting a proper value is&#xD;
      essential for making the model converging to a local minimum, and reaching thus improved&#xD;
      accuracy in a smaller amount of epochs. The batch size is taken equal to 32. The model that&#xD;
      hits the highest accuracy on the validation data is applied on the test set. For each of the&#xD;
      2 architectures and for each separate data set, 5 repeated applications are made and the&#xD;
      reported results for each case are computed as the average over the 5 outcomes. The runs are&#xD;
      made in Google Colab, using Tesla T4 for GPU. B. The successful gradient class activation map&#xD;
      (Grad-CAM) approach is used for outlining the decisions of the model for the Aorta and Other&#xD;
      labelling for each data set. The plots are derived from the 5 runs that are computed for each&#xD;
      distinct (architecture, data set) setup.&#xD;
