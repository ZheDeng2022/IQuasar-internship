  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot project is designed to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      offering small financial incentives for the completion of smoking cessation counseling and&#xD;
      biochemically-verified smoking abstinence at follow-up among Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline (OTH)&#xD;
      callers living in persistent poverty counties (PPCs). The study will enroll 160 adults who&#xD;
      reside in any of the 12 persistent poverty counties in Oklahoma, who are seeking smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment through the OTH.&#xD;

      The proposed randomized controlled trial will enroll 160 adults who are seeking smoking&#xD;
      cessation treatment through the OTH and who reside in any of the 12 PPCs in Oklahoma.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to OTH or OTH plus escalating incentives (OTH+I) for&#xD;
      completing up to 5 counseling calls over 8 weeks and for biochemically-verified smoking&#xD;
      abstinence at 8-weeks post-enrollment. Feasibility outcomes for the incentives-based&#xD;
      intervention will focus on counseling call completion, follow-up assessment completion,&#xD;
      smoking cessation, incentive costs, and perceptions of the intervention. Potential&#xD;
      effectiveness will be evaluated based on comparisons of counseling call completions and rates&#xD;
      of smartphone-based biochemically-verified smoking abstinence at 12 weeks post-enrollment (4&#xD;
      weeks after incentives have ended) in OTH+I relative to OTH alone.&#xD;

    <description>The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated as the difference in mean costs between the new (CM) and standard treatment (SC) divided by the difference in mean effectiveness between the two, estimates additional resources needed to achieve an increase of one unit of effectiveness. The ICER is then compared with published threshold values for cost-effective interventions. The cost model will include all necessary personnel, hardware, and material costs.</description>
