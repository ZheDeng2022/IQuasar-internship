  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer accounts for 28% of all cancer cases in Europe (&quot;WHO,&quot; 2018). Coping with&#xD;
      breast cancer is becoming an increasingly burdensome socio-economic challenge, partly due to&#xD;
      the increasing incidence registered in the last years, which is occurring despite continuous&#xD;
      advances in medicine. This said, mortality rate has decreased significantly as 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate has risen from 75% to 90% (&quot;Breast Cancer Research Foundation,&quot; 2016). For&#xD;
      these reasons the number of cancer survivors has grown, with important effects on quality of&#xD;
      life even years after the end of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of successful adaptation to breast cancer and the various accompanying stressors&#xD;
      can be conceptually defined as the person's resilience. Resilience is a complex construct&#xD;
      that can be defined on different levels: an individual's potential (capacity to engage in&#xD;
      adaptive coping processes), a process (adaptive reactions to adversity), and an outcome (the&#xD;
      final state achieved as the result of coping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While theoretical contributions regarding resilience models in medical settings have been&#xD;
      advanced (Deshields et al., 2016), to date no one has tested the integrated contributing role&#xD;
      of multiple psychological, biological and functional variables in predicting the patient's&#xD;
      ability to bounce back from the stressful life event of being diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;
      Resilience is going to be measured through a data-driven method (computation of resilience&#xD;
      index on the basis of retrospective data) and through a psychometric method (various domains&#xD;
      of resilience through questionnaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing need for novel strategies to improve the understanding and the capacity to&#xD;
      predict resilience of women to the variety of stressful experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOUNCE European Project (H2020 European Project &quot;Predicting Effective Adaptation to Breast&#xD;
      Cancer to Help Women to BOUNCE back&quot;; Grant Agreement Nr: 777167) will bring together&#xD;
      modelling, medical, and social sciences experts to advance current knowledge on the dynamic&#xD;
      nature of resilience as it relates to improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad and general objective of the BOUNCE project is to build a quantitative mathematical&#xD;
      model of factors associated with optimal adjustment capacity to cancer. The investigators&#xD;
      will collect biomedical status (BMS), the psychosocial status (PSS) and the functional status&#xD;
      (FUS) of breast cancer patients that literature demonstrated to be predictive of patients'&#xD;
      capacity to bounce back during the highly stressful treatment and recovery period following&#xD;
      diagnosis of breast cancer. The overarching goal of the model is to understand which factors&#xD;
      predict optimal adjustment to breast cancer and which combination of factors undermine&#xD;
      adjustment. This would allow early identification of women at risk for which it is better to&#xD;
      intervene through a personalised psychological support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding: The BOUNCE Project &quot;Predicting Effective Adaptation to Breast Cancer to Help Women&#xD;
      to BOUNCE back&quot; has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and&#xD;
      innovation programme, Project type: H2020 - SCI-2017-CNECT-2; Project type: H2020 -&#xD;
      SCI-2017-CNECT-2; Grant Agreement Nr: 777167.&#xD;
