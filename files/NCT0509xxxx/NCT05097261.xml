  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although, in the past years, an increasing use of ketamine in Traumatic Brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      has been reported as an adjunct to other sedatives, there is no evidence from randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial to support this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIKe (Brain Injury and Ketamine) study is a double-blind placebo controlled randomized&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial to examine the safety and feasibility of using ketamine as an&#xD;
      adjunct to a standard sedative strategy in TBI patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effects of ketamine as an adjunct to an standard sedation regime in adult&#xD;
      TBI patients will be investigated on the therapy intensity level and intracranial pressure.&#xD;
      All patients will receive propofol for sedation to control ICP, to a maximum dose of 4&#xD;
      mg/kg/h. If the ICP is not controlled at the maximum dose of propofol, midazolam will be&#xD;
      added, to a maximum dose of 0.3 mg/kg/h, as part of the current standard of care in the&#xD;
      Participating Sites. All patients will receive remifentanil, fentanyl or sufentanil infusions&#xD;
      for pain relief. The study medication (ketamine or placebo) will be started after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the current standard of care in the Participating Sites, the decision for&#xD;
      decompressive craniectomy and/or barbiturate coma will be taken after multidisciplinary&#xD;
      consultation between the treating intensivist and neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to stop or reduce sedation, lies with the treating physician, based on the level&#xD;
      of ICP control, the absence of clinical or radiological signs of deterioration of the&#xD;
      neurologic state. In the case of barbiturate coma, the study drug will be discontinued.&#xD;
      During and following decompressive craniectomy, the sedative regime (propofol/midazolam/study&#xD;
      drug/ opioids) will be continued. In case of suspected or threatening Propofol-Related&#xD;
      Infusion syndrome, propofol will be stopped and switched to midazolam. In case of&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia &gt;200 mg/dL, propofol will be reduced and if necessary, midazolam will be&#xD;
      associated to allow control of sedation. During surgical procedures related to the traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury or not, the study drug will not be discontinued. The use of open label&#xD;
      administration of ketamine is not allowed during the course of the trial, i.e until hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
