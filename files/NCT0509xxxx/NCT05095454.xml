      A study comparing short-term delivery of epidural spinal stimulation versus transcutaneous&#xD;
      spinal stimulation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare spinal motor nerve response to electrical stimulation&#xD;
      delivered directly to the epidural space, and delivered through the skin (transcutaneously),&#xD;
      and to measure any changes in motor performance over the course of about 5 months, during and&#xD;
      after using one of the two types of stimulation.&#xD;

    <description>Change in measurements of impairment of sensory and motor functions using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AISA Scale). Individuals are classified from A&quot; (complete spinal cord injury) to &quot;E&quot; (normal function). 28 dermatomes and 10 key muscles are assessed bilaterally. Results are summed to produce overall sensory and motor scores and are used in combination with evaluation of anal sensory and motor function as a basis for the determination of AIS classification. Sensory scores are rated 0 (sensation absent) to 2 (normal), bilaterally for each of 28 dermatomes. Muscle function is rated 0 (total paralysis) to 5 (active movement, full range of motion against significant resistance) for each myotome. Upper Extremity Motor Subscores and Lower Extremity Motor Subscores are each scored from 0 to 50; the ASIA Motor Score is scored from 0 to 100. The presence of anal sensation and voluntary anal contraction are assessed as a yes/no.</description>
