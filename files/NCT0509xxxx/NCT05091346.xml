  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1b part of this study is conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of E7386&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with previously treated selected solid&#xD;
      tumors, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7386 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 part of this study is conducted to assess the objective response rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with previously treated selected&#xD;
      solid tumors (melanoma, colorectal cancer [CRC], hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) according to&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;

    <measure>Phase 1b Part: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Cycle length is equal to [=] 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are any pre-specified toxicities occurring during Cycle 1, based on investigator assessment as related to study drug. All adverse events (AEs) of the specified grades should count as DLTs except those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease progression or extraneous causes. DLTs will be assessed to determine the RP2D of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab. All toxicity will be graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1b Part: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>

    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until progressive disease (PD) or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1b Part: Best of Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until PD or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 2 years 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>BOR is defined as CR, PR, stable disease (SD), PD, and not evaluable (NE), where SD has to be achieved at greater than equal to (&gt;=) 5 weeks after the first dose per RECIST version 1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD is defined as &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference-smallest sum recorded in study (sum at baseline if that was smallest). Sum of diameters must have absolute increase of &gt;=5 mm. Appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions also considered PD.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first documented CR or PR until first documentation of recurrent or progressive disease or death (up to approximately 2 years 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first in participants with confirmed CR or PR as per RECIST version 1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD is defined as &gt;=20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, reference-smallest sum recorded in study (sum at baseline if that was smallest). Sum of diameters must have absolute increase of &gt;=5 mm. Appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions also considered PD.</description>

    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of confirmed CR, PR, or SD after &gt;=5 weeks from first dose per RECIST version 1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until PD or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 2 years 7 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a BOR of confirmed CR, PR, or durable SD (duration of SD &gt;=23 weeks) per RECIST 1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
