  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is based on federal legislation that requires evaluation of a program being&#xD;
      implemented and delivered by Saint Francis Ministries, a community-based non-profit&#xD;
      organization serving children and families. Saint Francis Ministries received federal funds&#xD;
      to expand and deliver the Fatherhood FIRE Program to community-based and justice-system&#xD;
      involved fathers in their service area. The FIRE program, which stands for Family-Oriented,&#xD;
      Interconnected, Resilient, and Essential, aims to promote responsible and positive fatherhood&#xD;
      parenting practices and develop and maintain healthy relationships with their partners and&#xD;
      other co-parents (e.g., mothers of their children). Evaluation of the program is a condition&#xD;
      of Saint Francis Ministries' grant award from the U.S. Department of Health and Human&#xD;
      Services. The KU evaluation team at the School of Social Welfare has been contracted by Saint&#xD;
      Francis Ministries to conduct the evaluation. The evaluation will be carried out in two&#xD;
      parts: 1) a process evaluation and 2 an outcomes evaluation. The process and target&#xD;
      populations for both the process and outcomes components are as follows. PROCESS EVALUATION:&#xD;
      The process study involves individuals involved in the implementation of the Fatherhood FIRE&#xD;
      program at Saint Francis Ministries. Specific populations eligible for inclusion in the&#xD;
      process evaluation include: (1) implementation teams facilitating the Fatherhood FIRE program&#xD;
      in three states in Saint Francis Ministries service area (Kansas, Nebraska, &amp; Texas), (2)&#xD;
      members of the Fatherhood FIRE Data, Assessment, and Dissemination Workgroup, an advisory&#xD;
      group comprised of Saint Francis program administrators and the evaluation team charged with&#xD;
      planning and overseeing data collection, evaluation, and dissemination efforts, and (3) the&#xD;
      evaluation study team. OUTCOMES EVALUATION: Fathers ages 18 and older who are not&#xD;
      incarcerated and are enrolled and participating in the Fatherhood FIRE program. To be&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion in the evaluation study, program participants must not be&#xD;
      incarcerated, have children up to age 24, and may be living with or apart from their&#xD;
      children. Eligible participants may be biological parents, adoptive or foster parents, or&#xD;
      other caregivers in the parenting role if they have children who meet the age criteria.&#xD;
