      CONTEXT Vaccination has reduced mortality and morbidity by controlling many&#xD;
      vaccine-preventable diseases. To prevent recurrence of these diseases, high vaccine coverages&#xD;
      (VCs) (≥ 95%) are needed. But VCs for infants remain suboptimal, and four out of 10 parents&#xD;
      doubt the safety and efficacy of vaccines in France. The Ministry of Health therefore decided&#xD;
      in July 2017 to expand vaccination requirements to 11 valences now required to enter in young&#xD;
      children collective structures. This measure, which went into effect in January 2018, has&#xD;
      produced significant effects on VCs, but despite this, vaccine hesitancy (VH) persists in the&#xD;
      general population at a prevalence level that fluctuates around 20% to 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational interviewing is a collaborative conversational style that reinforces a person's&#xD;
      own motivation and commitment to behavior change. It has been successfully tested in multiple&#xD;
      domains related to health behavior change. It has also been adapted in Quebec in the area of&#xD;
      vaccination and tested in maternity wards with postpartum mothers (Promovac study). Having&#xD;
      led to an increase in the VCs of infants by an average of 7 percentage points and a 40%&#xD;
      decrease in vaccine hesitancy, this approach has been in the process of being generalized to&#xD;
      all maternity units in Quebec since 2017 (EMMIE program). It is indeed proving to be one of&#xD;
      the most effective at present in improving confidence in early childhood vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The main objective of this research is to provide proof of concept that, in the&#xD;
      French context of mandatory vaccination for infants but also of high rates of VH, an&#xD;
      educational strategy based on the principles and techniques of motivational interviewing and&#xD;
      carried out with parents in the maternity ward in the days following delivery can reduce&#xD;
      vaccine hesitancy (VH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to verify that this reduction in VH is associated with a change in knowledge, attitudes,&#xD;
           and beliefs regarding vaccines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to verify that this reduction is sustainable (at 12 months);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the acceptability and satisfaction of the interview for the parents&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS This is a pragmatic randomized controlled multicenter study with individual&#xD;
      randomization unit comparing the impact of motivational interviewing to a standard care with&#xD;
      a leaflet on vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational interviewing will be carried out by trained midwives from the two participating&#xD;
      maternity units (one in Marseille (Bouches-du-Rhône) and the other in Toulon (Var)), as part&#xD;
      of the routine care provided to parturients. The midwives will be trained by the founding&#xD;
      specialist of motivational interviewing in Quebec, during a two and a half day training&#xD;
      course. This training will include a presentation of the theoretical foundations of this&#xD;
      approach, its adaptation to the field of vaccination, and interactive games to put it into&#xD;
      practice. The trained midwives will then be able to put this approach into practice during a&#xD;
      one-month pilot period with parturients, during which they will be able to benefit from&#xD;
      support in the form of a debriefing. The actual survey will only start at the end of this&#xD;
      pilot phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, a questionnaire will be offered to the women (couples) who have agreed to&#xD;
      participate, both before the motivational interview (or delivery of the leaflet) and after&#xD;
      the interview (or delivery of the leaflet). The second questionnaire will be completed before&#xD;
      discharge from the maternity hospital. A third evaluation time is planned at 12 months in&#xD;
      both groups: it will be carried out by internet or telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the change in the vaccine hesitancy score, measured by an&#xD;
      international scale validated in French (Opel scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be changes in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about vaccination&#xD;
      between the two groups as well as satisfaction with the ME and the brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed in blocks of 8, prior to acceptance for participation in this&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED BENEFITS If the results of this research provide proof of concept that the&#xD;
      educational strategy based on motivational interviewing adapted to the vaccination of infants&#xD;
      after delivery, in maternity wards, makes it possible, in the French context, to reduce VH,&#xD;
      this will be a major advance in public health in France. Indeed, even if the vaccination&#xD;
      obligations introduced in January 2018 have had a positive impact on infant vaccination&#xD;
      coverage, VH remains present in parents in a proportion that remains worrying (20 to 25%&#xD;
      according to surveys). The results of this research will then allow us to study the&#xD;
      conditions for generalizing motivational interviewing in order to reinforce confidence in&#xD;
      vaccination, which is lacking in a significant part of the French population.&#xD;
