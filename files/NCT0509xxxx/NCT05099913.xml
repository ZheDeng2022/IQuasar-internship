  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to investigate the effect of central neuromodulators on refractory&#xD;
      functional dyspepsia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a prevalent disease combined with emotional disorders.&#xD;
      Antidepressants are beneficial in the treatment of refractory FD, while for the long-term use&#xD;
      of antidepressants, it could lead to withdrawal syndrome or other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refractory FD patients were unsatisfied with the regular first-line anti-acid treatment.&#xD;
      However, many patients were worried about taking antidiepressants, even though guideline has&#xD;
      recommended antidepressant use in FD. In our study, we would use low-dose and short-term&#xD;
      antidepressant in refractory FD patients, and investigate whether short-term antidepressants&#xD;
      application would improve therapeutic efficacy and minimize antidepressant withdrawal of FD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from baseline Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) scores at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks were obtained to assess the dyspepsia outcomes.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LDQ scores of 0-4 were classified as very mild dyspepsia, 5-8 as mild dyspepsia, 9-15 as moderate dyspepsia, and &gt;15 as severe or very severe dyspepsia.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks was obtained to assess the depression contition after treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 scores of 0-4 were classified as none or minimal depression, 5-9 as mild, 10-14 as moderate, 15-19 as moderately severe, and ≥20 as severe depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline Generalized Anxiety Questonaire-7 (GAD-7) scores at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks were obtained to assess the anxiety contition after treatment.</measure>

    <description>The GAD-7 scores of 0-4 were classified as the absence of anxiety, 5-9 as mild, 10-14 as moderate, and ≥15 as severe.</description>
