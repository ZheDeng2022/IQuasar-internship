  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH), a reduced amount of oxygen in the arterial blood&#xD;
      during exercise, has been observed in otherwise healthy, highly-trained endurance athletes&#xD;
      during exercise at sea level. The extent of the arterial deoxygenation may be influenced by a&#xD;
      histamine-mediated inflammatory response at the pulmonary capillary-alveolar membrane&#xD;
      limiting oxygen diffusion. Moreover, while EIAH has been routinely explored in running and&#xD;
      cycling, swimming is understudied despite potential mechanistic avenues which may put&#xD;
      swimmers at further risk for EIAH. The purpose of this study is threefold: 1) to determine&#xD;
      whether highly-trained swimmers experience EIAH during submaximal and maximal exercise, 2) to&#xD;
      determine the extent to which histamine release influences oxyhemoglobin saturation during&#xD;
      swimming exercise, and 3) to determine whether nedocromil sodium (NS), a mast cell&#xD;
      stabilizer, and cetirizine HCl (CH), an H1-receptor competitive inhibitor, can improve&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin saturation during submaximal and maximal swimming exercise. Twenty-six (13 men,&#xD;
      13 women) highly-trained swimmers will complete an intense swimming protocol to assess the&#xD;
      histamine response to intense exercise. A subset with the highest histamine responses will&#xD;
      participate in three additional sessions (placebo, NS, and CH conditions) which will include&#xD;
      a swimming aerobic capacity test and 5-minutes of swimming at both 70 and 85% of their&#xD;
      maximal oxygen uptake.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the first testing session, participants will report to the Indiana University Human&#xD;
      Performance Laboratory to complete a medical screening and, if willing, consent to the&#xD;
      procedures of the study. The medical screening will include measurements of height, weight,&#xD;
      resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, and resting pulmonary function along with a&#xD;
      health history questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second testing session consists of an assessment of risk factors for development of EIAH,&#xD;
      specifically changes in blood biomarkers pre- and post-swimming exercise. Participants will&#xD;
      report to the Counsilman-Billingsley Aquatics Center and complete an exercise protocol&#xD;
      designed to elicit an inflammatory response. Venous blood draws will be performed to assess&#xD;
      participants' pre-exercise complete blood count and pre- and post-intense exercise&#xD;
      concentrations of plasma IL-1β, IL-8, plasma histamine, whole blood histamine, and histamine&#xD;
      release. Measurements of hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit will also be performed pre-&#xD;
      and post-exercise in order to correct biomarker concentrations for fluid loss during&#xD;
      exercise. Swimmers of each sex that exhibit the largest histamine release will be selected&#xD;
      for further study until at least four swimmers of each sex complete all three experimental&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that exhibit increases in inflammatory markers following swimming exercise will&#xD;
      visit the Human Performance Laboratory on three occasions separated by at least 48 hours and&#xD;
      no more than 60 days. Apart from receiving a placebo (PL) or different drug treatment&#xD;
      (nedocromil sodium, NS; cetirizine HCl, CH) prior to exercise, participants will perform&#xD;
      identical protocols on each visit to the laboratory. Participants will report to the lab and&#xD;
      consume either a placebo or CH pill, followed by a health history update questionnaire and&#xD;
      their resting pulmonary function will be measured. Participants will then complete a&#xD;
      self-selected warm-up that will be standardized across all three testing sessions, followed&#xD;
      by administration of either a placebo or NS through an inhaler and instrumentation. The&#xD;
      exercise protocol beings with a progressive swimming test to maximum aerobic capacity&#xD;
      (V̇O2max) in a swimming flume, followed by two constant load work bouts at approximately 70&#xD;
      and 85% of the previously recorded HRmax while peripheral capillary oxyhemoglobin saturation&#xD;
      (SpO2) is continuously monitored. Participants will receive a 20-min break between each work&#xD;
      bout. Drug treatments will be assigned in a double-blind, randomized crossover fashion such&#xD;
      that each participant receives each treatment. Concentrations of plasma histamine, whole&#xD;
      blood histamine, and histamine release will be assessed from pre- and post-exercise blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
