      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SP-103 in subjects with moderate to severe acute&#xD;
      lower back pain. Three to 7 days after the Screening Visit, subjects will return for a&#xD;
      Baseline visit to verify electronic Diary compliance, collect urine samples for a drug screen&#xD;
      and pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential), and complete baseline clinical&#xD;
      rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects meet all the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized into the study. Subjects are expected to apply investigational&#xD;
      product for 12 hours per study day) study days 1 through 28 and to record the time of&#xD;
      investigational product applications and removals an electronic diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will capture daily numeric pain rating scores and topical adhesions assessments in&#xD;
      the electronic diary each evening prior the removal of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 28, subjects will return to the study site to complete the End of Study visit.&#xD;
