      Infants aged 9 months will be randomized to receive a meningococcal vaccine at 9 months or 15&#xD;
      months. Infants randomized to the 9-month age group will be further randomized in a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive a single dose of the experimental meningococcal vaccine (NmCV-5) or a single dose&#xD;
      of the comparator meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT). Prospectively identified and consented&#xD;
      infants randomized to the 15-month age group will return when aged 15 months and will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single dose of NmCV-5 or a single dose of MenACWY-TT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meningococcal meningitis, caused by invasive strains of Neisseria meningitidis, is a major&#xD;
      public health concern because of its considerable morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa. Case fatality during meningococcal meningitis epidemics can surpass 15%, and rates of&#xD;
      permanent sequelae among meningitis survivors in Africa are twice as high as they are in high&#xD;
      income countries. Because of the fulminant clinical course of invasive bacterial meningitis&#xD;
      and difficulties in access to care in the African meningitis belt, prevention by vaccination&#xD;
      is the optimal way to reduce meningococcal meningitis morbidity and mortality. Before 2010,&#xD;
      serogroup A meningococcal strains were routinely responsible for the majority (70-96%) of&#xD;
      invasive meningococcal disease in sub-Saharan Africa. And annual epidemic could be associated&#xD;
      with an incidence of meningococcal disease which could range between 100-1000 cases per&#xD;
      100,000 persons in any given year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive introduction of MenAfriVac since 2010 has resulted in a substantial reduction in&#xD;
      cases of serogroup A meningococcal disease. However, regular large-scale epidemics due to&#xD;
      serogroups C, W and X remain common in the African meningitis belt. An affordable and&#xD;
      scalable pentavalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (NmCV-5) has been developed by Serum&#xD;
      Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. (SIIPL), the manufacturer of MenAfriVac. NmCV-5 is designed to&#xD;
      protect against serogroups A, C, W, Y and X. The immediate goal for the clinical development&#xD;
      of NmCV-5 is for WHO Pre-Qualification (WHO-PQ), to enable the vaccine to be used in the&#xD;
      Meningitis Belt of sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate a single dose of NmCV-5 administered at either 9 months or 15 months&#xD;
      of age, time points in the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule when meningococcal&#xD;
      vaccine is most likely to be administered. Infants aged 9 months will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive a meningococcal vaccine at 9 months or 15 months. Infants aged 9 months (eligibility&#xD;
      9-11 months) and randomized to the 9-month age group will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive a single dose of NmCV-5 or a single dose of MenACWY-TT. Prospectively identified and&#xD;
      consented infants randomized to the 15-month age group will return when aged 15 months&#xD;
      (eligibility 15-17 months) and will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single dose of&#xD;
      NmCV-5 or a single dose of MenACWY-TT. &quot;Enhanced&quot; EPI vaccines will be co-administered and&#xD;
      will consist of 2-doses of a measles-containing vaccine administered at 9 months and 15&#xD;
      months and a single dose of yellow fever vaccine administered at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol is designed to provide evidence that concomitant vaccination with NmCV-5&#xD;
      will not significantly affect the immune responses of infants to their normally scheduled EPI&#xD;
      vaccines. This study has been specifically designed to provide information at two distinct&#xD;
      timepoints, 9 months and 15 months. The current Mali EPI schedule consists of a measles only&#xD;
      vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and MenA vaccine at 9 months of age; there is no 15 months of&#xD;
      age EPI vaccine visit and typically only a single dose of a measles-containing vaccine is&#xD;
      administered. However, to satisfy the conditions for WHO-PQ, study participants will receive&#xD;
      two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, at 9-months and 15-months. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      noninferiority evaluation must include an assessment of the rubella vaccine responses. These&#xD;
      modifications to the standard Malian EPI schedule provide a level-of-care that is higher than&#xD;
      the current standard-of-care for the general population. Within the context of this study,&#xD;
      the researchers will refer to this as an &quot;enhanced&quot; EPI schedule.&#xD;
