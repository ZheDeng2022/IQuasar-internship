  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although advances in knowledge of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of atherothrombosis&#xD;
      are encouraging, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), with acute and chronic ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      in particular, remain a major cause of disability and premature death throughout the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and secondary prevention are coordinated multidimensional&#xD;
      evidence-based strategies that aim to assist patients with acute and chronic ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease return to an active and satisfying life and to prevent the recurrence of further&#xD;
      cardiac events. Since CR is time limited after an acute event, secondary prevention proposes&#xD;
      a continuum where care is provided for the rest of a person's life according to the existence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular risk factors. Secondary prophylaxis is fundamental for the recovery of the&#xD;
      patient, but in most cases, it is only insufficiently implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure adequate resources for the delivery of health care and to further improve the level&#xD;
      of care, care-delivery models need to be changed in a way that patients themselves become&#xD;
      more involved in their own care. Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing health delivery&#xD;
      methodology with the potential to impact on health care research, health care delivery and&#xD;
      health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the study is to determine the impact of plaque visualization using a&#xD;
      digital intervention on treatment adherence to improve the cardiovascular risk profile.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups: intervention group and control group.&#xD;
      Participants of the control group receive the best medical care according to current&#xD;
      guideline recommendations without access to the app. Participants of the intervention group&#xD;
      receive the best medical care according to current guideline recommendations with full access&#xD;
      to the Smartphone application at time of study begin until the completion of the follow-up&#xD;
      period of 12 months. The access to the app includes access to relevant findings including&#xD;
      ultrasound images of the carotid artery, lipid profile, blood pressure values, and weight.&#xD;
