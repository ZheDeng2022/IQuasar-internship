  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intro: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 6th leading cause of cancer worldwide. In&#xD;
      France, more than 10,000 new cases are identified each year. The latter occur in 85% of cases&#xD;
      in cirrhosis, the most frequent causes of which are excessive alcohol consumption, metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome or HBV/HCV infection. Patients with cirrhosis justify being included in monitoring&#xD;
      programs involving the performance of a semi-annual liver ultrasound (US) in order to detect&#xD;
      HCC eligible for curative treatment (liver resection or percutaneous ablation). This practice&#xD;
      is considered to be cost-effective in the event of an annual incidence of HCC&gt; 1.5%. US in&#xD;
      this context has a low sensitivity for the detection of HCC at the very early stage and the&#xD;
      following observations have been made in the last 20 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of patients detected at early stage BCLC 0 is around 30% by ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The rate of patients included in surveillance programs detected with advanced HCC&#xD;
           eligible for palliative treatment is around 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reducing the periodicity of liver ultrasounds from 6 to 3 months does not improve these&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, liver MRI has been evaluated as a tool for the early detection of HCC. Its&#xD;
      performance for the detection of HCC at the very early stage exceeds 80%. However, due to the&#xD;
      higher cost compared to US, it was estimated that its use in screening context would only be&#xD;
      cost effective in the event of an annual incidence&gt; 3%. In addition, the practice of these&#xD;
      expensive and long-lasting MRIs (30 to 45 minutes) can be optimized by carrying out&#xD;
      abbreviated MRI protocols&quot; or Fast-MRI: short protocols (&lt;10 minutes), based on the sequences&#xD;
      with the better detection sensitivities (Se&gt; 83%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that Fast-MRI used as a screening examination in patients at high risk of&#xD;
      HCC (&gt; 3% per year) could increase the rates of patients detected at an early stage&#xD;
      accessible to curative treatment and demonstrate its cost-effectiveness in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/Objective: The main objective is to assess the cost / QALY and / patient detected&#xD;
      with an early HCC BCLC 0 (single tumor &lt;2cm) by semi-annual monitoring by liver US and&#xD;
      Fast-MRI, compared to conventional semi-annual monitoring by liver US alone in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis and an anticipated HCC incidence&gt;3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: If positive, this trial could modify international practice guidelines and set&#xD;
      MRI as the optimal tool for early HCC detection in high-risk patients.&#xD;

      Method: This is a randomized controlled, multicenter, 2 parallel arm, superiority trial&#xD;
      carried out in patients at high risk of HCC&gt;3%. Patients with cirrhosis of non-viral cause or&#xD;
      controlled/eradicated for HBV/HCV infection will be included if their estimated yearly HCC&#xD;
      incidence is above 3% according to clinical risk stratification scoring systems previously&#xD;
      developed (and published) in French population. Randomization will be individual according to&#xD;
      a 1: 1 allocation ratio, centralized and stratified on the center. After inclusion in the&#xD;
      trial, each patient will be randomized to be assigned to the experimental group (six-month&#xD;
      liver US and fast-MRI) or control (six-month liver US only). At each semi-annual visit, a&#xD;
      patient will be considered free from nodules if neither ultrasound nor Fast-MRI detects a&#xD;
      nodule. If a nodule is detected by either of the two exams, the patient will undergo a&#xD;
      characterization process according to international recommendations, using a combination of&#xD;
      injected sectional imaging and/or liver biopsy. The diagnosis of HCC will be definitively&#xD;
      assessed in each center during a multidisciplinary consultation meeting. The primary analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out by intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rates of BCLC 0 stage HCC will be compared between the two arms. Medico-economic&#xD;
      efficiency criterion will be based on an analysis of the different costs from the point of&#xD;
      view of the healthcare system and on an analysis of clinical effectiveness in real life and&#xD;
      will be supplemented by a budget impact analysis from the point of view of Health Insurance.&#xD;
      The time horizon extends from inclusion up to 3 years with an annual update of costs and&#xD;
      benefits at 2.5%.Quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D5L scale, their variations&#xD;
      to the total costs evaluated for each arm will be compared. QALYs will be calculated in each&#xD;
      group. The costs and QALYs will be compared for the 2 strategies.&#xD;
