  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical thrombectomy recently has revolutionized the treatment of stroke. Trials have&#xD;
      demonstrated the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusions, such as&#xD;
      in the intracranialinternal carotid artery and proximal, middle cerebral artery (M1), middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery trunk (M1), have relatively high rates of revascularization and favorable&#xD;
      clinical outcomes after MT. , However second-order branches of the middle cerebral artery&#xD;
      (M2) occlusions (postbifurcation in the Sylvian fissure) were underrepresented or not&#xD;
      represented in the trials. Posing a more significant technical challenge to the available&#xD;
      endovascular devices because of the smaller size and tortuosity of these arteries and the&#xD;
      greater likelihood of recanalization with intravenous thrombolysis, the overall risk-benefit&#xD;
      remains uncertain.&#xD;

      this study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compare efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy over medical treatment in occlusion of M2&#xD;
           division of MCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improve outcome of acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include all patients with AIS attending to emergency deparment with proven&#xD;
      occlusion of M2 division of MCA, and deviding then into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive medical treatment (rTPA if presented in the first 4 hours, and&#xD;
      antiplatelet if passed time window for IVT) Group 2 will underwent mechanical thrombectomy&#xD;
      (if accessible), and even after receiving medical treatment and not improved and comparing&#xD;
      the outcomes of these 2 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Sample Size Calculation: Sample size was calculated using G*power, version 3.1.9.7.&#xD;
      Estimation based on results of previous study which reported that, median (IQR) discharge&#xD;
      NIHSS in mechanical thrombectomy group was 2 (0-4) compared to 1 (0-2) in medical management&#xD;
      group giving medium effect size . With a power of 80% (using one-sided t-test, effect size =&#xD;
      0.65 and Î± of 0.5) the sample needed for the study was estimated to be 60 patients (30 in&#xD;
      each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are subjected to the following: -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrolled patients were admitted to stroke units or intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous t-PA was allowed if begun within &lt; 4.5 hours after symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombectomy will be performed with any FDA approved thrombectomy device by the use of&#xD;
           local anesthesia (general anesthesia will be discouraged).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients presented with clinical picture and radiography suggestive of large vessel&#xD;
           occlusion and who meet the proposed clinical criteria for EVT will be subjected to a&#xD;
           comprehensive evaluation with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial imaging of the cerebral circulation with preferably with CTA or alternatively&#xD;
           with magnetic resonance angiography to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perfusion imaging with perfusion CT or with diffusion weighted imaging MRI can allow&#xD;
           identification and quantification of the ischemic penumbra and, therefore, is useful for&#xD;
           assessing patient eligibility for EVT in the extended time window.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical neurological outcome was evaluated at discharge (within one week from onset) and at 3 months by the neurologist in charge. by using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Good clinical outcome at discharge was defined as a NIHSS score less than or equal to 2 or a decrease in NIHSS score greater than or equal to 10 points.</description>

    <description>Functional outcome will be assessed using Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) which measures the degree of disability after stroke.&#xD;
Good functional outcome was defined as mRS less than 2 that will be assessed at one and three moth at discharge.</description>
