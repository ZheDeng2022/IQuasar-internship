      To clinically assess the effectiveness of diode laser versus sclerotherapy in the treatment&#xD;
      of oral pyogenic granuloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized-controlled clinical trial conducted on 20 patients with oral pyogenic granuloma.&#xD;
      Patients were assigned into two groups. Group I treated by diode laser1; group II treated by&#xD;
      injection of ethanolamine oleate2 as sclerosing agent. All patients were clinically assessed&#xD;
      for pain, bleeding during surgery and healing quality; 1st week, 2nd week and 4th week. The&#xD;
      patients were followed up after 3 months from the end of treatment.&#xD;

      Background: Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is one of the most common reactive hyperplasia that&#xD;
      causes soft tissue enlargement. It affects skin and oral mucosa. The traditional treatment&#xD;
      for oral PG is conservative surgical excision with cold blade together with the removal of&#xD;
      causative irritant or source of trauma. Bleeding susceptibility, healing quality and pain&#xD;
      represent common complications following surgical excision of pyogenic granuloma. Sclerosing&#xD;
      agents are widely used in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma as it is a conservative non&#xD;
      painful procedure. The use of lasers in dentistry have grown in the last 4 decades. It has&#xD;
      proved its efficacy in the treatment of pyogenic granuloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: Study will be conducted to evaluate healing quality of using diode laser&#xD;
      versus sclerotherapy (Ethanolamine oleate) in the treatment of oral pyogenic granuloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Method: This randomized controlled clinical trial will include 20 patients with&#xD;
      pyogenic granuloma, divided equally into two groups. Group-I (test group) will be managed by&#xD;
      application of diode laser. Group- II (control group) will be managed by injection of&#xD;
      ethanolamine oleate as sclerosing agent on weekly injection visits. Patients of both groups&#xD;
      will be evaluated intraoperatively for bleeding severity and postoperatively in terms of pain&#xD;
      at the 2nd and 7th day and healing quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Results will be tabulated and statistically analysed.&#xD;
