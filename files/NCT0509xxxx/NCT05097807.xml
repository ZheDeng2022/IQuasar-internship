  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social media is pervasively used in our life. There is a research hypothesis that the&#xD;
      information in social media is &quot;shallow&quot; and the long-term use of it will cause readers'&#xD;
      addiction, insomnia, and inability to pay attention, thus reducing the efficiency of learning&#xD;
      and working. However, there is no systematic study on the relationship between &quot;shallow&#xD;
      reading&quot; in social media and attention, addiction, sleep quality, and other mental health.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators intend to explore the effect of &quot;shallow reading&quot; in social&#xD;
      media on mental health based on about 300 healthy subjects by conducting questionnaire,&#xD;
      cognitive scale assessment, multi-mode MRI scanning and EEG monitoring. A cross-sectional&#xD;
      study will be combined with a longitudinal study to explore the clinical characteristics its&#xD;
      relationship to brain function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the development of social media such as &quot;twitter&quot;, &quot;Facebook&quot; and &quot;Microblog&quot;, &quot;shallow&#xD;
      reading&quot; has gradually become the main way for people to obtain external information and&#xD;
      relax. &quot;Shallow reading&quot; is characterized by incomplete and intermittent reading patterns,&#xD;
      and readers often &quot;dip into it&quot; without thinking. There is a research hypothesis that the&#xD;
      information in social media is &quot;shallow&quot; and the long-term use of it will cause readers'&#xD;
      addiction, insomnia, and inability to pay attention, thus reducing the efficiency of learning&#xD;
      and working. Some researchers even concern that &quot;shallow reading&quot; is destroying human beings'&#xD;
      suspicion spirit, thinking ability and rational thinking which are based on writing and print&#xD;
      culture. However, there is no systematic study on the relationship between &quot;shallow reading&quot;&#xD;
      and attention or other mental health, not to mention its fMRI and EEG characteristics.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators intend to explore the effect of &quot;shallow reading&quot; in social&#xD;
      media on mental health based on about 300 healthy subjects by conducting questionnaire,&#xD;
      cognitive scale assessment, multi-mode MRI scanning and EEG monitoring. A cross-sectional&#xD;
      study will be combined with a longitudinal study to better understand both the short-term and&#xD;
      long-term effect of &quot;shallow reading&quot; habit to the mental health and imaging characteristics.&#xD;
      The collected indexes will be analyzed to explore the clinical characteristics of people with&#xD;
      the habit of &quot;shallow reading&quot;, and its relationship to mental health, brain imaging&#xD;
      characteristics will finally be clarified.&#xD;
