                  ALK(+) DLBCL, high grade lymphoma). The primary site is limited to the&#xD;
                  gastrointestinal tract, nasal cavity and breast, and central nervous system( CNS)&#xD;
                  involvement must be excluded. Gastrointestinal tract involvement of DLBCL can be&#xD;
                  included in the group after evaluation without bleeding or perforation risk.&#xD;

                  Lugano 2014 criteria, the evaluable lesion was: 18F fluorodeoxyglucose / positron&#xD;
                  emission tomography (18FDG-PET) examination showed that the uptake of extranodal&#xD;
                  areas was increased (higher than that of liver) and pet and / or computed. The&#xD;
