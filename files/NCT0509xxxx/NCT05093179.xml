  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep tissue massage (DTM), based on deep palpation and elimination of fascia restrictions,&#xD;
      can reduce symptoms resulting from fascial disorders. The goal of this study was the analysis&#xD;
      of the DTM effect on respiratory parameters in healthy people. People of both sexes living in&#xD;
      the city of Cracow were recruited to the study by the authors personally and through social&#xD;
      media. An original questionnaire was completed in the presence of the examiner in order to&#xD;
      collect the participants characteristics data. Questions about past diseases, previous&#xD;
      surgical procedures or injuries, currently taken medications or the level of physical&#xD;
      activity were asked to check the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study involved a group of&#xD;
      40 people divided into two subgroups. The experimental group underwent a single DTM session.&#xD;
      Classic massage was performed in the control group. Before and after treatment the lung vital&#xD;
      capacity, chest circumference and oxygen saturation were measured and a spirometry test was&#xD;
      performed. The main hypothesis assumed that static respiratory parameters should increase&#xD;
      after the treatment session more in the experimental than in control group while the dynamic&#xD;
      respiratory parameters would not differ significantly in both groups before and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of change of lung vital capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>twice: before and immediately after procedure administration in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The vital capacity of the lungs was assessed with spirotest (Riester, mod. 5260). The subject stood with legs hip-width apart. For each measurement, disposable cardboard mouthpieces were used. The examined person held the device vertically with both hands. At the examiner's command, subject took in as much air as possible, then tightly bit the mouthpiece with his mouth, and with all of their strength, exhaled air into the device for as long as possible. The subject had only 1 attempt-measured values were recorded with an accuracy of 50 mL.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change of blood oxygen saturation</measure>
    <time_frame>twice: before and immediately after procedure administration in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>Testing blood oxygen saturation was performed in a sitting position with digital pulseoximeter CMS50D. The device was put on the second finger of the left hand each time. The highest value displayed by the pulseoximeter within 30 s was recorded with an accuracy of 1%.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of change of chest circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>twice: before and immediately after procedure administration in both groups</time_frame>
    <description>The chest circumference was measured with a measuring tape, wrapped horizontally around the chest at the level of the xiphoid process. The subject was standing with feet hip-width apart, arms hanging along the body. At the command, the subject would take a maximum breathe in (first measurement) and exhale to the maximum for the next (second measurement). Obtained values were recorded with an accuracy of 0.5 cm.</description>
