    <textblock>
      To investigate the health effects of a new mobile application (app) for prevention and&#xD;
      personalized treatment in people with chronic cardiovascular pathologies associated with body&#xD;
      composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scientific evidence has shown that the adoption of the Mediterranean diet is a protective&#xD;
      factor against the appearance of several types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, aging and&#xD;
      obesity due to the amount of nutrients with anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity&#xD;
      properties that jointly contribute to the maintenance of health status. The antitumor effects&#xD;
      of the Mediterranean diet are mainly due to the combination of antioxidant elements, fiber&#xD;
      and polyunsaturated fats. Therefore, this dietary pattern is essential as a preventive&#xD;
      measure against the onset of cancer and other chronic diseases, but also to reduce health&#xD;
      care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring physical activity should be considered as a central factor when addressing&#xD;
      precision nutrition. Perform physical activity and exercise, as they are key components of&#xD;
      energy expenditure and balance, in addition, structural changes occur in muscles, increase in&#xD;
      the number of mitochondria in fiber, secretion of metabolically beneficial hormones with&#xD;
      reversal of muscle insulin resistance and reduction of hepatic lipogenesis. Regardless of&#xD;
      intensity, short-term exercise has been shown to improve adiposity and insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      which may help reduce metabolic risk. Boutcher et al. also demonstrated that intermittent&#xD;
      aerobic and anaerobic exercise performed at an intensity &gt;70% of maximal oxygen uptake&#xD;
      significantly reduces ambulatory and office blood pressure in hypertensive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of this app aims, through self-management and visualizing the altered&#xD;
      parameters and how they will evolve in your body in the short, medium and long term, to&#xD;
      increase the population's commitment to these pathologies, in order to improve their health.&#xD;
