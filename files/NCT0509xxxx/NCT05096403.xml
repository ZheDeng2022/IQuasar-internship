    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia/Fatigue (FACT-An) Scale Score (Quality of Life)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-An consists consists of 33 questions related to general quality of life and to the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms assessed using a 5 point scale (0=not at all; 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much). Responses to each question are added to obtain a total score.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has a 5-level response: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. A scale with score 0-100 is used to collect response on current health status.</description>
