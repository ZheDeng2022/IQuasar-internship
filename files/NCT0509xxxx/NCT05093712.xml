      This study investigates the health literacy, cervical cancer knowledge, and radiation&#xD;
      knowledge of patients with cervical cancer. The goal of this study is to develop a video that&#xD;
      can improve patients 'understanding of cervical cancer and its treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the baseline health literacy, cervical cancer knowledge and radiation knowledge&#xD;
      in a diverse sample of patients from two hospitals in Houston, Texas. (Phase 1) II. To test&#xD;
      improvement in comprehension of cervical cancer and radiation terminology in a diverse sample&#xD;
      of cervical cancer patients after viewing the video-based educational tool developed in this&#xD;
      study. (Phase 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess barriers to care and assess baseline radiation adherence, defined as missing no&#xD;
      treatments and time to radiation completion, in a diverse sample of patients from two&#xD;
      hospitals in Houston, Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the impact of the video on radiation treatment adherence in terms of&#xD;
      radiation completion, defined as missing no treatments) and time to radiation completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the relationships between time to radiation completion, health literacy,&#xD;
      sociodemographics, reported barriers to care, and baseline cervical cancer knowledge and&#xD;
      misconceptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients complete surveys over 10 minutes on their background, health literacy&#xD;
      level, barriers to cancer care, and knowledge of cervical cancer and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients watch educational video on cervical cancer. Patients also complete surveys&#xD;
      over 5-10 minutes at baseline and after watching educational video.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of patients answering a particular knowledge item correctly will be calculated along with 95% score confidence intervals. As part of a secondary set of analyses, the percent of knowledge items answered correctly will be tabulated for each participant. Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for percent of items answered correctly, both by site and combining data from both sites.</description>
