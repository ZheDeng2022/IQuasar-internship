  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effect of hydrotherapy (halliwick&#xD;
      concept) on motor functions in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Minimum of 30&#xD;
      Spastic CP children will be recruited for this study. Children will be randomly assigned into&#xD;
      control group who will receive conventional selected exercise treatment or study group who&#xD;
      will receive the same conventional program in addition to underwater exercise program. Motor&#xD;
      function will be evaluated at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. No potential harms&#xD;
      are expected during this study.&#xD;

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is an observational clinical tool designed to evaluate change in gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy. There are two versions of the GMFM - the original 88-item measure (GMFM-88) and the more recent 66-item GMFM (GMFM-66) The scoring system of the GMFM is a four-point scale divided into five categories (lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running).</description>

    <description>Under water exercise program according to halliwick concept which will be applied as three sessions per week for three successive months. Underwater exercises will be performed under the supervision of a certified aquatic therapist. This practitioner will instruct the child in proper techniques for performing exercises while ensuring child's safety by using flotation devices, body boards or float belts when necessary. Also the pool where the children will perform underwater exercises will be equipped with ramps, chair lifts, stairs, and handrails to facilitate a child's ability to access the pool.</description>

    <description>The Halliwick Concept is a detailed swimming programme based on the scientific principles of body mechanics and the properties of water intended to educate individuals with special needs to be water safe and to move independently in the water as much as possible (Lambeck &amp; Stanat 2001a).The programme consists of 10 specific progressive stages that are achieved without the use of floatation devices (Lambeck &amp; Stanat 2001b).</description>
