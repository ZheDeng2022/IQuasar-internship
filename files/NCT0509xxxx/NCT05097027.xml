  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the effects of blood flow restriction training on the&#xD;
      post-competition recovery of professional and semi-professional soccer players. Randomized&#xD;
      crossover clinical trial, with two intervention groups: Experimental group I will carry out a&#xD;
      recovery training based on the use of the blood flow restriction (BFR) on day 1&#xD;
      post-competition. On the other hand, the Experimental II group will perform the same recovery&#xD;
      training without the use of BFR. After 1 month the groups will cross their intervention and&#xD;
      make the recovery with the opposite method to the initial one. The study will be carried out&#xD;
      during the 2021-2022 season, from first regional to third division of Spanish soccer, with&#xD;
      soccer teams from the Mallorca Island. Before the competition, the countermovement jump (CMJ)&#xD;
      will be evaluated and repeated at 0, 24, and 72 h after the competition. The levels of muscle&#xD;
      soreness (DOMS) will be evaluated pre-post-competition 0, 24, 48 and 72h later. The same&#xD;
      procedure will be carried out to evaluate muscle fatigue, sleep quality, and stress through a&#xD;
      questionnaire that athletes will fill out pre, 0, 24, 48 and 72h after the game.&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and anthropometric data will be collected before starting the study.&#xD;

      W-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The warm-up will consist of 5 minutes running slow, 5 minutes mobility, and 5 minutes of&#xD;
      running exercises. In addition, the warm-up will contain a familiarization with the jump&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

    <description>Soccer players included in experimental group I will carry out this program for 1 week using 160mmHg blood pressure. After a month they will carry out the program without restriction of blood flow. Which will consist of a warm-up part with continuous running (5 min), 6 sprints from box to box of the field at 60-70% of a maximum repetition, and an activation part in the form of rounds with the ball.</description>
