  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By longitudinal, prospective research in children with neurodisabilities including severe&#xD;
      motor impairments and their parents to explore the beneficial effects of participating in an&#xD;
      intensive habilitation program on the child's adaptive functioning and parental empowerment&#xD;
      in order to treat and reduce the consequences of early brain damage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based knowledge about the effects of intensive training programs for children with&#xD;
      severe early brain damage is limited since research on this topic has methodological&#xD;
      weaknesses and shows conflicting results. As intensive training programs require extensive&#xD;
      efforts from the child, parents and professionals and represent major costs, the importance&#xD;
      of scientifically proven effects is considerable. This research project aims to measure the&#xD;
      effects of an intensive habilitation program for young children with severe early brain&#xD;
      damage on the child's adaptive, motor, language and social functioning and on parental&#xD;
      empowerment, family functioning and stress. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT) 90&#xD;
      children will be divided into an intervention group participating in a Norwegian developed&#xD;
      program of intensified habilitation of 12 months duration and a control group, who will&#xD;
      receive &quot;services as usual&quot; during the same time period. Between-group analyses will then be&#xD;
      performed. Due to a stepped wedge design, the control participants will then be offered&#xD;
      training in year two of participation. Within-group analysis of results before and after&#xD;
      training will then be performed for all participants. Standardized measures with high&#xD;
      responsiveness in documenting intervention effectiveness will be used as primary outcome&#xD;
      measures. Intensive training groups will be offered in all Health Regions in Norway and if&#xD;
      successful be implemented as standard clinical practice.&#xD;

    <description>The program is based on a holistic and family-centered concept, which acknowledges parents as experts on their child's abilities and needs. The program involves both parents and local professionals, and includes goal setting and goal-directed treatment targeted to the needs of the individual child. The program lasts for about one year and contains three in-patient group sessions over 2 weeks. In between the children are receiving individualized home training programs at home and in pre-school/kindergarten. The children train on a daily basis, both during the inpatient sessions and in the home setting.</description>
