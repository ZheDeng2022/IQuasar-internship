  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will address the question of whether targeting CMV antigens with PEP-CMV can serve&#xD;
      as a novel immunotherapeutic approach in pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade&#xD;
      glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) as well as recurrent medulloblastoma&#xD;
      (MB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEP-CMV is a vaccine mixture of a peptide referred to as Component A. Component A is a&#xD;
      synthetic long peptide (SLP) of 26 amino acid residues from human pp65. The SLPs encode&#xD;
      multiple potential class I, class II, and antibody epitopes across several haplotypes.&#xD;
      Component A will be administered as a stable water:oil emulsion in Montanide ISA 51.&#xD;

      This phase II clinical trial will have 3 strata in order to assess the efficacy of a highly&#xD;
      immunogenic CMV-directed peptide vaccines in children with (1) recurrent medulloblastoma&#xD;
      (rMB), (2) newly-diagnosed high-grade gliomas (HGG) and (3) newly-diagnosed diffuse intrinsic&#xD;
      pontine glioma (DIPG). Each stratum will run independently with a different endpoint and&#xD;
      statistical design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each stratum, the populations that may be used for analysis are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Analysis: Patients who receive at least 1 dose of the treatment will be used for&#xD;
           safety analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy Analysis: Patients who receive at least 1 dose of the treatment will be used&#xD;
           for efficacy analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum I: Patients with recurrent medulloblastoma with measurable disease (see eligibility)&#xD;
      can be enrolled at any point following recurrence regardless of any prior therapy. For the&#xD;
      purpose of this study, recurrence will be defined as a new lesion confirmed by biopsy or&#xD;
      resection, positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, or recurrent/progressive tumor on&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strata II and III: Patients with newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma or DIPG may be enrolled&#xD;
      any time within 42 days after completing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1 (Induction cycle) is 77±2 days. Patients will receive one course of temozolomide 200&#xD;
      mg/m2/day x 5 days on Days 1-5 of cycle 1 and receive PEP-CMV vaccine intradermally at dose&#xD;
      level 1 (250 μg/m2 ) on Days 21, 35 ±2 days, and 49 ±2 days. After the induction cycle which&#xD;
      is 77 ± 2 days, each subsequent cycle is 28 days. Starting in cycle 2, PEP-CMV vaccine is&#xD;
      administered intradermally every 28 days on day 1 of each course. Patient can continue to&#xD;
      receive PEP-CMV every 28 days for a total of 24 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a tetanus (Td) booster (Td 5 flocculation units, Lf) at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. Immunotherapy begins with a Td pre-conditioning vaccine (Td 1 Lf, in 0.4 mL of&#xD;
      saline) delivered i.d. at the RIGHT groin site of the vaccine injection 6-24 hours prior to&#xD;
      the first vaccine on day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEP-CMV vaccine will be administered as follows: 250 µg/m2 (up to a maximum of 500 µg) of&#xD;
      Component A mixed with Montanide ISA-51 (1:1 volume ratio) intradermally administered half in&#xD;
      the RIGHT groin and half in the LEFT groin.&#xD;
