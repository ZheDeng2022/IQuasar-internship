  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The aim of this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial is to compare&#xD;
      the effect of oral premedication of dexamethasone, ketorolac, meloxicam, ibuprofen or placebo&#xD;
      on the success of inferior alveolar nerve blocks (IANB) of mandibular posterior teeth in&#xD;
      patients experiencing symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Methods: The trial will include five&#xD;
      study groups, each consists of 50 patients who exhibits symptomatic irreversible pulpitis of&#xD;
      a mandibular first or second molar. The patients will receive identically appearing capsules&#xD;
      containing either dexamethasone 0.5 mg, ketorolac 10 mg, meloxicam 7.5 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg,&#xD;
      or placebo by mouth 60 minutes before the administration of an IANB. Endodontic access will&#xD;
      begin 15 minutes after completion of the IANB. The IANB success is defined as no or mild pain&#xD;
      (Heft Parker visual analog scale recordings) on pulpal access or instrumentation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. This trial&#xD;
      follows the most recent update of the Declaration of Helsinki criteria (October 2013). The&#xD;
      Vision Colleges Research Ethics Committee approved the clinical trial protocol and informed&#xD;
      consent. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines will be used to report the&#xD;
      present superiority study. Participants under the age of 18, those with a history of major&#xD;
      medical issues, those who had used central nervous system depressants or any analgesic drug&#xD;
      in the preceding 6 h, those who were pregnant, and those who were unable to give informed&#xD;
      consent will be excluded from the study. All the patients will sign a consent form that had&#xD;
      been approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be active pain in the first or second mandibular molar, a&#xD;
      prolonged response to cold testing, no periapical radiolucency on periapical radiographs, and&#xD;
      a vital coronal pulp on access opening. The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale will be used to&#xD;
      assess the patients' anxiety levels. The pain of the patients will be categorized into four&#xD;
      categories using the Heft-Parker visual analogue scale (HP VAS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 mm: no pain 0-54 mm: faint, weak, or mild 55-114 mm: moderate pain &gt;114 mm: strong,&#xD;
      intense, and maximum possible Permuted block randomization will be used to ensure the&#xD;
      homogeneity of the five groups. The patients will be randomly given dexamethasone 0.5 mg,&#xD;
      ketorolac 10 mg, meloxicam 7.5 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg, or placebo by mouth 60 mins before&#xD;
      administering IANB. To blind the experiment, each of the 50 patients in each group will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated a code consists of 2 letters and one number. Only the random codes will&#xD;
      identify the medications; thus, the patient and clinicians are uninformed of which medication&#xD;
      will be given to them. At 60 mins after taking the medication or placebo, the operator will&#xD;
      use a cotton tip applicator to put anaesthetic gel at the IANB injection site for 60 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will then give regular IANB injections and 0.9 mL long buccal injections&#xD;
      containing 2% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine. Each patient will be asked for lip&#xD;
      numbness every 5 mins for 15 mins after the IANB. The block will be considered missed if&#xD;
      substantial lip numbness was not reported by 15 mins, and the participant will be excluded&#xD;
      from the trial. After the lip numbness is determined, the tooth will be isolated and a second&#xD;
      cold test will be performed to verify the presence or absence of any painful reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, the endodontic access will be conducted. During the endodontic process, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to rate any pain they experienced. If the patient is in pain, the treatment&#xD;
      will be stopped, and the patient will use the HP VAS to rate his/her discomfort. The success&#xD;
      of the IANB is identified by the capability to access and clean and shape the root canal&#xD;
      space without pain (VAS score of 0) or mild pain (VAS rating ≤54 mm). The rubber dam will be&#xD;
      removed if the patient had moderate or severe pain (VAS rating ≥ 55 mm). Then, a buccal&#xD;
      infiltration of a cartridge containing 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine will be given&#xD;
      buccally to the tooth that required emergency treatment. After 5 mins, the rubber dam will be&#xD;
      replaced, and endodontic access will be resumed. The capability to access and instrument the&#xD;
      tooth without pain (VAS score of 0) or with mild pain (VAS rating ≤54 mm) is considered a&#xD;
      success of the buccal infiltration. Intraosseous anesthesia will be given to the patients who&#xD;
      still had moderate to severe pain. The intraosseous injection will be given. If that didn't&#xD;
      work, an intrapulpal injection will be given, followed by endodontic debridement. The extent&#xD;
      of access preparation and/or instrumentation will be recorded as within dentine, within pulp&#xD;
      space, and instrumentation of canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS satisfaction form will be used to record the post-treatment satisfaction of the&#xD;
      patient. On the VAS (0-100 mm), the patient will be asked to draw a vertical line to&#xD;
      represent their experience with the entire treatment. The VAS is classified into four&#xD;
      categories; 0: not satisfied, &gt;0 mm and ≤33 mm: somewhat satisfied, &gt;33 mm but &lt;66 mm:&#xD;
      moderately satisfied and ≥66 mm: completely satisfied.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Measurement as it will be assessed on a Heft-Parker 170 mm Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes after the inferior alveolar nerve block</time_frame>
    <description>At 60 minutes after receiving the medication or placebo, the participants will be given inferior alveolar nerve block injection. Each patient will be asked for lip numbness every 5 minutes for 15 minutes after inferior alveolar nerve block injection. During the endodontic process, patients will be asked to rate any pain they experienced on a Heft-Parker visual analog scale. The number of millimeters along the scale will be reported. No pain corresponded to 0 mm. Mild pain is defined as greater than 0 mm and less than or equal to 54 mm. Mild pain is the descriptors of &quot;faint&quot;, &quot;weak&quot;, and &quot;mild pain&quot;. Moderate pain is defined as greater than 54 mm and less than 114 mm and includes the descriptor &quot;moderate&quot;. Severe pain is defined as equal to or greater than 114 mm up to and including 170 mm. Severe pain includes the descriptors of &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;intense&quot;, and &quot;maximum possible.&quot;</description>
