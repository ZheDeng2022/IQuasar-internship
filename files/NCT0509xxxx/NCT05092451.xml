  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving immune cells&#xD;
      called natural killer (NK) cells with chemotherapy to patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune system cells (such as NK cells) are made by the body to attack foreign or cancerous&#xD;
      cells. Researchers think that NK cells you receive from a donor may react against cancer&#xD;
      cells in your body, which may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety, efficacy and optimal cell dose of CAR.70/IL15-transduced CB-NK cells&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory hematological malignances. The efficacy and optimal dose&#xD;
      will be identified for individual diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify persistence of infused allogeneic donor CAR-transduced CB-derived NK cells&#xD;
           in the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.&#xD;
