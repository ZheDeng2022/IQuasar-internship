    <textblock>
      62 patients with postlumbar surgery syndrome were randomized and divided into two groups.&#xD;
      Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) was applied to the TFESI group (n=31), and&#xD;
      caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI) was applied to the CESI group (n=31). The age of the&#xD;
      patients involved in this study ranged from 18 years old to 65 years old&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with low back and radicular pain related to epidural fibrosis following single-level&#xD;
      lumbar discectomy were included. The patients were randomly divided into two groups as the&#xD;
      CESI group and TFESI group. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection was applied to the&#xD;
      TFESI group (n=31), and caudal epidural steroid injection was applied to the CESI group&#xD;
      (n=31). All patients were assessed before the procedure (baseline) and at 1 hour, three&#xD;
      weeks, and three months after the procedure using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and at&#xD;
      baseline and three weeks and three months using the modified Oswestry Disability Index&#xD;
      (mODI). Treatment success was defined as ≥50% decrease in the NRS scores compared to baseline&#xD;

    <description>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is a scale for assessing the severity of pain. The numerical rating scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. The patient chooses the most appropriate number describing the severity of pain (oral version).</description>

    <description>Modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI) is a 10-question questionnaire assessing disability in low back pain. Each question has 6 options. The lowest score for each question is zero and the highest score is 5. High score is associated with increased disability.</description>

    <description>This procedure was applied only once.&#xD;
1 to 2 cc of the contrast agent (300 mg/50 mL iohexol) was given and the distribution pattern was visualized. Once the epidural distribution of the contrast agent was confirmed without vascular flow, a mixture of 40 mg (1mL) of triamcinolone acetonide, 2 cc of physiological saline, and 2 cc (0.5%) of bupivacaine was injected.</description>

    <description>This procedure was applied only once&#xD;
1 to 2 cc of the contrast agent (300 mg/50 mL iohexol) was given and the distribution pattern was visualized which showed bilateral L5-S3 distribution without vascular flow. A mixture of 40 mg (1mL) of triamcinolone acetonide, 7 cc of physiological saline, and 2 cc (0.5%) of bupivacaine was injected. A total of 10 cc mixture was used for CESI.</description>
