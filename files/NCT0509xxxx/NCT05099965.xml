      A5355 is a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two injections of MVA Vaccine Encoding CMV antigens&#xD;
      (Triplex®) in adults with both HIV and CMV. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either two injections of CMV-MVA Triplex® or placebo administered at study Entry/Day&#xD;
      0 and week 4. Participants will have follow-up visits in person or by phone for 92 weeks&#xD;
      after the second injection, for a total of 96 weeks of follow-up. During the study,&#xD;
      participants will have blood, urine, genital secretions, and oral secretions collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be stratified based on sex and use of gender-affirming hormones with at least&#xD;
      25% of participants being individuals assigned female sex at birth not on testosterone or&#xD;
      individuals assigned male sex at birth on feminizing hormones. Special outreach to&#xD;
      transgender and gender non-binary persons will be encouraged with exploratory stratified&#xD;
      analysis conducted based on both gender and sex assigned at birth.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test, or HIV enzyme or&#xD;
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit, at any time prior to study entry, and&#xD;
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot, or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND&#xD;
        studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&#xD;
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is&#xD;
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test&#xD;
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a&#xD;
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus&#xD;
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently on continuous ART for ≥48 weeks prior to study entry. This is defined as&#xD;
             continuous ART consisting of at least 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
             (NRTIs) and either a protease inhibitor boosted with low dose ritonavir or with&#xD;
             cobicistat, an integrase inhibitor, or an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase&#xD;
             inhibitor (NNRTI) for the 48-week period prior to study entry with no ART interruption&#xD;
             longer than 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE 1: Other ART regimens may be acceptable. For a list of acceptable ART regimens, please&#xD;
        see the A5355 PSWP. For any regimens not listed, sites must consult the protocol team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE 2: Modifications to ART regimens prior to study entry are allowable except for the&#xD;
        time period noted in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 RNA level &lt;75 copies/mL (or below the limit of detection of clinically certified&#xD;
             assays) for at least 48 weeks prior to study entry, using an FDA-approved assay&#xD;
             performed by any US laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments&#xD;
             (CLIA) certification or its equivalent. The participant must have a minimum of two&#xD;
             values in the last 48 weeks obtained &gt;30 days apart, with the most recent value&#xD;
             obtained within 45 days prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 500&#xD;
        copies/mL (i.e., &quot;blips&quot;) are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent&#xD;
        determinations are both below the level of quantification. The screening value may serve as&#xD;
        the subsequent undetectable value following a blip.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ cell count &gt;250 cells/μL, obtained within 45 days prior to study entry at any US&#xD;
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.&#xD;

             care (POC)/CLIA-waived test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Individuals of reproductive potential who are able to become pregnant are defined as&#xD;
        individuals who have reached menarche and who have not been post-menopausal for at least 12&#xD;
        consecutive months with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥40 IU/mL or 24 consecutive&#xD;
        months if an FSH is not available, i.e., who have had menses within the preceding 24&#xD;
        months, and have not undergone a sterilization procedure (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy, or salpingectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are able to impregnate or become pregnant (i.e., of reproductive&#xD;
             potential) and are participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must&#xD;
             agree to practice contraception/birth control as indicated below or agree to not&#xD;
             participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to&#xD;
             impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) for at least 14 days prior to the&#xD;
             start of the 2-dose vaccine regimen at Entry/Day 0 through at least 60 days after the&#xD;
             final vaccination at week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals of reproductive potential who are able to become pregnant are defined&#xD;
             above. Individuals of reproductive potential who are able to impregnate are defined as&#xD;
             individuals who do not have documented azoospermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acceptable contraception/birth control for this study includes the use of one or more of&#xD;
        the following methods:&#xD;

&#xD;
        NOTE: The participant may not be able to provide written proof of a partner's vasectomy,&#xD;
        sterilization, or menopausal status, since the participant's partner is not usually&#xD;
        enrolled in the same study to provide consent for release of this information. The verbal&#xD;
        report from the participant of their partner's status should be written into the source&#xD;
        documents.&#xD;

          -  Active hepatitis C (defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody (Ab) positive and HCV&#xD;
             RNA detectable within 24 weeks prior to study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) negative,&#xD;
             hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg), and/or HBV DNA detectable within 24&#xD;
             weeks prior to study entry).&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE 1: Participants with HBV DNA suppressed on an antiviral regimen containing anti-HBV&#xD;
        agents are eligible if they have HBV DNA BLQ within the past 24 weeks or at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE 2: Prior documentation of positive HBsAb is acceptable evidence that hepatitis B is&#xD;
        not present. If HBsAb is BLQ or documentation is not available, HBsAg and HBcAb should be&#xD;
        documented prior to study entry. Participants who have positive HBcAb but BLQ HBsAg and&#xD;
        HBsAb (isolated HBcAb positive status) must have HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
        performed and confirmed as BLQ for participant to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected active rectal, genital, or pharyngeal chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis&#xD;
             (based on screening test results and other clinical information). These participants&#xD;
             need to be treated and can be rescreened 30 days or more after treatment. Treatment&#xD;
             must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) only.&#xD;
        In persons with positive syphilis enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or rapid plasma regain (RPR), a&#xD;
        treponema-based test must be performed for confirmation, however, only evidence of active&#xD;
        infection would exclude the subject from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or serious illness, in the opinion of the site investigator, requiring systemic&#xD;
             treatment and/or hospitalization within 14 days prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: See protocol for guidelines related to COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body temperature &gt;38°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of immunity to varicella.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Serology should only be utilized to verify a history of varicella if the participant&#xD;
        does not report a history of chickenpox or have documented completion of the varicella&#xD;
        vaccine series.&#xD;
