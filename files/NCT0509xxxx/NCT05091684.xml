  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet transfusions are widely employed to prevent or treat bleeding episodes in patients&#xD;
      with thrombocytopenia. Patients with bone marrow failure secondary to haematological&#xD;
      malignancy and chemotherapy frequently receive prophylactic platelet transfusion when&#xD;
      platelet level reaches 10x109.L-1, to avoid spontaneous major bleeding. Due to immune or&#xD;
      nonimmune factors, platelet refractoriness may be observed and is defined as a repeated&#xD;
      suboptimal response to platelet transfusions with lower-than-expected post-transfusion count&#xD;
      increments. The management of patients with alloimmunization is complex and prophylactic&#xD;
      platelet support is no longer indicated. Therefore, platelet refractoriness remains a&#xD;
      clinically challenging complication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no specific therapeutic strategy has been proposed for platelet refractoriness, in&#xD;
      cancer patients who are both at high risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Interestingly,&#xD;
      fibrinogen is a critical hemostatic protein required for both prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      bleeding as it provides a matrix and mesh network essential for clot formation, amplification&#xD;
      and strength. Fibrinogen repletion, primarily with the use of fibrinogen concentrates for&#xD;
      acquired bleeding, has been reported in clinical settings including surgery, trauma, and&#xD;
      obstetrics. However, its use as adjuvant therapy for patients requiring massive transfusion&#xD;
      is not yet a widely approved indication, especially in hematological patients. Therefore, the&#xD;
      evidence regarding timing, efficacy and safety of fibrinogen administration in massively&#xD;
      transfused hematological patients is scarce. This study aims at evaluating whether fibrinogen&#xD;
      administration to transfused and refractory patients with on-going bleeding could affect the&#xD;
      viscoelastic test of clotting function.&#xD;
