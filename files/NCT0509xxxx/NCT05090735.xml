  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether superficial parasternal intercostal plane&#xD;
      (SPIP) block alone or with transverses abdominis plane (TAP) block can improve post-operative&#xD;
      pain in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, specifically, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting (CABG).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management remains an important clinical challenge in cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgery. Inadequate postoperative pain control can have adverse pathophysiologic&#xD;
      consequences, including increased myocardial oxygen demand, hypoventilation, suboptimal&#xD;
      clearance of pulmonary secretions, acute respiratory failure, and decreased mobility, with&#xD;
      associated increased risks for formation of clots in a blood vessels (thromboembolism). These&#xD;
      adverse events may result in greater perioperative morbidity and mortality. Despite several&#xD;
      multimodal approaches to postoperative pain control, optimal pain management after&#xD;
      cardiothoracic procedures remains an issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia is used to block sensation in a specific part of body during and after&#xD;
      surgery. It offers numerous advantages over conventional general anesthesia, including faster&#xD;
      recovery time, fewer side effects, no need for an airway device during surgery, and a&#xD;
      dramatic reduction in post-surgical pain and reduction in opioid use following surgery. The&#xD;
      use of local anesthetic peripheral nerve blocks for surgical anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      pain management has increased significantly with the advent of ultrasound-guided techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound has revolutionized regional anesthesia by allowing real-time visualization of&#xD;
      anatomical structures, needle advancement and local anesthetic (LA) spread. This has led not&#xD;
      only to refinement of existing techniques, but also the introduction of new ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, ultrasound has been critical in the development of fascial plane blocks, in&#xD;
      which local anesthetic (LA) is injected into a tissue plane rather than directly around&#xD;
      nerves. These blocks are believed to work via passive spread of LA to nerves traveling within&#xD;
      that tissue plane, or to adjacent tissue compartments containing nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although research into these techniques is still at an early stage, the available evidence&#xD;
      indicates that they are effective in reducing opioid requirements and improving the pain&#xD;
      experience in a wide range of clinical settings. They are best employed as part of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia with other systemic analgesics, rather than as sole anesthetic techniques.&#xD;
      Catheters may be beneficial in situations where moderate-severe pain is expected for &gt;12&#xD;
      hours, although the optimal dosing regimen requires further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will focus on the superficial parasternal-intercostal plane&#xD;
      (SPIP) block and the transverses abdomens plane (TAP) block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the SPIP block administered alone and with a TAP block; the&#xD;
      investigators will measure the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery, total post-operative opioid consumption (oral morphine equivalents), total&#xD;
      acetaminophen and ketorolac consumption, post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), length of&#xD;
      the ICU stay, time to extubation, and length of hospital stay to determine if one technique&#xD;
      is superior to the other.&#xD;
