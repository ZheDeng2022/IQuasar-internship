  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the capacity of a reflex training system to change&#xD;
      the size of the targeted reflex. For this, the researchers are recruiting 25 individuals with&#xD;
      chronic incomplete SCI who have spasticity in the leg to participate in the reflex training&#xD;
      procedure. The study involves approximately 45 visits with a total study duration of about 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in reflex activity as measured by the H-reflex amplitude (mV) in response to nerve stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Decreased H-reflex amplitude indicates reduced reflex activity and a more normal reflex response to muscle activity</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in walking speed (m/s) as measured by the 10-meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Speed of the participant's fastest comfortable walking speed across 10 meters. Decreased time (sec) demonstrates increased walking speed (m/s)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in walking distance (meters) as measured by the 6-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The distance walked in 6 minutes in measured. The participant is asked to walk at his/her fastest comfortable speed on an indoor walkway.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the level of assistance required to walk 10 meters as measured by the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury (WI-SCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>WI-SCI classifies the level of assistance needed to perform the 10MWT; the scale is from 0-20 with 20 being no assistance required at all. An increase of score indicates increased level of independence while walking.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of spasticity in the more affected leg as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A decrease in the score on the MAS indicates a decrease in spasticity. To measure spasticity, resistance to passive movement about a joint is tested at a range of velocities. The score ranges from 0-4 (i.e., 0: normal muscle tone; 4: rigid in flexion or extension).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance as measured by Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An increase in score on the Berg Balance scale indicates better balance and decreased fall risk. For each item, the score ranges from 0-4 with a maximum total score of 56.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in basic functional independence as measured by the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM III)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before Baseline, after completion of intervention sessions (approximately 10 weeks), 1 month and 3 months after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An increase in the the score on the SCIM III indicates increased basic functional independence. This is a self report questionnaire with 19 items in three sub-scales: (1) self-care (6 items, subscore 0-20); (2) respiration and sphincter management (4 items, subscore 0-40); and (3) mobility (9 items, subscore 0-40). The total score ranges from 0-100.</description>

    <description>The researchers will measure changes in H-reflex size achieved with the use of the new system and compare these measures with the existing results in 25 spastic individuals with chronic incomplete SCI. Each participant completes 6 baseline sessions and 30 conditioning sessions. In the 30 conditioning sessions, the soleus H-reflex will be down-conditioned to decrease the activity of the hyperactive spinal stretch reflex pathway in people with spasticity that is characterized by exaggerated reflex activity. It is anticipated that the magnitude of reflex change obtained with the use of the new system would be greater or at least the same as the bench-marked values from the previous studies that used the old prototype reflex conditioning system.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a clinically stable spinal cord injury (above T11) that occurred at least one year&#xD;
             previously&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. the ability to ambulate at least 10 m with or without an assistive device (i.e.,&#xD;
             walker, crutches, or cane, not parallel bars) within 100 sec (those with 10-meter&#xD;
             walking time &gt;100 sec are excluded because it is unlikely that they are able to&#xD;
             participate in and complete our planned locomotion evaluation procedures)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. clinical signs of spasticity in the plantarflexor muscles at least unilaterally (i.e.,&#xD;
             hyperreactivity to Achilles tendon tap, and increased muscle tone, score &gt;1 on&#xD;
             Modified Ashworth scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. spastic hyperreflexia reflected in exaggerated H-reflex&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. functionally and medically stable for at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. medical clearance to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. reasonable expectation that current medications (including antispasticity medication&#xD;
             such as baclofen, diazepam, and tizanidine) will not change over the conditioning&#xD;
             period. Each participant's medication and dosage will be monitored and recorded&#xD;
             throughout the study. Once enrolled, the subject will remain enrolled even if&#xD;
             medication changes. (Because only neurologically stable subjects will enter this&#xD;
             study, medication changes will be unlikely.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. motoneuron injury;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. a cardiac condition (history of myocardial infarct, pacemaker use, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. an unstable medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. a pre-existing or confounding neurological condition (e.g., history of Multiple&#xD;
             Sclerosis (MS), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Stroke, Parkinson's disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. a condition that prevents lower extremity mobility testing or weight bearing (e.g.&#xD;
             fracture, severe sprain/strain, botox muscular injection) (orthotic knee&#xD;
             hyperextension is not excluded; in severe cases of knee hyperextension, the brace can&#xD;
             be worn during the study sessions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. a cognitive impairment that precludes giving informed consent (e.g., severe&#xD;
             intellectual disability)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. use of a functional electrical stimulation (FES) foot-drop stimulator or an FES&#xD;
             bicycle on a daily basis (FES applied to the arm is acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. deep vein thrombosis within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. depression (due to potential interference of anti-depressant medication with the&#xD;
             intervention and possible reduced participation reliability)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. pregnancy (due to expected changes in weight and posture and potentially unstable&#xD;
             medical condition).&#xD;
