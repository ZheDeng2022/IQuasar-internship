    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study in healthy volunteers who have received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine, to evaluate the safety and immune responses that develop in the blood and lungs&#xD;
      following the administration by aerosol of either Ad5-triCoV/Mac or ChAd-triCoV/Mac, new&#xD;
      experimental adenovirus-based vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and RNA&#xD;
      polymerase proteins.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of either&#xD;
      Ad5-triCoV/Mac, a replication deficient human adenovirus vector, or ChAd-triCoV/Mac, a&#xD;
      replication deficient chimpanzee adenovirus 68 vector, delivered to the respiratory tract by&#xD;
      aerosol, in healthy volunteers who have received two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Both&#xD;
      vectors have been engineered to express the spike, nucleocapsid and RNA polymerase proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this dose escalation study. The first cohort (n=6)&#xD;
      will receive Ad5-triCoV/Mac (n=3) or ChAd-triCoV/Mac (n=3) at a lower dose of 10e5,&#xD;
      administered using the AeroNeb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer. Assuming no safety concerns,&#xD;
      the aerosol dose will be increased to 10e6 to complete enrolment [Ad5-triCoV/Mac (n=12) or&#xD;
      ChAd-triCoV/Mac (n=12)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody and specific T cell responses will be measured in lung from bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
      fluid collected at bronchoscopy at baseline and at 4 weeks following vaccination and in blood&#xD;
      at several time points up to week 48 following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints will include the nature of any adverse events, their severity and the&#xD;
      probability of a relationship to study procedures and administration of vaccine.&#xD;

    <description>Ad5-triCoV/Mac is a recombinant type 5 human adenovirus vector which has been engineered to express our trivalent SARS-CoV-2 transgene cassette under the control of an MCMV promoter, and is followed by an SV40 polyA signal. The adenovirus construct is E1 and E3 deleted.This trivalent transgene cassette consists of the S1 region of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (aa 47-716), full-length SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) fused to a highly conserved portion of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (RdRp or POL).</description>
