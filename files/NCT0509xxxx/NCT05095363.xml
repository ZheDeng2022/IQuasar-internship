  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      evidence for clinical impact of a mobile app-based program called Palliative Care Planner&#xD;
      (PCplanner) in addressing needs and promoting advance care planning discussions among&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and their clinicians.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) affects roughly 6.3 to 76 per 100,000 people of predominantly&#xD;
      older adult patients worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Patients&#xD;
      with such idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis suffer symptom burdens similar to patients with&#xD;
      cancer and commonly experience long, costly hospitalizations that often include care in an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU). Despite the presence of numerous unmet needs, ILD patients&#xD;
      uncommonly receive palliative care because of lack of symptom recognition, supports to&#xD;
      provide advanced care planning (ACP) and symptom control, and processes to promote&#xD;
      collaboration between primary teams and palliative care specialists to deliver the&#xD;
      appropriate level of care. To address this important clinical gap, we propose adapting our&#xD;
      existing needs-targeted PCplanner (Palliative Care planner) mobile app platform to the&#xD;
      outpatient setting. PCplanner Outpatient will allow patients to report their needs, provide&#xD;
      video content to stimulate knowledge of and discussion about more advanced care planning, and&#xD;
      assist primary physicians in recognizing the optimal timing of specialist palliative care&#xD;
      referral.&#xD;
