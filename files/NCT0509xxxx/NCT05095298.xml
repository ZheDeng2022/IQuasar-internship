  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial, We intended to recruit the participants&#xD;
      who completed 2 doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine 4-8 months before, and volunteered to&#xD;
      receive the third dose of vaccine (inactivated vaccine, or recombinant subunit protein&#xD;
      vaccine and mRNA vaccine) into the experimental group, and the participants who completed 2&#xD;
      doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine 4-8 months before without a third dose of vaccination&#xD;
      plan into the control group. Participants in the experimental group received the third dose&#xD;
      of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at baseline, and participants in the control group received no&#xD;
      intervention. Each subject will be followed up for one year after enrollment, and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies and total antibodies will be tested at the specified time points, as&#xD;
      well as the records of adverse events and adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study set up 4 groups, 100 people each for inactivated vaccine, recombinant subunit&#xD;
      protein vaccine, mRNA vaccine and the control group, totaling 400 people.&#xD;
