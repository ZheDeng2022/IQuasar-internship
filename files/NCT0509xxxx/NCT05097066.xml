  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurosurgical practice has seen many important changes over several decades with advances in&#xD;
      treatments and the types of patients treated. Neurosurgical procedures have evolved, and as&#xD;
      outcomes have improved the number of patients being treated has increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no recent evaluations of national neurosurgical practice in the United Kingdom&#xD;
      (UK), with the last prospective cohort studies being Safe Neurosurgery 1993 and Safe&#xD;
      Neurosurgery 2000. More recent studies of neurosurgical services have been based on data from&#xD;
      single institutions or surgeons and these may not give a representative picture of practice&#xD;
      nationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent national quality improvement programmes for neurosurgery in England (such as the&#xD;
      National Neurosurgical Audit Programme (NNAP) and Cranial Neurosurgery and Spinal Surgery&#xD;
      Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) Programmes) have focused on using national hospital&#xD;
      administrative datasets. To be effective, quality improvement initiatives require robust&#xD;
      outcome measures and quality (process) indicators. Currently, there is a lack of validated&#xD;
      quality indicators for neurosurgery, with practice often being described using generic&#xD;
      measures such as readmission and reoperation rates and length of stay. Many studies have been&#xD;
      able to derive these common outcome measures, but it may also be possible to produce&#xD;
      indicators specific to neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational study was firstly to describe the current pattern of&#xD;
      neurosurgical admissions and procedures in England, and thereby given an overview of the&#xD;
      epidemiology of neurosurgical patients. Secondly, it aims to investigate the range of outcome&#xD;
      measures that might be produced from hospital administrative data and use these to assess the&#xD;
      quality of care in neurosurgery.&#xD;
