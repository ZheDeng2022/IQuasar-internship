  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo preoperative baseline screening and will be randomised to either&#xD;
      normal postoperative care or a 12-week supervised exercise programme comprising of both an&#xD;
      aerobic and resistance component&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be assessed prior to surgery which will include cardiopulmonary exercise testing&#xD;
      (CPET). This is a well-established method of assessing aerobic exercise response and is&#xD;
      widely used in the perioperative period for assessment of cancer patients with co-morbidity.&#xD;
      The assessment days will also include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  muscle ultrasound (vastus lateralis) to ascertain muscle structure (thickness, pennation&#xD;
           angle and fascicle length),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional composite scores,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life questionnaires,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment days will be carried out at four time points during the study; prior to&#xD;
      surgery, before commencement of the exercise program, halfway through the intervention (6&#xD;
      weeks post commencement of exercise) and at the end of the study. In the week before the&#xD;
      assessment days patients will wear a physical activity monitor to characterise their daily&#xD;
      movements. The control group will also be assessed at the same time points and wear the&#xD;
      activity monitors but will not take part in the exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a physical activity monitor placed onto the right thigh in the&#xD;
      midline at postoperative day 1 until discharge or day 7, whichever is sooner. This is a&#xD;
      non-invasive measure of activity and can discriminate between whether a patient is lying,&#xD;
      sitting, standing or walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants self-report feeling able to start exercising again post-discharge, they&#xD;
      will commence the 12 week programme. The intervention will consist of 2 resistance training&#xD;
      (RET) sessions per week and 75 minutes of vigorous or 150 minutes of moderate aerobic&#xD;
      exercise per week (can be split according to patient preference). They will receive a diary&#xD;
      to log their sessions and will be monitored via twice weekly virtual follow-up (either&#xD;
      telephone or video calling) and for the first 6 weeks weekly visits to ensure that they are&#xD;
      adherent to the exercise protocol and provide any support/advice. Satisfactory compliance&#xD;
      with the programme will be considered to be the completion of at least 27 sessions over the&#xD;
      12 week period, with a minimum of 13 out of 18 and 14 out of 18 sessions completed in the&#xD;
      first and last 6 weeks, respectively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to provide a structured exercise programme to investigate whether a structured&#xD;
      exercise programme following discharge from hospital will aid return to full activity.&#xD;
      Exercise programmes are a well-tested and effective method of improving fitness in the&#xD;
      healthy population. The government guidelines for adults aged 19 and above are to do at least&#xD;
      150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week which can be&#xD;
      split over multiple days. This does not require specialist equipment or costly interventions&#xD;
      and include simple measures such as brisk walks and lifting weights. In conjunction with set&#xD;
      resistance exercises, the investigators aim to use this as the target to provide a regimen&#xD;
      that reaches this target for patients. Physical activity will also be measured at four&#xD;
      timepoints during the study using a non-invasive physical activity monitor (ActivPAL) to&#xD;
      compare between the intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Understandably for the potential recruits this will be a difficult and emotional&#xD;
      time period given their significant diagnosis that will have been given very soon prior to&#xD;
      the research team's first interaction with them. Participants will be recruited in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting but after the diagnosis and treatment plan has been made and conveyed by&#xD;
      their parent team. Patients will be given all the information and at least 48 hours to&#xD;
      consider their involvement in the study. They will then be re-contacted them via telephone&#xD;
      and if they agree, researchers who are trained in taking consent will complete the consent&#xD;
      process with the patient. No patients will be included who lack capacity or are in any other&#xD;
      way unable to give informed consent. The research group have previously recruited for several&#xD;
      prehabilitation studies in this way with good patient feedback and no reports of&#xD;
      psychological harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      These guidelines are suitable for older participants with necessary adaptations. However, it&#xD;
      is assumed that a small number older of participants may struggle to achieve these targets as&#xD;
      they were not achievable for them prior to diagnosis and surgery. The investigators have a&#xD;
      long and safe track record of exercise in the elderly in studies performed by the group, and&#xD;
      clinical researchers will closely supervise the CPET. Unfamiliarity with exercise in itself&#xD;
      is not a reason for non-inclusion in the study, but a more graduated increase in effort may&#xD;
      be required for individual participants. There are clear inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      outlined to minimise the risk of adverse outcomes following exercise in the participants.&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) will be included in the functional assessments at&#xD;
      four points during the study. There is a theoretical risk of exercise-induced pathology that&#xD;
      may occur secondary to this. The guidelines will be followed for absolute contraindications&#xD;
      as laid out by the POETTS consensus guidelines (2018) and ATS/ACCP statement on CPET (2003).&#xD;
      These include but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute myocardial infarction (3-5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unstable angina&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled arrhythmias causing symptoms or hemodynamic compromise (200 mm Hg systolic,&#xD;
           120 mm Hg diastolic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syncope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active endocarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute myocarditis or pericarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute pulmonary embolus or pulmonary infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombosis of lower extremities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspected dissecting aneurysm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary edema&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Room air desaturation at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute non cardiopulmonary disorder that may affect exercise performance or be aggravated&#xD;
           by exercise (i.e. infection, renal failure, thyrotoxicosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental impairment leading to inability to cooperate These patients will not be included&#xD;
           in the study. Also, any abnormal results picked up at screening will warrant exclusion&#xD;
           from the study, and the PI will communicate these to the participants' GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any of the following occur both during exercise or CPET testing the programme will be&#xD;
      terminated immediately and the participant withdrawn:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest pain suggestive of ischaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ischemic ECG changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complex ectopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second or third degree heart block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fall in systolic pressure 20 mm Hg from the highest value during the test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension (250 mm Hg systolic; 120 mm Hg diastolic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe desaturation: SpO2 ≤ 80% when accompanied by symptoms and signs of severe&#xD;
           hypoxemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sudden pallor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of coordination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mental confusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dizziness or faintness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of respiratory failure CPET testing is the standard test for qualification of lack&#xD;
           of cardiorespiratory fitness before operation and is used to stratify risk in higher&#xD;
           risk patients as standard of care in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These guidelines will also be applied to those performing alternative forms of exercise such&#xD;
      as brisk walking/running and resistance exercises. The resistance exercise component will via&#xD;
      the use of resistance bands and therefore does not require equipment such as weight machines&#xD;
      or free weights which can cause injury if applied incorrectly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who volunteer for the study may be more active by virtue of a desire to be included.&#xD;
      There is the potential for outcomes not being as generalizable to the whole population&#xD;
      regardless of pre-existing physical activity, and also, impact of interventions may be&#xD;
      lessened as both groups may be more fit than some groups of those who present for surgery.&#xD;
