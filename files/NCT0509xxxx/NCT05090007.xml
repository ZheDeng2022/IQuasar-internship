  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability in children and young adults.&#xD;
      Children with moderate to severe TBI are typically at risk of poor functional outcome in&#xD;
      terms of neurocognitive impairment and behavior problems. Neurocognitive impairments include&#xD;
      deficits in attention and working memory, learning and memory, and executive functioning,&#xD;
      whereas behavior problems include anxiety, depression and aggression. Neuroimaging techniques&#xD;
      based on multi-modal magnetic resonance image (MRI) can detect the structural and functional&#xD;
      brain abnormalities objectively and sensitively. Recent evidence indicates that even after&#xD;
      mild TBI, children with risk factors for intracranial pathology are at risk of poor&#xD;
      neurocognitive and behavioral outcome.Meanwhile, recently, the concept of &quot;gut-brain axis&quot;&#xD;
      has been proposed and hint gut microbiota could shape the brain. Some studies have emphasized&#xD;
      that human gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis and development of TBI.&#xD;
      However, how the gut affects the brain in patients with TBI is unclear. Thus, combining&#xD;
      analysis of neuroimaging and &quot;gut-brain axis&quot; will provide more information for finding the&#xD;
      risk factors and imaging diagnostic markers of brain impairment in TBI. It will also helpful&#xD;
      for explaining the underlying mechanisms of brain impairment in TBI, providing an objective&#xD;
      basis for clinical diagnosis and prediction of the prognosis.&#xD;
