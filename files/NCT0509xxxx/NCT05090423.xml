  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40% of acute ankle sprain would develop into chronic ankle instability (CAI).&#xD;
      Chronic ankle instability is characterized by pain, repeated sprains and giving way.&#xD;
      Recently, the pathomechanical impairment, sensory-perceptual impairment and motor-behavioral&#xD;
      impairment have been documented in the chronic ankle instability model. Previous research&#xD;
      revealed that compared to the control subjects, people with CAI had lower pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold (PPT). This increased mechanosensitivity of the neural tissues around the ankle&#xD;
      might account for pain and dysfunction in people with CAI. Also, the other study indicated&#xD;
      that in subjects following ankle inversion sprain there is greater restriction of knee&#xD;
      extension on the injured side compared to non-injured side in the slump test with the ankle&#xD;
      plantar flexion and inversion, which may suggest the restriction in mobility of the common&#xD;
      peroneal tract. However, the effects of neurodynamic intervention, which addresses the&#xD;
      mechanosensitivity problems, in people with CAI are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the effect of additional neurodynamic&#xD;
      intervention on the ankle range of motion, mechanosensitivity, balance performance and&#xD;
      self-reported function.&#xD;

      The investigators will recruit 40 patients with chronic ankle instability and compare the&#xD;
      effect of two intervention groups (balance training alone, combined balance training and&#xD;
      neurodynamic intervention for the common peroneal nerve) on ankle range of motion (ROM),&#xD;
      active knee ROM, pressure pain threshold , Y balance test and Foot and ankle ability measure&#xD;
      (FAAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent test and Chi-square test are used to examine demographic data of the groups&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-way repeated measures ANOVA is used to examine the intervention effect with the alpha&#xD;
      level set at 0.05&#xD;

    <description>Ask the person to face the wall and the tested foot in front, then the second toe and heel in the line is perpendicular to the wall. The contralateral limb is positioned behind the testing limb in a comfortable position and hands are placed on the wall in front to maintain stability. The gravity inclinometer is placed at the tibial tuberosity to measure the angle. The subjects will lunge forward trying to touch a vertical line on the wall with their knee, at the same time keeping heel contact with ground.&#xD;
Participants will perform three practice trials followed by 3 test trials and average the 3 tests.</description>

    <description>The Foot and Ankle Ability Measures (FAAM) is a self-report measure that evaluate physical function of lower extremities musculoskeletal disorders. The measurement includes two parts, activities of daily living subscale of 21 items and sports subscale of 8 items. For each question, the subjects will chose the appropriate answer that most clearly describes their condition within the past week. It is based on the 4-0 scale. (4: no difficulty, 3: slight difficulty, 2: moderate difficulty, 1: extreme difficulty, 0: unable to do) If an activity in question is limited by something other than their foot or ankle, the patient is asked to record N/A. The sum of the scores in the two parts is less than ninety points, indicating that there is ankle instability</description>
