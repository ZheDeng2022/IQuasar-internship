  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Establishment of a sufficiently wide and thick keratinized gingival/mucosal tissue cuff&#xD;
      around teeth/implants is considered of importance for long-term stability. This can more&#xD;
      readily be achieved by means of autogenous soft tissue grafts harvested from the palate than&#xD;
      with soft tissue substitutes. However, this often implies the creation of an open palatal&#xD;
      wound involving secondary intention healing. The aim of this randomized controlled,&#xD;
      split-mouth, clinical trial is to assess the effect of a hyaluronic acid containing&#xD;
      commercial product on wound healing and patient morbidity after palatal soft tissue&#xD;
      harvesting. Altogether, 20 volunteers will be recruited. An individualized splint containing&#xD;
      2 symmetrically located contralateral cylindrical openings will be used for standardized soft&#xD;
      tissue harvesting (6 mm in Ø, 2 mm in depth). Soft tissue grafts will be harvested randomly&#xD;
      from the right or left side and patients will be monitored for 3 weeks followed by a 1-month&#xD;
      wash-out period prior to harvesting the second soft tissue graft from the other side.&#xD;
      Participants will randomly start treating the palatal wound either with the test product (GUM&#xD;
      Aftaclear Gel, Sunstar Suisse SA, Etoy, Switzerland; 0.3%) or saline solution for 7 days to&#xD;
      promote the healing process, which will be reversed for the second round. Patient-related&#xD;
      outcomes (morbidity, discomfort, taste alteration, pain killer consumption), frequency of&#xD;
      bleeding events, defect closure (area, volume), and microbial colonisation will be recorded&#xD;
      and analysed for any differences between the control and test product.&#xD;
