  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies in healthy young adults have shown that abnormal and undesirable physiological&#xD;
      changes are a result of chronic sleep curtailment, with implications on inflammatory status,&#xD;
      blood glucose regulation, circulating free fatty acids, and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies suggest an increase in energy intake with shortened, sleep and this&#xD;
      has been associated with weight gain. Interestingly most studies examining sleep restriction&#xD;
      do not consider whether the restricted sleep is due to sleep delay or an advanced wake time.&#xD;
      This study will investigate the change in physical activity or food intake during a period of&#xD;
      sleep restriction. To date only one study has addressed this question but they only examined&#xD;
      one study night and followed their subjects for only 24 hr. The objective of the proposed&#xD;
      project is to examine the effects of shortened sleep on potential changes in physical&#xD;
      activity and energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that after several nights of short sleep that different&#xD;
      strategies are employed to remain awake and these strategies will also vary whether bed time&#xD;
      was delayed or wake time was advanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To examine the effects of sleep timing on energy intake and expenditure during periods&#xD;
      of sleep restriction&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will have preliminary screening tests. There will be 3 study conditions, with the&#xD;
      latter 2 conditions (delayed bed time/advanced wake time) will be completed in a randomized,&#xD;
      crossover design. Subjects will wear an activity monitor (actigraph) and sleep monitor&#xD;
      (actiwatch) for 6 days. Dietary records and smart phones will be used record energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first experimental condition, the subject will wear the actiwatch and actigraph, and&#xD;
      monitor food intake for 6 day of normal sleep. This condition will allow determination of&#xD;
      their sleep pattern and when they habitually go to bed (ie. 11 pm - 5 am) and awaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second condition, the investigators will allow subjects to maintain their usual&#xD;
      physical activity and dietary patterns but the investigators will ask subjects to delay the&#xD;
      time of going to bed by 2 hr. Subjects will be followed for 4 nights of shortened sleep but&#xD;
      data will be collected for 6 days. On the other condition, subjects will go to bed at the&#xD;
      usual time but awaken 2 hr earlier that they normally would. Again subjects will monitor&#xD;
      their physical activity, hunger/fullness, sleep and energy intake. These latter 2 conditions&#xD;
      will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Subjects will be provided a verbal explanation of the study and will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent if interested. Subjects will then complete questionnaires assessing health&#xD;
      history, sleep, morningness and physical activity habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Subjects will collect physical activity monitor (actigraph) and sleep monitor&#xD;
      (actiwatch) along with surveys to fill out each day about dietary consumption, sleep habits&#xD;
      and physical activity, lasting for 6 days. Subjects will also be asked to photograph any food&#xD;
      or drink they consume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Return the actiwatch and actigraph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4-5: Repeat of Visit 2-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6-7: Repeat of Visit 2-3.&#xD;
