      Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs) are specialized United States Army units formed to&#xD;
      train, advise, assist, enable and accompany operations with allied and partner nations. SFABs&#xD;
      are composed of roughly 800 senior military personnel, primarily commissioned and&#xD;
      non-commissioned officers selected from regular Army units across a wide range of military&#xD;
      specialties. Because of the high operational tempo (OPTEMPO) of these units, individual&#xD;
      resiliency is of utmost importance in maintaining readiness to successfully execute critical,&#xD;
      high-stress missions. Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) is an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention with strong potential to enhance resiliency by bolstering psychological&#xD;
      flexibility along with other factors which have been demonstrated to optimize individual and&#xD;
      group performance. This project will compare an ACT-based resiliency-enhancement training&#xD;
      program as compared to training as usual in 600 3rd SFAB soldiers stationed at Fort Hood in&#xD;
      Killeen, Texas. Assessment measures related to resilience will be administered before and&#xD;
      after training as well as before and after deployment. Assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline, and every 4 months thereafter for a total of 16-months.&#xD;

      Over the past decade, the DoD has also had a significant interest in the development and&#xD;
      evaluation of evidence-based programs for enhancing resiliency in military personnel to help&#xD;
      optimize operational readiness and prevent deployment-related psychological health&#xD;
      causalities (Peterson, Cigrang, &amp; Isler, 2009). Maintaining health, optimizing performance,&#xD;
      and boosting resiliency to stressors in harsh combat environments is a momentous challenge.&#xD;
      Conducting research aimed at enhancing health, performance, and resiliency is similarly&#xD;
      challenging. As a result, few studies have documented evidence-based interventions to&#xD;
      maintain or boost performance under such harsh conditions. Thus, compared to the major&#xD;
      scientific and clinical advancements in the assessment and treatment of deployment-related&#xD;
      psychological health conditions in active duty military personnel, little research has been&#xD;
      conducted on the enhancement of resiliency in military personnel. A major challenge in the&#xD;
      development and evaluation of evidence-based resiliency-enhancement programs for military&#xD;
      personnel is the design of scientifically valid and methodologically sound research designs.&#xD;
      Most of the resiliency-enhancement programs developed to date-such as the Comprehensive&#xD;
      Soldier Fitness Program-have been evidenced-informed programs that were universally&#xD;
      implemented in ways that prevented rigorous scientific validation of their efficacy&#xD;
      (Steenkamp, Nash, &amp; Litz, 2013). Consequently, prospective efficacy research is desperately&#xD;
      needed to evaluate potential approaches to enhance resiliency and optimize readiness in&#xD;
      military personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ideally, a resiliency enhancement training for military personnel would demonstrate not only&#xD;
      improvements in self-reported resiliency and other related constructs but also demonstrate&#xD;
      positive adaptation in the face of significant stress or adversity as a result of the&#xD;
      training (Britt, Sinclair, &amp; McFadden, 2013). Adler and colleagues have conducted a series of&#xD;
      studies to evaluate the efficacy of resiliency training in active duty military populations&#xD;
      (Adler, et al., 2015; Adler et al., 2015; Cacioppo et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An excellent summary of the science of resiliency was completed as part of a systematic&#xD;
      review by Macedo et al., (2014) of interventions for building resilience in non-clinical&#xD;
      samples of adults. The summary of this review highlighted that to date, no prospective study&#xD;
      has evaluated the efficacy of resiliency-enhancement trainings and investigated the actual&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse situations after the training to document that the training improved&#xD;
      positive adaptation in the face of significant adversity. A Cochrane Report titled&#xD;
      Psychological Interventions for Resilience Enhancement in Adults (Helmreich et al., 2017) is&#xD;
      currently conducting a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on psychological&#xD;
      interventions to enhance resiliency in adults. The currently published protocol for this&#xD;
      Cochrane study indicates that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is one of the most promising&#xD;
      psychological approaches for resilience enhancement in adults. The study team believe that&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy has some of the strongest scientific support for potential&#xD;
      adaptation for use in military training to enhance resiliency and optimize readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT, which is pronounced as one word (&quot;act&quot;), is a contemporary, evidence-based,&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral approach to improving functioning and performance (Hayes, 2004; Hayes et&#xD;
      al., 2006). In ACT, the broad goal is to help individuals identify and act consistently with&#xD;
      their values and goals and to align their actions with those values even if they are&#xD;
      experiencing pain or discomfort (Hayes, 2004; Hayes et al., 2006). ACT is rooted in a&#xD;
      well-established theory of human language and cognition (Relational Frame Theory), which&#xD;
      describes how internal experiences (e.g., thoughts, emotions, physiological sensations, and&#xD;
      urges) are viewed as behaviors that can be predicted and influenced. In ACT, trainees&#xD;
      practice identifying these internal events for what they are (i.e., transient phenomena)&#xD;
      rather than as permanent experiences. Trainees learn to take a stance characterized by active&#xD;
      acceptance of and willingness to remain in contact with these experiences rather than&#xD;
      allocating attention and energy to attempts to control, reduce, or eliminate negatively&#xD;
      evaluated internal experiences. Examples of such negatively evaluated internal experiences&#xD;
      include physiological sensations such as pain or sensations associated with lack of oxygen,&#xD;
      emotions such as fear, and thoughts such as &quot;I can't stand it&quot; or &quot;It's not worth it.&quot; Under&#xD;
      harsh conditions, it is highly unlikely if not impossible that attempts to control, suppress,&#xD;
      or eliminate such experiences will be successful. Thus, a behavioral stance characterized by&#xD;
      active acceptance and willingness is more adaptive, as it increases the availability of&#xD;
      personal resources for optimizing volitional control over one's behavior. This volitional&#xD;
      control may then be optimally applied toward goal attainment. Taking an accepting, willing&#xD;
      stance ultimately gives rise to greater psychological flexibility, which is the primary&#xD;
      target or mechanism in ACT. As with elite athletics, taking an adaptive, flexible stance is a&#xD;
      core element of preparation for successful performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are over 250 published or in press randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using ACT to&#xD;
      optimize functional outcomes in diverse domains including improving workplace performance&#xD;
      under stressful conditions, completing physical exercise regimens, improving parenting&#xD;
      skills, and adhering to dietary restrictions (Moran, 2015). Moreover, ACT has been studied&#xD;
      extensively and demonstrated to improve functioning among people living with a wide range of&#xD;
      psychological and physical conditions, syndromes, and injuries. Such RCTs span applications&#xD;
      of ACT for depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, psychosis, personality&#xD;
      disorders, tobacco use, eating disorders, and a range of medical health issues (e.g., cancer,&#xD;
      diabetes, chronic pain). Thus, ACT has a proven track record of improving performance and&#xD;
      functioning across a range of conditions, including those involving intense physical and&#xD;
      emotional distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the ACT model, suffering and impairment are primarily the consequence of&#xD;
      psychological inflexibility (i.e., inability to persist in or change behavior according to&#xD;
      situational or contextual factors and personally chosen values due to problematic, inflexible&#xD;
      reactions to negatively evaluated internal experiences). Psychological inflexibility may be&#xD;
      particularly detrimental when an individual is confronted with stress or adversity (Hayes,&#xD;
      2004; Hayes et al., 2006). Thus, interventions targeting increased psychological&#xD;
      flexibility-ACT being the foremost in this field-are recommended not only for facilitating&#xD;
      recovery after stressors but also for enhancing resilience (e.g., Meyer, Frankfurt, et al.,&#xD;
      2018; Meyer, Szabo, et al., 2019). Highly relevant to the current proposal is a series of&#xD;
      randomized experiments in which brief interventions based on core components of the ACT model&#xD;
      were shown to increase pain tolerance. In these studies, pain tolerance was operationalized&#xD;
      as increasing the amount of time spent on the task before quitting, which is an analogue for&#xD;
      greater persistence in an intense military training program. A brief acceptance-based&#xD;
      intervention led to large increases in pain tolerance compared to a control group (Masedo &amp;&#xD;
      Rosa Esteve, 2007). Recently, a brief values-based intervention led to a 55% increase in pain&#xD;
      tolerance, whereas the control condition reported a 12% decrease in pain tolerance at&#xD;
      follow-up (Smith et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional empirical support for the ACT model comes from a study led by Co-PI Meyer&#xD;
      demonstrating that psychological flexibility predicted lower overall disability and greater&#xD;
      quality of life in combat-exposed veterans, even after accounting for PTSD symptom severity&#xD;
      (Meyer, Frankfurt, et al., 2018). ACT includes mindfulness training to support the&#xD;
      development of psychological flexibility. This same study also found that mindfulness&#xD;
      predicted lower disability and greater quality of life in combat veterans over and above PTSD&#xD;
      severity. In ACT, these modifiable factors are targeted in order to promote trainees' ability&#xD;
      to commit to engaging in goal- or values-consistent behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the ACT model, the recent report by the Cochrane Collaboration that&#xD;
      identified ACT as an evidence-based intervention for enhancing resilience listed&#xD;
      psychological flexibility, the central target of ACT, as having the highest tier of evidence&#xD;
      support for promoting resilience (Helmreich et al., 2017). They also rated this relationship&#xD;
      as having the highest tier of empirical support. Specifically, more systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses were included in the report for psychological flexibility than any other single&#xD;
      factor. The report delineated how ACT is likely to enhance resilience by bolstering&#xD;
      psychological flexibility specifically through teaching mindfulness and acceptance skills&#xD;
      (e.g., maintaining contact with the present moment, cognitive de-fusion, acceptance of or&#xD;
      willingness to experience emotional distress) along with behavior-change skills (e.g.,&#xD;
      committed action). In this way, the report authors posit several resilience factors will be&#xD;
      fostered in ACT-based resilience interventions (e.g., cognitive flexibility, purpose in&#xD;
      life). In particular, based on the available evidence, the report emphasized that acceptance&#xD;
      of the full range of emotions, particularly those that are uncomfortable and that is often&#xD;
      associated with behavioral avoidance, likely promotes successful adaptation to stressful&#xD;
      conditions (i.e., resilience; Helmreich et al., 2017).&#xD;

      SFABs are specialized United States Army units formed to train, advise, assist, enable and&#xD;
      accompany operations with allied and partner nations. SFABs are intended to reduce the burden&#xD;
      of such operations on conventionally organized Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs), allowing BCTs to&#xD;
      focus on fighting near-peer threats. Designed on the model of a standard infantry BCT, SFABs&#xD;
      is composed of roughly 800 senior personnel, primarily commissioned and non-commissioned&#xD;
      officers selected from regular Army units and given additional training at the Military&#xD;
      Advisor Training Academy at Fort Benning, Georgia. The first such unit, the 1st SFAB, began&#xD;
      operations in February 2018. The 3rd SFAB began operations at Fort Hood less than a year&#xD;
      later in January 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with other highly trained and specialized military units deployed to hostile and uncertain&#xD;
      areas, the 3rd SFAB has been and will continue to be exposed to physical and psychological&#xD;
      stressors as part of their military service.&#xD;

    <measure>Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 10-item questionnaire examining attitudes toward coping with adversity. Items require respondents to indicate their degree of endorsement on 5-point scales ranging from 0 (&quot;not true at all&quot;) through 4 (&quot;true nearly all the time&quot;; e.g., &quot;Having to cope with stress makes me stronger&quot;). Score ranges are from 0 to 40, with a lower score indicating less coping ability.</description>

    <measure>Dispositional Recovery and Dysfunction Inventory (DRDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 14-item measure that is comprised of 2 subscales (a resilience and dysfunctional cognitions subscale). Participants are asked to rate themselves (e.g., 1 - not at all like me; 7 - completely like me) concerning their perception of themselves on items such as &quot;I often feel shame&quot; or &quot;I am an achiever&quot; on a Likert scale of (not at all characteristic of me) to 7 (entirely characteristic of me). Scores on the subscales can range from 7 to 40. High scores on the resilience subscale indicate that individuals are more likely to be willing to engage in flexible thinking whereas high scores on the dysfunction subscale are likely to indicate individuals are engaging in more rigid thinking.</description>

    <measure>Response to Stressful Experiences Scale (RSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 22-item questionnaire that asks participants to assess how well each statement describes them, both during and after stressful events in their lives. Responses are given on a 5-point scale, with anchors 0 (not at all like me) to 4 (exactly like me). Scores range from 0 to 88 with a lower score indicating that the participant identifies less with the statements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 7-item measure examining levels of experiential avoidance. Participants are asked to rate themselves on items such as &quot;Emotions cause problems in my life&quot; on a Likert scale of 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). Scores range from 1-49 with a lower score indicating that emotions are less problematic. Higher total scores mean less flexibility, while lower total scores mean more flexibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility Inventory (MPFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 60-item measure of the six core processes underlying the psychological flexibility model. Each core process is rated in terms of both flexibility and inflexibility. Thus, for each of the six core processes, there are five items reflecting flexibility (acceptance, present moment awareness, self-as-context, cognitive defusion, values, and committed action) and five items reflecting inflexibility (experiential avoidance, lack of contact with the present moment, self-as-content, cognitive fusion, lack of contact with values, and inaction). These 12 subscales share about 40% of their variance in common, reflecting both the inter-relatedness of these processes and the uniqueness of these constructs, which is consistent with the psychological flexibility of the model. Higher scores reflect higher levels of flexibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire-6 (GSEQ-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a six-item self-report measure that assesses for general self-efficacy as related to an individual's ability to adapt to stress and chronic illness. Example questions include &quot;It is easy for me to stick to my aims and accomplish my goals&quot; or &quot;I am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events.&quot; Total score ranges between 10 and 40, with a higher score indicating more self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF; WHO, 2012)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF (WHO, 2012) will be used to measure QoL, also referred to as life satisfaction, across major life domains. It consists of 26 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale and is comprised of four subscales: Physical, Psychological, Social Relationships, and Environment. The measure is calculated by summing the point values for the questions corresponding to each domain and then transforming the scores to a 0-100 point interval. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life).</description>

    <measure>General Functioning 12-item subscale (GF12) of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 12-item self-report measure that is a subscale of the FAD (Miller et al., 1985). designed to assess for family functioning. The GF12 subscale includes six items of healthy family functioning, and six items of unhealth family functioning. Scoring is on a 4-point scale (1= strongly agree to 4= strongly disagree). The FAD is scored by adding the responses for each scale and dividing by the number of items in each scale. Higher scores indicate worse levels of family functioning.</description>

    <measure>Short Grit Scale (Grit-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on an 8-item grit scale that examines trait-level perseverance and passion for long-term goals. Participants are asked to rate themselves on items such as &quot;My interests change from year to year&quot; or &quot;I am a hard worker&quot; on a Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all like me&quot; to &quot;very much like me.&quot; Higher scores indicate that individuals are able to maintain focus and interest, and persevere in obtaining long-term goals.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (ITIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 6-item self-report scale examining individual fixed/growth mindset in relation to intelligence. Participants are asked their agreement with items such as &quot;You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you really can't do much to change it&quot; on a Likert scale of 1 (strongly agree) to 6 (strongly disagree). Scores range from 1-26 with a higher score indicating that the participant has a more negative perception of their mindset in relation to intelligence. Scores of less than three indicate a &quot;fixed mindset.&quot; Scores of four or more indicate a &quot;growth mindset.&quot; A score between 3.3 and 3.7 can be taken as &quot;borderline.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 7-item measure that asks participants to rate the frequency with which they have been bothered by anxiety symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score. Scores reflect no significant anxiety symptoms (0-4), mild anxiety symptoms (5-9), moderate anxiety symptoms (10-14), and severe anxiety symptoms (&gt;15). Respondents also indicate the degree to which their anxious symptoms have made it difficult for them to do their work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people, from &quot;not difficult at all&quot; to &quot;extremely difficult.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on a 9 items scale that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders; these 9 items correspond to the diagnostic criteria for DSM MDD. Respondents rate the frequency with which they have been bothered by depressive symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score. Scores reflect no significant depressive symptoms (0-4), mild depressive symptoms (5-9), moderate depressive symptoms (10-14), moderately severe depressive symptoms (15-19), and severe depressive symptoms (&gt;19). Respondents also indicate the degree to which their depressive symptoms have made it difficult for them to do their work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people, from &quot;not difficult at all&quot; to &quot;extremely difficult.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Horizontal and Vertical Cohesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Horizontal Cohesion subscale assesses the degree to which unit members are cooperative, can depend on one another, and stand up for one another. Three items related to horizontal cohesion are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The Vertical Cohesion subscale assesses whether or not service members believe that their leaders are supportive and capable of keeping them safe from the inherent dangers of a combat deployment.&#xD;
The vertical cohesion subscale consists of 12 items rated on a 5-point scale (1 = never to 5 = always). For both subscales, higher scores indicate greater cohesion.</description>
