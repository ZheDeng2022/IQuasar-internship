  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to analyze the changes in corneal biomechanics of myopic children with different treatment&#xD;
      (low concentration atropine eye drops and orthokeratology) and explore the possible mechanism&#xD;
      of myopia control&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High myopia is accompanied by excessive growth of eyeball, which leads to many complications.&#xD;
      Myopia control is a great concern of the government and ophthalmologists worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atropine eye drops is used clinically to control the progression of myopia. In recent years,&#xD;
      low dose Atropine eye drops (0.01%, 0.05% and 0.1%) have been proven to be effective in&#xD;
      slowing growth of eyeball. With less negative effects, these eye drops have been widely used&#xD;
      for school children in Taiwan. Orthokeratology is another effective tool to control myopia,&#xD;
      and long-term wearing of Ortho-k lens can inhibit the speed of eyeball growth, it is the most&#xD;
      useful optical treatment for myopia control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Corvis® ST is a combination of an air pulse tonometer with an ultra-high-speed&#xD;
      Scheimpflug camera. The movement of the cornea is mainly influenced by three factors which&#xD;
      can be measured by the instrument:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraocular pressure (IOP)，biomechanical properties of the cornea and corneal thickness. The&#xD;
      relationship between adult corneal biomechanics and refractive error has been noted in recent&#xD;
      years. Previous studies pointed out that corneal biomechanics analyzer (Corvis ST) can&#xD;
      measure the deformation process of the cornea and the biomechanics parameters. These&#xD;
      literature found that the corneas of myopic patients， esp. high myopic, have larger corneal&#xD;
      deformation in biomechanics analysis and revealed that the corneal stiffness of myopia&#xD;
      patients was lower. There are still few discussions about the effect of orthokeratology on&#xD;
      corneal biomechanics and there is no research focused on the change of corneal biomechanics&#xD;
      of low-concentration atropine user which is worthy of our further exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hope to analyze the changes in corneal biomechanics of&#xD;
      myopic children with different treatment (low concentration atropine eye drops and&#xD;
      orthokeratology) and explore the possible mechanism of myopia control.&#xD;
