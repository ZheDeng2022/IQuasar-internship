  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy individuals from the University of Oregon and surrounding community will be recruited&#xD;
      for participation in behavioral, fMRI and eye tracking experiments that investigate human&#xD;
      memory. Recruitment will involve emails, flyers, and local advertisements. Individuals&#xD;
      between the ages of 18-80 (or 18-35 for some studies) will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad objective of the research is to understand how humans form distinct memories for&#xD;
      similar experiences. Experimental sessions will involve studying and trying to remember&#xD;
      various images (e.g., images of natural scenes). The intervention will involve manipulating&#xD;
      the similarity and/or learning protocol for the studied images. Outcome measures will include&#xD;
      (a) behavioral measures of memory, and/or (b) fMRI measures of hemodynamic activity, and/or&#xD;
      (c) eye tracking measures of gaze direction. Experimental sessions will last approximately&#xD;
      1-3 hours.&#xD;

      Objective: The goal of the research studies is to understand how memories are formed for&#xD;
      similar experiences such that interference (confusion) between these memories is minimized.&#xD;
      Of particular interest is the role of the hippocampus (a brain region important for memory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Healthy individuals from the University of Oregon and surrounding community&#xD;
      will be recruited through fliers, emails, and advertisements. For some of the studies,&#xD;
      individuals between 18-80 years of age will be recruited. For others, individuals between&#xD;
      18-35 will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: All studies will involve studying and trying to remember various images (e.g.,&#xD;
      natural scenes) displayed on a computer screen. Memory decisions will be made and recorded&#xD;
      using a computer keyboard or external button box. The similarity of images and/or the&#xD;
      specific learning procedures (e.g., number of repetitions, order of study, etc.) will be&#xD;
      manipulated. Experimental sessions will be conducted in behavioral testing rooms (with or&#xD;
      without eye tracking equipment) and/or in an MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Measures of interest will include (a) behavioral responses, (b) fMRI measures of&#xD;
      hemodynamic responses, and/or (c) gaze direction as measured by eye tracking equipment.&#xD;
      Behavioral responses will consist of simple memory decisions, such as indicating whether or&#xD;
      not an image has been seen before or trying to remember associations between images. fMRI&#xD;
      data will be analyzed using multivariate pattern similarity analyses. Eye tracking data will&#xD;
      be used to measure the specific spatial locations of images that participants fixate on.&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral responses will be recorded by keyboard or external button boxes. These responses will be used to assess the accuracy with which participants remember individual images. Accuracy will be averaged across stimuli within each learning condition to obtain measures of mean memory accuracy (i.e., the percentage of stimuli that were successfully remembered) per condition and participant.</description>

    <description>fMRI will be used to measure hemodynamic (BOLD) responses as participants study images. Pattern similarity analyses will be applied to the fMRI data. Pattern similarity will be indexed by the correlation (r) between patterns of BOLD activity. Pattern similarity will be computed for images within and across different learning conditions.</description>

    <time_frame>Data will be collected over a 5 year period. Results from sub-studies will be analyzed within 6 months of the conclusion of data collection.</time_frame>
    <description>Eye tracking equipment will be used to measure gaze direction and fixations as participants study images. These data will be used to calculate variables such as the number of saccades (eye movements) made and the percentage of time (within each trial) spent looking at each portion of an image. Data from individual trials will be averaged across trials within each learning condition. This will yield mean values per condition and participant.</description>
