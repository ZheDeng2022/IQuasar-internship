  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase I study, we will first demonstrate the safety of CAR20.19.22 T-cells expanded&#xD;
      with interleukin-7 (IL-7) and Interleukin-15 (IL-15) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL) / chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as means to achieve complete B-cell&#xD;
      ablation and limit relapse from antigen loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, interventional, open label, dose-finding treatment study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of IL-7/IL-15 manufactured CAR T-cells in adult patients&#xD;
      with B-cell malignancies that have failed prior therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an additional dose-expansion cohort of&#xD;
      up to 12 patients may be enrolled at that dose to further describe the safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR20.19.22 T-cells will be administered either fresh or thawed after cryopreservation by IV&#xD;
      injection. Patients will receive one of three dose levels of CAR20.19.22 T-cells based on our&#xD;
      dose escalation design.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects who have adequate T-cells as per eligibility criteria will be leukopheresed to obtain an mononuclear cells (MNC) apheresis product for CAR20.19.22 T- manufacturing. The apheresis product will be washed free of platelets and plasma and the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T-cells will be purified from the MNC, activated through the cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) and cluster of differentiation (CD28) antigens, then transduced with the CAR20.19.22 lentiviral vector. The cells will be expanded in vitro with interleukin-7 (IL-7) / interleukin-15 (IL-15), washed from culture, removed from the device, and either administered to the patient within 48 hours of production or cryopreserved for later administration.

&#xD;
        Special Criteria for regarding Fertility and Contraception:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche or women who&#xD;
        have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, i.e., who have had menses&#xD;
        within the preceding 24 months, or have not undergone a sterilization procedure&#xD;
        [hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy]) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
        test performed as part of eligibility criteria. Lactating women are eligible for this study&#xD;
        but will be asked to not provide breast milk to their child from Day -4 through Day +90&#xD;
        after CAR T-cell therapy. It is possible they may no longer be able to lactate after&#xD;
        receiving chemotherapy and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Due to the high-risk level of this study, while enrolled, all subjects must agree not to&#xD;
        participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to&#xD;
        impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization). Additionally, if participating in&#xD;
        sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the study subject must agree to use reliable&#xD;
        and double barrier methods of contraception during the follow-up period of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acceptable birth control includes a combination of two of the following methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intrauterine device (IUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal-based contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who are premenarche or have been&#xD;
        post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or have undergone hysterectomy tubal&#xD;
        ligation, salpingectomy, and/or bilateral oophorectomy or men who have documented&#xD;
        azoospermia) are eligible without requiring the use of contraception.&#xD;
