  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), i.e. the occurrence of troublesome symptoms or&#xD;
      lesions as a consequence of retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus, is one of&#xD;
      the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorders. Obesity, defined by a body mass index (BMI) of&#xD;
      ≥ 30 kg/m2, is an increasingly important problem in the Western world and a well-known risk&#xD;
      factor for GERD related symptoms and esophagitis. Possible underlying mechanisms include an&#xD;
      increased gastroesophageal pressure gradient, upward positional shift of the lower esophageal&#xD;
      sphincter (LES) and increased occurrence of transient LES relaxations (TLESRs) after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery has emerged as a highly effective treatment for obesity and its associated&#xD;
      metabolic complications. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) currently&#xD;
      account for the majority of the procedures. Several studies have reported improvement of GERD&#xD;
      after gastric bypass and SG, probably through a combination of reduction of the&#xD;
      acid-producing gastric mucosa and weight loss. However, in up to 34% of patients who&#xD;
      underwent SG, de novo GERD or worsening of pre-existent GERD becomes evident, which&#xD;
      established baseline GERD symptoms one of the few relative contra-indications for SG in many&#xD;
      centers. Several post-operative alterations have been hypothesized to explain the increased&#xD;
      incidence of GERD after SG: increased incidence of hiatal hernia due to the sleeve formation,&#xD;
      dissection of the phreno-esophageal ligament, intrathoracic sleeve migration, increased&#xD;
      intragastric pressure due to decreased gastric compliance and disruption of the competency of&#xD;
      the esophagogastric junction (EGJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the fact that the majority of patients will respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)&#xD;
      therapy, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience regurgitation and/or&#xD;
      heartburn despite acid suppression although treatment outcome data are largely missing in the&#xD;
      literature. These patients with refractory GERD symptoms after SG pose a challenge to&#xD;
      surgeons and gastroenterologists since the postoperative anatomy does not allow classic&#xD;
      fundoplication procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretta® (Mederi RF LLC, Houston TX, USA) is an endoscopic anti-reflux procedure using the&#xD;
      delivery of radiofrequency energy to the LES. Stretta® is supported by the Society of&#xD;
      American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES, ASGE and NICE) for the treatment of&#xD;
      GERD in selected patients and is long-term cost-effective. Several controlled studies and a&#xD;
      meta-analysis have reported improved symptoms after Stretta® although the effect on&#xD;
      esophageal acid exposure time is inconsistent. Stretta® decreases the compliance of the EGJ&#xD;
      without inducing fibrosis since the effect was reversed by administration of a nitric oxide&#xD;
      donor and decreased sensitivity to distal acid perfusion. However, studies evaluating the&#xD;
      symptomatic benefit of Stretta® in patients after SG are lacking, which is the primary goal&#xD;
      of our study (primary endpoint). With the secondary endpoints, the effect of Stretta® will&#xD;
      also be investigated on various aspects, which will provide an insight in the mechanism of&#xD;
      action behind the potential effect of the intervention.&#xD;
