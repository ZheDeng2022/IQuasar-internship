  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center prospective pilot study of PureWick used as a management for nocturia&#xD;
      and reduction of nighttime falls associated with going to the bathroom. Subjects are followed&#xD;
      up to 3 months after the intervention. As a pilot study, it is expected that a 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up will adequately capture urinary and sleep outcomes data and any adverse events&#xD;
      related or unrelated to the study device.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients at 3 months who have a demonstrated 50% or greater reduction in the number of nocturia episodes/night will be calculated via binomial proportions and an exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence interval will be computed to assess the precision of the obtained estimate.</description>

    <measure>Change in average number of nocturnal voids at baseline and at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used, as appropriate, to compare the average number of nocturnal voids between baseline and at 3 months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of scores on the N-QoL at baseline and at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>N-QoL (Nocturia quality of life) score is determined by the n-qol short form. The ICIQ-Nqol is a patient-completed questionnaire evaluating quality of life (QoL) in patients with nocturia for use in research and clinical practice across the world. The ICIQ-Nqol is the N-QoL adapted for use within the ICIQ structure and provides a detailed and robust measure to assess the impact of nocturia on quality of life with particular reference to the effects on patient' lives of Nocturia and can be used as an outcome measure to assess impact of different treatment modalities.&#xD;
0-52 overall score with greater values indicating increased impact on quality of life Bother scale not incorporated into overall score but indicate impact of symptoms overall for the patient.&#xD;
Similar analyses to paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be performed to compare scores on the N-QoL, an self-reported sleep quality between baseline and at 3-months.</description>

    <description>The PureWick Urine Collection System is intended for non-invasive urine output management. It pulls urine through tubing that is connected to a collection canister for proper disposal. It is designed to be used by patients, caregivers, or healthcare professionals in both home environments and professional care facilities.</description>
