  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacodynamic endpoint of percentage of subjects with suppressed estradiol level (less&#xD;
      than 20 pg/mL) on cycle day 29 is the primary endpoint of the study.&#xD;

      Objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine efficacy and pharmacodynamic effects of various dosing regimens of Ovarest®&#xD;
           (within the 60-mg - 120 mg daily dosing range) in women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine a minimally effective daily dosing regimen of Ovarest® with pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           effects at least comparable to the historical data for marketed Lupron Depot&#xD;
           formulations and for GnRH antagonists indicated for the treatment of endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate safety and tolerability of the long-term administration of leuprolide within&#xD;
           the targeted daily dosing range in women with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important goal of this study is to provide adequate dose-response data for the&#xD;
      suppression of estradiol (E2) levels below the menopausal threshold of 20 pg/mL. Results of&#xD;
      this study in conjunction of Enteris proprietary PK data will support further development of&#xD;
      Leuprolide Acetate Oral Tablet for the treatment of reproductive disorders, particularly&#xD;
      endometriosis. Another reason for this trial is to support a comparative evaluation of the PD&#xD;
      effects across the QD and BID regimens delivering the same overall dose of Ovarest&#xD;

    <description>The primary PD metric - suppression of E2 level (E2 &lt;20 pg/mL) - will be assessed at each on-treatment evaluation timepoint. E2 below 20 pg/mL at Day 29 is a primary endpoint for a given Treatment Cycle.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of vaginal (menstrual) bleeding days</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days of therapy and 14 days post study follow up</time_frame>

CPSSS values are derived from the Biberoglu and Behrman scale, with 5 components addressing dysmenorrhea (0-none and 3-severe), dyspareunia (0-none and 3-severe), non-menstrual pelvic pain (0-none and 3-severe), pelvic tenderness (0-none and 3-severe), and pelvic induration (0-none and 3-severe). In composite score (total symptom and sign severity score) 0 being none and 11-15 being very severe.</description>
