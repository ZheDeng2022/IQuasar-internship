  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study we extracted acoustic parameters using PRAAT from patient's attempt&#xD;
      to phonate during the clinical evaluation using a digital smart device. From these parameters&#xD;
      we attempted (1) to define which of the PRAAT acoustic features best help to discriminate&#xD;
      patients with dysphagia (2) to develop algorithms using sophisticated ML techniques that best&#xD;
      classify those i) with dysphagia and those ii ) at high risk of respiratory complications due&#xD;
      to poor cough force.&#xD;

      This study was prospective study, and patients who visited the department of rehabilitation&#xD;
      medicine in a single university-affiliated tertiary hospital with dysphagic symptoms from&#xD;
      September 2019 to March 2021 were included.Voice recording was performed at the enrollment&#xD;
      with blinded assessment, where the participants first visited the rehabilitation department&#xD;
      with chief complaints of dysphagia. The cough sounds were recorded with an iPad (Apple,&#xD;
      Cupertino, CA, USA) through an embedded microphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the acoustic files we extracted fourteen voice parameters that include the average value&#xD;
      and standard deviation of the fundamental frequency (f0), harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), the&#xD;
      jitter that refers to frequency instability, and the shimmer that represents the amplitude&#xD;
      instability of the sound signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Machine learning algorithms and sophisticated deep neural network analysis will be performed.&#xD;

A voice recorder application provided by Apple was used, and the sampling frequency of the sound was 44,100 Hz. The digitized cough sound signals were band-pass-filtered between 20 to 16,000 Hz to use data from the whole frequency band gathered by the iPad. In each case, the smart device was positioned 20cm from the patient</description>
