    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of Holour in patients&#xD;
      suffering from hypospadias treatment failure. Holour is intended for urethral replacement and&#xD;
      is made from ex vivo expanded autologous oral mucosal cells including stem cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Holour is a prospective, open-label, uncontrolled pilot clinical trial phase i/ii. The aim of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is to perform a tissue engineering therapy to assess the safety (at 3 and&#xD;
      12 months) and efficacy (at 12 months) of the autologous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria and will be&#xD;
      candidate for the treatment if all eligibility criteria are met. Up to 8 patients will be&#xD;
      treated by means of autologous cultured oral mucosa grafts containing oral mucosa stem cells.&#xD;
      Holour is produced by ex vivo expansion of cells obtained from oral mucosa biopsy collected&#xD;
      from patient. The biopsy will be processed in a laboratory of a regenerative medicine&#xD;
      manufacturing site where the epithelial cells will be isolated, expanded and prepared as&#xD;
      final graft to be implanted. Holour administration will be planned according to the&#xD;
      procedures and the need of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire procedure envisages the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral mucosa biopsy to manufacture autologous grafts of Holour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Penile urethroplasty in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First stage: application of holour on the wound bed prepared according to standard&#xD;
                surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Second stage: penis reconstruction according to standard surgical procedure. The&#xD;
                surgical procedures may be followed by a post-implantation treatment (if necessary)&#xD;
                with corticosteroids and antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment includes a single administration of Holour; in case of &quot;failure&quot; of the first&#xD;
      procedure eligible patients can undergo to a second implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after the transplantation, primary endpoint will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      investigator. The study completion will be reached when 1 year (secondary endpoint) of&#xD;
      follow-up after the last transplant in the last patient will be accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the trial is defined as the last visit of the last patient after the last&#xD;
      treatment if any.&#xD;

The biopsy will be processed in a laboratory of a regenerative medicine manufacturing site where the epithelial cells will be isolated, expanded and prepared as final graft to be implanted.&#xD;
The treatment for urethra reconstruction required a two stage urethroplasty:&#xD;
First stage: application of Holour on the wound bed prepared according to standard surgery The penis will be immobilized for some days after this operation.&#xD;
Second stage: surgical procedure for urethral tubularization and penile reconstruction according to standard surgical procedure.&#xD;
The surgical procedures may be followed by a post-implantation treatment (if necessary) with corticosteroids and antibiotics.</description>
