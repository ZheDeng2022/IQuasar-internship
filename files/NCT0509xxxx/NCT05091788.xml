      Prospective, up to 4 center study of the safety and efficacy of mechanical coring with&#xD;
      directional closure to achieve directional skin tightening intended to improve the appearance&#xD;
      of wrinkles of the face. Up to 45 subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      treated. All subjects will be monitored for a period 7, 30, and 90 days post treatment.&#xD;
