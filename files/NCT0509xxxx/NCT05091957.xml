      Living in poverty has a profound negative impact on parenting stress and children's health.&#xD;
      When poverty occurs early in childhood and continues for a long time, the impact on child&#xD;
      health can be lifelong. Child poverty is common, affecting about 20% of Canadian children.&#xD;
      Many low income families may not be receiving all the social benefits for which they are&#xD;
      eligible. There are calls for primary care providers to ask patients if they have difficulty&#xD;
      making ends meet at the end of the month and to intervene if poverty is identified, but it is&#xD;
      not known if intervening can improve parent's and children's health. This study will test&#xD;
      whether a Community Support Worker who helps families with young children navigate the social&#xD;
      service system by reviewing social needs (like food, housing or energy insecurity) and income&#xD;
      supports can lead to increased family income, reduced parenting stress and an improvement in&#xD;
      their child's health. The Community Support Worker will help families complete income tax,&#xD;
      apply for benefits and community supports for which they are eligible. The investigators will&#xD;
      also study the effect of this intervention on health care utilization. Our study will be&#xD;
      conducted in Toronto and Kingston in primary care practices participating in the TARGet Kids!&#xD;
      primary care research network. Results from this study will help health care providers and&#xD;
      policy makers understand whether Community Support Workers are an effective way to integrate&#xD;
      the health and social service systems to improve parent and child health.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Poverty and financial strain have profound and long-lasting&#xD;
      negative impacts on both parent and child health, contributing to substantial health&#xD;
      disparities. As the first contact with the health system for most families, primary care&#xD;
      providers are uniquely positioned to address child poverty in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many professional health organizations recommend that healthcare providers identify and&#xD;
      address social determinants of health, but there is little evidence regarding the impact of&#xD;
      effective interventions. Social systems are frequently complex and difficult to navigate; for&#xD;
      example, low income Canadians are known to have lower tax filing rates than the general&#xD;
      population. Therefore, many families may not be accessing all social benefits to which they&#xD;
      are entitled. The investigators propose to rigorously test a poverty reduction intervention&#xD;
      (navigation of financial supports) embedded in primary care using a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the impact on parent and child health outcomes. Results of our pilot study&#xD;
      demonstrated feasibility and will inform our proposed full trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Study Design: A multi-site, pragmatic, blinded, superiority, parallel-group&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Families of children ages (from birth to 2 years), screening positive for the&#xD;
      question &quot;Do you ever have difficulty making ends meet at the end of the month?&quot;, identified&#xD;
      as a good predictor of poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Active Comparator: Families will be randomly allocated to the intervention&#xD;
      or active comparator group. Parents in the intervention group will have a review of their&#xD;
      social needs and resources with a trained Community Service Worker (CSW) with a thorough&#xD;
      understanding of potential income supports and community agencies and will assist the parent&#xD;
      to access financially related social benefits for which they are eligible. All participants&#xD;
      will receive a written summary of available resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome, measured 6 months after enrollment, is parenting stress, as&#xD;
      measured by the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form. Secondary outcomes are change in: a)&#xD;
      self-reported after-tax household income; b) household food security; c) parent depression;&#xD;
      d) child development; e) child social, emotional and behavioural health; f) Community Service&#xD;
      Worker workload; g) health care utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEAM EXPERTISE: The study is a collaboration between TARGet Kids!, (a well-established&#xD;
      child-focused primary care practice-based research network) and integrated Knowledge Users&#xD;
      (parents, administrators and policy makers). The research team has expertise in child health,&#xD;
      pragmatic trials and social determinants of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED OUTCOME: Results from this research will address a critical evidence gap regarding a&#xD;
      feasible and scalable intervention to address child poverty in the primary care practice&#xD;
      setting. Leveraging primary preventive care in early childhood, which is accessed by almost&#xD;
      all families, will provide powerful opportunities for implementation. Effective interventions&#xD;
      to address child poverty and financial strain in clinical practice have the potential to&#xD;
      influence child health trajectories over their life course.&#xD;
