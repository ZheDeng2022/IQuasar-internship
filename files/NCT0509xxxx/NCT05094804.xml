    <textblock>
      This Phase 1-2 study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of OR2805, a fully human IgG1 antibody&#xD;
      that binds specifically to CD163, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study consists&#xD;
      of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A: a dose-escalation phase to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum&#xD;
           achievable dose and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OR2805 in a maximum of&#xD;
           approximately 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B: a monotherapy expansion phase of up to approximately 40 subjects in each of 4&#xD;
           select tumor types at the RP2D to determine preliminary anti-tumor activity and further&#xD;
           characterize safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part C: a mini-dose-escalation at 2 doses of OR2805 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
           followed by a combination expansion cohort of up to approximately 40 subjects in each of&#xD;
           2 tumor types to determine the safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of OR2805 in&#xD;
           combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part D: a biology cohort of up to approximately 20 subjects at the RP2D to determine&#xD;
           mechanism of action and potential predictors of response and pharmacodynamics in&#xD;
           subjects not eligible for either Part B or C.&#xD;
