  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer (NSCLC), a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or to other&#xD;
      parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#xD;
      are proteins that help cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the&#xD;
      building plans (genes) for these proteins in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal&#xD;
      EGFR and/or HER2. These abnormal proteins drive the growth and the spread of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several EGFR and/or HER2 mutations exist in the cancer cells. Two mutations observed in NSCLC&#xD;
      are called EGFR- or HER2exon20ins and EGFR C797X. The study treatment, BAY2927088, works by&#xD;
      blocking the mutated EGFR protein and also its ex20ins version which are present in NSCLC. It&#xD;
      is also believed to work against HER2 and HER2ex20ins mutations. Researchers think this may&#xD;
      help stop the further spread of NSCLC cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that researchers will study BAY2927088 in humans. In this study, the&#xD;
      researchers want to learn more about using BAY2927088 in participants who have NSCLC with&#xD;
      EGFR and/or HER2 mutations including EGFRex20ins and/or HER2ex20ins mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are to find for BAY2927088&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how safe BAY2927088 is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how BAY2927088 moves into, through and out of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the maximum amount of BAY2927088 that the participants can take without too many side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will also study the action of BAY2927088 against the cancer. This study will&#xD;
      have three parts. The first part will help find the most appropriate dose that can be given&#xD;
      in the third part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant of the first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one&#xD;
      specific dose group for BAY2927088. The amount of BAY2927088 that is given increases stepwise&#xD;
      from one group to the next.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of the second, so called Backfill part will be assigned any specific dose&#xD;
      that has already been tested during Part 1 and found to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of the third, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most&#xD;
      appropriate dose of BAY2927088 found in the first and second parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the participants will take the study treatment in 3 week periods called&#xD;
      &quot;cycles&quot;. They will in general take BAY2927088 once daily until their cancer gets worse,&#xD;
      until they have medical problems, until they leave the study or until the study is&#xD;
      terminated. Participants will have around 5 visits in each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the study team will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take regular CT or MRI scans to check if the participants' cancer has gotten better or&#xD;
           worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the participants' overall health and heart health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they&#xD;
           are having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep&#xD;
      track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse&#xD;
      events might be related to the study treatments.&#xD;
