  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation entails a pilot randomized controlled trial to explore whether a&#xD;
      stand-alone, alcohol-reduction, brief intervention (with a module on substance use and&#xD;
      depression) would be feasible, acceptable, and potentially efficacious within the context of&#xD;
      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool that can help prevent the&#xD;
      acquisition of HIV, its degree of effectiveness has been shown to be linked to a number of&#xD;
      key behaviors, including treatment adherence, attendance in follow-up care, and the&#xD;
      concurrent use of condoms. Hazardous alcohol consumption has the potential to contribute to&#xD;
      suboptimal PrEP adherence, poor retention in PrEP care, and condomless sex/sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STIs); and its impact on these PrEP-related behaviors may also become&#xD;
      exacerbated in the presence of concurrent issues such as substance use and depression, thus&#xD;
      reflecting a potential syndemic effect. The present investigation entails a pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in which 120 hazardous drinking, PrEP-prescribed men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM) will be randomly assigned to receive either a tablet-based, alcohol-reduction brief&#xD;
      intervention or treatment-as-usual. Participants assigned to the former condition for whom&#xD;
      substance use- and/or depression-related concerns are identified will additionally be&#xD;
      provided with links to relevant supportive resources. Feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention will be examined. Furthermore, biomarker testing and self-report electronic&#xD;
      surveys at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months will be employed to assess the preliminary impact&#xD;
      of the intervention on alcohol use, PrEP adherence, retention in PrEP care, and the&#xD;
      engagement in condomless sex/STI acquisition.&#xD;
