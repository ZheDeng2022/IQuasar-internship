    <measure>Mildness of the Facial Cleanser in Participants with Sensitive Skin Based on Investigator and Participant Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Mildness of the facial cleanser in participants with sensitive skin (eczema/atopic dermatitis, rosacea, acne, cosmetic intolerance syndrome) based on investigator and participant assessments will be reported. It will be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 4 with 0=none, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Assessment for Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator observed tolerability parameters such as: redness/erythema, rash/irritation, peeling/flaking, tactile roughness, and dryness which will be measured using a 5-point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Assessment for Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators observed efficacy parameters such as: visual smoothness, tactile softness, clarity, radiance, pores, and overall skin appearance which will be measured using a 5-point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Assessment for Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants observed tolerability parameters such as: stinging, burning, itching, tightness, redness, flaking/peeling, roughness, dryness and overall sensitivity which will be measured using a 5-point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</description>

    <measure>Participant Assessment for Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants observed efficacy parameters such as: smoothness, softness, clarity, radiance, pores and overall skin appearance which will be by using a 5-point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Photographic Imaging (Right, Left and Frontal Face with Standard Lighting 1 and Cross Polarized Light)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Photographic imaging (right, left and frontal face with standard lighting 1 and cross polarized light) will be obtained by using VISIA. Each participant's face will be imaged using the photographic imaging system prior to any product use. The imaging system takes a series of two high-resolution images that are captured sequentially in rapid succession to minimize panelist movement and maximize registration of images. Three sets of images will be taken - 45 degree left, 45 degree right, and center of the face.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-invasive Assessment: Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL measurements of defined target sites of face will be reported. A decrease in TEWL values reflects an improvement in the barrier properties of the skin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-invasive Assessment: Skin pH</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Skin pH measurements of defined target sites of the face will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-invasive Assessment: Skin Hydration Measured by Corneometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Skin hydration of defined target sites of face as measured by Corneometer will be reported. An increase in values reflects an improvement in the hydration of the skin.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-invasive Assessment: Biomarker Tapes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Three D-squame tape strips will be taken from a defined target site on the face. D-Squame Standard Sampling Discs (CuDerm Corporation, Dallas, N) will be used to non-invasively collect skin samples from the forehead. The discs are 2.2 centimeters (cm) in diameter and have a homogenous layer of a medical-grade adhesive, which safely removes stratum corneum components and provides optimum visibility of adhering corneocytes. Samples will be collected for the analysis of various skin biomarkers such as skin flakiness, as well as the integrity of the natural moisturizing factors (NMFs), ceramides, free fatty acids, cholesterol via biochemical assays.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-invasive Assessment: Facial Swabbing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>A swabbing technique will be used to collect surface skin microflora to determine the effect of the non-marketed cosmetic facial cleanser on the skin microflora.</description>
