      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two goals: (1) to identify parameters of interest in decision making in the&#xD;
      context of anxiety disorders, using theoretical models (2) and to identify neural correlates&#xD;
      of these parameters, using human neuroimaging in healthy volunteers (HV) and anxiety patients&#xD;
      (AD). Participants are asked to complete a decision-making task, namely the Multi-armed&#xD;
      Bandit Task. The study includes 2 arms: Clinic, Scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinic: Participants (HV and AD) are asked to fill out questionnaires and complete the&#xD;
           Multi-armed Bandit Task. An electric shock is used as the aversive stimulus. Monetary&#xD;
           reward is used as the reward stimulus. Additionally, physiological signals (Heart rate,&#xD;
           skin conductance activity, startle) are collected during the course of the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, in a pilot study, participants startle responses for varying shock&#xD;
           parameters are recorded and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Scanner: Participants (HV) are asked to fill out questionnaires and complete the&#xD;
           Multi-armed Bandit Task. An electric shock is used as the aversive stimulus. Monetary&#xD;
           reward is used as the reward stimulus. Additionally, physiological signals (Heart rate,&#xD;
           breathing rate) are collected during the course of the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to use theoretical models in healthy volunteers (HV)&#xD;
      and patients with an anxiety disorder (AD) to better understand how changes in anxiety are&#xD;
      associated with changes in decision making. The neural correlates of these decision-making&#xD;
      parameters will be identified using functional imaging. In addition, this study will&#xD;
      ascertain whether decision making parameters correlate with certain behavioral measures such&#xD;
      as trait and state anxiety using (i) questionnaires, (ii) physiological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is a significant difference in model derived parameters&#xD;
      between experimental manipulations (conditions) and/or population groups. The parameters of&#xD;
      interest include: 1) Learning Rate, 2) Exploration parameter, 3) Discount rate, 4) Loss&#xD;
      aversion, 5) Inverse Temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neural correlates of these decision-making parameters will be identified using functional&#xD;
      imaging parametric modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are a significant correlation between functions of model derived&#xD;
      parameters and behavioral and/or physiological measures of anxiety including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaire scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Startle&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Skin conductance&#xD;

      Electric shocks: Electric shocks are used as aversive stimuli. Electric shocks are one of the&#xD;
