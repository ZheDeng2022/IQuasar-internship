  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to explore mifepristone as an option for induction of labor at&#xD;
      term by evaluating the efficacy of mifepristone use for cervical preparation. Since the Labor&#xD;
      Induction versus Expectant Management in Low-Risk Nulliparous Women (ARRIVE) trial supporting&#xD;
      that elective induction after 39 weeks decreases cesarean sections and morbidity, rates of&#xD;
      elective term inductions are increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University specifically, approximately 40%&#xD;
      of spontaneous vaginal deliveries follow induction of labor, with an average induction time&#xD;
      of 20 hours. Previous studies have established the maternal and neonatal safety of&#xD;
      mifepristone in term inductions, however, this study will assess the difference in overall&#xD;
      time from induction to complete cervical dilation, delivery, and the total time on Labor and&#xD;
      Delivery.&#xD;
