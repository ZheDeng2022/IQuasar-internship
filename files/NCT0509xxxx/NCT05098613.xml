    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm phase 1/1b trial aims to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 chimeric antigen receptor-expressing (CAR) T cells (CD19x22 CAR T) in&#xD;
      adolescents and adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL).&#xD;
      Phase 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of CD19x22 CAR T cells using a standard 3+3&#xD;
      trial design. Phase 1b is an expansion phase designed to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      CD19x22 CAR T in CAR-treated and CAR-naïve patients.&#xD;

      Phase 1: To determine the safety and tolerability of infusing CD19x22 CAR T, generated using&#xD;
      a bicistronic vector, in adolescents and adults with R/R B-NHL, and to determine the Phase 1b&#xD;
      recommended dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b (expansion phase): To acquire additional evidence of safety and efficacy of-CD19x22&#xD;
      CAR T infusion in CAR-treated and CAR-naïve R/R B-NHL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives for all subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 1b include: 1) Feasibility of&#xD;
      manufacturing and infusion, 2) Safety of infusion and 3) Efficacy: Descriptive&#xD;
      characterization of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) at Day +90. As well, progression-free survival (PFS), overall&#xD;
      survival (OS), duration of remission (DOR) and overall response rate (ORR) will be&#xD;
      determined. Efficacy will be descriptively stratified based on prior receipt of CAR-T cell&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
