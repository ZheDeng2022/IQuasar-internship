  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia (SA) is the most preferred method of anesthesia in cesarean deliveries&#xD;
      because it eliminates the potential risks associated with airway management in pregnant&#xD;
      women. Spinal anesthesia poses a risk of hypotension with an incidence of approximately 70%,&#xD;
      resulting from decreased vascular tone due to sympathetic block. Hypotension can cause&#xD;
      dizziness in the mother, nausea and vomiting, and acidosis in the fetus. Therefore, the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of postspinal hypotension has been an important area of research in&#xD;
      obstetric anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Perfusion Index (PI) is the ratio of pulsatile blood flow (arterial chamber) to&#xD;
      non-pulsatile static blood flow (venous and capillaries) in a patient's peripheral tissue,&#xD;
      such as the fingertip, toe, or earlobe. This can be obtained from a pulse oximeter. This is&#xD;
      non-invasive and continuous monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse variability index (PVI) represents changes in PI that occur during one or more&#xD;
      complete respiratory cycles. PVI is found by calculating over PI changes. Allows evaluation&#xD;
      of intravascular volume; and a higher PVI is associated with greater responsiveness to fluid&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our work; We will simultaneously observe PI and PVI changes in the lower and upper&#xD;
      extremities in the study group patients. When we look at the previous studies; we see that&#xD;
      the parameters (PI and PVI) that we will look at are evaluated with different combinations in&#xD;
      our study group patients. When we look at these studies again; We saw that contradictory&#xD;
      results were obtained for the same parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, patients will be verbally informed in detail about the study in the&#xD;
      preoperative period and their consent will be obtained. While the patients are taken to the&#xD;
      operating room and monitored, the saturation probe will be connected to the 2nd finger of the&#xD;
      upper and lower extremities of the patients, and the PI and PVI values in both extremities&#xD;
      will be measured simultaneously. PI and PVI values and vital values (SAB, MAP, HR, SPO2) in&#xD;
      both extremities before spinal anesthesia; intraoperative SAP, MAP, HR, SPO2, ephedrine&#xD;
      requirement, atropine requirement and PI and PVI values in both extremities will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result; In our study, we aimed to observe simultaneous changes in PI and PVI in the&#xD;
      lower and upper extremities in pregnant patients who will undergo cesarean section under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia, which is our study group.&#xD;
