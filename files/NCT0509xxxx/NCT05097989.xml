  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of&#xD;
      ALXN2050 in addition to background therapy consistent with the standard of care in adult&#xD;
      participants (≥ 18 to ≤ 75 years of age) with either LN or IgAN. The study will consist of an&#xD;
      up to 6-week Screening Period, a 26-week blinded Initial Evaluation Period, a 24-week blinded&#xD;
      Extended Treatment Period, and an Open-label Extension (OLE) Period of up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
