  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procenta® has been successful in facilitating closure of non-healing diabetic ulcers in&#xD;
      patients where proper wound care management/practice has failed along with other allo- and&#xD;
      xenografts. In each individual case study where diabetes mellitus was pathological, unique&#xD;
      wound morphologies with high variability in all three dimensions showed significant progress&#xD;
      or were fully closed after at least one application of Procenta®. In the present study, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to investigate the efficacy of the product over a 90-day treatment&#xD;
      time-course with a larger sample size of patients suffering from non-healing wounds due to&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus types I or II (diabetes mellitus). As a result, the investigators hope to&#xD;
      better understand the potential and limitations of the product under these conditions with&#xD;
      the anticipation that a significant number of patients will recover, avoid amputation, and&#xD;
      return to a normal daily life.&#xD;

      Study Design Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential candidates are diabetes mellitus type I or II patients with ulcers on the foot and&#xD;
      ankle with no-to-minimal associated co-morbidities, regardless of age. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate the patient pool is likely to be in the range of 60-95 years of age. For this&#xD;
      study, patients must have failed previous treatments which are in accordance with proper&#xD;
      wound management practices and are considered to be typical applications/regiments. Patient's&#xD;
      eligible for the current study should be candidates for amputation and failed traditional&#xD;
      wound care practices and treatment alternatives. Diabetic ulcers of the foot and ankle should&#xD;
      have a minimum surface area of 0.5cm2 and a maximum of 10.0 cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting selection criteria should be consulted regarding the application of&#xD;
      Procenta® as an alternative to other treatments and/to surgeries. Once properly advised, the&#xD;
      patient enrollment will begin with the execution of the Research Informed Consent Document&#xD;
      from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the document, Informed Consent for Use of&#xD;
      Procenta® for VAWNY072020PRODFU (IRB693) for the study. When scheduled for Procenta®&#xD;
      application, the physician will complete form, Initial Application Form for VAWNY072020PRODFU&#xD;
      (IRB692.F02), where the condition of the ulcer and procedure data will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of one unit of the tissue allograft Procenta® (Catalog # 001050, 200mg) per&#xD;
      ≤2.5cm2 ulcer surface area will be the protocol standard. Up to 4 units may be applied to a&#xD;
      wound within the range described at each office visit and should fill ≥70% of the wound&#xD;
      volume. The study will enroll 10 patients, where Procenta® is applied up to once every 7 days&#xD;
      over a 12-week time-course. Data will be collected in the form of physician reporting during&#xD;
      the initial application and at each follow-up visit on forms, Initial Application Form for&#xD;
      VAWNY072020PRODFU (IRB692.F02) and Week (1-12) Follow-Up Form for VAWNY072020PRODFU&#xD;
      (IRB692.F03). The patient will also be required to report on their quality of life at each&#xD;
      follow-up on the Quality of Life Questionnaire for VAWNY072020PRODFU (IRB692.F04) and Foot&#xD;
      and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) at the time of enrollment and at the end of the study&#xD;
      period. Patients must agree to a 90-day treatment period, as well as a standard 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
