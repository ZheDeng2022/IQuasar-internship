  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hippocampal-avoidance whole brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT) limits radiation dose to the&#xD;
      hippocampal-avoidance region while still delivering therapeutic doses of radiation to the&#xD;
      whole brain. When used in addition to prophylactic memantine, this technique has been shown&#xD;
      to better preserve cognitive function in patients with brain metastases outside of the&#xD;
      hippocampal-avoidance region with no difference in intracranial progression-free and overall&#xD;
      survival. However, HA-WBRT requires considerably longer planning time when compared to&#xD;
      conventional WBRT (5-10 business days, compared to next-day), and studies have shown that&#xD;
      brain metastases can grow in as rapidly as one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proposed solution for quicker initiation of HA-WBRT is the use of simulation-free radiation&#xD;
      treatment planning, in which pre-existing diagnostic images are used to generate the&#xD;
      radiation treatment plan (as opposed to acquiring planning-specific image sets). This will be&#xD;
      paired with the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted semi-automated planning using&#xD;
      the FDA-approved treatment planning system called Ethos Therapy. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed an institutional HA-WBRT auto-planning template, which has been retrospectively&#xD;
      validated for the creation of plans that are compliant with the gold standard NRG Oncology&#xD;
      CC001 clinical trial and are dosimetrically comparable to traditional HA-WBRT plans.&#xD;
      Semi-automated plans will be constructed using diagnostic imaging, which will be refined as&#xD;
      needed (adjustments for difference in gross head positioning between diagnostic imaging and&#xD;
      radiation treatment positioning, etc.) while the patient is on the treatment table at&#xD;
      fraction one using adaptive radiation planning. Adaptive radiotherapy is standard-of-care&#xD;
      practice for other disease sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of a simulation-free&#xD;
      workflow for HA-WBRT that is AI-assisted and semi-automated.&#xD;

    <description>-Success will be defined as HA-WBRT plan creation and delivery of fraction 1 using the simulation-free study workflow in one on-table attempt, without having to resort to use of a backup, simulation-based plan in at least 70% of treated patients. Unsuccessful planning and workflow delivery will be defined as multiple attempts for sim-free planning and on-table delivery without creation of a plan meeting planning constraints such that the study workflow is abandoned and a traditional simulation-based planning workflow is used instead.</description>

          -  Patients may have had prior therapy for brain metastasis, including radiosurgery,&#xD;
             prior whole brain RT, and surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of a contrast-enhanced brain MRI performed ≤21 days prior to study&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50&#xD;
&#xD;

             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry. If pregnancy test is not clinically&#xD;
             indicated as determined by treating physician or protocol principal investigator (PI),&#xD;
             documentation of this exception is sufficient in lieu of a pregnancy test.&#xD;
