  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is the 6th most common cancer worldwide with an annual&#xD;
      incidence of 12000 cases in the UK alone. More than 60% of cases are diagnosed at the locally&#xD;
      advanced stage. These patients are treated with radical intent, using a combination of&#xD;
      surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Unfortunately 5 in 10 patients relapse within 2&#xD;
      years, with most relapses occurring within the first year since treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike many other solid tumours, 80% of relapses occur locoregionally. Salvage surgery offers&#xD;
      the best chance of long-term survival for patients with loco-regional recurrence, but this is&#xD;
      only possible if the recurrence is amenable to resection. Salvage surgery has been estimated&#xD;
      to improve survival outcomes in relapsed cancer by up to 73%. For salvage surgery to be&#xD;
      feasible, relapses need to be detected early. Current surveillance strategies have little&#xD;
      evidence base, with imaging often driven by clinical symptoms - often when the recurrence is&#xD;
      no longer amenable to salvage surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, we will address the unmet clinical need to develop a risk-stratified&#xD;
      surveillance pathway to enhance detection of early relapse of radically treated head and neck&#xD;
      cancer. At present, tumour grade and biomarkers such as HPV status have offered important but&#xD;
      insufficient information to guide surveillance strategies.&#xD;

      AIMS: We hypothesise that risk of relapse relies on a dynamic interplay between the immune&#xD;
      profile, tumour microenvironment, genetic signature and clinicopathological characteristics&#xD;
      of the participant receiving treatment. Based on the recruitment of 200 participants within&#xD;
      the study, we aim to generate sufficient evidence to guide a multi-analyte-based stratified&#xD;
      imaging surveillance/follow up strategy to detect early relapse of cancer and improve&#xD;
      survival. We will also develop a biorepository of data across a range of modalities to guide&#xD;
      individualised treatment by precision medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to develop and validate a multimodal signature to&#xD;
      risk-stratify participants with radically treated head and neck cancer into different&#xD;
      surveillance pathways. Non-invasive methods of surveillance, such as blood and saliva tests,&#xD;
      will be used to monitor for relapse, with any abnormalities triggering imaging. This will&#xD;
      facilitate early detection of relapse and facilitate salvage surgery, leading to better&#xD;
      survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study of participants with newly diagnosed locally&#xD;
      advanced HPV negative head and neck cancer, deemed to be intermediate or high risk (Figure&#xD;
      2A), referred to secondary care for radical treatment.&#xD;
