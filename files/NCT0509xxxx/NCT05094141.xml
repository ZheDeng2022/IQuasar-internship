  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to utilize the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety scale&#xD;
      (mYPAS), a validated preoperative/procedural anxiety score, to measure preoperative anxiety&#xD;
      via distraction in pediatric oncology patients undergoing port access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that using Virtual Reality (VR) will objectively decrease anxiety scores&#xD;
      measured by mYPAS by five percent (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be the parents or the legally authorized representative (LAR)&#xD;
      subjective reports of anxiety with the use of VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kind VR device is used in house at Children's Health in the Dallas and Plano campuses.&#xD;
      The VR device used in this study qualifies as exempt from FDA IDE regulations. It is a&#xD;
      non-significant risk, non-invasive, interactive video device the user wears like goggles. The&#xD;
      study carries minimal risks to the subjects and is designed to minimize patient discomfort&#xD;
      from placement or motion sickness. Furthermore, the device has disposable covers for&#xD;
      protection against infection and can be sanitized between uses, once the disposable covers&#xD;
      are removed. Children's Health System of Texas (CHST) and this research group are not&#xD;
      partnering entities with the Kind VR, and the Kind VR device is not being studied. The effect&#xD;
      of virtual reality (VR) on preprocedural anxiety as measured by questionnaires and the&#xD;
      observations of the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) is being studied&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients coming to the Clinic of Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) are under chronic&#xD;
      care for their ongoing disease and are likely to be coming to the CCBD at least twice in a&#xD;
      6-month period. The CCBD schedule will be reviewed by the researchers for patients age 5-12,&#xD;
      requiring port access at least twice during the next six-month period. Patient families whose&#xD;
      child meets the basic screening criteria, and have no exclusion criteria, will be approached&#xD;
      privately as possible participants in the study. Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled over a&#xD;
      2-year period. Once the subject/parent or LAR agrees to participate, study staff will&#xD;
      randomize the subjects into which standard of care distraction method for anxiety management&#xD;
      they will receive first in this study.&#xD;
