  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with acute COVID-19 (Coronavirus 19) recover within weeks, however a&#xD;
      significant number of individuals will develop the post-acute COVID 19 syndrome (PASC). As of&#xD;
      July 2021, the post COVID syndrome qualifies as a disability under the Americans with&#xD;
      Disabilities Act. The symptoms which comprise this condition are highly variable and often&#xD;
      extraordinarily debilitating. They may be distinct from the initial presentation or may mimic&#xD;
      those which defined the initial infection. The post COVID syndrome can be diagnosed when&#xD;
      symptoms persist longer than 3 months and may extend to beyond one year. There are risks for&#xD;
      permanent levels of disability. Patients who seemingly did not have active COVID-19 symptoms&#xD;
      in the days following infectious exposure may also develop post Covid syndromes. These&#xD;
      syndromes are considered to constitute a distinct clinical entity which has of yet no clearly&#xD;
      defined pathogenic mechanism or validated treatment algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International investigative efforts are now underway to determine who might develop the post&#xD;
      COVID syndrome, it's long term consequences and how best to treat its many problematic&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the long Covid syndrome or PASC is a well recognized syndrome, its pathogenesis is&#xD;
      poorly understood. Hypotheses have included persistent viral remnants with consequent&#xD;
      provocation of the generalized symptoms characteristic of systemic inflammation. The virus&#xD;
      may continue to infect heart, lung or neurologic tissue rendering various organs&#xD;
      dysfunctional. Alternatively there could be persistently infected or damaged endothelial&#xD;
      cells which line blood vessels and thereby create perturbations of blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The altered blood flow might then explain the many reported symptoms. However the&#xD;
      pathogenesis can be distinguished and studied independently from the physiological&#xD;
      disturbance. Existing and accepted therapies for tachycardia and shortness of breath,&#xD;
      although they might not reverse the virus caused injury, could be used to reduce the&#xD;
      resultant physiologic abnormalities which in turn produce the symptoms of the long Covid&#xD;
      syndrome. Beta blockers are standard therapies in sinus tachycardias, (1,2) and postural&#xD;
      orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (3,4) which are often characterized by high levels of&#xD;
      sympathetic drive which beta blockers are designed to modulate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus it is reasonable to hypothesize that that treatment with beta blockers may be an&#xD;
      effective intervention as Covid-19 directly infects the nerve and vascular tissues which&#xD;
      regulate sympathetic excess which in turn may produce the cardiovascular symptoms of PASC.&#xD;
      Moreover it is important to specifically study beta blockers in PASC because they are&#xD;
      currently actively in use for this indication. Yet the possibility remains that although the&#xD;
      symptoms are similar to those in which beta blockers have been effective, the pathologic&#xD;
      processes in PASC will not be responsive to beta blocker therapy. If this were to be true,&#xD;
      beta blockers would prove ineffective and might carry a risk of harm. Equally as important is&#xD;
      to properly determine the effective dose as the therapeutic window for these agents is wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metoprolol which is a widely used agent in cardiovascular disease is approved in doses&#xD;
      ranging from 25 to 400 mg per day. The proposed study will compare 6 minute walk distances&#xD;
      (pre and post the treatment), the echocardiographic measurement of the impact of sympathetic&#xD;
      excess on the heart's ability to empty effectively and a quality of life survey. Each of&#xD;
      these study elements will be measured before and after progressively increased doses of beta&#xD;
      blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is thus designed to study two issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether beta blockers which have been utilized to treat tachycardias, POTS (postural&#xD;
           orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), and hypertension will have similar effectiveness in&#xD;
           PASC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine appropriate dosing which may be different than those used on non PASC&#xD;
           conditions.&#xD;
