      The study aims to determine the proportion of patients diagnosed with dry eye by the Asia Dry&#xD;
      Eye Society (ADES) criteria, among patients diagnosed with dry eye disease under current&#xD;
      hospital-based practice in Taiwan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This real-world, observational study aims to show in a descriptive manner to characterize the&#xD;
      patient profile of dry eye disease in Taiwan, and to understand the local practice and its&#xD;
      difference compared with Asia Dry Eye Society (ADES) criteria. Specific objectives&#xD;
      include:(1) to determine the proportion of patients diagnosed with dry eye by the Asia Dry&#xD;
      Eye Society (ADES) criteria, among patients diagnosed with dry eye disease under current&#xD;
      hospital-based practice in Taiwan, (2) to compare the patient profile including ocular&#xD;
      condition and dry eye-related characteristics of dry eye diagnosed with ADES criteria versus&#xD;
      hospital-based real-world practice in Taiwan, and (3) to determine the disease&#xD;
      characteristics of patients diagnosed with dry eye in Taiwan medical institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients who are diagnosed with dry eye, aged 20 years (inclusive),&#xD;
      and are willing to provide signed informed consent. These patients will be categorized into&#xD;
      Group I or II according to the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data of eligible patients at the time of dry eye diagnosis on medical charts will be&#xD;
      collected. If any return visit is scheduled per routine practice before the end of data&#xD;
      collection (Apr-30-2022), follow-up data regarding dry eye evaluations and treatments will be&#xD;
      collected at the first follow-up visit for Group I; and within 6 months after the cataract&#xD;
      surgery for Group II.&#xD;
