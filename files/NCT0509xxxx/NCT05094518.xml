  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of mobile phone based appointment&#xD;
      reminder notifications sent through Health Recording App (HERA) in increasing the uptake of 4&#xD;
      World Health Organization recommended prenatal visits among Syrian refugee population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: 12 million Syrians have been forcibly displaced from their homes since the start&#xD;
      of Syrian Civil War in 2011. Despite Turkey providing free healthcare services through&#xD;
      national insurance to nearly 4 million refugees that it hosts, pregnant Syrian women are less&#xD;
      likely to attend prenatal visits and more likely to die during and after labor. An increase&#xD;
      in the uptake of prenatal care may improve quality of life through healthy pregnancies and&#xD;
      safer labor conditions in this population with double vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile phone-based reminders have been shown in randomized controlled trials and systematic&#xD;
      reviews to increase the uptake of various services, including prenatal care. Mobile phone&#xD;
      penetration is high among Syrian refugees in Turkey and qualitative studies demonstrate that&#xD;
      mobile health interventions are acceptable and feasible for Syrian refugees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the impact of mobile phone-based reminders on the uptake of&#xD;
      prenatal care among pregnant Syrian refugee women. More specifically, the study assesses the&#xD;
      effectiveness of mobile phone-based reminders by measuring the percent increase in the number&#xD;
      of prenatal appointments attended by intervention arm participants compared to the control&#xD;
      arm participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a behavioral intervention study using an un-blinded, parallel groups,&#xD;
      randomized controlled study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the number of medical visits, following the initial&#xD;
      baseline prenatal care visit, over the 6 month period prior to childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are based on the Sociodemographic and Health History form. The form&#xD;
      gathers information about demographics of the participants (age, education, employment,&#xD;
      marital status, number of children) and health history (previous pregnancies, delivery&#xD;
      methods, miscarriages, stillborn, chronic conditions and medications. We will further examine&#xD;
      these risk factors on the number of medical visits during the study period.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will fill the sociodemographic and health history form. Participants will receive reminders in the form of push notifications for prenatal checkup dates automatically generated according to their pregnancy start data or initial check-up appointment for 6 months. Reminders will be sent at the following intervals: 1) 2 weeks before the appointment, 2) 1 day before the appointment, and 3) on the day of appointment. After this date, participants will receive push notifications asking whether they went to the appointment or not weekly for 1 month. This reminder algorithm will be used for each prenatal checkup for a total of four appointments: once in first trimester, once in second trimester and two in third trimester, using the World Health Organization and Turkish Ministry of Health prenatal checkup calendar. At the end of 6 months of follow up period, participants will be contacted via phone call to ask for any remaining appointments or unanswered notifications.</description>
