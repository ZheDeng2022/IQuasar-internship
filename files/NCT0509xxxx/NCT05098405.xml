  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new experimental therapy, MP0317, a DARPin® drug candidate&#xD;
      targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and CD40. Preclinical studies suggest that&#xD;
      MP0317 may provide benefit for the treatment of tumors known to express high levels of FAP&#xD;
      and for which approved therapies have been exhausted. This is the first study of MP0317 in&#xD;
      humans and its main purpose is to test its safety and tolerability in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. This study will also examine the blood levels of MP0317 at several increasing&#xD;
      dose levels and a recommended dose for further development will be determined. The&#xD;
      recommended dose will be tested in a second part of the study to confirm safety and to&#xD;
      further assess the preliminary biologic and anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
