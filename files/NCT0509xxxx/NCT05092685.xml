  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is an inherited metabolic liver disease which&#xD;
      means that the body cannot maintain normal levels of ammonia. Ammonia levels can rise (called&#xD;
      hyperammonaemic decompensations) which can be life-threatening and may result in impaired&#xD;
      neurological development in children. OTCD is a rare genetic disorder characterised by&#xD;
      complete or partial lack of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OTC is a key element of the urea cycle, which is how the liver breaks down and removes extra&#xD;
      nitrogen from the body. For people with OTCD the extra nitrogen builds up in the form of&#xD;
      excess ammonia (hyperammonemia) in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ammonia is toxic and people with OTCD suffer 'hyperammonaemic decompensations' when ammonia&#xD;
      levels in the blood rise too high. The symptoms of these hyperammonaemic decompensations&#xD;
      include vomiting, impaired movement, and progressive lethargy. If left untreated these&#xD;
      hyperammonaemic decompensations may result in life-threatening complications or coma. OTCD is&#xD;
      managed with drugs that reduce the amount of ammonia in the blood (ammonia-scavenging drugs)&#xD;
      and a low protein diet. However, sometimes hyperammonaemic decompensations still occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver transplants for people with OTCD can be life-saving but there may be a long wait for a&#xD;
      suitable liver and neurological damage may occur before a liver transplant is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HORACE study is testing a new gene therapy (AAVLK03hOTC) which specifically targets the&#xD;
      liver so that it can start making OTC. The investigators hope that a single injection of gene&#xD;
      therapy for children with OTCD could help the liver work normally and reduce hyperammonaemic&#xD;
      decompensations and their associated risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This gene-therapy treatment could serve as a 'bridge-to-transplant' where children could grow&#xD;
      up in a metabolically stable condition until a liver transplant is possible. This could&#xD;
      minimise longer-term neurological damage caused by hyperammonaemic decompensations.&#xD;

             severe (≥ grade 3) functional organ impairment (liver, kidney, respiratory) according&#xD;
             to CTCAE v5.0. For neurological symptoms considered as sequelae of previous&#xD;
             hyperammonaemic decompensation and which are considered as stable (i.e. not evolving),&#xD;
             a grade 3 will be acceptable. Grade 4 and 5 will preclude inclusion.&#xD;
