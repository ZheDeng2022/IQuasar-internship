    <textblock>
      Chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide and is characterized by multilevel disease, often involving the tibiopedal vessels&#xD;
      . CLTI is an undesirable clinical consequence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) . It&#xD;
      affected âˆ¼8 million people in the USA and affects 12-20% of American people aged more than 65&#xD;
      years. Within 1 year of diagnosis, 25% of those patients progress to a major amputation and&#xD;
      the other 25% die due to co-morbid conditions&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Revascularization is the cornerstone of Chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) treatment&#xD;
      for lower limb preservation . Endovascular revascularization is the favored approach in many&#xD;
      centers because of its lower morbidity and mortality than open surgery . In a subset of&#xD;
      patients with Chronic limb threatening ischemia, particularly in longstanding type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      patients, a predominance of disease involving the pedal vessels can exist with relative&#xD;
      sparing of the tibial vessels .The pedal arch describes the connection between the anterior&#xD;
      and posterior circulation in the foot, this typically runs from the lateral plantar artery&#xD;
      into the dorsalis pedis and represents the final arcade of outflow for the lower extremity&#xD;
      vasculature . Secondary or &quot;deep&quot; pedal plantar loops connecting the medial and lateral&#xD;
      tarsal arteries to the medial and lateral plantar arteries can also exist . A strong&#xD;
      understanding of the pedal arch anatomy and its multiple connections is important for the&#xD;
      physician performing not only pedal arch interventions, but tibial interventions as well .&#xD;
      Familiarity with the arch anatomy increases procedural success rates in tibial intervention,&#xD;
      as it gives the operator another collateral pathway to approach the target occlusion in a&#xD;
      retrograde fashion . An intact pedal arch has been associated with improved wound healing, as&#xD;
      well as a higher patency rate for bypass grafting and percutaneous interventions for inflow&#xD;
      disease . An Angio some-directed revascularization strategy, however, has clearly been shown&#xD;
      to improve wound healing and limb salvage rates in both surgical and endovascular series .&#xD;
      Pedal arch intervention should therefore be considered in patients with advanced tissue loss,&#xD;
      with a goal of restoring inline flow to the corresponding angiosomes, this could mean the&#xD;
      difference between a major and minor amputation, as the options for these patients are&#xD;
      limited and major amputation rates are high .&#xD;

        The calculation was done using confidence interval 98 % giving a total sample size 28.&#xD;
        According to the equation for sample size for prospective study design, prevalence of&#xD;
        chronic limb threatening ischemia was 1.3 % of total population attending the Vascular&#xD;
        Surgery Department [2]. Raising the sample size will be done up to 35 to compensate for&#xD;
        dropout and refusal.&#xD;
