  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot randomized controlled trial aims to assess effects of a guided online acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed stroke survivors compared to the&#xD;
      care-as-usual control group. A total of 24 stroke survivors who meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention group or the control group.&#xD;
      Exploratory hypotheses are that the ACT group will show improvements in mental health&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress), and ACT processes (e.g.,&#xD;
      psychological flexibility/acceptance) at posttest and 2-month follow-up, compared to the&#xD;
      care-as-usual control group. Also, the project will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment,&#xD;
      adherence, and retention of participants and explore participants' experiences in the ACT&#xD;
      intervention through semi-structured interviews at posttest.&#xD;

      This pilot randomized controlled trial aims to assess effects of a coach-guided individual&#xD;
      online acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed stroke survivors&#xD;
      compared to the care-as-usual control group. A total of 24 stroke survivors who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention group or the&#xD;
      control group. The intervention group will receive individual ACT sessions guided by a&#xD;
      trained coach for one hour per week over 6 weeks through Zoom videoconferencing. Also, a&#xD;
      one-time 1-hour booster session will be provided at 1-month follow-up to facilitate the&#xD;
      maintenance of treatment effects. All ACT sessions will be delivered by our ACT coach, a&#xD;
      licensed professional counselor (LPC) with substantial clinical experiences and expertise in&#xD;
      ACT. Participants assigned to the control group will receive care as usual during the study&#xD;
      period. Outcomes regarding mental health and ACT processes will be collected at three time&#xD;
      points (i.e., pretest, posttest, and 2-month follow-up) and compared between groups over&#xD;
      time. Mental health outcomes and ACT processes will be measured using self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires. A 30-minute individual interview also will be conducted for participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group through Zoom videoconferencing to explore participants' experiences in&#xD;
      the ACT intervention. The participant demographic information form will be asked to complete&#xD;
      at pretest only, asking participants' information such as age, gender, ethnicity/race, level&#xD;
      of education, marital status, employment status, and time since stroke.&#xD;
