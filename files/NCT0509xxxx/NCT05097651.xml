  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will obtain preliminary information about whether, and at what dose, cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD) may help with insomnia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The&#xD;
      study will be a 5-week randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled phase II trial using daily&#xD;
      oral CBD doses between 50mg and 600mg. Sleep problems will be measured using a wrist-worn&#xD;
      device and by self-report. Performance on tests of thinking skills will be compared before&#xD;
      and after CBD/placebo treatment. Positive study results will provide support for the use of&#xD;
      CBD as a potential treatment for insomnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are highly prevalent in people with HIV, and traditional treatment with&#xD;
      sedative/hypnotic medications can compound neurocognitive dysfunction. A treatment option&#xD;
      without cognitive side effects would be highly desirable for use with this vulnerable&#xD;
      population. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid component of the marijuana plant that is&#xD;
      considered devoid of euphoriant or other psychoactive properties. A small literature&#xD;
      demonstrates a broad range of CBD doses at which sleepiness is reported to occur, and also&#xD;
      not occur, which indicates the need for controlled studies to ascertain the lowest&#xD;
      efficacious dose, as well as the sustainability of effects over a period of repeated use. The&#xD;
      proposed clinical trial will seek to 1) Ascertain the dose range of CBD that is useful in&#xD;
      managing symptoms of insomnia and improving sleep quality, and 2) determine whether CBD use&#xD;
      has any next-morning cognitive sequelae measured objectively with a neuropsychological test&#xD;
      battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed five-week clinical trial, investigators will use a liquid solution that is&#xD;
      100 mg/mL of CBD formed from semi synthetic CBD powder suspended in sesame oil. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into either a CBD or Placebo group. At the baseline visit,&#xD;
      participants will be fitted with a wrist-worn actigraph to measure activity and light&#xD;
      exposure, which they were wear for 5 weeks to estimate their rest/ activity cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 7-day baseline period, participants will be instructed to take 50mg of CBD/placebo to&#xD;
      begin the titration phase. They will slowly increase their daily dose by 50mg/day until they&#xD;
      achieve relief from symptoms of insomnia. This includes the option to remain on the minimum&#xD;
      study dose of 50 mg daily to a maximum medication limit of 600 mg daily. Participants will&#xD;
      return weekly to monitor vital signs, download actigraphy data, and receive the next&#xD;
      allotment of study medication. Clinical labs, self-reported sleep, fatigue, and mood, as well&#xD;
      neuropsychological test performance will be be measured at baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      medication maintenance phase. Participants will also be instructed to use a daily diary to&#xD;
      record sleep and other health related items, as well as adherence to the study regimen for&#xD;
      the duration of the study.&#xD;
