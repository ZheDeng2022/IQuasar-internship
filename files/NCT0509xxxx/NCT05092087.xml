      This study aims to investigate the frequency of personalized nutrition counseling's effect on&#xD;
      individual cardiovascular risk factors. The study collected 110 to 150 cases data, including&#xD;
      a regular blood test, blood glucose, blood lipid, liver panel, and inflammatory factors. The&#xD;
      enrolled cases were classified into two groups according to the subjects' duration of&#xD;
      consultation: those who completed the consultation and subsequent tests in &gt;24 weeks were in&#xD;
      the control group, whereas those who completed the consultation and subsequent tests in &lt;24&#xD;
      weeks were in the test group. The effectiveness of nutrition consultation toward managing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors and its correlation with the subjects' frequency of&#xD;
      following the consultations was analyzed using the pre- and post-consultation data. It was&#xD;
      found that personalized nutrition consultation significantly improved the subjects' risk&#xD;
      factors of cardiovascular diseases, and that the treatment group showed a greater improvement&#xD;
      than the control group which who require over 24 weeks to complete all consultation sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most of interventional studies on nutrition consultation have generally emphasized on the&#xD;
      extent to which the diet composition can prevent chronic diseases or provide improvement.&#xD;
      Although dietitians play an important role in health education for the primary prevention of&#xD;
      chronic disease, their individuals dietary consultation results are mostly focused on weight&#xD;
      loss and blood glucose control. However, the effectiveness of nutrition consultation on the&#xD;
      prevention of chronic diseases, such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, has few been studied. The effectiveness of dietary instructions provided to&#xD;
      individuals by dietitians in primary health care institutes is yet to be validated with&#xD;
      significant evidence. In addition, nutrition consultation methods, processes, and influencing&#xD;
      factors on its results are seldom discussed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      frequency of personalized nutrition counseling's effect on individual cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. The study collected1 10 to 150 cases data who aimed to prevent or improve chronic&#xD;
      diseases and had completed eight times individualized nutrition consultations from Bon Vivant&#xD;
      Health Lifestyle Management Center, and the pre- and post-consultation data, including a&#xD;
      regular blood test, blood glucose, blood lipid, liver panel, and inflammatory factors, will&#xD;
      be analyzed. Blood were drawn before and after the first and the last time consultation for&#xD;
      biochemical tests; blood pressure and body composition was also measured for comparison. The&#xD;
      enrolled cases will be classified into two groups according to the subjects' duration of&#xD;
      consultation: those who completed the consultation and subsequent tests in &gt;24 weeks were in&#xD;
      the control group, whereas those who completed the consultation and subsequent tests in &lt;24&#xD;
      weeks were in the test group. The effectiveness of nutrition consultation toward managing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors and its correlation with the subjects' frequency of&#xD;
      following the consultations was analyzed using the pre- and post-consultation data. It was&#xD;
      found that personalized nutrition consultation significantly improved the subjects' risk&#xD;
      factors of cardiovascular diseases, and that the treatment group showed a greater improvement&#xD;
      than the control group which who require over 24 weeks to complete all consultation sessions.&#xD;
