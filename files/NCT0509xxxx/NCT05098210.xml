    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the safety of personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage IIIC-IV melanoma or hormone receptor positive Her2 negative breast cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine is a product combines multiple patient&#xD;
      specific neo-antigens. Given personalized neo-antigen peptide vaccine together with Th1&#xD;
      polarizing adjuvant poly ICLC may induce a polyclonal, poly-epitope, cytolytic T cell&#xD;
      immunity against the patient's tumor.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive poly ICLC intramuscularly (IM) once weekly in weeks when no vaccine is&#xD;
      given. Beginning 2 weeks after starting poly ICLC, patients receive personalized neo-antigen&#xD;
      peptide vaccine IM once every 4 weeks and nivolumab every 2 or 4 weeks. Treatment continuous&#xD;
      for 25 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then&#xD;
      receive nivolumab every 2 or 4 weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24, 36, and 48 weeks.&#xD;

             topical, eye drops, local injections, or inhaled corticosteroids (e.g. fluticasone for&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is allowed. The use of oral mineralocorticoids&#xD;
             (e.g. fludrocortisone for patients with orthostatic hypotension) is allowed.&#xD;
             Physiologic doses of corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency are allowed. Low dose&#xD;
             corticosteroids for a short duration [5 mg once daily (QD) prednisone for 2 weeks] as&#xD;
             symptomatic treatment and upon with discussion with the investigator is allowed. Note:&#xD;
             Patients with adrenal insufficiency may take 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should have an international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial&#xD;
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) =&lt; 1.5 X ULN unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant&#xD;
             therapy. Subjects on anticoagulant therapy should have a prothrombin time (PT) or&#xD;
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within therapeutic range of intended use and no&#xD;
             history of severe hemorrhage. Patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation and&#xD;
             cannot discontinue anticoagulation safely during the day prior, day of, and day after&#xD;
             injection are excluded. Patients requiring anticoagulation with warfarin are excluded&#xD;
             unless they can be transitioned to an alternative anticoagulant (e.g., low molecular&#xD;
             weight heparin or direct oral anticoagulants) prior to enrollment. Antiplatelet agents&#xD;
             (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel, etc.) are not considered anticoagulants for the purposes&#xD;
             of this study (i.e., they are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other medical, social, or psychiatric factor that interferes with medical&#xD;
             appropriateness and/or ability to comply with study, as determined by the principal&#xD;
             investigator (PI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to enrollment. Childbearing potential is defined as women who&#xD;
             have not been surgically sterilized and who are not post-menopausal (free of menses&#xD;
             for at least 1 year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are lactating or intend to breastfeed during the duration of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any underlying medical condition for which, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (e.g.-&#xD;
             compromises the health of the subject) or that could prevent, limit or confound&#xD;
             protocol assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MELANOMA SPECIFIC: Uveal or Choroidal melanoma. This entity is excluded due to the&#xD;
             absence of abundant mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BREAST SPECIFIC: Patients with symptomatic disease including patients with symptomatic&#xD;
             lung metastases, bone marrow replacement with associated cytopenia, or significant&#xD;
             liver metastases with associated liver dysfunction&#xD;
