    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a observational trial, with outcome ascertainment at 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months after cardioversion. The primary objective is to demonstrate how cardioversion&#xD;
      may aid in the regression of left atrial fibrosis in patients with persist atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation as assessed by late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to assess the relationship between structural and functional changes&#xD;
      with heart rhythm and heart rate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is estimated to affect over 33 million people worldwide&#xD;
      and is associated with significant co-morbidities such as embolic stroke, heart failure,&#xD;
      dementia. Consequently, AF poses a significant burden to the healthcare system, in both&#xD;
      direct and indirect costs. The management of AF is complex, especially for patients with&#xD;
      persistent AF, which is defined as sustained AF for &gt; 7 days. It is preferable to terminate&#xD;
      the AF and restore normal sinus rhythm for relief of symptoms associated with AF or&#xD;
      improvement of cardiac structure and function. The maintenance of AF, especially persist AF&#xD;
      is associated with fibrosis of left atria. Furthermore, AF itself promotes fibrosis, which in&#xD;
      turn leads to increased conduction heterogeneity within the atrial substrate resulting in&#xD;
      further progression of AF. In animal models, alterations in myocytes after sustained AF&#xD;
      resemble those of myocardial hibernation. Ultimately, these structural changes would lead to&#xD;
      Calcium overload and metabolic stress, similar changes have been observed in humans. In&#xD;
      humans, atrial dilatation and degenerative changes have been observed. Interstitial fibrosis&#xD;
      is the prime cause of structural remodeling in left atrium. Whether reversal of sinus rhythm&#xD;
      can reverse fibrosis partly? The introduction of Late Gadolinium enhancement magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) sequence now allows for non-invasive and dynamic assessment of&#xD;
      the location and extent of atrial fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no studies evaluating the regression of left atrial fibrosis after cardioversion&#xD;
      assessed by LGE-MRI have been performed. We propose to use LGE-MRI to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      cardioversion on atrial fibrosis. It has been shown that the extent of fibrosis can predict&#xD;
      the success of catheter ablation procedure. For these patients with more &quot;scar&quot;, control the&#xD;
      progression of fibrosis and simultaneously provide respite from AF recurrence would be an&#xD;
      extremely desirable prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the regression of left atrial fibrosis in patients with persist&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation as assessed by late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will be a observational trial in patients with persist AF. Candidate&#xD;
      inpatients or outpatients will be identified if pharmacological or electrical cardioversion&#xD;
      has be performed and MRI were performed after cardioversion at least twice. The heart rhythm&#xD;
      will be assessed by medical records and telephone survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate how cardioversion may influence the&#xD;
      regression of left atrial fibrosis in patients with persist atrial fibrillation as assessed&#xD;
      by LGE-MRI, using longitudinal data from a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation over a six month follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of sinus rhythm in global parameters of myocardial remodeling such as&#xD;
      right and left atrial volumes and right and left ventricular volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether characteristics of MRI after cardioversion can predict the rate of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation sinus rhythm maintenance.&#xD;
