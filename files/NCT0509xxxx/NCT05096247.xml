    <textblock>
      The intended use of the RF (radiofrequency) device used in this study is to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the handpiece for the treatment of facial wrinkles. If the other device (Intense&#xD;
      Pulsed Light) laser in this study is used, the intended use will be for the treatment of&#xD;
      benign pigmented and/or vascular lesions.&#xD;
