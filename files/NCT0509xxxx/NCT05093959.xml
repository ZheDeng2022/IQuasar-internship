    <textblock>
      Met-PEF will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to examine the effects&#xD;
      of 20 weeks of 1500 mg/day of metformin on physical function, quality of life (QOL),&#xD;
      microbiome diversity, leaky gut, and systemic inflammation in patients with 20 older patients&#xD;
      with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrollment of participants will be conducted at both Wake Forest and Atrium Health&#xD;
      (approximately 10 participants at each site) following assessment of eligibility criteria and&#xD;
      willingness to participate in the trial. Eligibility criteria are designed to target the&#xD;
      population under study and exclude participants unable to safely take the study intervention&#xD;
      or undergo study procedures. Informed consent will be obtained from qualified participants.&#xD;
      Participants will complete baseline assessments before masked, random assignment to metformin&#xD;
      or placebo. The assigned study medications will be dispensed by the research pharmacy.&#xD;
      Participants will take assigned metformin or placebo for a treatment period of 20 weeks,&#xD;
      starting at 500mg/day and escalating over the first 3 weeks to a target dose of 1500mg/day.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted every 2 weeks for assessment of adverse events, side effects,&#xD;
      and adherence. At week 4, participants will be seen in clinic for safety laboratory&#xD;
      assessments. At week 20, participants will complete follow-up assessments by an assessor&#xD;
      blinded to treatment group.&#xD;

    <measure>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy (KCCQ) Overall Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The KCCQ overall score is the main summary score of the KCCQ containing physical, symptom, quality of life, and social subdomains. It is measured on a scale of 0-100 units with higher score indicating better HF-disease-specific quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB is a valid, clinically meaningful measure of physical function in older adults. The SPPB has 3 components: standing balance, 4-meter walk, and repeated chair rises, corresponding to balance, mobility, and functional strength. Each component is scored on a scale of 0-4 for a total score of 0-12 units with a higher score indicating better physical function.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>6MWD is the distance walked in 6 minutes, with higher distance indicating better function. The 6MWD test is a well-established outcome measure in heart failure. It is valid and reproducible in patients with a wide range of physical function, predicts clinical events, and responds to interventions.</description>

    <description>20 weeks of metformin 1500 mg daily. Metformin is a widely used medication with an excellent safety profile. Dosing will be escalated during the first 3 weeks of treatment. Dosing will be initiated with 500 mg taken orally once daily in the evening for 1 week. After one week, the participant will be called to assess tolerance and will be asked to increase dose to two capsules per day for a total 1000 mg per day for one week. At the end of the second week, participants will be called again and if they tolerated the increased dose will be instructed to increase to three capsules (1500 mg/day) per day for the remainder of the 20 weeks. An extended release formulation will be used which improves compliance and reduces GI side effects.</description>

After one week, the participant will be called to assess tolerance and will be asked to increase dose to two capsules per day for a total 1000 mg per day for one week.
