  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with acute respiratory failure often need a breathing tube attached to a breathing&#xD;
      machine, called a mechanical ventilator, to assist their breathing until they can recover.&#xD;
      Once the cause of respiratory failure has resolved or improved enough, the breathing tube can&#xD;
      be removed, and that is called extubation. The Extubation Readiness Test (ERT) is a simple&#xD;
      evaluation commonly performed in the intensive care unit to determine if a child is ready to&#xD;
      have the breathing tube removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how the ERT and the eventual removal of the&#xD;
      breathing tube affect where the air is in the lungs, and whether this can help predict which&#xD;
      children will succeed or fail having the breathing tube taken out. This can done be at the&#xD;
      bedside with a device called electrical impedance tomograph. This novel device is painless&#xD;
      and uses a belt fitted with sensors placed around the chest to show where the air is in the&#xD;
      lungs.&#xD;
