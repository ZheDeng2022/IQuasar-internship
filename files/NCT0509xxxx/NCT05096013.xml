  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and sarcopenia (muscle wasting) are common in health care settings and represent&#xD;
      a health and economic burden due to associated increased mortality and prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stays. Nutritional therapy co-management is recommended for both diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the efficacy of individualized nutrition therapy (iNT) in pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Patients at significant risk for malnutrition already receive iNT within&#xD;
      clinical routine during rehabilitation. The investigators will investigate if patients with&#xD;
      only mild to moderate risk of malnutrition and possible sarcopenia also benefit from iNT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participating patients are randomly assigned to two groups after giving written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group receives individual counseling by nutrition therapists twice a week in&#xD;
      addition to the usual rehabilitation program. The iNT determines the energy and protein needs&#xD;
      of the patients and creates targeted individual measures to achieve them. Measures may&#xD;
      include, for example, adjustments to the meal plan or nutritional supplementation. The&#xD;
      measures are continuously adapted to the patients' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group also receives soup fortified with a standard amount of protein and fat and,&#xD;
      if needed, an energy- and protein-rich dessert option as part of the rehabilitation routine&#xD;
      care for patients at risk for malnutrition. However, patients from the control group do not&#xD;
      receive additional counseling or adjustment by the iNT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' energy and protein intake will be recorded on three subsequent days at start of&#xD;
      rehabilitation and at three subsequent days before discharge. Average duration of&#xD;
      rehabilitation is expected to be three weeks. As primary outcome, change in energy intake&#xD;
      will be compared between groups. Additionally, change in protein intake and other follow-up&#xD;
      parameters of nutritional status and sarcopenia will be examined.&#xD;

In order to be able to blind the nutritional calculations of the primary endpoint, the logged amounts of food eaten will be recorded on the neutral eating cards, on which the study group allocation will not be apparent.</masking_description>

    <description>Individualized nutrition therapy: Specialists in nutritional counseling determine the patient's individual energy and protein needs and create targeted individual measures to achieve them. Measures can include, for example, adjustments to the menu, food enrichment or supplementation. The measures are discussed with the patients on an ongoing basis and adjusted as necessary.</description>

    <description>Intervention arm: Usual care + individualized nutritional therapy. Patients at risk for malnutrition and sarcopenia will receive a counselling by the nutritional therapist twice a week. The therapists will assess the patient's energy and protein demand in order to develope appropriate individual measures (e.g additional meals or supplements) to increase patients' energy and protein intake. Individual nutritional therapy is already usual care in patients with high risk for malnutrition, but not for patients with only light to moderate risk of malnutrition and risk of sarcopenia.</description>
