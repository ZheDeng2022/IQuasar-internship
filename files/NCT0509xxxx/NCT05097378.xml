    <description>Encorafenib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor, which suppresses the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in tumour cells expressing several mutated forms of BRAF kinase (V600E, D and K).&#xD;
Binimetinib is an ATP-uncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of the kinase activity of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. Binimetinib inhibits activation of MEK by BRAF and inhibits MEK kinase activity</description>
