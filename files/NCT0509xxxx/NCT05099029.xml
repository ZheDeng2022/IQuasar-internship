      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the EV71vaccine efficacy, immune response and&#xD;
      safety profiles after two injections of the cell culture-based inactivated EV71 vaccine with&#xD;
      adjuvant Al(OH)3 administrated in pediatric population aged 2 months to 6 years old.&#xD;

      The clinical trial designed in this Study is a placebo-controlled, double-blinded Phase III&#xD;
      and is aimed to evaluate the vaccine efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and immune persistence&#xD;
      of cell culture-based inactivated EV71 vaccine in children age of 2 months to &lt;6 years old.&#xD;
      Two doses of Alum-adjuvanted 1.0 μg per dose of EV71 vaccine candidate will be administrated&#xD;
      to subjects. The efficacy will be evaluated within a two year period after receiving&#xD;
      2-regimen vaccination by comparing the EV71-associated disease rates between the vaccine and&#xD;
      placebo groups. Whereas, the immunogenicity will be assessed on Day 56 and Day 196, and the&#xD;
      immune persistence will be evaluated on Day 392. Safety will be followed up to Day 392.&#xD;
