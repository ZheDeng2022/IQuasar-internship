  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intraoral cryotherapy application on&#xD;
      postoperative pain in single and multiple visit retreatment of teeth with symptomatic or&#xD;
      asymptomatic apical periodontitis. This clinical trial was also investigate the potential of&#xD;
      intraoral cryotherapy application to reduce on postoperative analgesic use of patients in&#xD;
      line with the results obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 118 patients who met the inclusion criteria were selected for the study. The&#xD;
      patients were randomly divided into two groups as single visit and multiple visit (n=59).&#xD;
      Then, each group was randomly divided into three subgroups as control (without cryotherapy),&#xD;
      15 minutes of cryotherapy, and 30 minutes of cryotherapy. Twenty two teeth were retreated in&#xD;
      each cryotherapy group and 15 teeth in each control group. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was&#xD;
      used to evaluate and compare postoperative pain. Postoperative analgesic use of patients was&#xD;
      also recorded.&#xD;

Residual gutta-perchas in the access cavity were removed with the aid of heated hand tools. The quality of root canal filling was checked with periapical radiographs.&#xD;
The pulp chamber was filled with flowable composite resin (Filtek Ultimate Flowable, 3M-ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) and nanohybrid composite resin (3M-ESPE) using an incremental technique.&#xD;

    <description>Root canals were filled with calcium hydroxide paste (Kalsin, Turkey), prepared according to the rate recommended by the manufacturer using a lentulo spiral (Dentsply Sirona, Switzerland) 2 mm from the working length. Sterile dry cotton pellets were placed in the pulp chamber, then the access cavity was sealed with a temporary filling material and occlusion was checked.&#xD;
Intraoral cryotherapy was not applied. Patients were given an appointment 7 days later for second visit. In this appointment, patients were anesthetized, the tooth was isolated with rubber dam, the temporary filling material was removed. Then calcium hydroxide paste was removed by using the last instrument used to prepare the root canals at the working length during the first appointment using sufficient irrigation.&#xD;
The final irrigation protocol was repeated. Root canal fillings and permanent restorations were completed by applying the same techniques as in single session groups.</description>

    <description>Tap water was filled into plastic ice molds and kept in the freezer in the clinic until the application was made. The ice packs used were weighed with digital pocket scale (Knmaster CT1000, Turkey) as 6-8 grams. In the cryotherapy groups, at the end of the first appointment ice packs were removed from the freezer, wrapped in sterile gauze and placed on the vestibular mucosa of the teeth.</description>
