  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      BEY1107 in combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      refractory or intolerant to standard of care (SoC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1, patients who experienced treatment failure of colorectal cancer with the&#xD;
      second-line or beyond standard chemotherapy will be enrolled at each dose level of BEY1107 in&#xD;
      combination with Capecitabine. Phase 2 will be conducted after RP2D is determined on the&#xD;
      Phase 1 results.&#xD;
