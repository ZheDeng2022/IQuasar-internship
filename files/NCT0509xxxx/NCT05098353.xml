    <textblock>
      In this study, the task was to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribing small doses of&#xD;
      quetiapine (25-75 mg) for bipolar patients in remission in order to relieve symptoms of&#xD;
      impulsivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy and safety of the administration of&#xD;
      Quetiapine ® in small doses (25-75 mg / day) to patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder who&#xD;
      are in an euthymic state with signs of impaired impulse control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of administration, dosage regimen and duration of taking quetiapine in this study:&#xD;
      1-3 tablets from one to 3 times a day, regardless of food intake for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient included in the program will be given a package with the drug for 14 days of&#xD;
      admission. In the first 14 days of administration, dose adjustment is possible in the range&#xD;
      from 25 to 75 mg, depending on individual tolerability. The decision on correction is made by&#xD;
      the doctor based on a phone call to the patient after the first week of taking the drug at a&#xD;
      dose of 25 mg. Correction is also possible at a later or earlier date during the first two&#xD;
      weeks of therapy. At visit 2, the patient will have to provide the doctor with a package of&#xD;
      the drug as part of the compliance assessment. At visit 2, the doctor should give the patient&#xD;
      packages with the drug for 28 days of admission and ask them to bring packages to assess&#xD;
      compliance and account for the drug for visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (Visit 1 / Day 0) The inclusion of the subject in the program will be carried out&#xD;
      on the basis of an assessment of demographic, clinical characteristics, anamnesis data. Prior&#xD;
      to the start of the examination, the subject must be provided with oral information about the&#xD;
      nature of the study, an informed consent form for signing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be performed during the screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of demographic data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history (previous and concomitant diseases, surgical interventions, allergic&#xD;
           history, gynecological history);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of the diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Concomitant therapy Within the framework of this study, patients can receive any&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy therapy, with the exception of quetiapine in higher doses than prescribed by&#xD;
      the protocol. At each visit, the doctor should interview the patient about any medications&#xD;
      used by the patient during participation in the study. Information about the patient's intake&#xD;
      of concomitant medications is entered by the doctor in the IRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) As part of this study, an additional fMRI&#xD;
      procedure will be performed for a part of patients (10 people) to assess the functional&#xD;
      activity of the brain when performing the Go-no-GO test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study The expected duration of the subjects' participation in the study&#xD;
      corresponds to the expected duration of taking the drug and for each participant will be 42 ±&#xD;
      3 days. The inclusion of patients in the study will continue until their total number reaches&#xD;
      30 people.&#xD;
