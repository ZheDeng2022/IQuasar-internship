  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PKU Sphere Liquid is a prospective, open-label, acceptability study to evaluate PKU sphere&#xD;
      liquid in up to 15 participants aged 3 and above for the dietary management of PKU over 31&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PKU Sphere Liquid is a newly-developed Food for Special Medical Purposes (FSMP) designed for&#xD;
      the dietary management of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PKU sphere liquid is a vanilla flavoured, ready-to-drink, low phenylalanine protein&#xD;
      substitute containing a blend of casein glycomacropeptide (GMP) isolate, essential and&#xD;
      non-essential amino acids, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals, and Docosachexaenoic acid&#xD;
      (DHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study designed to evaluate the acceptability, tolerance and adherence&#xD;
      of children and adults consuming PKU sphere liquid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a four-week supply of PKU Sphere Liquid and they will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a daily diary and short questionnaire for four weeks to record information on:&#xD;
      adherence, gastrointestinal tolerance, palatability and how the product is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be on the trial for 31 days. This includes a 3-day baseline period and&#xD;
      28 days taking the study product. If deemed appropriate in each individual circumstance, the&#xD;
      sponsor of the trial, Vitaflo International Ltd, will continue to supply the product free of&#xD;
      charge at the end of the trial until available on prescription.&#xD;
