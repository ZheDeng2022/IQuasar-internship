  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder. Alcohol craving, a hallmark&#xD;
      symptom of AUD that drives relapse in patients, is only insufficiently treated by existing&#xD;
      medication. One promising new compound is Oxytocin (OXY), which showed beneficial effects on&#xD;
      alcohol craving in preliminary clinical studies. Additionally, OXY seems to enhance effects&#xD;
      of established medication, specifically Naltrexone (NTX), an opioid-antagonist which is&#xD;
      approved for AUD treatment via positive synergism on neurotransmitter levels. The proposed&#xD;
      two-armed, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial seeks to test the putative&#xD;
      synergistic effects of combined intranasal OXY spray (24 IU) + oral NTX (50mg) against&#xD;
      Placebo spray + oral NTX (50mg) on alcohol craving (primary outcome) in male and female&#xD;
      patients with AUD that suffer from high alcohol craving, within the framework of a validated&#xD;
      alcohol cue-and stress-exposure task (i.e. a combined Trier Stress Test and alcohol&#xD;
      cue-exposure) that was established for screening new medications in AUD and determine their&#xD;
      effects on craving and relapse risk. Treatment effects on additional neurobiological and&#xD;
      biochemical markers of craving that show strong associations to individual relapse risk, will&#xD;
      serve as secondary outcomes. Collection and analysis of follow-up data (90 days) will be&#xD;
      performed to determine whether treatment effects relate to patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial period for an individual participant consists of a screening visit (visit&#xD;
      1), a baseline visit (visit 2) and two treatment visits (visits 3 and 4)(all within equal or&#xD;
      less than ten days) followed by a 90 days (+/- 7 days) follow-up phase with two visits&#xD;
      (visits 5 and 6) at day 30 (± 7 days) and day 90 (± 7 days). Visits 1 to 4 will be conducted&#xD;
      while participants are undergoing standard in-patient treatment at the Department of&#xD;
      Addictive Behavior and Addiction medicine at the Central Institute of Mental Health (CIMH) in&#xD;
      Mannheim, Germany, for the medical condition under investigation.&#xD;
