    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of REGN5459 (Part&#xD;
      A) or REGN5458 (Part B) as monotherapy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who need&#xD;
      kidney transplantation and are highly sensitized to human leukocyte antigen (HLA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to determine/assess the following for REGN5459&#xD;
      (Part A) or REGN5458 (Part B):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose regimen(s) that result in a clinically meaningful reduction of anti-HLA&#xD;
           alloantibody levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to maximal and clinically meaningful reduction in anti-HLA alloantibody levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the effect of study drug on the reduction of anti-HLA alloantibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect on circulating immunoglobulin (Ig) classes (isotypes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics (PK) properties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunogenicity&#xD;
