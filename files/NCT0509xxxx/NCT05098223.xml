      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a nation people eat more energy, free sugars, saturated fat and salt than recommended for&#xD;
      good health. These nutrients contribute to the burden of major chronic diseases, including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes, principally through effects on blood cholesterol, blood&#xD;
      pressure, insulin sensitivity or body weight. In addition, persistent inequalities in dietary&#xD;
      intake underpin inequalities in long-term health outcomes. Despite decades of health&#xD;
      promotion, dietary change is slow. Growing evidence suggests people need more than general&#xD;
      knowledge about the healthfulness of foods to change behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food purchasing is a key antecedent of food consumption and interventions to change food&#xD;
      purchasing habits may be more impactful than interventions intended to change consumption at&#xD;
      the moment of eating. Supermarkets account for the majority of the weekly expenditure on food&#xD;
      and drinks, estimated to be around 87% of all UK retail grocery sales. Impactful, scalable&#xD;
      and sustainable approaches within supermarkets are particularly needed in order to shift&#xD;
      population-level intakes to be closer to the recommendations for calories, sugar, salt and&#xD;
      saturated fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous systematic reviews of supermarket interventions have identified effective strategies&#xD;
      to support dietary change. Evidence is generally stronger for economic (e.g. price&#xD;
      interventions or price promotions), positioning and availability interventions. However, many&#xD;
      of the interventions described in the literature are multi-component, and there is a&#xD;
      challenge in attributing their effectiveness to any single strategy. In the 2020 Obesity&#xD;
      Plan, the government in England laid out plans to introduce legislation to restrict the&#xD;
      promotion of high fat salt sugar (HFSS) foods, by restricting volume promotions such as 'Buy&#xD;
      One Get One Free'. This is based on observational evidence of purchasing habits. Specific&#xD;
      evidence of the impact of removing promotions is of interest to policymakers and could help&#xD;
      in shaping effective but proportionate policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online supermarkets offer unique opportunities to deliver and support complex nutrition&#xD;
      interventions that can often be tested and scaled up more rapidly and feasibly using digital&#xD;
      technology than in-store interventions. There is some evidence that baseline purchases made&#xD;
      online tend to be healthier than purchases in physical stores, but less is known about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventions delivered online to change behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of the removal of price promotions&#xD;
      on confectionery and snacks on the energy, sugar and saturated fat content of items selected&#xD;
      while shopping online in a representative sample of UK adults. The proposed intervention can&#xD;
      be easily implemented, and could reach large numbers of people, meaning that if it is&#xD;
      effective it could have a significant population impact and be very cost-effective, even if&#xD;
      the effect size is smaller than more intensive interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION This study uses a bespoke virtual online supermarket shopping (OLS) platform,&#xD;
      hosted by The University of Oxford, which emulates a real online supermarket for research&#xD;
      purposes relating to food purchasing interventions (www.woodssupermarket.co.uk). The site is&#xD;
      populated with approximately 23,000 current supermarket products drawn from foodDB (April&#xD;
      2019), a weekly updated database of food and drinks available for purchase in six UK online&#xD;
      supermarkets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to imagine they are buying snacks for a night in with 4 friends,&#xD;
      with a maximum limit of £10. They will be asked to select products from the following&#xD;
      categories, which are aligned and named in the way items are presented in the store:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confectionery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biscuits and crackers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crisps, nuts and snacking fruit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cakes and tarts&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shopping task is estimated to take participants 10 minutes to complete. Participants will&#xD;
      only be asked to complete the shopping task once. Participants will read a message with the&#xD;
      following instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;We would like you to do some online grocery shopping on a supermarket website. This is not a&#xD;
      real supermarket, and you will not be asked to spend your own money.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like you to imagine you are buying snacks for a night in with 4 friends, up to a&#xD;
      limit of £10. You should select products from the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confectionery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biscuits and crackers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crisps, nuts and snacking fruit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cakes and tarts We would ask you not to select any additional items from your usual&#xD;
           shopping list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When doing your shopping, try to imagine you are doing your own grocery shopping and choose&#xD;
      foods that you and your friends would eat. You should choose the things you normally buy or&#xD;
      wouldn't mind eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make sure you get your reward, please make sure you buy at least £5 worth of products&#xD;
      within the suggested food categories&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICATION AND RECRUITMENT 7.1. Study Participants Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be UK adults who are responsible for a substantial proportion of their household grocery&#xD;
      shopping, able to read and understand the instructions provided and able to provide online&#xD;
      consent to take part in the study. Participants will be required to have access to a computer&#xD;
      and the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who are following a vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free or sugar-free diet will not be&#xD;
      eligible to participate to minimise the risk of unbalancing the groups with people choosing&#xD;
      from a restricted selection of products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES 8.1. Recruitment Participants will be recruited from the volunteer panel&#xD;
      Prolific Academic (https://www.prolific.co).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2. Screening and Eligibility Assessment Panel members will be sent an email introducing the&#xD;
      study and including a link to the participant information sheet. Panel members who are&#xD;
      interested in taking part in the study will be asked to click on a web-link from the email,&#xD;
      which will take them to the study registration website (on Qualtrics). At this registration&#xD;
      website, they will be asked screening questions indicating their responsibility for shopping,&#xD;
      if they have any dietary restriction, if they regularly buy products from the target&#xD;
      categories for their household, and to confirm their age and country of residence. They will&#xD;
      also be able to re-read the detailed participant information before consenting to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3. Informed Consent After reading the detailed participant information sheet and answering&#xD;
      screening questions to confirm they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria; and if they are&#xD;
      happy to proceed, participants will be asked to give consent electronically to take part in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written electronic versions of the Participant Information and Informed Consent will be&#xD;
      presented to the participants detailing no less than: the exact nature of the study, what it&#xD;
      will involve for the participant and the implications and constraints of the protocol. It&#xD;
      will be clearly stated that the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time&#xD;
      for any reason and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal. The participant will&#xD;
      be allowed as much time as wished to consider the information. Electronic Informed Consent&#xD;
      will then be obtained by means of clicking on a tick box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.4. Randomisation Randomisation will be performed by the survey platform Qualtrics via&#xD;
      computerised random number generation on a 1:1 basis with random block sizes and participants&#xD;
      will be directed to a website that introduces an online shopping task. Allocation concealment&#xD;
      is achieved, as participants are recruited from independent research panels and are being&#xD;
      directed by automatic randomisation in the survey platform. Details of the intervention are&#xD;
      described in Section 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.5. Blinding Investigators will be blinded to intervention allocation and will not be able&#xD;
      to manipulate any study parameter following the initial study set up, as all study procedures&#xD;
      are taking part in the online platform. The outcome assessment is blinded, as it happens&#xD;
      automatically in the online platform. The statistician who will analyse the data will be&#xD;
      blinded to intervention allocation. Participants will only be aware of the trial arm that&#xD;
      they are exposed to and will be unaware of the other trial arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.6. Baseline Assessments Following consent and completion of the shopping task, participants&#xD;
      will complete a baseline questionnaire on demographic, shopping, and health data&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.7. Follow-up Participants will complete a short post-intervention survey about the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention in the online shopping task and their usual shopping&#xD;
      behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.8. Discontinuation/Withdrawal of Participants from Study Each participant has the right to&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time. Participants will not be replaced as a sufficient sample&#xD;
      size will be recruited to allow for non-completion rate. Withdrawal from the study, based on&#xD;
      the pre-defined completion criteria, will result in exclusion of the data for that&#xD;
      participant from analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.9. Definition of End of Study The end of study is the completion of the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and post-intervention survey following the shopping task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS AND ANALYSIS 9.1. The Number of Participants There are no previously reported&#xD;
      standard deviations of the mean difference from similar trials (e.g. where a one-off shop is&#xD;
      done) to guide the estimation of the effect size and standard deviation, and, thus, the&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size. However, the study by Brimblecombe et al. 2020 implemented a&#xD;
      complex intervention within real supermarkets in Australia where promotions on high sugar&#xD;
      products were removed, including confectionery and sugary drinks. This study found a total&#xD;
      reduction of -22% in sales (g/MJ) in confectionery, a difference of -4.5% (SD 15) compared to&#xD;
      control; and a reduction of -8% in sugar-sweetened soft drinks, a difference of -13% compared&#xD;
      to control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total sample of 500 participants (250 in each group) would be needed to detect a minimum&#xD;
      effect size of -4.5% in total kcal from the target categories, with 90% power, 5% alpha and&#xD;
      10% attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2. Analysis of Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the task will be defined as spending at least £5 on products from the target&#xD;
      categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis Linear regression models will compare the total energy (kcal) purchased in&#xD;
      the two groups. Any baseline variables (e.g. demographic characteristics) which appear to&#xD;
      have been imbalanced between groups will be adjusted in the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analysis Linear regression models will compare the (i) total sugar (g, kcal, %E),&#xD;
      (ii) total salt (g, kcal, %E) and (iii) total SFA (g, kcal, %E) purchased in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses will also compare differences in total energy (kcal), total sugar (g,&#xD;
      kcal, %E), total salt (g, kcal, %E) and total SFA (g, kcal, %E) across the individual target&#xD;
      categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes specified above will be conducted by&#xD;
      gender, age group, ethnic group (White vs Non-White), BMI stratified into &lt;30 and ≥30kg/m2&#xD;
      groups, education level (lower vs. higher), and household income (lower vs. higher) provided&#xD;
      there are sufficient numbers within each subgroup (n&gt;=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis The exploratory outcome measures will be discussed descriptively. A&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan will be finalised before conducting the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT 10.1. Access to Data Direct access will be granted to authorised&#xD;
      representatives from the University of Oxford for monitoring and/or audit of the study to&#xD;
      ensure compliance with regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2. Data Handling and Record Keeping All study data will be captured in a password&#xD;
      protected secure database. The participants will be identified by a unique study specific&#xD;
      number and/or code in any database. Personal data will not be collected in this study.&#xD;
      Research data and records will be retained for at least three years after publication or&#xD;
      public release of the work of the research and reviewed thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES The study will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the current approved protocol, relevant regulations and standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 12.1. Declaration of Helsinki The Investigator will&#xD;
      ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2. Approvals The protocol, informed consent form, participant information sheet and any&#xD;
      proposed advertising material will be submitted to the ethical committee for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator will submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the above parties for&#xD;
      all substantial amendments to the original approved documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.3. Participant Confidentiality All data collected by participants will be anonymous. The&#xD;
      participants will be identified only a participant ID number on all study documents and any&#xD;
      electronic database. All documents will be stored securely requiring password-protected&#xD;
      access and will be only accessible by study staff and authorised personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy and confidentiality of data is particularly hard to manage in Internet-based research&#xD;
      because researchers are not in control of online communication networks, leading to the risk&#xD;
      of third-party interceptions. The use of a secure link at the consent stage will be&#xD;
      encouraged. Participants will be informed that their IP addresses will not be collected. As&#xD;
      the data will be anonymised, it does not constitute personal data and the duties and&#xD;
      obligations of the Data Protection Act do not apply. The research agencies will only share&#xD;
      with the researchers a participant ID and no personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.4. Other Ethical Considerations Internet based research issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Authentication The research agency who will recruit participants uses a number of&#xD;
           mechanisms to authenticate responders such as checking for duplicate respondents by&#xD;
           evaluating variables such as email address, matches across several demographic data, and&#xD;
           device-related data through use of digital fingerprint technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participant rights Participants will be free to withdraw themselves and their data at&#xD;
           any point in the research. During the shopping task, clicking on a clearly displayed&#xD;
           &quot;exit here&quot; button will lead participants to a quick debrief page that will give them&#xD;
           the option to confirm that they do not wish their data to be retained for the study&#xD;
           purposes. Participants will be clearly informed before giving consent that anonymity&#xD;
           makes withdrawal following completion of the study difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCE AND INSURANCE 13.1. Funding The study is funded by the National Institute for Health&#xD;
      Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaborations (ARC Oxford).&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.2. Insurance This is a simple online task and any unintended or adverse effects due to&#xD;
      participation cannot be foreseen. The University of Oxford maintains Public Liability and&#xD;
      Professional Liability insurance that will operate in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION POLICY The Investigators will be involved in reviewing drafts of the manuscripts,&#xD;
      abstracts, press releases and any other publications arising from the study. Authors will&#xD;
      acknowledge that the study was funded by the NIHR Oxford ARC. Authorship will be determined&#xD;
      in accordance with the ICMJE guidelines and other contributors will be acknowledged. As the&#xD;
      participants' contact details will not be stored, the results will not be disseminated&#xD;
      directly to study participants. A dissemination plan will be followed to engage with public&#xD;
      health agencies, the industry, the media, and the&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will see a version of the website which will reproduce the types and frequency of promotions that can be found in any online supermarket, for example multi-buy offers and temporary price reductions will be applied to a pre-determined percentage of food products within the target categories [confectionery; biscuits and crackers; crisps, nuts and snacking fruit; cakes and tarts]. Promotions will be applied to match the current levels and types of promotions on the website of the largest UK retailer present in a specific week, shortly before the study launch.</description>
