  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a tele-rehabilitation home exercise program is feasible to&#xD;
      promote adherence to a fitness and mobility exercise program in ambulatory adults with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy (GMFCS I, II, III) aged 21- 60 year old, and second, to determine if a&#xD;
      tele-health exercise program improves fitness and functional mobility for participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive neurologic condition caused by a brain lesion(s)&#xD;
      that occurs in the prenatal, perinatal or early postnatal period. Ambulatory adults with CP&#xD;
      are at risk for gait deterioration and increased sedentary lifestyles due to their diagnosis,&#xD;
      associated conditions and the impact of aging. Adults with CP often have limited access to&#xD;
      physical therapy (PT) and community-based programs to sustain ambulation, reduce pain,&#xD;
      prevent falls risk and increase fitness and physical activity. This Tele-Rehabilitation Home&#xD;
      Exercise Program (TRHExP) is a prospective cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this feasibility study will engage in 150 minutes of exercise per week (30&#xD;
      min/day for 5 days/week) for 8 weeks and will have weekly virtual Exercise Coaching sessions&#xD;
      with a trained project team member.&#xD;

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is a semi-structured interview that measures participants' perspective of their performance and satisfaction of self-identified occupational performance problems in areas of self-care, productivity and leisure. Participants rate their performance and satisfaction of the occupational performance problems they identify using a 10 point scale. Scores range from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating poor performance/ low satisfaction and 10 indicating very good performance/ high satisfaction (better outcome).</description>

    <measure>30 Second Sit to Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (Post-Test)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to stand up from a standard chair without using their arms as many times as possible within 30 seconds. The number of full stands are counted.</description>

    <measure>2 Minute Step Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (Post-Test)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to stand next to the wall, and a piece of tape is placed on the wall halfway between the participant's iliac crest and patella. The participant is asked to step in place for 2 minutes, raising each knee to the mark on the wall for each step, for as many times as possible within that period. The number of times the right knee reaches the required height are counted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Single Leg Stance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (Post-Test)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is asked to stand unassisted on one leg with eyes open and hands on hips. The amount of time in seconds the participant can maintain this position is measured (up to 30 seconds).</description>

    <description>Participants will engage in 150 minutes of exercise per week (30 min/day for 5 days/week) for 8 weeks and will have weekly virtual Exercise Coaching sessions with a trained project team member. Customized home exercise programs will be reviewed weekly during the coaching sessions and will be modified as needed to ensure participants can complete their exercises safely and effectively. Exercise coaches will send weekly messages to 'check-in' with participants in order to motivate and remind participants to adhere to their tailored home exercise programs.&#xD;
During weekly exercise coaching sessions, exercises will be reviewed for form, safety, and progression. Exercises will be revised as needed to ensure that they are in line with participants' goals, needs, and preferences.</description>
