  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to check how rifampin affects the way soticlestat is processed&#xD;
      by the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to stay at the study clinic for 18 consecutive days. On the&#xD;
      first full day and 15th day, participants will take a single dose of soticlestat. Rifampin&#xD;
      will be taken each day starting on the 5th day for 13 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic staff will follow up with each participant about 15 days after the last soticlestat&#xD;
      dose to check for any side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called soticlestat (TAK-935). The study will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of soticlestat when co-administered with rifampin in healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 14 participants. The participants will be assigned to treatment group&#xD;
      to receive following therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Soticlestat 300 milligram (mg) + Rifampin 600 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two periods: Period 1 and Period 2. In Period 1, participants will&#xD;
      receive soticlestat in fasted condition while in Period 2 participants will receive&#xD;
      soticlestat along with rifampin. The data will be collected and stored in electronic case&#xD;
      report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall study duration&#xD;
      of the study will be approximately 58 days including 28 days screening and follow up&#xD;
      duration. There will be a follow up contact required for all participants approximately 15&#xD;
      days after the last dose of soticlestat.&#xD;
