    <textblock>
      Frailty is a multidimensional concept that influences several domains , such as body mass&#xD;
      decline, gait ,mobility, balance ,muscle strength ,motor processing ,cognition, nutrition&#xD;
      endurance, and physical activity, and its directly related to adverse consequences such as&#xD;
      falls ,disability the need for long term care , hospitalization and even mortality. As the&#xD;
      elderly have twice as many disabilities and four times as many physical limitations as people&#xD;
      less than 60 years of age. There is a need to focus on this demographic shift and Aging&#xD;
      population Pakistan increasing double in 2050 hence is has become a new challenge. So,&#xD;
      Effective approaches is needed to help older people maintain a healthy and active life. The&#xD;
      main objective is to determine reference values of senior fitness test SFT for elderly&#xD;
      population. The Senior Fitness Test is a battery of tests for the assessment of the&#xD;
      functional fitness of older persons. This test will assess the physiological capacity for&#xD;
      carrying out normal daily activities independently and safely without the appearance of&#xD;
      fatigue. For this study cross sectional survey will conduct and will use non probability&#xD;
      convenience sampling technique , sample size will be 500 both male and female and conducted&#xD;
      from Heaven old age homes and Dar ul Khilafa old age home, Lahore. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
      includes subject 60 and above , living Subjects 60 years and above, living independently (not&#xD;
      community dwelling, hospitals, nurse homes etc ), perform ADLS. Exclusion criteria includes&#xD;
      if not willing to participate, any medical contraindication, unable to speech ,functional&#xD;
      disability .All the analysis will be carried out on SPSS v -25.&#xD;

      According to the world health organization WHO, the proportion of older people above 60 is&#xD;
      growing more rapidly than any other age group. Within this group not everyone reach old age&#xD;
      successfully. Although the common rule is that increasing age is related to decreasing&#xD;
      well-being and increasing levels of frailty. It is also true that individual with same&#xD;
      chronological age can vary in health and functional status . Functional fitness is a way to&#xD;
      help people perform daily tasks with ease. It includes exercises that mimic the movements of&#xD;
      daily activities. Walking, squatting, bending, pushing, and pulling are examples. Three key&#xD;
      elements of functional fitness for seniors are balance, mobility, and strength. Improving&#xD;
      these three aspects of physical fitness helps seniors: Maintain a healthy body weight, Reduce&#xD;
      the risk of falling, Make activities of daily living easier, Boost emotional health. The&#xD;
      discovery of effective interventions to prevent or delay disability in older persons is a&#xD;
      public health priority. The geriatric assessment designed to manage frail older people&#xD;
      requiring medical care, is responsible for early diagnosis , assessment, treatment, and&#xD;
      planning while addressing a person's medical, psychological, social, and functional&#xD;
      capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of study to highlights age-related differences in physical abilities and the risk&#xD;
      for the loss of independence in later life. High walkability of the living environment&#xD;
      provides opportunities for physical activity in old age, but among those with physical&#xD;
      limitations especially, awareness of environmental facilitators may be needed to promote&#xD;
      physical activity. The main objective of this research will be to provide normative values of&#xD;
      functional fitness in 60 and above seniors citizens of Pakistan .Research results will enable&#xD;
      preparing an effective intervention strategy for maintaining mobility and functional&#xD;
      independence of elderly people.&#xD;

        Informed consent will be obtained from participants to meet inclusion criteria before&#xD;
        including in study.It is a cross sectional study, researcher will find out the normative&#xD;
        values of senior citizen by using senior fitness test SFT in both male and female gender 60&#xD;
        or above age .Senior fitness test contains 6 six and before assessment , screening&#xD;
        participants either meet inclusion criteria or not and for basic and advanced everyday&#xD;
        activities . Anthropometric measurements by BMI body mass index will used. So overall this&#xD;
        procedure will contain 45 to 50 minute per participant. All readings of SFT 6 components&#xD;
        will be mentioned in table according to gender and age group 60-64yrs&#xD;
