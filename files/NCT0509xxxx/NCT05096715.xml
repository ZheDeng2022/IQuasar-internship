    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of the drugs atezolizumab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for treating unresectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the following interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase 1B study designed to evaluate the combination of Atezolizumab and&#xD;
      Bevacizumab with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT for treating and limiting the&#xD;
      recurrence of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved atezolizumab and bevacizumab for&#xD;
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The FDA has not approved the combination of radiation&#xD;
      therapy, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is believed to work by increasing the immune system's response to cancer cells.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is believed to work by inhibiting cancer cells from growing by targeting a&#xD;
      specific protein in the cancer cells. Radiation therapy is a standard of care treatment for&#xD;
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Radiation therapy has also been shown to increase the&#xD;
      effects of drugs like atezolizumab and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for as long as the study drugs are safe and&#xD;
      beneficial to them. Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20-32 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genentech, a biotechnology company, is supporting this research study by providing funding&#xD;
      for the study, including the study drugs.&#xD;

             with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants who received acute, low-dose systemic immunosuppressant medication&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients who received mineralocorticoids (e.g. fludrocortisone), corticosteroids&#xD;
                  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, or low-dose&#xD;

                  for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequately controlled arterial hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
             ≥150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg), based on an average of ≥ 3 BP&#xD;
             readings on ≥ 2 sessions. Anti-hypertensive therapy to achieve these parameters is&#xD;
