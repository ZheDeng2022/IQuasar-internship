    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at evaluation of the efficacy of mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who have been treated for at least 12 months in&#xD;
      several Polish allergy/asthma centres under the same protocol. Target population to be&#xD;
      recruited has been set at 130 subjects from at least 6 asthma centers throughout the country.&#xD;
      Data on dempgraphics and asthma status will be collected using questionnaires at 3&#xD;
      time-points: pre-MEPO, after 24 weeks of MEPO and after 1 year of MEPO administration (some&#xD;
      of the outcomes will be observed every 4 weeks). Primary endpoints will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma exacerbations measured at qualification for the treatment (in the period of&#xD;
           previous 52 weeks) and at the 24th and 52nd week of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral Corticosteroids use dose (documented at qualification for the treatment and at the&#xD;
           24th and 52nd week of the treatment).&#xD;

      This study is aimed at evaluation of the efficacy of mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who have been treated for at least 12 months in&#xD;
      several Polish allergy/asthma centres under the same protocol. Retrospective multicentre&#xD;
      observational study will involve 130 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma ( SEA ) who&#xD;
      have been treated in six Severe Asthma Treatment Centres ( SATCs) in Poland. In each SATC all&#xD;
      data available in the program questionnaires will be transferred to the Study Data Sheet&#xD;
      (questionnaire), and will be send to the study coordinator within 5 months from the study&#xD;
      beginning The start-up meeting including partners from all centres involved will be organized&#xD;
      to discuss the study protocol and to unify data collection The evaluation parameters&#xD;
      (exacerbations rate, OCS dose) will be analysed at least at three time points: pre-MEPO,&#xD;
      after 24 weeks of MEPO and after 1 year of MEPO administration (some of the outcomes will be&#xD;
      observed every 4 weeks, for the details see 'study endpoints' section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the following parameters which are available in patients' records will be&#xD;
      analysed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACQ-5 score (measured at qualification for the treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AQLQ score (measured at qualification for the treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (measured at qualification for the treatment and every 4 weeks&#xD;
           thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research activities will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  collecting raw data from the clinical centres (paper version) and constructing a raw&#xD;
           dataset (digital version),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data cleaning, computation of variables,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  statistical analysis typical for pre-post study design (the statistical analysis will be&#xD;
           outsourced to the specialized private institute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical improvements observed at 24 weeks and at 52 weeks of treatment with Mepolizumab will&#xD;
      be referred to the following characteristics of patients at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of comorbidities including the atopic status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical status,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  eosinophilia. We will control for mepolizumab use regarding dose, treatment duration and&#xD;
           dosing frequency as well as for the safety profile based on the AEs reporting in the&#xD;
           medical documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source / Data Collection Patients recruited to the study had been treated with&#xD;
      mepolizumab between December 2017 and December 2019.All the data planned to be used in the&#xD;
      proposed study were systematically collected in the form of the clinical documentation (paper&#xD;
      version) and will be transferred in the study centres into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sheets. Collaborating Researchers (Severe Asthma Centres' Leaders) will provide the data&#xD;
      input into the dedicated online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population 130 Patients who were treated with mepolizumab in six severe-asthma clinics&#xD;
      in Poland between December 2017 and December 2019 . In the drug program in Poland it was&#xD;
      mandatory to conduct the control examinations at the 24th and 52nd week of the treatment . In&#xD;
      the proposed study we will use this information to evaluate study endpoints. Only patients&#xD;
      who have been treated for at least 52 weeks are included into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables concerning the primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asthma exacerbations measured at qualification for the treatment (in the period of&#xD;
           previous 52 weeks) and at the 24th and 52nd week of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral Corticosteroids use dose (documented at qualification for the treatment and at the&#xD;
           24th and 52nd week of the treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables concerning the secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACQ-5 score (measured at qualification for the treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AQLQ score (measured at qualification for the treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (measured at qualification for the treatment and every 4 weeks&#xD;
           thereafter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood eosinophil counts (measured at qualification for the treatment and at the 24th and&#xD;
           52nd week of the treatment)&#xD;
