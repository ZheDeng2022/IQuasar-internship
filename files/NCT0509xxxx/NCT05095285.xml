  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the preterm babies in neonatal units are followed up with invasive mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation support. For this reason, endotracheal suction is needed repeatedly in preterm&#xD;
      babies in order to open the airway obstruction caused by secretions and to maintain the&#xD;
      airway patency. Endotracheal aspiration, which is one of the invasive procedures in which&#xD;
      pain is felt most in newborns, is performed by nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endotracheal suction, which causes pain and discomfort in intensive care units, negatively&#xD;
      affects the comfort of patients. Studies emphasize that comfort is an indicator of pain and&#xD;
      stress, and the comfort scale is also used in pain and distress assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pain management and the development of pain-related care standards to reduce pain&#xD;
      in preterm newborn infants improve clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. For this reason,&#xD;
      it is necessary to reduce the pain that has an effect on the development of preterm babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatric nursing, studies on non-pharmacological methods have increased in recent years&#xD;
      in order to increase the comfort of infants and reduce pain and stress, especially during&#xD;
      painful and stressful procedures in infants followed in neonatal intensive care units. When&#xD;
      the literature is examined, there are few studies measuring the effectiveness of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods used in reducing pain due to endotracheal suction. There are&#xD;
      differences in the effectiveness of the methods applied in the existing studies. Therefore,&#xD;
      more observation, research and scientific studies by neonatal nurses are needed to reduce the&#xD;
      pain associated with endotracheal suction in preterm newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, swaddling and oropharyngeal colostrum, which are two non-pharmacological&#xD;
      methods, will be applied during endotracheal suction to preterm newborns receiving invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation support. This experimental study was planned to determine the effect&#xD;
      of these two non-pharmacological methods on procedural pain and comfort and to contribute to&#xD;
      evidence-based nursing practices.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted experimentally in randomized controlled trials to determine the&#xD;
      effect of two non-pharmacological methods, swaddling and oropharyngeal colostrum on&#xD;
      procedural pain and comfort during endotracheal suction (ES) in premature neonates. The&#xD;
      population of the study was intubated premature neonates hospitalized in NICU in two&#xD;
      foundation university hospitals between July 2019 and October 2020. The study sample&#xD;
      consisted of 48 babies who met the sample selection criteria. Descriptive Characteristics&#xD;
      Form, Premature Infant Intervention Follow-up Form, Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised&#xD;
      (PIPP-R) and Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale (COMFORTneo) were used in data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two minutes before the ES procedure, babies were swaddled or 0.4 ml of oropharyngeal&#xD;
      colostrum was given, depending on the group in which they were involved. Physiological&#xD;
      parameters (heart rate, respiration, saturation) of the babies were recorded before, during&#xD;
      and after the procedure, and PIPP-R and COMFORTneo scores were given by two observers by&#xD;
      video recording.&#xD;

Common procedure steps:&#xD;
Legal representatives of the infants will sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
İncubator cover and nesting&#xD;
Endotracheal suction(ES) was performed in the supine position.&#xD;
ES was done at the time of care the baby needed.&#xD;
No painful procedure was applied until 2 hours before ES and 15 minutes after ES.&#xD;
Aspiration was performed sterile at 80 mmHg pressure.&#xD;
A second nurse assisted in the suction process and the procedure took no more than 15 seconds.&#xD;
The amount of oxygen taken by the baby was increased by 10% 30 seconds before the suction procedure and returned to its original value 60 seconds after the procedure.&#xD;
Beginning 3 minutes before the ES procedure, during the procedure and until 15 minutes after the procedure, the infants' behaviors and bedside monitor indicators were video recorded.</description>
