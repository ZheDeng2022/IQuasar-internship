  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) is an&#xD;
      FDA approved treatment for medication refractory essential tremor (ET). However, VIM&#xD;
      stimulation can be associated with impacts on speech and balance. There is also suggestion&#xD;
      that there may be habituation to stimulation in more than half of these patients. Stimulation&#xD;
      of the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) has been found to be beneficial in tremor control as&#xD;
      well. In fact, there is thought that the improvement in tremor in standard VIM DBS&#xD;
      stimulation may be related to stimulation effects on the PSA. Updates in DBS stimulation&#xD;
      allow to stimulate more than one area of the brain independently, while using a single lead.&#xD;
      In this study, we will recruit patient who are referred for VIM DBS to a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over trial in which they will receive VIM, PSA, or dual stimulation. We will assess&#xD;
      tremor qualitatively and quantitatively, in addition to evaluating side effects, including&#xD;
      quantitative gait analysis on each setting. The pre-operative, operative, and initial&#xD;
      programming evaluation will be performed per standard of care. After baseline assessment and&#xD;
      initial programming, subjects will be evaluated in a blinded manner after they have been on&#xD;
      each setting for 2 weeks. The entire duration of the study from baseline visit through final&#xD;
      study visit will be 17 weeks. For subjects who are clinically evaluated in our outpatient&#xD;
      clinics, we will review their charts at 6 months for stimulation parameters and clinical&#xD;
      information as it relates to their tremor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential Tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder. It is estimated that between 25&#xD;
      and 55% of patients with ET will have a tremor which is refractory to pharmacotherapy&#xD;
      necessitating advanced therapeutic options to control tremor. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is&#xD;
      one such option and has been FDA approved for ET since 1997 with the ventral intermediate&#xD;
      nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) as a target. Over the past twenty years, DBS has become the&#xD;
      standard of care for patients with treatment-refractory motor circuit disorders such as&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and essential tremor. A study reviewing the United States&#xD;
      database hospital discharges from 2002 to 2011 showed that more than 30,000 DBS surgeries&#xD;
      were performed during this time, 22% were for ET and the other 78% for Parkinson's Disease. A&#xD;
      study done at Columbia University Medical Center estimated that about 1 in 34 ET patients&#xD;
      undergo DBS surgery. DBS is highly effective at controlling motor symptoms and improvement in&#xD;
      tremor with DBS in ET patients has been reported to be between 47.4% and 65.4%. However,&#xD;
      there are limitations to stimulation in regard to adverse effects, such as dysarthria, gait&#xD;
      imbalance, ataxia, etc. Additionally, some reviews suggest a loss of benefit in more than&#xD;
      half, and as high as 73%, of individuals at a mean interval of approximately 18 months.&#xD;
      Although DBS is relatively safe and effective, alternative surgical treatments include&#xD;
      lesional therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, radiosurgery, and&#xD;
      magnetic-resonance-guided focused ultrasonography. DBS still remains the standard of choice&#xD;
      given ability to adjust stimulation over time or to turn it off if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the VIM, the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) has emerged as a potential&#xD;
      alternative target for ET. The PSA contains the Zona incerta (Zi) and prelemniscal radiation&#xD;
      (Raprl) and has previously been targeted in subthalamotomies for tremor control. It is&#xD;
      believed that the cerebellothalamic connections of the PSA are involved in tremor and that&#xD;
      the somatotopic organization of the PSA allows for improvement in proximal tremor control, in&#xD;
      particular. From a stimulation perspective, results published in the literature have&#xD;
      suggested that the PSA may be equivalent, and possibly superior to the VIM, in terms of&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit. The PSA was targeted in a case series of patients with severe proximal&#xD;
      tremor specifically, and found to have beneficial impact. The VIM is located dorsal to the&#xD;
      PSA which allows for access to both structures with a single electrode and in fact, review of&#xD;
      VIM lead locations and optimal contacts for tremor control have shown better tremor control&#xD;
      with more ventral contacts, which are more likely stimulating the PSA, to have superior&#xD;
      tremor control than that achieved with thalamic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single small study evaluated the surgical approach of targeting both VIM and PSA with a&#xD;
      single electrode for dual stimulation and found this to be a feasible surgical procedure.&#xD;
      This study showed equivalent outcomes for VIM, PSA, and VIM+PSA but this was a small&#xD;
      unblinded study with only 8 patients. Another small study assessing 17 patients with ET and&#xD;
      DBS of both VIM and PSA in one surgical trajectory found that intraoperatively, PSA&#xD;
      stimulation offered superior tremor control compared to VIM in 88% of aligned trajectories.&#xD;
      Dysarthria and gait ataxia were side effects seen in both VIM and PSA stimulation. Successful&#xD;
      tremor control was achieved in 69% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our center, we have a series of patients with longstanding ET who initially had&#xD;
      considerable improvement of tremor following DBS of the VIM only. Although this benefit was&#xD;
      sustained for several years, these patients had re-emergence of their tremor requiring&#xD;
      increasing stimulation over time as well as reintroduction of pharmacotherapy for tremor&#xD;
      control. Higher stimulation was limited by adverse effects in the form of dysarthria and&#xD;
      ataxia. Given the significant disability from their tremors, and the availability of newer&#xD;
      DBS leads with more contacts and the availability of complex stimulation options, these&#xD;
      individuals underwent replacement of their existing VIM DBS leads with longer leads targeting&#xD;
      both the VIM and PSA in one surgical trajectory as salvage therapy. Retrospective review of&#xD;
      these cases show that the reduction in tremor was higher for those receiving concurrent VIM&#xD;
      and PSA stimulation compared to VIM or PSA alone. Others had a reduction in their tremor but&#xD;
      were still functionally limited as even with considerable reduction in tremor amplitude,&#xD;
      there was still a robust tremor present. However, this is a small case series of severely&#xD;
      refractory ET and broad generalizations cannot be made. Therefore, we propose a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, cross-over trial of DBS for ET quantitatively assessing whether dual stimulation&#xD;
      of VIM and PSA is superior to VIM or PSA alone in terms of the various tremor components of&#xD;
      ET (i.e. proximal v. distal limb tremor), quality of life measures, and side effect profile.&#xD;
      We postulate that since two targets involved in tremor control will be stimulated&#xD;
      simultaneously, lower current will be needed at each target which should limit involvement of&#xD;
      adjacent pathways which are typically recruited with higher stimulation and lead to side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not be an evaluation of a new surgical target or trajectory, as the patients&#xD;
      eligible to be recruited for this study will already be candidates for VIM+PSA DBS, which are&#xD;
      closely positioned and connected structures often affected simultaneously by DBS depending on&#xD;
      lead placement and targeting of stimulation. This study will only be examining the separate&#xD;
      and combined affected of stimulation within these two structures using the more accurate&#xD;
      targeting available with GuideXT software.&#xD;
