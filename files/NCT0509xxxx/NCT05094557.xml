    <description>Stages and processes of change in weight management (S-Weight and P-Weight). Lower scores on this scale reflect no use of a given process of change and higher scores reflect the full use of that process. To make scores from the different subscales comparable, these scores are transformed on a scale ranging from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18 (TFEQ-R18). The questionnaire assesses three different aspects of eating behaviour: (a) cognitive restraint (CR); (b) uncontrolled eating (UE) and (c) emotional eating (EE). The questionnaire consists of 18 items using a 4-point response scale which ranges from 1 (definitely true) to 4 (definitely false) and items scores are summated into the 3 different subscales: CR, UE and EE. Lower scores show more disordered eating while higher scores show healthier eating behaviour.</description>

    <measure>Eating habits II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0); Post-Intervention (week 6)- Baseline; 1-week follow-up (week 7)- Baseline; 4-week follow-up (week 11)- Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Lifestyle habits questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 22 items, each one of which is rated using a 5-poing Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (always), with higher scores indicated better lifestyle habits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological well-being I</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0); Post-Intervention (week 6)- Baseline; 1-week follow-up (week 7)- Baseline; 4-week follow-up (week 11)- Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The questionnaire consists of 14 items, 7 for anxiety and 7 for depression, and is used to detect the presence and severity of anxiety and depression among people with physical illnesses. The HADS is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, with the total score ranging from 0 to 42. Higher scores indicate a greater level of distress.</description>

    <measure>Psychological well-being II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0); Post-Intervention (week 6)- Baseline; 1-week follow-up (week 7)- Baseline; 4-week follow-up (week 11)- Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ). The BSQ is a 10-item self-report instrument, derived from the original 34-item version developed by Cooper, Taylor, Cooper, &amp; Fairbum (1987), which assesses concerns about body shape expressed by clinical and non-clinical samples. It is based on a 6-point Likert scale questions (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Very Often, and Always) with higher scores indicating higher body dissatisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Psychological well-being III</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0); Post-Intervention (week 6)- Baseline; 1-week follow-up (week 7)- Baseline; 4-week follow-up (week 11)- Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Body Image QoL Inventory (BIQLI-SP). The BIQLI is a 19-item instrument designed to quantify the impact of one's body image experiences on several relevant facets of his/her psychosocial functioning and wellbeing in everyday life. The instrument uses a 7-point bipolar scale ranging from -3 (very negative effect) to 0 (no impact) to +3 (very positive impact), with higher scores indicating better psychological well-being in everyday life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological well-being IV</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0); Post-Intervention (week 6)- Baseline; 1-week follow-up (week 7)- Baseline; 4-week follow-up (week 11)- Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS-M). The WBIS-M is a self-report 11-item unidimensional scale that is considered one of the most frequently used instruments for assessing internalized weight stigma across different body weight categories, in both clinical and research settings. Each answer is rated using a 7-point Liker scale, ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree) with higher scores indicating higher internalized weight bias. Items 1 and 9 are reverse scored.</description>

    <description>Suitability Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ). The SEQ is a 14-item questionnaire designed to measure satisfaction, acceptance and security of use in VR systems and it was specifically designed for rehabilitation systems using VR. Thirteen questions of the SEQ are based on a 6-point Likert scale plus a last open-ended question offering participants the possibility to add comments, if necessary. The global score of SEQ ranges from 13 (poor suitability) to 65 (excellent suitability).</description>

    <description>Participants from the Experimental Group 1 will engage in a self-conversation through embodied perspective taking (body swapping), according to which they will be embodied alternately in their own virtual representation and in their counsellor's virtual body. They will also continue receiving Treatment As usual plus a Psychoeducational video with useful information about how to engage with a healthier lifestyle.</description>

    <description>Participants from the Control Group will receive their Treatment As Usual plus a Psychoeducational video. Treatment as usual will consist of regular medical, nutritional and/or psychiatric follow-ups with the obesity specialists of the Vall d´ Hebron University Hospital and standard routine tests. These visits aim to provide practical recommendations about how to achieve a gradual weight loss and engage more with physical exercise.</description>

    <intervention_name>Experimental Group 1: Enhanced VR intervention with body swapping + psychoeducational video + Treatment As usual</intervention_name>
    <description>The patient will be embodied in his/her own avatar and will maintain a conversation with a counsellor's avatar of his/her choice. Once the experiment starts, the patient, embodied in his/her own body, will start describing his/her problem in terms of subjective experiences of being obese in daily life. Then, he/she will be body swapped to the counsellor's body and try to respond to the problem just manifested by the patient. The crucial aspect here is that the patient, from the counsellor's viewpoint, will see a representation of his/her real body when looking at the patient's avatar speaking and moving. Therefore, the patient will have the opportunity to see himself/herself in first person (1PP) and second person (2PP) perspectives.</description>

    <description>Participants from the Experimental Group 2 will be embodied in their own body and will participate in a &quot;scripted dialogue&quot; with the chosen counsellor that will ask about the perceived barriers for engagement with a healthier lifestyle and will give practical recommendations about how to achieve a healthier and happier life, in terms of healthy eating and physical activity. No body swapping will take place for this group. Participants will also continue receiving Treatment As usual plus a Psychoeducational video with useful information about how to engage with a healthier lifestyle.</description>
