  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calorie-restricted(CR) diet and exercise were effective to reduce Metabolic syndrome(MetS),&#xD;
      however, its effect on knee functions for MetS patients with degenerate meniscus tears(DMTs)&#xD;
      was still poorly investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CR diet and exercise group received a balanced diet with an energy consists carbohydrates&#xD;
      45-65%; fat 20-35%; and protein 10- 35% and a deficit of 600 kcal/day from their daily energy&#xD;
      requirement [23]. The energy intake per day of the calorie restricted diet was calculated&#xD;
      based on the detailed composition of meals such as rice, vegetables, eggs, pork, and beef,&#xD;
      using the Chinese food composition tables[24]. Our diets were cooked with traditional Chinese&#xD;
      cooking methods such as boiling, stir-frying, and stewing. During the intervention, other&#xD;
      lipid-lowering drugs were not allowed to intake supplement as it alters the outcome.&#xD;
      Participants were guided by a dietitian for modulations of their caloric intake weekly for&#xD;
      six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise intervention consists of aerobic exercises and resistance exercise, flexibility&#xD;
      exercises about 150 minutes for≥2 d•wk for six months. The aerobic exercises included walking&#xD;
      on a treadmill, stationary cycling for at least 30 minutes for≥2 d•wk, while, resistance&#xD;
      exercises included nine upper-extremity and lower-extremity exercise with weighting lift&#xD;
      machines for ≥2 d•wk, while, flexibility exercise including the major muscle-tendon groups (a&#xD;
      total of 60 s per exercise) for ≥2 d•wk. Participants performed 1 or 2 sets with 8-12&#xD;
      repetitions of each exercise. The exercise sessions were monitored by telephone video.&#xD;
      Calorie restricted diet and exercise group contain both the above intervention for 6 months.&#xD;
