      Studying the genetic effect of Vitamin D administration on assisted reproductive outcomes in&#xD;
      women undergoing Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) by giving a dose of vitamin D and&#xD;
      determining the effect of this dose on both the quality embryos, implantation and ongoing&#xD;
      pregnancy rate.&#xD;

      1. NintyNinety women will include in the study. All patients will be treated with&#xD;
           gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist &quot;Decapeptyl&quot; 0.1 mg&#xD;
           subcutenoussubcutaneous &quot;FeringFerring, Germany&quot; and vitamin D from day 20 of the&#xD;
           preceding cycle till the day of HCG administration for preparation of ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Controlled ovarian hyper stimulation will be done with Gonal F &quot;recombinant FSH&quot;,&#xD;
           starting from day 3 of the stimulation cycle according to the standard protocol of the&#xD;
           center. The dose is calculated according to the ovarian reserve, age as the BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HCG and Vitamin D will be given when one or more of the growing follicles reaching 17 mm&#xD;
           of diameter or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ovum pickup was done guided by the transvaginal ultrasonography 34-36 hours after HCG&#xD;
           administration. Follicular fluid and blood sample were obtained at the time of ovum&#xD;
           pickup for ICSI/IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. This prospective randomized case control trial will include 90 women who will be&#xD;
           allocated IVF/ICSI. They will be sub divided into a study and a control group; each&#xD;
           group will include 45 women.&#xD;
