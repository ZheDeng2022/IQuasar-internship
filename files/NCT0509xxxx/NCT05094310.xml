      Genetic predictors of response to acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer&#xD;
      patients after chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer related fatigue(CRF) in patients with breast cancer has a great impact on their&#xD;
      quality of life and treatment compliance. Many studies suggest that acupuncture has certain&#xD;
      therapeutic effects on fatigue. In this clinical trial, we treated patients with acupuncture&#xD;
      to alleviate their fatigue symptoms. Currently, studies have shown that cancer related&#xD;
      fatigue in breast cancer patients is related to some biological factors. While acupuncture is&#xD;
      used to treat fatigue, we will collect blood samples from patients for fatigue related single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms（SNP）.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on CRF related biological factors, our study aims to screen SNPs that related to CRF&#xD;
      related biological factors to guide electroacupuncture in the treatment of cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue and establish a prognostic model.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with breast cancer who experienced fatigue were measured by the Brief Fatigue Inventory(BFI) scale and other Fatigue related questionnaire. Breast cancer patients diagnosed with cancer related fatigue are included in our clinical study，and those patients will receive acupuncture treatment. The position of acupuncture refers to the principle of acupuncture treatment of traditional Chinese medicine. According to ICD-10-CD code R53.0, the diagnosis of CRF is determined by the experience of diminished energy or other physical and psychological symptoms every day or almost every day for two consecutive weeks in the past month. We collected patients' blood to detect fatigue related SNP.</description>
