      Regular physical activity at a mild to moderate intensity can control inflammation in general&#xD;
      and intestinal inflammation in particular during IBD. The effectiveness of a physical&#xD;
      activity programme has been evaluated during IBD, but the data are limited to a few studies.&#xD;
      Overall, PA improves quality of life but also improves control of disease symptoms and&#xD;
      fatigue . The aim of the present work is to evaluate the impact of a physical activity&#xD;
      programme on quality of life in patients with IBD. This programme will also evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of physical activity on 1) anxiety-depression, 2) fatigue (a frequent and difficult to&#xD;
      manage symptom in IBD), 3) IBD activity, 4) smoking cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and haemorrhagic rectocolitis are Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (CIBD)&#xD;
      which evolve by flare-ups interspersed with periods of remission . The incidence of these two&#xD;
      diseases is increasing in France in adults but also and especially in children and&#xD;
      adolescents. Indeed, according to data from the EPIMAD registry, from 1988-1990 to 2009-2011,&#xD;
      a significant increase in the incidence of both Crohn's disease and haemorrhagic rectocolitis&#xD;
      was observed in adolescents (10-16 years): for Crohn's disease from 4.2 to 9.5/10 5 (+126%; P&#xD;
      &lt;0.001) and for UC from 1.6 to 4.1/10 5 (+156%; P &lt;0.001). Over the long term, Crohn's&#xD;
      disease can progress to intestinal destruction that can be complicated by stricture(s),&#xD;
      obstruction(s), fistula(s) and/or abscesses leading to surgical treatment estimated at 50%&#xD;
      after 10 years of Crohn's disease progression 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-TNFα therapies are widely prescribed for Crohn's disease because they control symptoms,&#xD;
      heal the mucosa, reduce hospital admissions and improve quality of life. However, they are&#xD;
      associated with side effects often reported by patients, such as asthenia, weight gain and&#xD;
      joint pain, symptoms that could be improved by regular physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity at a mild to moderate intensity can control inflammation in general&#xD;
      and intestinal inflammation in particular during IBD. The effectiveness of a physical&#xD;
      activity programme has been evaluated during IBD, but the data are limited to a few studies.&#xD;
      Overall, PA improves quality of life but also improves control of disease symptoms and&#xD;
      fatigue . The aim of the present work is to evaluate the impact of a physical activity&#xD;
      programme on quality of life in patients with IBD. This programme will also evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of physical activity on 1) anxiety-depression, 2) fatigue (a frequent and difficult to&#xD;
      manage symptom in IBD), 3) IBD activity, 4) smoking cessation.&#xD;
