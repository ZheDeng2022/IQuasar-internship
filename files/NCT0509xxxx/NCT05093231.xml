    <description>Pembrolizumab is a highly selective immunoglobulin G4-kappa humanised monoclonal antibody against Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor. It was generated by grafting the variable sequences of a very high-affinity mouse antihuman PD-1 antibody onto a human IgG4-kappa isotype with the containing a stabilizing Serine 228 to Proline Fc mutation.</description>
