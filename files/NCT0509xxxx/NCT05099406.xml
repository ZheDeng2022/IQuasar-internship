  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory chronic pain represents a serious and limiting health condition which does not&#xD;
      respond to standard pharmacological therapy. Thus, it emerges the necessity of new techniques&#xD;
      to treat these group of diseases, such as the transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). This&#xD;
      procedure induces a low-intensity electrical current through the scalp to modify the&#xD;
      excitability of brain cells, thus facilitating changes in neural networks which may be&#xD;
      dysfunctional in some chronic pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this research is to test the efficacy of two tES techniques,&#xD;
      differentiated by applying direct or alternant electrical current, to reduce the pain&#xD;
      intensity and to increase pain thresholds of these patients. Besides, intervention is&#xD;
      implemented at home for patients themselves thanks to a portable and convenient stimulator&#xD;
      device, after one training session provided by technicians. Researches can supervise the&#xD;
      compliance of the treatment remotely, as the stimulator has a permanent connection with their&#xD;
      computers. A home-based approach means a more comfortable and accessible treatment&#xD;
      alternative for patients, since they do not have to attend to clinics everyday to receive the&#xD;
      stimulation; the advantages become even more relevant in the pandemic context, since the risk&#xD;
      of being infected is radically minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the main purpose is to test the efficacy of tES to improve the pain suffered by&#xD;
      patients, many other areas are considered as secondary end points for being intrinsically&#xD;
      linked or affected by the disease, such as the interference in daily tasks provoked by pain,&#xD;
      mood disorders (depression/anxiety), fatigue, life quality, physical functioning and sleep&#xD;
      quality; these last two variables are measured with actigraph wristwatches, apart from&#xD;
      specific questionnaires. Lastly, endogenous modulatory pain mechanisms are examined through&#xD;
      sensory tests, namely Conditioned Pain Modulation and Temporal Summation of pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This work aims to provide answers to the refractory chronic pain challenge. Pain is defined&#xD;
      as refractory when multiple evidence-based biomedical therapies have failed to reach&#xD;
      treatment goals that may include adequate pain reduction and/or improvement in daily&#xD;
      functioning, even after appropriately assessing and addressing those psychosocial factors&#xD;
      that could influence pain outcomes. In this sense, on the one hand, the study focus on&#xD;
      detecting central biomarkers of pain modulation and processing which will contribute to&#xD;
      improving knowledge of the mechanisms of pain chronification and the diagnosis procedure. On&#xD;
      the other hand, given the low efficacy of pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies&#xD;
      for the patients studied, the efficacy of new therapeutic alternatives (tES) is explored. In&#xD;
      short, the project will allow the transfer of knowledge to clinical practice in several&#xD;
      aspects, such as diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the research aims to test the role of defective central pain modulation/processing&#xD;
      as explanatory mechanisms for chronic pain. A second main objective is to test the efficacy&#xD;
      of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) to modify dysfunction of central mechanism of&#xD;
      pain, and to improve symptoms and quality of life in refractory chronic pain patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, the investigators will select valid and reliable instruments to assess pain&#xD;
      and comorbid symptoms in chronic pain patients and the most sensitive outcome measures to&#xD;
      assess tES treatment efficacy. Sensory testing paradigms, namely Conditioned Pain Modulation,&#xD;
      Temporal Summation of Second Pain and pain-related evoked potentials using&#xD;
      electroencephalographic recordings, will act as biomarkers which are proposed to correlate&#xD;
      with the severity of the chronic pain disease or some of their symptoms, and also as&#xD;
      predictors of the treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample includes 120 patients with refractory pharmaco-resistant pain, attended at the&#xD;
      Pain Units of two Public Galician Hospitals (36 male, 84 female).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to contribute to detection and preventive measures of future pain, and&#xD;
      diagnosis of chronic pain disorders, improving prognosis and development of feasible&#xD;
      patient-centered interventions, providing new directions for future research on pain.&#xD;

Tentatively, we will use the cold water immersion of the non-dominant hand as conditioning stimuli; whereas the test stimuli will be the pressure pain thresholds using a digital handhold algometer, which puts progressively heavier pressure over the lateral area of dominant forearm. Differences in pressure pain threshold between the standard condition and when the CS is applied is assumed as an index of pain inhibitory response. Negative values are indicative of a greater pain inhibitory response.</description>

    <description>By applying a low current over the cortex through the scalp, this technique can excite or inhibit the neural activity, thus modulating brain processes like pain perception and inducing relatively sustained changes in cortical excitability and neuroplasticity.&#xD;
Home-based transcranial electrical stimulation device consists of a custom headgear with fixed electrode sites and built-in cabling made for a simplistic setup for tDCS/tACS stimulation. Systems are equipped with strict dose control feature that provide reliable control over the intensity and timing of stimulation, turning these devices into a feasible and safe clinical alternative. The equipment is specifically designed for easy and simplistic self-setup and allows the researchers to remotely check the position of electrodes and also monitor the stimulation session.</description>
