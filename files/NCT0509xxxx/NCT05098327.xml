  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to establish the mechanisms underlying insulin resistance (reduced&#xD;
      insulin action that can lead to high blood sugar and maybe diabetes) in patients undergoing&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate carcinoma as well as to investigate the role&#xD;
      of pioglitazone therapy in reduction/ reversal of that insulin resistance&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, cross-sectional then prospective, randomized single-blinded study&#xD;
      with 2 groups of subjects. One group will be men with prostate cancer in various stages of&#xD;
      ADT and the other group will be men with prostate cancer not on ADT as control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients interested in participating who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and who agree&#xD;
      to undergo blood draws and fat biopsy will be identified from the Genito-urinary oncology and&#xD;
      urology clinics. These patients will be referred to the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research&#xD;
      Center of WNY where they will undergo blood draws in fasting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the screening day, participants will be asked to complete the informed consent, medical&#xD;
      history and physical exam, and non-fasting blood draws (for CBC, CMP and HbA1c) prior to&#xD;
      participating in the study. 30 ml of blood will be drawn at this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who qualify and consent to take part in the study will be called in for the baseline&#xD;
      study visit where they will undergo blood draws in fasting state. HOMA-IR method will be used&#xD;
      to determine insulin resistance. Subcutaneous fat biopsies will be performed in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the ADT group, subjects will be assigned a number by a computerized simple random&#xD;
      number generation program (Excel, Microsoft Inc.) and will be randomized (1:1) to receive&#xD;
      either pioglitazone or placebo. The patient will be blinded to the treatment, however, the&#xD;
      research team will not. Subjects will be given a 12 week supply of pioglitazone 30 mg or&#xD;
      placebo pills containing cellulose that will take once a day in morning. Subjects who develop&#xD;
      side effects (weight gain, pedal edema) on the 30 mg dose will be asked to reduce the dose to&#xD;
      15 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then return to the research center in 12 weeks for visit 2 where the fasting&#xD;
      blood draws and subcutaneous fat biopsies will be performed again. The subjects will then be&#xD;
      discharged from the study and follow with their physicians. Subject will receive a phone call&#xD;
      after 1 and 4 weeks following start of treatment to collect any safety data. Patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to call the research center anytime they have a question or side effects.&#xD;
