    <textblock>
      This is a transversal study allowing to compare the effect of volume expansion by saline&#xD;
      versus albumin on the correction of peripheral tissue hypoperfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • A multicentric, open-label, transversal study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size :&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 6 and 48 hours after admission, the patient will be included after information and&#xD;
      collection of non-opposition. The patient will receive volume expansion either by 0.9% saline&#xD;
      (500mL) or by 20% albumin (100mL) over 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated clinical measurements will be performed every 30 minutes for 4 hours. A blood sample&#xD;
      will be taken just before the volume expansion and 4 hours after, at the same time as the&#xD;
      samples usually taken as part of the standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis is planned. Analysis will be performed at the end of the study after data&#xD;
      review and freezing of data base.&#xD;

        The study will be performed in patients with septic shock hospitalized in intensive care&#xD;
        with signs of peripheral hypoperfusion persisting despite the initial resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be eligible after 6 hours of management of septic shock, necessary for&#xD;
        diagnostic management and hemodynamic optimization according to international standards&#xD;
        including control of the source of infection, administration of antibiotics, volume&#xD;
        expansion by crystalloids of at least 20 mL / kg and finally the administration of&#xD;
        norepinephrine to maintain a MAP&gt; 65mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hemodynamic stabilization is defined as no increase in the dose of norepinephrine for at&#xD;
        least 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In total, patients with reanimated and hemodynamically stabilized septic shock will be&#xD;
        included. The diagnostic and therapeutic management will comply in all points with the&#xD;
        usual service protocol and&#xD;
