  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19. Today, RT-PCR performed on a nasopharyngeal sample&#xD;
      remains the gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, several other assays&#xD;
      have been developed to increase testing capabilities and provide rapid screening strategies&#xD;
      such as antigenic lateral flow assays. Most recommended tests to date are based&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal sampling that is often poorly tolerated by patients and associated with a&#xD;
      significant risk of infection for the sampler. Saliva can be used but provide slightly lower&#xD;
      sensitivities depending of the subsequent assay use with those samples. The detection of the&#xD;
      N antigen of SARS-CoV-2, by ELISA or rapid immunochromatographic technique, on a serum or&#xD;
      blood sample would make it possible to overcome these constraints and to provide a new&#xD;
      testing alternative. ELISA tests are faster, cheaper and easier to automate than molecular&#xD;
      biology approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling may be easier to perform in certain populations (in particular in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients who already benefit from blood sampling, blood donors, etc.), require less&#xD;
      equipment, and is better tolerated (immunocompromised patients subject to blood sampling&#xD;
      repeated), and can be integrated more systematically into assessments carried out at the&#xD;
      entrance to hospitals or in town, etc. If the N-antigen levels in blood are sufficient, rapid&#xD;
      antigen assay on capillary blood could also provide useful testing alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study conducted at Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital, the sensitivity of the first&#xD;
      available commercial test was estimated at 93% (95% CI, 84.7-100), and its specificity at 98%&#xD;
      (95% CI, 85.3-100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current work is to evaluate the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 N&#xD;
      antigen detection in the serum compared to nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR in several&#xD;
      populations such as symptomatic hospitalized patients, symptomatic non-hospitalized patients&#xD;
      and asymptomatic subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each detection kit evaluated, the primary endpoint is the sensitivity (and its 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval) of the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen in serum overall and in those&#xD;
      populations. The specificity will also be assess.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 pathology. Since the emergence of the virus in&#xD;
      China at the end of 2019, the virus has become pandemic and responsible for constant epidemic&#xD;
      waves since 2020. France was hit by a first epidemic wave from February to April 2020. This&#xD;
      epidemic wave could only be stopped by the implementation of national containment. The virus&#xD;
      continues to circulate in France and has been accelerating since the end of August in the&#xD;
      general population. The fight against this expansion and new waves aims to slow the viral&#xD;
      expansion, to allow the development of new knowledge, treatments and vaccine approaches, as&#xD;
      well as to limit the use of intensive care units, so as not to exceed their reception&#xD;
      capacities. This fight involves in particular the use of broad and rapid screening practices&#xD;
      in the general population in the event of symptoms, events inducing at risk contacts or&#xD;
      travel. Today, gold standard assays are the reference methods of RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swabs. The general population still has great difficulties in finding an available screening&#xD;
      center and obtaining a result in a short time, allowing effective isolation and investigation&#xD;
      of cases. Alternatives are being used to increase testing capabilities: (i) detection of the&#xD;
      N antigen on a nasopharyngeal sample, however with less sensitivity than RT-PCR (ii) saliva&#xD;
      sampling but mostly limited, in France, to children population as less sensitive than&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, only RT-PCR performed on a nasopharyngeal sample therefore remains the reference&#xD;
      technique for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. This method has several flaws, in particular&#xD;
      for mass screening. Thus, (i) RT-PCR can only be carried out in laboratories suitable for&#xD;
      molecular biology approaches, limiting the number of centers and sometimes imposing&#xD;
      significant transport delays; (ii) RT-PCR is a technique requiring long turn around times,&#xD;
      rarely compatible with rapid screening strategies; (iii) RT-PCR is relatively expensive; (iv)&#xD;
      the nasopharyngeal sample is a sample that is often poorly tolerated by patients and&#xD;
      associated with a non-negligible risk of infection for the medical staff performing the&#xD;
      sampling. Several other approaches have been evaluated to overcome these difficulties.&#xD;
      Antigenic detection of SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab: these approaches were authorized by&#xD;
      the French HAS authorities for symptomatic patients. The sensitivity is more limited than&#xD;
      with RT-PCR approaches and still potentially infectious viral loads (between 25 and 33 Ct)&#xD;
      may not be detected. PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 on saliva sample allow to avoid the&#xD;
      constraints of nasopharyngeal samples but present a sensitivity issue, especially in patients&#xD;
      with little or no symptoms. Recently, a new approach, based on the detection of the N antigen&#xD;
      of the virus in a blood sample, has been described. The first commercially available method&#xD;
      was evaluated at the Virology laboratory at Bichat Hospital in the case of a retrospective&#xD;
      study on frozen serum samples. This innovative approach shows satisfactory sensitivity in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. Sensitivity was estimated to be 93.0% (95% CI: 84.7-100) within the&#xD;
      first 14 days after symptom onset among 165 patients tested with PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
      The sensitivity was better for high viral loads (49 positives out of 50 with a viral load &lt;30&#xD;
      Ct obtained in the same 24 hours as the serum sample). The specificity, estimated on 63&#xD;
      non-COVID patients, was 98.4% (95% CI: 85.3 to 100). This first study included few&#xD;
      outpatients&#xD;
