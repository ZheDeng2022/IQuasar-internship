    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem major cardiovascular disease of pregnancy with hypertension&#xD;
      its main clinical manifestation. Acute pulmonary edema, which signifies severe disease, is a&#xD;
      leading cause of death in women with pre-eclampsia, and is a frequent cause for admission to&#xD;
      an intensive care unit&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Outside pregnancy, transthoracic cardiac ultrasound (echocardiography) and lung ultrasound&#xD;
      have become important diagnostic and monitoring tools in critically ill patients.&#xD;
      Echocardiography allows a rapid and non-invasive assessment of myocardial contractility and&#xD;
      preload, and lung ultrasound can be used to determine the amount of extravascular lung water&#xD;
      (EVLW).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pregnancy, there is evidence of a good correlation between non-invasive hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring by echocardiography and invasive monitoring using a pulmonary artery catheter.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that invasive hemodynamic monitoring could facilitate fluid&#xD;
      management in patients with PE. However, recent studies have examined the utility of&#xD;
      echocardiography in combination with lung ultrasound for guiding fluid therapy in patients&#xD;
      with severe PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic fluid content (TFC) is one of the many variables measured by the ICON electrical&#xD;
      cardiometry (EC) device (Osypka Medical, etc.). The ICON device is one relatively new&#xD;
      proprietary implementation of impedance cardiography technology, which is also often called&#xD;
      &quot;thoracic electrical bio-impedance&quot;. Impedance cardiography is based on measuring the changes&#xD;
      in total resistance of the thorax to electric current. The impedance (Zo) to electric current&#xD;
      is determined by the resistance of different tissues such as bone, muscles, and fluids. The&#xD;
      fluid compartment is considered the dynamic component that will cause short term changes in&#xD;
      thoracic impedance. TFC is calculated as the reciprocal of the total thoracic impedance (1/&#xD;
      Zo) and is considered a numerical measure of total (intravascular and extravascular) thoracic&#xD;
      fluid. Although TFC is a measure of both extra and intra-vascular thoracic fluid, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that it might provide an estimate of the increase in intrathoracic&#xD;
      fluids such as to facilitate the risk of pulmonary edema.&#xD;
