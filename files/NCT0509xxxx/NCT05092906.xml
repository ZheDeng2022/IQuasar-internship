  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of hypnosis, as add on therapy, on patients&#xD;
      requiring a lumbar puncture (LP) as part of their medical management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will follow the zelen's methodology randomization. It is an add-on study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study will be presented to patients as an assessment of their comfort during the LP.&#xD;
           The intervention group is not presented to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients are asked to sign the consent of the standard of care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization into two equally sized groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention arm : LP with complementary hypnoanalgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control arm : LP without complementary hypnoanalgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who have been randomized into the control group, will have LP according to the&#xD;
           standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been randomized into the hypnoanalgesic group will be informed about the&#xD;
      hypnoanalgesia intervention and then asked to sign the consent of the hypnosis group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the patient accepts, he will benefit from hypnosis during LP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the patient refuses, he will re-join the control group without hypnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physicians performing LP will be the same in both groups. A phone call follow-up is&#xD;
      scheduled on day 3 and 7 after intervention.&#xD;
