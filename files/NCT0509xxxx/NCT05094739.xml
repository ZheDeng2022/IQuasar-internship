      statement of the problem: COVID-19 is a global public health threat that affects the&#xD;
      respiratory system and threatens millions of lives all over the world. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) declared on 30 Jan. 2020 that COVID-19 is a public health emergency&#xD;
      (Clouthard et al. 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue, fever and dry cough are the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Symptoms maybe severe&#xD;
      and may lead to serious complications which cause death in some cases. COVID-19 can be&#xD;
      transmitted by droplets, aerosols and close contact (WHO, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear from infection transmission from person to person or from contaminated objects increased&#xD;
      after emergence of COVID-19 as virus can survive in aerosols for 3 hours and on plastic and&#xD;
      stainless steel surfaces up to 3 days (Surme et al. 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As dentistry is a profession with high risk for transmission of COVID-19, it is affected&#xD;
      greatly clinically and economically. Clinically as only cases which need immediate&#xD;
      interference like trauma and swellings that obstruct the airway can be done, and routine&#xD;
      dental care should be suspended. Economically this suspension of routine dental care causes&#xD;
      closure of number of dental clinics due to real financial problems, anxiety and stress&#xD;
      (Clouthard et al. 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From patient's point of view, so many patients thought that dental clinics are dangerous&#xD;
      areas as source of risk of infection with COVID-19 (Surme et al. 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: is to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of a group of Egyptian parents&#xD;
      toward dental treatment of their children during the fourth wave of COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
