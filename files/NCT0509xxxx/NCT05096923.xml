  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study aims to create a registry of childhood, adolescent, and young adult&#xD;
      patients with cancer (&lt;40 years-old at cancer diagnosis), entitled the 'UNC Childhood,&#xD;
      Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Cohort' (UNC-CAYACC). This resource will serve to support&#xD;
      cancer outcomes research among pediatric and young adult cancer patients with a primary focus&#xD;
      on enrolling patients treated as adolescents or young adults (AYAs, 15-39 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: As appropriate for age, participants will complete physical and cognitive&#xD;
      functional assessments; questionnaires to assess health-related quality of life and other&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes; will undergo body composition and anthropometric measurements; and&#xD;
      will be asked to provide biospecimens for biobanking. Assessments will be collected (as&#xD;
      possible) at diagnosis, during active treatment, following treatment completion, and annually&#xD;
      in survivorship to assess outcomes throughout the treatment and survivorship trajectory.&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and clinical information such as cancer treatment modalities and cumulative&#xD;
      doses will be collected by medical record abstraction. Participants will be eligible to&#xD;
      enroll at any time from diagnosis through survivorship. This registry will provide data to&#xD;
      better understand the manifestations of accelerated aging and key contributing factors among&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer.&#xD;
