    <textblock>
      To minimize negative health effects on health of workers in phosphate mining, it is important&#xD;
      to assess, and diagnose health related effect of phosphate exposure &amp; health hazards related&#xD;
      to miners. Early reporting, diagnosis, and intervention can limit the severity of health&#xD;
      hazards, improve the health services. To our knowledge no local previous studies were done in&#xD;
      this area.&#xD;

      Mining continues to be a dangerous activity, whether large-scale industrial mining or&#xD;
      small-scale artisanal mining. Not only are there accidents, but exposure to dust and toxins,&#xD;
      along with stress from the working environment or managerial pressures, give rise to a range&#xD;
      of diseases that affect miners. Beneficiation is the process of removing the unnecessary&#xD;
      minerals, which is used to increase the grade of mining product (concentrate). Phosphate ores&#xD;
      can be beneficiated using one or a combination of different methods. The most common ones&#xD;
      are: flotation, crushing, desliming, separation, grinding and washing thus keeping workers in&#xD;
      Phosphate mines employ exposed to respirable dust pollution and to high silica dust levels&#xD;
      presented in silicosis in many job areas, Silicosis is the most common occupational lung&#xD;
      disease in Egypt where its prevalence rate ranges from 18.5 % to 45.8% among workers exposed&#xD;
      to free crystalline silica dust. Despite its high prevalence, there is a lack of enforcement&#xD;
      of exposure limits, availability and use of personal protective equipment, and occupational&#xD;
      health education programs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Egyptian phosphate miners' study (2011), The study involved of three groups: 50&#xD;
      silica-exposed workers with radiological evidence of silicosis, 50 silica-exposed workers&#xD;
      without evidence of silicosis, and 50 healthy unexposed subjects. , There were significant&#xD;
      differences between pulmonary function parameters, values of C-reactive protein, rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor, complement component C3, IgA, IgG, and IgM in exposed groups with and without&#xD;
      silicosis, and healthy unexposed control subjects (p&lt;.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to acid fumes in the phosphate mining was significantly associated with dental&#xD;
      erosion and deteriorated oral health status, As working in phosphate mines had 8 and 28 times&#xD;
      the risk for developing respectively oral lesions and teeth abrasions. This supported by&#xD;
      Tunisian 2017 on 37 workers&amp; 37 controls, found that frequencies of fluorosis, teeth&#xD;
      abrasion, and oral lesions were significantly higher among the exposed group.&#xD;
