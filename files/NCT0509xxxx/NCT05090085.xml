  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of 5% Dimethyl Sulfoxide&#xD;
      application prior to three step-etch and rinse dental adhesive on the durability of composite&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;

      Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial After power analysis calculation, cervical lesions will&#xD;
      be pretreated with 5% DMSO/EtOH (Dimethyl Sulfoxide/Ethanol). Control groups will be bonded&#xD;
      with SBMP (Single Bond Multipurpose). Cavities will be restored with nanohybrid composite&#xD;
      restoration (Z350 XT, shade A2, 3M ESPE) under rubber dam isolation. Follow-ups will be&#xD;
      performed by a single-blinded evaluator at baseline and after 6m, 12m, 18m using the FDI&#xD;
      criteria. Photographic documentation will be performed for all restorations at every&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation In a previous study response within each subject per group was&#xD;
      normally distributed. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 20%,&#xD;
      the investigators will need to study 31 subjects per group (62 subjects) to be able to reject&#xD;
      the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are&#xD;
      equal with probability (power) 0.8. The sample size was increased by 15% to compensate for&#xD;
      dropouts to reach a total of 74 (37 per group). The Type I error probability associated with&#xD;
      this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. The sample size had been calculated using the Z&#xD;
      test (difference between two independent proportions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses After confirming the normality, Shapiro-Wilk test, and the&#xD;
      homoscedasticity of the data, Barlett test, ANOVA will be used. Differences between groups&#xD;
      were calculated using Tukey's post hoc test (α=0.05). Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      with IBM SPSS &quot;Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&quot; statistical Version 25 for&#xD;
      Windows.&#xD;

    <masking_description>In our clinical trial, double blinding will be performed, the participants and assessors will be blinded to the type of material used to reduce performance and ascertainment bias and also reduce biased estimates of treatment effects. The operator cannot be blinded in this trial because of the difference in the application procedures of each restorative material. Therefore, the operator (O.I.) will take care to treat the two allocation groups as equally as possible by standardizing the care of participants, frequency of follow-ups and management of complications.</masking_description>

    <description>O.I. will clean the labial surface of the tooth with polishing paste and brush Roughening of the surface may be needed by the diamond point The tooth will be isolated by a rubber dam. Apply etchant for 30 s for enamel and 15 s for dentin. Rinse thoroughly with water for 15 s. blot-drying with paper tissue was carefully performed leaving the dentin surface slightly moist. Active application of consecutive coats of the adhesive for 15 s. Gently air for 5 s. Light cure for 10 s. Composite build ups (Filtek Z350 XT, 3 M ESPE, St Paul, MN, USA) were performed in increments and individually light-cured for 20 s. Light curing of all resin materials was performed using (3M Elipar Curing Light) delivering 1100 mW/cm2.</description>
