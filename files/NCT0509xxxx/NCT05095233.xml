    <description>Research has shown that user engagement, rather than the modality of therapy is the key to achieving successful outcomes and given that just 50% and 13% of patients currently have a choice of when and where they receive therapy, apps may not only be equally effective as some forms of traditional psychotherapy but also provide a flexible and pragmatic means of increasing patient access, through removing barriers to treatment that do not respond to financial impetus. Woebot is an automated conversational agent designed to deliver CBT in the format of brief, daily conversations and mood tracking. Woebot, takes one of the more heavily researched clinical approaches to CBT, and packages it in a user friendly free app that can accessed anytime, anywhere, as long as the user has a smart phone.</description>
