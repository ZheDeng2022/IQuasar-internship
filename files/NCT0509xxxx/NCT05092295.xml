  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rebion has developed a device, the Rebion trauma tool (referred to as the head and&#xD;
      intraocular trauma tool, or &quot;HITT&quot;), that detects ocular fixation and alignment using a&#xD;
      binocular retinal scan. Preliminary data obtained from hospitalized patients with a&#xD;
      clinically-confirmed traumatic brain injury (TBI) and uninjured controls indicates that the&#xD;
      device can detect changes in ocular fixation, alignment, and saccades that are related to&#xD;
      brain injury. This study seeks to evaluate the ability of the Rebion trauma tool to assess&#xD;
      perturbations in eye movements resulting from TBI. The study will enroll 100 TBI patients and&#xD;
      100 controls.&#xD;
