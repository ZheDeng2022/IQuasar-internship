    <description>The Vivaer procedure will be performed in the study clinic using the Vivaer ARC Stylus and Aerin Console. The Vivaer ARC Stylus is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue when connected to the Aerin Console radiofrequency generating device. Participants will undergo bilateral treatment of the nasal airway in a single study procedure session. Each side of the nose will be treated as follows:&#xD;
• Two (2) to six (6) nonoverlapping applications of RF energy are performed at the SSB per nostril.&#xD;
The default treatment settings will be used for the study: temperature 60 C, power 4 watts, treatment time 18 seconds, and cooling time 12 seconds. No repeat (&quot;touch up&quot;) procedures will be permitted after the initial procedure through the end of the study (36 months).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 22 to 85 years (inclusively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Seeking treatment for nasal obstruction and willing to undergo an office-based&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Baseline NOSE score ≥ 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of SSB hypertrophy limiting visualization of the middle turbinate (MT) by&#xD;
             more than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Reduction in size of the SSB after application of topical decongestant on a cotton&#xD;
             plug directly to the SSB region.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Improvement in the symptoms of nasal obstruction after SSB decongestion suggesting&#xD;
             that the SSB may play a role in nasal obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing and able to withhold anticoagulant medications during the perioperative period&#xD;
             (3-day window on either side).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Willing and able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willing and able to comply with the participant-specific requirements outlined in the&#xD;
             study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior turbinate (IT) reduction, or other surgical nasal&#xD;
             procedures within the preceding 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Severe case of any of the following: septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, polyps,&#xD;
             or ptotic nose tip believed to be the primary contributor to the participant's nasal&#xD;
             obstruction symptoms and warranting surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any adjunctive surgical nasal procedure planned on the same day or within 3 months&#xD;
             after the Vivaer procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known or suspected allergies or contraindications for any general or local anesthetic&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known or suspected to be pregnant or is lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participating in another clinical research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Other medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator would predispose the&#xD;
             participant to poor wound healing or increased surgical risk, or poor compliance with&#xD;
             the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known or suspected regular use of oxymetazoline (Afrin) nasal decongestant or oral&#xD;
             steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For sites participating in the CT substudy only: Active sinus condition (eg,&#xD;
             significant sinus diseases, infection or polyp formation) identified by CT.&#xD;
