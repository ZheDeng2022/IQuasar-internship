  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorder, with a lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence of 15-25% in children and 1-3% in adults worldwide. AD is a heterogeneous disease&#xD;
      induced by multiple factors, including genetic mutation and environmental risk factors. The&#xD;
      main inflammatory mechanism that contributed to AD is the immune response mediated by T&#xD;
      helper 2 (Th2) cells. The clinical features of AD, such as recurrent eczematous lesions,&#xD;
      IgE-mediated intense itch, and the disruption of skin barrier induced by abnormal epidermal&#xD;
      cell differentiation and protein structures, etc., can be attributed to the secretion of Th2&#xD;
      cell-related cytokines. AD is likely to be a lifelong illness with repeated onsets, causing&#xD;
      not only physiological discomfort but also psychological distress; hence the quality of life&#xD;
      of AD patients is inevitably affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactic acid is a natural moisturizing factor, which exists in healthy skin. It can&#xD;
      efficiently prevent water loss from the skin and alleviate allergic reactions caused by dry&#xD;
      skin. The moisturized function of lactic acid has made it became a commonly used additive in&#xD;
      a wide variety of skincare products, such as lotion, cream, butter and spray. This product is&#xD;
      rich in natural lactic acid generated by the fermentation of probiotics, and therefore can&#xD;
      relieve skin itching caused by skin dryness, and resume the water-holding capability of the&#xD;
      skin by removing abnormally proliferative stratum corneum as well as inducing collagen&#xD;
      production. Importantly, this product is a steroid-free product with safety and without any&#xD;
      induced adverse effects in use. This product is also can be a promising option other than&#xD;
      steroids to be applied for the mitigation of recurrent symptoms in atopic dermatitis by&#xD;
      resuming the water-retention ability of skin and rebuilding skin barrier function.&#xD;

                visit, weeks 4, 12 and 16 of natural lactic acid-enriched cream.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare the effect of 12 weeks of natural lactic acid-enriched cream treatment&#xD;
                on S. aureus abundance for up to 4 weeks after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

                III. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For continuous variables, the following will be presented: mean, median, standard deviation,&#xD;
      minimum and maximum. The comparison between two treatment groups and the comparison within&#xD;
      group will be tested by using two independent t-test and paired t-test, respectively. If the&#xD;
      normal assumption is violated, the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be&#xD;
      conducted, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For categorical variables, the numbers and percentages of subjects will be listed and&#xD;
      summarized. Comparison for percentages will be performed using the Chi-square test and&#xD;
      McNemar's test when comparing results in the same patient. The Fisher's exact test will&#xD;
      replace the Chi-square test when any counting of the expected frequency is less than 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Endpoints: To perform the primary efficacy and other endpoints for continuous variable, two&#xD;
      independent t-test will be used. If the normal assumption is violated, the non-parametric&#xD;
      method of Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be applied for analysis. Significant level will be&#xD;
      adopted with two-side at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For categorical variables, the Chi-square test will be used. When any counting of the&#xD;
      expected frequency is less than 5, the Fisher's exact test will be conducted. Significant&#xD;
      alpha level will be adopted at 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Safety: Adverse events will be coded by preferred term (PT) and system organ class (SOC) by&#xD;
      the latest version of MedDRA. Adverse events will be summarized by severity, relationship to&#xD;
      study drug, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination findings will be presented in a tabulated listing.&#xD;
