      Primary Aim/Objective: To determine if a school-based intervention promoting reading with a&#xD;
      growth mindset framework improves student reading achievement in the intervention group&#xD;
      compared to a wait-list comparison group of children in kindergarten through 2nd grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim/Objective: To determine if students whose parents endorse a fixed mindset with&#xD;
      regard to student reading abilities show more improvement post-intervention than parents that&#xD;
      endorse growth mindset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim/Objective: To determine if more parents endorse growth than fixed mindset&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
