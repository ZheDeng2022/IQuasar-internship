      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee osteoarthritis is a long-term rheumatic disease with a significant impact on the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life and the socio-economic development of societies. The usual&#xD;
      treatment consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a palliative measure. The&#xD;
      decrease in the beneficial effect and the appearance of serious long-term adverse effects&#xD;
      make it necessary to look for other therapeutic procedures. Acupuncture is a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment that could reduce pain and improve functionality in this&#xD;
      condition, however current scientific evidence is limited. A previous study has observed a&#xD;
      clinical improvement in the combination of sensitized local and peripheral points in the&#xD;
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis but studies with a larger sample are needed to confirm these&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the effectiveness of acupuncture using a combination of local and peripheral&#xD;
      sensitized points in the treatment of active knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized clinical trial will be performed in a hospital centre with 2 groups. The control&#xD;
      group will standard treatment plus transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, while the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive acupuncture in addition to standard care. Study outcomes will&#xD;
      be pain, quality of life, function, exercise adherence, drug intake, adverse effects, and&#xD;
      body mass index. There will be a 12-month post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will receive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and usual care.&#xD;
TENS treatment will perform in the region of the knee and the extensor muscles for 20 minutes, 2 times a week. 4 electrodes will be placed, 2 on the proximal region of the internal and external vastus, and the other 2 on the distal region of the motor plate.&#xD;
Usual care will consist in home exercises with toning exercises of the extensor apparatus, pelvic region and musculoskeletal stretching exercises of 2 weekly sessions, the recommendation of daily activity of walking for 1 hour daily as an active lifestyle and the recommendation of the reduction of body weight in the case of being above normal weight. There will be a total of 6 face-to-face sessions at the rate of 2 weekly sessions</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this group will receive acupuncture treatment and usual care.&#xD;
Acupuncture treatment will consist in 20-minute semi-standardized acupuncture sessions, 2 times a week. The intervention will consist of the insertion of 8 needles: 4 in points located in the knee (points St34, St35, XiYan and Sp10) and 4 more sensitive to palpation points located between the knee and the ankle. Stimulation will be performed to obtain local spasm response, the needles will be left for 20 minutes and then removed. The needles will be sterile disposable silicone needles of 0.20x20mm and 0.20x40mm.&#xD;
Usual care will be the same described in the Usual care plus TENS group</description>

    <description>TENS is a therapy that uses low voltage electrical current to provide pain relief. A TENS unit consists of a battery-powered device that delivers electrical impulses through electrodes placed on the surface of your skin.
