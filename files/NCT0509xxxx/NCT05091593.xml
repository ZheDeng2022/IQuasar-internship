      In an effort to reduce rural-urban disparities and improve the quality of cancer care for&#xD;
      these patients, the objectives of this study will be to: (1) adapt the intervention to&#xD;
      maximize effectiveness for rural, low-income patients, (2) test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      adapted intervention, and (3) prepare for implementation of the intervention in rural,&#xD;
      low-income communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to reduce rural-urban disparities and improve the quality of&#xD;
      cancer care for these patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 1): By using mixed methods, investigators will adapt the stepped collaborative care&#xD;
      intervention to address the contextual needs of patients diagnosed with comorbid cancer and&#xD;
      depression living in rural, low-income communities. Using face-to-face qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with 30 patients diagnosed with cancer and quantitative data from our past trial,&#xD;
      investigators will adapt the stepped collaborative care intervention for patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with cancer from rural, low-income communities. For all quantitative data, the frequency&#xD;
      distributions of study variables will be examined prior to statistical analyses to provide&#xD;
      descriptive data and to identify departures from normality. If nonlinearity is detected, a&#xD;
      transformation will be performed using the Box-Cox transformation, which finds the optimal&#xD;
      relationship between variables. All measures have established reliability and validity&#xD;
      similar to that from which the study sample will be drawn; however, the reliabilities of&#xD;
      scales will be assessed using Cronbach's. Thorough exploratory data analyses will be&#xD;
      performed to ascertain data characteristics and to screen for anomalies (i.e., outliers). The&#xD;
      preliminary exploration of the data will be used to: (1) examine univariate and bivariate&#xD;
      distributions; (2) identify any imbalances between treatment groups on baseline&#xD;
      characteristics; (3) investigate the magnitude of the associations between the dependent&#xD;
      variables and the potential covariates; (4) determine the internal consistency reliabilities&#xD;
      of the measurement scales using Cronbach's alpha; and (5) verify the statistical assumptions&#xD;
      of the planned primary analyses. If assumptions are violated, then alternative procedures&#xD;
      such as data transformations or more robust statistical methods will be considered. Missing&#xD;
      data will be examined using available data on subject characteristics. Logistic regression&#xD;
      models will be created with SAS PROC LOGISTIC to compare the characteristics of subjects who&#xD;
      remained in the study versus those who dropped out. If data are determined to be missing at&#xD;
      random, likelihood estimation procedures available in SAS PROC MIXED will produce unbiased&#xD;
      estimates and allow the retention of subjects with missing data on outcomes. If data are&#xD;
      determined to be not missing at random, pattern mixture or selection modeling will be used to&#xD;
      investigate attrition. If necessary, multiple imputation (SAS PROC MI) will be used to impute&#xD;
      missing values for covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 2): To test, in a randomized controlled trial, the adapted stepped collaborative care&#xD;
      intervention for 242 patients diagnosed with comorbid cancer and depression living in rural,&#xD;
      low-income communities. Primary hypotheses are that patients randomized to the stepped&#xD;
      collaborative care intervention will report clinically meaningful (0.40 or greater effect&#xD;
      size) improvements in depression and Quality of Life (QoL) at 6- and 12-months when compared&#xD;
      to patients randomized to the screening and referral arm. The secondary hypotheses are that&#xD;
      patients randomized to the stepped collaborative care intervention will report clinically&#xD;
      meaningful (0.30 or greater effect size) improvements in sleep quality, perceived stress, and&#xD;
      social support when compared to the screening and referral arm. The expectation is that&#xD;
      caregivers of patients randomized to the intervention arm will have reductions in stress and&#xD;
      depression when compared to caregivers of patients randomized to the screening and referral&#xD;
      arm. Further exploration will be done of the beneficial effects of the stepped collaborative&#xD;
      care intervention on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 3): To examine the cost-effectiveness of the stepped collaborative care intervention for&#xD;
      242 patients diagnosed with cancer and depression. The stepped collaborative care&#xD;
      intervention is expected to be cost-effective compared to the screening and referral arm from&#xD;
      the health system perspective in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year based on&#xD;
      established benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. Given the low cost of the intervention and our&#xD;
      preliminary data showing reductions in complications and healthcare utilization, there is a&#xD;
      high chance that the intervention is, on average, cost saving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Aim 4): Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR), The&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility and actionable factors within the rural context that influence the&#xD;
      delivery of the stepped collaborative care intervention will be assessed.. Using mixed&#xD;
      methods, guided by the CFIR framework, Surveys will be administered and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews performed with patients, caregivers, providers, clinical and research staff after&#xD;
      testing the screening and adapted intervention to further refine and inform future&#xD;
      implementation in rural, low-income communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of relevant prior knowledge and gaps in current knowledge, over 60 million people&#xD;
      live in rural communities in the United States. Those who develop cancer are diagnosed later,&#xD;
      at more advanced stages, with greater physical comorbidities, poorer quality of life (QoL),&#xD;
      and have fewer options for treatment and resources to cope with a diagnosis of cancer when&#xD;
      compared to those living in urban communities. As a result, they suffer from greater&#xD;
      cancer-related distress and depression. Patients diagnosed with cancer from rural Appalachia&#xD;
      were more likely to meet the criteria for clinical levels of distress compared to 27.4% of&#xD;
      non-rural cancer patients. Investigators have also observed higher rates of depression in&#xD;
      patients from rural, low-income areas when compared to their urban counterparts in&#xD;
      Appalachia. Despite the high rates of depression, people who live in rural communities are&#xD;
      47% less likely to receive mental health treatment and 72% less likely to receive specialized&#xD;
      mental health treatment when compared to those living in urban communities. Depression&#xD;
      results in poorer QoL, decreased adherence to cancer treatments, and increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that have been effective in&#xD;
      people from urban communities have not been effective in those living in rural, low-income&#xD;
      communities. A stepped collaborative care intervention was designed and tested for&#xD;
      socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with comorbid cancer and depression. While the&#xD;
      intervention was effective for patients from urban, low-income communities, subgroup analyses&#xD;
      revealed the intervention was not effective in patients from rural, low-income communities.&#xD;
      While preliminary, there is the belief that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may not be&#xD;
      culturally sensitive in rural, low-income patients. In addition, predictors of depression for&#xD;
      these patients included poor sleep, high levels of perceived stress, and lack of social&#xD;
      support. The proposal is to adapt the intervention using problem solving therapy, rather than&#xD;
      CBT; provide resources to reduce financial stress; and incorporate stress management, support&#xD;
      groups, and treatment of sleep problems in the novel intervention. In effort to reduce&#xD;
      rural-urban disparities and improve the quality of cancer care, the objectives of this study&#xD;
      will be to: (1) adapt the stepped collaborative care intervention to maximize effectiveness&#xD;
      for rural, low-income patients, (2) test the effectiveness of the adapted intervention, and&#xD;
      (3) prepare for implementation of the intervention in rural, low-income communities.&#xD;
