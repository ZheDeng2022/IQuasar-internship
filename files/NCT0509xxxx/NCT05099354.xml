  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The autonomic nervous system (ANS), regulating involuntary physiologic processes including&#xD;
      heart rate and blood pressure, is affected by changes in the cerebral vessels like carotid&#xD;
      artery stenosis, occlusion, carotid artery stent and endarterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until now, no data concerning autonomic nervous system in patients with acute intracranial&#xD;
      large artery occlusion and thrombectomy is available. Due to the known effect on ANS in case&#xD;
      of pathologies of extracranial brain supplying arteries it is highly suspected that&#xD;
      intracranial large artery occlusion and thrombectomy can affect the ANS as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to determine autonomic parameters during and after thrombectomy in&#xD;
      patients with large cerebral artery occlusion. The project is a prospective descriptive pilot&#xD;
      study at the University Hospital Tulln. 20 patients will be assessed during and after&#xD;
      thrombectomy up to three months post intervention. A combination of autonomic parameters,&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters and clinical outcome will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Autonomic tests, including heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), are performed with a 10min ECG with non-invasive or invasive blood pressor measuring during rest. During the time at the stroke unit, this data will be calculated using the existing continuous monitoring.&#xD;
Valsalva maneuver during continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring. The patient will be instructed to exhale against a mouthpiece with a defined resistance for 15 seconds.&#xD;
Assessment of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity will be done with continuous transcranial duplex sonography (TCD) and &quot;breath holding index&quot; (BHI). The patient will be instructed to hold his breath for 30 seconds, 4 times in a row with intervals of 4 minutes. This test will be performed only in responsive and compliant patients.</description>
