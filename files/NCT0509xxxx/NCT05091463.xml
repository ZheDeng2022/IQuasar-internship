    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of multi-modal training combining&#xD;
      activity-based locomotor training and transcutaneous spinal stimulation (ABLT+scTS) to&#xD;
      improve sitting posture and trunk control in children with a chronic spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 12 participants, ages 3-12 with chronic, acquired SCI, T10 and&#xD;
      above and non-ambulatory. The participants in this study will be novices to scTS and AB-LT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a within subjects, repeated measures design study. Participants with chronic,&#xD;
      acquired SCI (T10 and above and non-ambulatory), ages 3-12 years will serve as their own&#xD;
      control and will participate in the studies for all three aims. The participants in this&#xD;
      study will be novices to scTS and AB-LT. Medical history and demographics will be collected&#xD;
      according to NINDS-Common Data Elements guidelines for pediatric SCI and recommended,&#xD;
      standardized outcomes used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will participate in 60 sessions, 5 days/week for 90 minutes/session. The&#xD;
      participants will be assessed at the following time points: Baseline (prior to intervention),&#xD;
      after 20 sessions, after 40 sessions and after 60 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If possible, there will be follow-up assessments occur at 3 months post-60 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the effects of 60 AB-LT + scTS therapy sessions on sitting posture and&#xD;
      trunk control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested over a total of 4 session (2 pre- and 2 post-60 session&#xD;
      intervention). Sessions 1 and 2 will include testing for clinical (Segmental Assessment of&#xD;
      Trunk Control (SATCo) and Modified Functional Reach (MFR)) and biomechanical outcomes&#xD;
      (Sitting with best posture and MFR), respectively. The two sessions will be conducted within&#xD;
      one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine a) the rate of change in sitting posture and trunk control across, 20, 40,&#xD;
      and 60 sessions of AB-LT + scTS, b) the durability of training effects at 3-months follow-up,&#xD;
      and c) responsiveness of clinical outcome measures (SATCo and MFR) of trunk control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine residual activation of trunk muscle below the level of the lesion,&#xD;
      functional neurophysiological assessment (FNPA) and trunk perturbations will be assess pre-&#xD;
      and post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will attain parent/guardian informed consent and participant assent for&#xD;
      children &gt; 7 years. Twelve total participants, ages 3-12 years will be recruited and enrolled&#xD;
      for all three aims. Participants will be enrolled for 60 sessions (3 months) for the&#xD;
      intervention and will be re-tested 3 months post-training.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (Pre-Intervention), after 20 sessions, after 40 sessions, after 60 sessions and after 3 months post 60 sessions(each session is 1.5 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be tested in a seated position with arms and back unsupported on a bench with hip and knee both at 90 degrees of flexion and feet supported. Trunk control will be examined with a therapist progressively changing the level of support, starting at the shoulder girdle and axilla to assess cervical (head) control. They will then progress to the inferior-scapula (mid-thoracic), lower-ribs (lower thoracic), below-ribs (upper lumbar), pelvis (lower lumbar) and no support, to measure full trunk control. Pelvis will be placed in a neutral position via manual support for all testing, except for the no support level.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (Pre-Intervention), after 20 sessions, after 40 sessions, after 60 sessions and after 3 months post 60 sessions(each session is 1.5 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be in a sitting position with hip, knees, and ankles in 90 degrees flexion, with feet flat on the floor. The initial reach will be measured using a yard stick with participant reaching (leaning) as far as possible (front, right, and left). Distance covered, in centimeters from initial position to furthest reaching at the level of the 3rd metacarpal, will be recorded in all 3 directions.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (Pre-Intervention), After 60 intervention Sessions (each session is 1.5 hours) and 3 months after 60 sessions end</time_frame>
    <description>Center of pressure is the location on the supporting surface where the resultant vertical force vector would act if it could be considered to have a single point of application. A shift of CoP is an indirect measure of postural sway and thus a measure of a person's ability to maintain balance.</description>

    <description>Transcutaneous spinal stimulation (scTS): The 5-channel stimulator capable of generating pain-free biphasic rectangular waveform of 0.3 to 1.0 ms pulses with a frequency of 5-10 kHz will be used to stimulate at single or multi-site spinal levels. Transcutaneous stimulation will be delivered in combination with activity based locomotor training in 5-10 minute bouts of stimulation at sub-motor threshold during daily sessions (5x/week) lasting for 90 minutes for a total of 60 sessions of therapy. The sessions will consist of 55-60 minutes on the treadmill for facilitated standing/stepping followed by 30 minutes of activities off the treadmill in sitting, standing, or stepping.</description>
