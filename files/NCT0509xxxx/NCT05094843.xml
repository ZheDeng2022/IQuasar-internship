  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer surgery causes significant changes in the small circulation as well as changes in&#xD;
      the intrathoracic anatomy. The effects of lung cancer surgery on electrocardiography and the&#xD;
      cardiac stress associated with the procedures have not been previously extensively studied.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to ascertain whether modern mini-invasive lung cancer surgery&#xD;
      causes changes in the electrocardiogram, and whether these changes are transitory during&#xD;
      short-term follow-up. Furthermore, the study aims to describe whether lung cancer surgery&#xD;
      causes significant cardiac stress detectable by intraoperative electrocardiography.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer surgery causes significant acute changes in the small circulation as well as both&#xD;
      transient and permanent changes in the intrathoracic anatomy. The electrocardiographic&#xD;
      changes as well as their associations with postoperative recovery associated with modern&#xD;
      mini-invasive lung cancer surgery have not been extensively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define in detail the electrocardiographic changes and their duration caused by lung&#xD;
           cancer surgery, both perioperatively and in the early postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess, whether perioperative electrocardiographic changes are associated with the&#xD;
           postoperative recovery of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether 100 patients with planned mini-invasive lung cancer surgery in the Tays Heart&#xD;
      Hospital, Tampere, Finland, will be prospectively recruited for the study between the years&#xD;
      2021 and 2028.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12-lead rest electrocardiogram will be recorded from each patient preoperatively as well&#xD;
      daily postoperatively and during follow-up out-patient clinic visit two weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively. The perioperative continuous multi-lead electrocardiogram will be recorded.&#xD;
      Laboratory examinations (cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides) indicating cardiac&#xD;
      stress will be obtained from the patients preoperatively and repeatedly postoperatively. The&#xD;
      variables included in the electrocardiography analysis include cardiac rhythm, heart rate&#xD;
      variability, PQ-time, QRS duration, P-, QRS, and T-wave amplitudes and axles, as well as&#xD;
      ST-level variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia and the&#xD;
      duration of postoperative air leak and postoperative chest tube drainage, will be recorded.&#xD;
      The associations between lung cancer surgery and electrocardiographic changes, their&#xD;
      duration, as well as their associations with postoperative recovery will be analyzed using&#xD;
      statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A local study registry will be established for the study adhering to the legislature and&#xD;
      protocols for clinical studies, including data security. Institutional ethics board committee&#xD;
      approval has been obtained. The study will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov prior to&#xD;
      patient enrollment. The study does not include any interventions beside the normal treatment&#xD;
      of these patients. Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient. The results&#xD;
      of the study will be published in international medical journals.&#xD;
