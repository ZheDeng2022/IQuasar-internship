  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals living in Canterbury (New Zealand) have experienced significant stress related to&#xD;
      the Canterbury earthquake sequence. Previous research conducted at the Department of&#xD;
      Psychological Medicine (Christchurch, New Zealand) has shown significant cognitive&#xD;
      difficulties in a group of Cantabrians exposed to high levels of earthquake trauma. A high&#xD;
      proportion (30%) perceive themselves to have significant cognitive difficulties, even seven&#xD;
      years post-earthquake. People who perceive that they have cognitive difficulties find this&#xD;
      distressing and tend to function less well in work and parenting. Understanding pathways&#xD;
      underlying cognitive difficulties in the population is vital for developing appropriate&#xD;
      treatments and strategies to help with this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first study to investigate rates of, and factors contributing to, perceived&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties in a large population exposed to multiple stressors and is important&#xD;
      for the population of Canterbury, and populations affected by natural and man-made disasters&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four hundred and sixty people who were exposed to the Canterbury earthquake sequence will be&#xD;
      recruited from the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS). Psychological,&#xD;
      cognitive, functional and biological factors will be compared between those with the greatest&#xD;
      levels of perceived cognitive difficulty and those with the lowest levels of difficulty. This&#xD;
      will determine what factors relate most strongly to perceived cognitive difficulties, which&#xD;
      will in turn be used to develop treatments for this population.&#xD;

        The Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) is a birth cohort study comprising&#xD;
        1265 people born in Christchurch in 1977. Participants have been followed to age 40, with&#xD;
        75-80% retention at data collection points. At the time of the February 2011 earthquake,&#xD;
        460 participants were in Christchurch and were subject to earthquake-related stresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will recruit people from the CHDS who were exposed to the Canterbury earthquake&#xD;
        sequence, based on results of an initial screening using the Cognitive Failures&#xD;
        Questionnaire (CFQ): the quartile with the highest scores on the CFQ, and the quartile with&#xD;
        the lowest scores will be selected and invited to attend a more comprehensive evaluation.&#xD;
