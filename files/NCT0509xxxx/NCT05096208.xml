      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study will examine the immune&#xD;
      response and the safety and tolerability profiles across 3 manufactured lots of RSVpreF when&#xD;
      administered as a single 120 µg dose to healthy adults to demonstrate lot equivalence in&#xD;

    <measure>The ratio of RSV A- , RSV B- neutralizing GMTs for each between-lot comparison (Group 1/Group 2, Group 1/Group 3, and Group 2/Group 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>RSV A and RSV B neutralizing titers (NT), expressed as Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs). GMR is the ratio of GMTs and is calculated by dividing GMT from lot 1 to lot 2, lot 2 to lot 3, and lot 3 to lot 1.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants reporting prespecified local reactions in the pooled RSVpreF lots (Groups 1, 2, and 3) and placebo separately</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 7 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Local reactions included pain at injection site, redness and swelling recorded by participants in an e-diary. Redness and swelling are measured and recorded in measuring device units. 1 measuring device unit =0.5 cm and graded as mild: 2.5 to 5.0 cm, moderate: &gt; 5.0 to 10.0 cm and severe: &gt;10 cm. Pain at injection site is graded as mild: did not interfere with daily activity, moderate: interfere with daily activity and severe: prevented daily activity</description>

    <time_frame>Within 7 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic reactions:fever, fatigue/tiredness, headache, nausea, muscle pain, joint pain, vomiting, diarrhea and any systemic event recorded by participants in an e-diary. Fever: greater than equal to (&gt;=)38.0 degrees (deg) Celsius (C), mild (&gt;=38.0 to 38.4 deg C, &gt;38.4 to 38.9 deg C), moderate (&gt;38.9 to 40.0 deg C and &gt;40.0 deg C), severe (&gt;38.9 deg C to 40.0 deg C) and grade 4 (&gt;40.0 deg C). Fatigue, headache, nausea, muscle pain and joint pain are graded as mild: did not interfere with activity, moderate: some interference with activity and severe: prevented daily routine activity. Vomiting is graded as mild: 1 to 2 times in 24 hours(h), moderate: &gt;2 times in 24h and severe: requires intravenous hydration. Diarrhea is graded as mild: 2 to 3 loose stools in 24h, moderate: 4 to 5 loose stools in 24h and severe: 6 or more loose stools in 24h.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants reporting AEs in the pooled RSVpreF lots (Groups 1, 2, and 3) and placebo separately</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study duration (up to 35 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs include both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants reporting SAEs in the pooled RSVpreF lots (Groups 1, 2, and 3) and placebo separately</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study duration (up to 35 days)</time_frame>
    <description>SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
