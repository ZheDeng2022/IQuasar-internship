  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study for patients with prostate cancer that will be treated with&#xD;
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy. The study will help the investigators learn more about how&#xD;
      these medications affect the heart and how those effects relate to patients' medical history&#xD;
      and social determinants of health (such as race, gender identity, education, occupation,&#xD;
      access to health services and economic resources). Patients on this study will have&#xD;
      echocardiograms, blood draws, and answer questions about their symptoms and activity level.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed on this study for up to 5 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a prospective longitudinal cohort of prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) to determine the associations between social&#xD;
      determinants of health (SDOH) and cardiotoxicity risk and to determine wither associations&#xD;
      between SDOH and cardiotoxicity risk differs according to race. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      with serial echo, blood draw, and surveys prior to start of ADT and then 6 months, 1 year, 2&#xD;
      years, 3 years, and 5 years after start of ADT.&#xD;

        androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, may be used in combination with GnRH&#xD;
        agonist/antagonist therapies per provider clinical discretion.&#xD;
