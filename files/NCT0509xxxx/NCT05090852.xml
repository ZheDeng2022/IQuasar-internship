      The goals of this study are to establish the efficacy of Hi-VNI (High Velocity Nasal&#xD;
      Insufflation) in upper airway surgery from the anesthesiologist's and surgeon's perspectives,&#xD;
      and to describe the ideal patient and the ideal pathology as well as suitable clinical&#xD;
      scenarios when this oxygenation technique should be selected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most challenging aspects of laryngeal and laryngotracheal procedures are difficulty of&#xD;
      exposure and airway management. These procedures require use of microlaryngeal instruments&#xD;
      through a small lumen of a rigid laryngoscope, and are oftentimes difficult to perform with a&#xD;
      standard endotracheal tube in place. Similarly, when performing endoscopic evaluation of the&#xD;
      trachea, access to the space and visualization of the entire 360-degree view of the trachea&#xD;
      is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome these challenges, a number of techniques for oxygen delivery have evolved over&#xD;
      time. Among them are use of a small endotracheal tube, use of jet ventilation and&#xD;
      intermittent apnea with periodic removal of the endotracheal tube. The aforementioned methods&#xD;
      of airway management carry inherent risks of airway injury, can be accompanied by brief&#xD;
      periods of hypoxia or hypercarbia, and can sometimes lead to tenuous airway management&#xD;
      scenarios for both the surgeon and the anesthesiologist when clear communication and&#xD;
      familiarity with the airway management plan during the procedure are sub-optimal. For this&#xD;
      reason, there is an ongoing search for acceptable solutions to minimize these risks during&#xD;
      upper airway surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the newly emerging advanced oxygenation techniques, also known as Hi-VNI (High&#xD;
      Velocity Nasal Insufflation), allows for delivery of humidified oxygen through a specialized&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula at rates of up to 40 l/min. This non-invasive high flow respiratory&#xD;
      support system is currently being used in the treatment of respiratory failure in both adult&#xD;
      and pediatric patients. This technique provides sustained oxygenation due to reduction in&#xD;
      airway resistance, a build-up of airway pressure with oxygen-rich gas and active gas&#xD;
      exchange, which lead to flushing of anatomic dead space, and delivery of oxygen into the&#xD;
      lungs. This oxygenation technique can be used both in spontaneously breathing patients and&#xD;
      under apneic conditions, while providing an unobstructed surgical view with the glottis,&#xD;
      subglottis and trachea fully accessible for instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to establish the efficacy of Hi-VNI in upper airway surgery, to&#xD;
      document the advantages and disadvantages of this technique from the standpoint of the airway&#xD;
      surgeon and the anesthesiologist, and to provide more information about the optimal patient&#xD;
      and airway pathology as well as suitable clinical scenarios when Hi-VNI device can be used&#xD;
      for oxygenation during upper airway surgery. The researchers hypothesize that in appropriate&#xD;
      clinical situations, Hi-VNI can ease airway management, shorten case duration, and provide&#xD;
      superior operating conditions including space for instrumentation during upper aerodigestive&#xD;
      tract procedures.&#xD;
