    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the association between sacubitril/valsartan utilization and HF&#xD;
      patients' Part A &amp; B expenditures within the reimbursement framework of BPCI and MSSP, and&#xD;
      identified BPCI/MSSP participants with the greatest potential for performance improvement&#xD;
      (with respect to improving quality and efficiency of care for HF patients) through optimized&#xD;
      utilization of sacubitril/valsartan.&#xD;

      This drug utilization study employed a retrospective cohort design using the 100% files of&#xD;
      2015-2018 Medicare enrollment and Part A, B &amp; D claims data in conjunction with publicly&#xD;
      available information on providers participating in Bundled Payments for Care Improvement&#xD;
      (BPCI) and/or Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BPCI Study Design The unit of analysis for addressing study objectives was a unique&#xD;
      Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) episode of care, which encompassed an initial acute inpatient&#xD;
      stay plus all Part A &amp; B covered medical services during the 90 days post hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Episode index date was defined as the date of a beneficiary's initial acute hospital stay&#xD;
      with a qualifying Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for CHF, triggering a&#xD;
      CHF episode of care. Beneficiaries were followed longitudinally from episode index date&#xD;
      through episode end date to measure their utilization of sacubitril/valsartan and Part A &amp; B&#xD;
      expenditures during the CHF episode of care. A 12-month lookback period, based on when the&#xD;
      episode was initiated, was utilized to capture beneficiaries' baseline characteristics. For&#xD;
      example, episodes initiated on 2/1/2018 will have a 2/1/2017 to 1/31/2018 baseline lookback&#xD;
      period. Balancing the need for data recency, all qualifying CHF episodes from 2016-2018 were&#xD;
      included in the analysis. Given this is an episode-level analysis, a beneficiary may have&#xD;
      contributed multiple CHF episodes to the data analysis. To account for potential&#xD;
      within-subject clustering, a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution was applied&#xD;
      for estimating the association between sacubitril/valsartan use and CHF episode costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSSP Study Design The unit of analysis for addressing study objectives was a HF patient's&#xD;
      Part A &amp; B expenditures within the MSSP. Given the most recent year of data available at the&#xD;
      time the study was conducted was 2018, the study population included HF patients for whom the&#xD;
      MSSP participants were accountable in 2018 per Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)&#xD;
      assignment. These beneficiaries' utilization of sacubitril/valsartan and annual Part A &amp; B&#xD;
      expenditures was measured from January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2018. Data from CY 2017 was&#xD;
      leveraged for capturing these patients' baseline characteristics.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥18 years old during year of index date with valid gender and geographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continuous enrollment (CE) in the health plan with medical and pharmacy benefits for&#xD;
             ≥6 months (180ii days) before the index date (pre-index period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CE with medical and pharmacy benefits for ≥18 months (540ii days) beginning on the&#xD;
             index date (post-index period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients had uniform 6-month pre-index and 18-month post-index periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥1 medical claim with an MS diagnosis codeiii in any position during the pre-or&#xD;
             post-index periods&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥1 claim for fingolimod after the index date (i.e., from index date +1 to 539 days&#xD;
             post-index)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  By requiring ≥1 medical claim with an MS diagnosis code and ≥2 claims with an NDC for&#xD;
             fingolimod, the inclusion criteria essentially incorporated the preferred/overall best&#xD;
             performing MS case-finding definition validated by Culpepper et al. The criteria for&#xD;
             that definition required at least 3 separate encounters from any of the following:&#xD;
             MS-related ambulatory visits, MS-related inpatient stays, and DMT claims during a&#xD;
             12-month period. Slightly higher accuracy was found when a 24-month period was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        ≥1 pharmacy or medical claim for any MS DMT during the pre-index period&#xD;
