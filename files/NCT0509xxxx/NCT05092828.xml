      Background Deformity surgery is considered one of the most painful procedures patients can&#xD;
      undergo in medicine today. Stringent protocols for pain management have done much to&#xD;
      dramatically increase patient satisfaction, but the procedure still lags considerably behind&#xD;
      advances in pain control when compared to other procedures such as total joint surgery.&#xD;
      Specifically, it has been reported that over half of patients undergoing spine surgery report&#xD;
      inadequate pain control the first 24 hours after surgery. Uncontrolled pain has been shown to&#xD;
      correlate with prolonged hospital stays, delayed ambulation, poor functional outcomes, and&#xD;
      increased risk for the development of chronic pain. Furthermore, the large amount of&#xD;
      narcotics given to patients in an attempt to mitigate their pain postoperatively often leads&#xD;
      to significant complications in their own right, such as ileus, mental status changes, and&#xD;
      nausea. New modalities to treat postoperative pain, especially in the initial days following&#xD;
      deformity correction, are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrathecal (subarachnoid) injection of morphine has been used to treat severe pain since the&#xD;
      1970's. Its efficacy in treating postoperative pain has been well documented in various&#xD;
      specialties including obstetrics, oncology, general surgery, and orthopedic surgery. Specific&#xD;
      to spine surgery, intrathecal morphine is an attractive option given the access and&#xD;
      visualization of the thecal sac in addition to the high demand of pain control required&#xD;
      postoperatively. However, there remains no definitive consensus regarding the use of&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine in spine surgery. Current literature is limited by few randomized&#xD;
      trials, small sample sizes, heterogeneity of outcomes recorded, and an unclear association&#xD;
      with complications. Additionally, there is a paucity of data dedicated to patients undergoing&#xD;
      deformity correction. Accordingly, there is a need for high-quality trials to investigate the&#xD;
      role of intrathecal morphine in adult spinal deformity surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we hypothesized that the use of intrathecal morphine will significantly reduce&#xD;
      post-operative pain after deformity surgery, reduce opioid utilization, decrease hospital&#xD;
      stay, allow for earlier ambulation, increase patient satisfaction, and have comparable&#xD;
      complications to traditional pain management strategies. This study aims to compare the&#xD;
      effects of intrathecal morphine to traditional pain management strategies on post-operative&#xD;
      recovery for deformity surgery.&#xD;
