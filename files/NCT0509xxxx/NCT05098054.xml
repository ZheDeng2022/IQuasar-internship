  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to check the effect of a single dose of soticlestat in adults with moderate&#xD;
      or severe liver failure compared to healthy adults with normal liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will check into the study clinic for 8 days. During the stay, one oral dose of&#xD;
      soticlestat will be given and the participant will be monitored. The clinic staff will follow&#xD;
      up with the participant about a week after discharge from the clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called soticlestat (TAK-935). The study will assess&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of single oral dose of soticlestat in participants with moderate&#xD;
      or severe Hepatic Impairment (HI) compared to healthy participants matched by age (mean ±10&#xD;
      years), sex (±2 per sex), and body mass index (BMI, mean ±10 percent [%]) with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants. Participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      following study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1, Moderate HI: Soticlestat 300 milligram (mg) (Child-Pugh B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2, Severe HI: Soticlestat 300 mg or lower dose (Child-Pugh C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3, Normal hepatic function: Soticlestat 300 mg or lower dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive single oral dose of study drug. The data will be collected and&#xD;
      stored in electronic case report form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study is approximately 42 days. Participants will be followed up for 14 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
