      The present study is a clinical intervention applied to patients with urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      with the intention of verifying the effects of the Pilates method associated or not with&#xD;
      photobiomodulation with static magnetic field. The sample will consist of women with stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence from Bento Gonçalves attended at the school clinic of Faculdade&#xD;
      Cenecista de Bento Gonçalves.&#xD;

    <description>Muscle strength will be assessed through the unidigital vaginal touch, applied by a &quot;blind&quot; evaluator, so called because she does not monitor the performance of the interventions, as well as their respective evolutions during treatment, this assessment is subjective and will be classified by the scale of Modified Oxford (scale with a score between 0-5; 0- absence of muscle response, 1- Outline of non-sustained contraction; 2- presence of small intensity contraction, but which is sustained; 3- moderate contraction, felt as an increase in intravaginal pressure, which compresses the examiner's fingers with a small cranial elevation of the vaginal wall; 4- satisfactory contraction, which squeezes the examiner's fingers with elevation of the vaginal wall towards the pubic symphysis; 5- strong contraction, firm compression of the fingers of the examiner with positive movement towards the pubic symphysis).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>01 and 24 day of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ-SF is a questionnaire used to assess urinary incontinence, consisting of six questions that assess the frequency, severity of urinary loss and the impact of urinary incontinence on daily life, in addition to a sequence of eight self-diagnostic items, related to causes or incontinence situations that are not scored. The sum of the scores for questions three, four and five ranges from 0 to 21, and the higher the total score, the greater the severity of urinary incontinence. The impact of daily life is defined according to the score of question five; (0) not at all, (1-3) mild, (4-6) moderate, (7-9) severe, and (10) very severe.</description>
