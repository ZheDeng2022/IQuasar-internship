  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A case-control cohort study is being conducted to develop and validate the performance of a&#xD;
      whole blood gene expression qPCR test to distinguish KD from other febrile conditions by&#xD;
      collecting whole blood sample from KD patients in the first 7 days of illness and from&#xD;
      febrile controls immediately after presentation and before clinical diagnosis is confirmed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no diagnostic tool for Kawasaki disease (KD). Diagnosis is based on&#xD;
      clinical features shared with other febrile conditions, frequently resulting in delayed or&#xD;
      missed treatment and an increased risk of coronary artery aneurysms. An accurate diagnostic&#xD;
      blood test might enable early discrimination of Kawasaki disease from other infectious and&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions, resulting in a precise clinical treatment to improves survival and&#xD;
      quality of children's life. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a&#xD;
      blood-based assay for accurate diagnosis of KD in in the first 7 days of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect blood samples from healthy patients with no recent history of fever or&#xD;
      immunization and from febrile patients diagnosed with KD or other infectious and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three types of patients in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 6-60 months old who have been diagnosed with (or strong clinical suspicion for)&#xD;
      KD by clinician. Blood samples must be collected before any treatment has been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 6-60 months old with febrile conditions who have been diagnosed with other&#xD;
      infections or inflammation by clinician. Blood samples must be collected before any&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 6-60 months old with no recent history of fever or immunization.&#xD;
