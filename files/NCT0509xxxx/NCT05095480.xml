      A triple-blind clinical trial on 92 patients in 2019 was conducted. Patients were randomly&#xD;
      divided into a control group of 49 patients and a treatment group of 43 patients. The block&#xD;
      randomization method with a block size=2 and a ratio of 2:2 for drug vs. placebo was used.&#xD;
      Participants were selected from cardiology center (Prof. Kojuri cardiology clinic, Niayesh&#xD;
      St., Shiraz, Iran, www.kojuriclinic.com, Instagram @Kojuri_clinic) who took part in this&#xD;
      trial voluntarily and were completely informed about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily, some blood tests were done for all of the participants in order to measure their&#xD;
      serum levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol,&#xD;
      triglyceride (TG), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). The patients with very&#xD;
      high levels of serum LDL-C (above 200 mg/dL) and those with serum levels of LDL-C below&#xD;
      100m/dL were excluded from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food supplements based on red yeast rice were given to the patients of the treatment group in&#xD;
      the form of tablets named LesstatÂ® (Gricar chemical Srl Co.). Each tablet contained 200 mg&#xD;
      fermented red rice with Monascus Purpureus tit 5% in Monacolin K, 10 mg equal to Monacolin K,&#xD;
      90 mg chitosan, 3.5 mg lycopene, 30 mg ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and 5 mg tocopherol&#xD;
      (vitamin E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure blindness, the placebo tablets were similar to Lesstat (RYR) tablets in&#xD;
      shape and color. Both RYR and placebo tablets were given to the patients in identical&#xD;
      packages and every package contained 30 tablets of RYR or placebo, which was designed for a&#xD;
      one-month use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the prescription, the participants were told to take one tablet daily in addition to&#xD;
      their routine statin therapy for a period of 30 days. The patients were encouraged to contact&#xD;
      us if they had any problems during that 30-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were told to come back to our center after one month in order to perform&#xD;
      some secondary blood tests to compare patients' serum levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, TG, and hs-CRP with the initial measures. We carried out both primary and&#xD;
      secondary blood tests in the same laboratory and with the use of the same kits. Additionally,&#xD;
      the levels of serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic&#xD;
      transaminase (SGPT), and serum total bilirubin of all patients were assessed in order to&#xD;
      assess possible adverse hepatic effects of this combination (statins and RYR) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS software (version 25) for statistical analyses was sed. For comparing the variables&#xD;
      between the treatment and placebo groups at baseline, the independent sample t-test and&#xD;
      Pearson chi-squared test were . The paired-sample t-test and repeated measure ANOVA were used&#xD;
      for the variables with repeated measures. Values of p less than 0.05 were considered to be&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participants were totally informed about the purposes and details of our study,&#xD;
      with giving their informed consent before taking part. Patients refusing to participate were&#xD;
      excluded from the trial.&#xD;
