  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is listed as the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the&#xD;
      third most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of HCC cases occurs stem&#xD;
      from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for approximately 70% to 90% of all primary liver cancers.&#xD;
      Trans-arterial Chemoembolization is the most widely utilized and is considered the first-line&#xD;
      treatment recommended for patients staged as intermediate HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer&#xD;
      stage B). If applied correctly, TACE can produce survival benefits without adversely&#xD;
      affecting hepatic functional reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two TACE techniques have been used since 2004, conventional TACE (c-TACE) and TACE with&#xD;
      drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE). Conventional TACE was evidenced first to treat intermediate&#xD;
      stage HCC patients.&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is listed as the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the&#xD;
      third most frequent cause of cancer-related mortality. The majority of HCC cases occurs stem&#xD;
      from chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for approximately 70% to 90% of all primary liver cancers.&#xD;
      HCC patients have been suffering from poor prognosis with 5-year survival being roughly 10%&#xD;
      to 15% for decades despite the progress in screening, diagnosis, and treatment, which is&#xD;
      mainly resulted from that most patients are already in the moderate or advanced stage at&#xD;
      diagnosis, whom can only receive palliative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the level of the individual patient, concomitant cirrhosis and the number, size, and&#xD;
      location of hepatocellular tumors will affect the treatment approach. In addition, multiple&#xD;
      disease-related factors need to be taken into account, such as the presence of vascular&#xD;
      involvement or extra-hepatic disease, when deciding on the best treatment options for these&#xD;
      patients. Consequently, a multidisciplinary approach involving several physicians with&#xD;
      different specialties (e.g., diagnostic and interventional radiologists, surgical&#xD;
      oncologists, hepatologists, and medical oncologists) is necessary to determine the best&#xD;
      approach to treatment and maximize potential outcomes for patients with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liver has a dual vascular supply via the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The&#xD;
      rationale of the trans-arterial embolotherapies is explained by the fact that liver&#xD;
      malignancies are predominantly supplied by the hepatic artery, which allows delivering the&#xD;
      chemotherapy directly to the tumor-feeding artery while sparing the healthy hepatic tissue&#xD;
      mainly supplied by the portal vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loco regional treatments are a set of therapeutic approaches that directly target tumors in&#xD;
      the liver. Among the loco regional modalities, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE)&#xD;
      involves the local delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor and is generally recommended for&#xD;
      patients with liver-limited disease. Several randomized trials have been conducted to examine&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, TACE is the first-line&#xD;
      treatment for patients with intermediate stage HCC, including those with large or&#xD;
      multinodular HCC, well-preserved liver function, and no cancer-related symptoms or evidence&#xD;
      of vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread. Recent advances allow TACE treatment of both&#xD;
      early stage patients (i.e. those with a solitary nodule or up to 3 nodules under 3 cm) and&#xD;
      some advanced stage patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans-arterial Chemoembolization is the most widely utilized and is considered the first-line&#xD;
      treatment recommended for patients staged as intermediate HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer&#xD;
      stage B). If applied correctly, TACE can produce survival benefits without adversely&#xD;
      affecting hepatic functional reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two TACE techniques have been used since 2004, conventional TACE (c-TACE) and TACE with&#xD;
      drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE). Conventional TACE was evidenced first to treat intermediate&#xD;
      stage HCC patients. It combines the trans-catheter delivery of chemotherapy using&#xD;
      Lipiodol-based emulsion plus an embolizing agent to achieve strong cytotoxic and ischemic&#xD;
      effects. Drug-eluting beads (DEB) were developed in order to slowly release chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents, and to increase ischemia intensity and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of TACE with drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE) was primarily developed to&#xD;
      enhance the delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent while minimizing systemic toxicity and to&#xD;
      provide a standardized embolizing effect. DEBs are embolic microspheres loaded with a&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent (mostly doxorubicin) with the ability of slow drug release, which&#xD;
      should ensure high local and low systemic drug concentrations. Indeed, systemic levels of&#xD;
      doxorubicin were significantly lower in patients receiving DEB-TACE compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving c-TACE with Lipiodol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEB-TACE was introduced 10 years ago with the aim to improve the overall c-TACE outcomes and&#xD;
      to diminish the side effects of the procedure. It is based on the use of microspheres that&#xD;
      exploit ionic bonds and are able to actively sequester and then slowly release the cytotoxic&#xD;
      drug inside the target lesion. Moreover, the use of particles allows a deeper distal&#xD;
      embolization of small vessels, ensuring a permanent highly selective occlusion of the&#xD;
      tumor-feeding arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEB-TACE has several advantages over c-TACE, such as the delivery of higher concentrations of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents directly to tumors, lower rates of systemic complications, greater&#xD;
      efficacy in advanced stage or large tumors, and better standardization of the procedure&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
