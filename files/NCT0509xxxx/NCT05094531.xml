  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a&#xD;
      terrifying event perceived as a life threatening - either experiencing it or witnessing it.&#xD;
      Lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the European population is between 0.7% and 1.9%. According to&#xD;
      the &quot;dose-response&quot; model, the individuals most exposed to traumatic events (TEs) are those&#xD;
      who are most at risk of developing this disorder. This is why it is not surprising to observe&#xD;
      a higher prevalence of this disorder in the military population, ranging from 10% to 18% or&#xD;
      even 45%, depending on the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1980s, the practice of evidence-based preventive medicine (EBM-Evidence Based&#xD;
      Medicine) was developed. It involves the conscientious, explicit, judicious and reasonable&#xD;
      use of modern, best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. EBM&#xD;
      integrates clinical experience and patient values with the best available research&#xD;
      information. Health condition prevention includes several levels of action: primary,&#xD;
      secondary or tertiary, depending on the timing of the intervention in the course of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to explore the efficiency of primary prevention actions in&#xD;
      strengthening the resilience capacities of at-risk professionals, such as the military, in&#xD;
      order to prevent the development of PTSD and to improve it prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are (i) to design a primary prevention program for PTSD&#xD;
      specific to the military population studied and compatible with the operational constraints&#xD;
      of field soldiers, (ii) then, to implement / validate it within the operational staff of the&#xD;
      Mountain Infantry Brigade (MIB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach is based on an integrative reading of the processes in the risk of developing&#xD;
      PTSD. This biopsychosocial approach targets both the factors specific to the individual (on&#xD;
      the physiological and psychological level) and the contextual and social factors relating to&#xD;
      his professional environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dimensions are addressed: (i) biophysiology (by integrating the study of key biomarkers&#xD;
      of the neurobiological response to stress, and by strengthening the flexibility of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system), (ii) psychology (by facilitating and measuring the development of&#xD;
      the flexibility of coping strategies to cope with stress as well as by evaluating the&#xD;
      moderating role of the sense mission in the development of PTSD) and (iii) the social (by&#xD;
      facilitating community strategies aimed at reducing stigmatization and facilitating the use&#xD;
      of care for professionals in difficulty in the institutional context).&#xD;
