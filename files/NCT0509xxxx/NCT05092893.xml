      In this study we will examine the social-communicative skills of children with Developmental&#xD;
      Coordination Disorder (DCD) by using online parental questionnaires in children aged 5 to&#xD;
      15y.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder described in the&#xD;
      DSM-V characterized by motor coordination problems which significantly interfere with daily&#xD;
      living activities and participation. The problems cannot be explained by another disorder and&#xD;
      are already present in early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although DCD is a 'motor' disorder, other domains may equally be affected. Children with DCD&#xD;
      show lower health-related quality of life, more socio-emotional problems, and experience more&#xD;
      academic difficulties. It has been proposed that social skills may mediate the emergence of&#xD;
      socio-emotional problems at a later age. Previous research has suggested that socials skills&#xD;
      of children with DCD may be altered. However, the process remains unclear. One possible&#xD;
      hypothesis is that early motor coordination problems leads to avoiding or inhibits&#xD;
      age-appropriate physical and social activities, which may reduce the opportunities to develop&#xD;
      adequate socials skills and/or may impact negatively on a child's developing self-esteem and&#xD;
      create a sense of isolation and exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, it has been reported that these children spend more time playing alone and are often&#xD;
      onlookers instead of actively engaging in play. In general they exhibit a lower participation&#xD;
      rate which may contribute to the reported poorer peer relations, less (deep) friendships, and&#xD;
      a tendency for more bullying and loneliness. They also feel less competent in peer and social&#xD;
      relations. Poorer social interaction skills and more social communication problems have been&#xD;
      recognized in these children even interfering in non-verbal skills such as poorer recognizing&#xD;
      of facial expressions and emotions and a reduced tendency to follow gaze which may be similar&#xD;
      to children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be debated if these social problems are comorbid or rather a secondary consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the investigators aim to map social responsiveness problems in children with&#xD;
      Developmental Coordination Disorder and clarify if and which domains are most affected. The&#xD;
      investigators defined the following research question: &quot;Do children with Developmental&#xD;
      Coordination Disorder experience social responsiveness problems compared to typically&#xD;
      developing children? If so, which domains are most affected?&quot;.&#xD;

    <description>The SRS-2 is a parental 65-item questionnaire to detect difficulties in social responsiveness in children with autism spectrum disorder. Four different forms are available: preschoolers (2.5-4.5 years), school-aged children (4-18 years), adults (≥ 19 years) and adults self-report. In this study, only the form for school-aged children will be used.&#xD;
The DCDQ'07 is a parental 15-item questionnaire to detect the risk of DCD in children between 5 and 15 years of age. Parents are asked to compare their child's motor performance to his/her peers using a 5-point Likert scale. The total sum score is compared to age-specific cut-off scores to determine the risk of DCD. Belgian norms are available since 2007.</description>
