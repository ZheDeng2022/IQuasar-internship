      This is a prospective, observational, single center pilot trial to find out if a new&#xD;
      computerized technology for analysis of the electrical activity recorded during atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation can identify the electrical source of this arrhythmia. If we are able to&#xD;
      reliably identify the source, then in the future we may be able to use this technology to&#xD;
      determine the optimal sites for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in the heart. The&#xD;
      present study will compare the standard electrical recordings to the new computerized&#xD;
      algorithm analysis of recordings gathered at the same time. The study will enroll 30&#xD;
      participants with persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) that are&#xD;
      scheduled for elective catheter ablation of AF. The catheters that are being placed in the&#xD;
      heart are standard Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved mapping catheters. The&#xD;
      investigational computerized software that will be employed in the trial will be used after&#xD;
      the case has done and will not directly impact any of the activities during the ablation&#xD;
      procedure. Information learned from this trial will improve understanding of the mechanisms&#xD;
      of atrial fibrillation and will potentially improve success rates of AF ablation for patients&#xD;
      in the future and will be used to design a prospective trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that initiation and propagation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is dependent,&#xD;
      at least in part, on rapid atrial stimulation from focal sources. It is debated whether the&#xD;
      mechanism of arrhythmogenesis at these foci is abnormal automaticity, triggered activity,&#xD;
      microreentry or rotational reentry. However, after activation emerges from these &quot;driver&quot;&#xD;
      sites, fibrillatory conduction ensues resulting in the disorganized conduction pattern of AF.&#xD;
      Conventional mapping systems can either achieve high spatial resolution by sequential&#xD;
      tachycardia beats following a fixed intra-atrial activation pattern (as in macro reentrant&#xD;
      atrial flutter), or high temporal resolution with very low spatial resolution achieved&#xD;
      through multielectrode basket catheters. Activation mapping in AF with commercially available&#xD;
      mapping systems has been unsuccessful in identifying driver sites because atrial activation&#xD;
      patterns change on a beat-to-beat basis precluding the use of sequential mapping approaches,&#xD;
      and real-time mapping with basket electrodes lacks sufficient resolution to delineate the&#xD;
      complex patterns of conduction. Electrographic Flow (EGF) mapping (AblaMap®, Ablacon, Inc,&#xD;
      Wheat Ridge, CO) is a unique method to assess dominant patterns of intra-atrial conduction&#xD;
      during ongoing atrial fibrillation and has been previously described. Recordings from a&#xD;
      multielectrode basket catheter are analyzed for electrical activation vectors over sequential&#xD;
      2-second segments during a 60 second acquisition period. Patterns of reproducible vector&#xD;
      activation are used to identify driver sources for the AF. Multiple sources are often&#xD;
      identified in patients with persistent AF. It is anticipated that substrate modification of&#xD;
      these source regions will eliminate the AF drivers and result in a favorable response to&#xD;
      catheter ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergoing elective catheter ablation of AF will be enrolled. During the&#xD;
      elective catheter ablation and during ongoing AF, A 64-pole basket mapping catheter (FIRMap™,&#xD;
      Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) will be inserted into the right atrium, and electrical&#xD;
      signals will be passively acquired. This is the only aspect of the procedure that will be&#xD;
      research beyond standard of care. A 16-pole HD grid mapping catheter (Advisor™ HD Grid,&#xD;
      Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) will be inserted into the right atrium and high density&#xD;
      electrogram signals will be recorded from each site for 2 minutes. At least 6 sites will be&#xD;
      assessed. After transseptal catheterization, mapping of the left atrium will proceed in a&#xD;
      similar fashion. Electrogram signals will be recorded in the electroanatomical mapping system&#xD;
      as well as the 128-channel electrophysiology recording system. The collected electrogram data&#xD;
      will be analyzed post procedure.&#xD;
