  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a dramatic event resulting in a long-term handicap. Appropriate&#xD;
      care from admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is a key element not only for the&#xD;
      survival of these patients but also to promote their recovery. Moreover, the studies on&#xD;
      natural history of SCI have shown that most of the recovery occurs within the first 3 to 6&#xD;
      months post-injury. This period is therefore crucial for these patients. However, the&#xD;
      environment of the ICU and the acute condition of the patients limit the rehabilitation&#xD;
      possibilities. In such a context, functional proprioceptive stimulations (Vibramoov™ system,&#xD;
      Techno Concept, France) could be a tool of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using tendon vibrations, the Vibramoov™ system allows to reproduce the proprioceptive&#xD;
      signatures of cyclic movements such as walking. Some studies have already demonstrated the&#xD;
      benefits of proprioceptive vibrations. However, so far, these benefits have only been studied&#xD;
      at the chronic stage of neurological diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that early functional proprioceptive stimulations (FPS) may&#xD;
      reduce spasticity and promote sensorimotor recovery in tetraplegic and high paraplegic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test their hypothesis, the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial on 40&#xD;
      patients with traumatic SCI. These patients will be stratified into two groups according to&#xD;
      the completeness of their lesion. Every patient will be included within ten days post-injury&#xD;
      and receive either FPS, either sham stimulations to the joints of the lower limbs, 4 times a&#xD;
      week during 8 weeks. the primary outcome measures will assess spasticity. the investigators&#xD;
      also assess sensorimotor recovery, pain, muscle wasting, cognitive impairment and functional&#xD;
      status. &quot;&#xD;
