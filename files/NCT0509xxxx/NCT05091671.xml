    <textblock>
      To determine the effectiveness of the &quot;Free from Pain&quot; exercise and information programme.&#xD;
      The complete programme provides exercises and information for people over the age of 60 to&#xD;
      reduce early osteoarthritic and generalised musculoskeletal pain and fear of falling. The&#xD;
      study will compare the effects of 2 versions of the Free from Pain programme to ascertain&#xD;
      which is the most effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal conditions are the leading cause of disability worldwide. The World&#xD;
      Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.71 billion people have musculoskeletal&#xD;
      conditions worldwide. They cause a significant economic burden on the NHS. Â£5 billion of&#xD;
      England's yearly NHS budget goes towards the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disability from the initial pain is worsened by immobility, which will cause a loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass and fitness and an increased risk of falls, further injury, and diseases associated with&#xD;
      poor activity (such as heart attacks and some cancers). In chronic musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      conditions, providing information and participating in exercise programmes are commonly used.&#xD;
      However, there are no evidence-based recommendations on which plans are the most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Free from Pain&quot; exercise programme is a fusion of three different generally accepted&#xD;
      exercise programmes. Therapeutic exercise programmes exist for individual body parts, but&#xD;
      there is no single generalised exercise programme that targets all body parts. Hence, the&#xD;
      creation of this fusion of programmes. The three programmes are the Otago exercises for lower&#xD;
      body strength and balance, the motor control exercises for the lower back and the isometric&#xD;
      exercises for the neck and shoulder. The Otago exercise program (OEP) was developed by&#xD;
      Robertson and Campbell for the New Zealand accident compensation corporation (ACC). The aim&#xD;
      of the programme was to improve balance and strength in patients to prevent falls. The Otago&#xD;
      exercise programme has also been identified as an effective intervention in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults for coping with musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational information leaflets will also be provided as part of the programme. These&#xD;
      comprise an introductory leaflet, in addition to 12 reasons to exercise and 12 metaphor&#xD;
      leaflets. The 12 reasons to exercise leaflets provide evidence-based information regarding&#xD;
      the effects exercise can have on health. The 12 metaphor leaflets will contain metaphors used&#xD;
      by the lead investigator in his practice over many years. These metaphors attempt to link&#xD;
      everyday life with health, allowing laypersons to better understand the importance of certain&#xD;
      lifestyle choices in regard to maintaining health. It will be recommended to participants&#xD;
      that they read one reason to exercise leaflet and one metaphor each week for 12 weeks to&#xD;
      ensure that they absorb the information fully and do not overbear themselves with&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised control trial feasibility study which will be conducted over an 18-month&#xD;
      period, during which participants will be asked to provide data in the form of completed&#xD;
      surveys three times, at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The aim of this randomised control&#xD;
      trial feasibility study is to determine the effectiveness of the &quot;Free from Pain&quot; exercise&#xD;
      and information programme. The complete programme provides exercises and information for&#xD;
      people over the age of 60 in reducing early osteoarthritic and generalised musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain and fear of falling. The study will compare the effects of 2 versions of the Free from&#xD;
      Pain programme to ascertain which is the most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 60 participants who will be split into 2 groups. One group&#xD;
      will carry out the exercise classes independently at home, whereas the other group will&#xD;
      participate in the online zoom exercise classes with a trained individual leading the class.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire scores (MSK-HQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report changes in Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire scores to assess changes in musculoskeletal pain. The MSK-HQ is scored on a range of 0-56, with a higher score indicating better MSK-HQ health status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Pain as assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pain in the back, hips, knees, ankles and feet will be assessed via a self-report Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as follows: 0 to 10 where 0 is 'No Pain' and 10 is 'The worst imaginable pain', with total scoring range of 0-50.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usefulness scale for patient information material (USE)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reports using the usefulness scale for patient information material (USE) will be collected to assess the usefulness of the information leaflets provided. A maximum total score of 90 suggests that the participant 'completely agrees' with nine positive statements regarding the usefullness of the information material provided, whilst a minimum score of 0 suggests that they 'completely disagree' with said statements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-point Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Upon completion of the study, participants will be asked to rate on a 0-5 likert scale (where 0 means 'extremely likely' and 5 means 'extremely unlikely') how likely they are to recommend the exercise programme to friends or family who may require it.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Emergence of adverse effects in the form of additional pain as assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to refer to a 0-10 VAS pain scale (where 0 denotes pain-free and 10 denotes worst pain possible) if they experience any unexpected pain throughout the study period. If they experience pain which they determine to be 2 points higher on this scale than their pain level at the study onset, which they beleive to be as a result of the exercises, they will be asked to contact the research team, who will remove them from the study. The number of participants who are forced or wish to withdraw due to increased pain will be recorded and analysed to further ascertain the suitability and safety of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will have the initial online consultation and will be provided with the exercise booklet and the 12 information/metaphor leaflets. The ongoing 12 Zoom online sessions are not included in this option. Instead, participants will be asked to independently engage in the exercises within the exercise booklet. They will be advised to either do all 3 sets of exercises 3 times a week or to do the neck and low back exercises twice a week and the Otago exercises 3 times a week. The exercises should take around an hour to complete each day. The ideal plan would be as follows:&#xD;
Monday - Otago exercises. Tuesday - Neck and Back exercises. Wednesday - Otago exercises. Thursday - Rest day. Friday - Neck and Back exercises. Saturday - Otago exercises. Sunday - Rest day.</description>
