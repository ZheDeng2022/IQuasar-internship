  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection remains an important public health with more than 240&#xD;
      million people chronically infected despite the existence of an effective vaccine. Cirrhosis&#xD;
      and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are major complications of CHB infection and are&#xD;
      responsible for more than 600,000 deaths each year. These complications are strongly related&#xD;
      to the function of the immune system. Indeed, the persistence of HBV and the progression of&#xD;
      liver disease are mainly due to the development of an ineffective immune response to HBV.&#xD;
      Therefore, the clinical outcome depends on the complex interaction between HBV replication&#xD;
      and adaptive immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of antiviral treatments is the elimination of HBsAgHBs and the appearance&#xD;
      of anti-HBs antibodies without detectable PCR replication. Current treatments are effective&#xD;
      at lowering viral DNA levels, but they are not able to permanently eliminate chronic HBV&#xD;
      infection, due to the persistence of cDNA in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. This&#xD;
      therapeutic goal is rarely achieved and new therapeutic approaches are needed. In this sense,&#xD;
      Immunotherapy represents a very promising new therapeutic approach that could lead to the&#xD;
      cure of chronic HBV infection. Indeed, HBV infection is characterized by a progressive&#xD;
      depletion of T lymphocytes which results in a progressive loss of function, associated with a&#xD;
      sustained positive regulation of inhibitory control molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the objective of this study is to define the immune signature and the main control&#xD;
      pathways associated with T-cell depletion in patients chronically infected with HBV, by&#xD;
      analyzing immune cells isolated from these patients at phenotypic , transcriptional and&#xD;
      functional levels&#xD;
