    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, multi-center, prospective clinical study of camrelizumab in&#xD;
      combination with liposomal doxorubicin and losartan in patients with advanced or locally&#xD;
      advanced triple-negative breast cancer who had received no more than 1 prior line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Our aim was to explore the efficacy and safety of it.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered, single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical&#xD;
      trial to assess the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combination with liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin and losartan in female patients age of 18 to 70 with advanced or locally advanced&#xD;
      TNBC, and previously treated with no more than one line of chemotherapy in the advanced&#xD;
      setting. The number of patients to be included is 52 patients (Simons two stage design). All&#xD;
      enrolled patients will be treated with camrelizumab 200mg (iv. 3mg/kg for patient whose&#xD;
      weight is below 50kg) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg, Q3W&#xD;
      for 6 weeks) plus oral losartan (50 mg loading dose followed by 100 mg QD, Q3W, until&#xD;
      discontinuation of liposomal doxorubicin).The primary objective is to assess the overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death. Participants who were alive at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up assessment. Participants without follow-up assessment were censored at the day of last study medication and participants with no post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>DoR is defined as date of initial confirmed PR/CR until date of progressive disease or death from any cause. PR or CR or SD is according to RECIST version 1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ratio of CR,PR and SD greater than or equal to 24 weeks in all subjects</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.3.&#xD;
In general, AEs are graded according to the following: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE.&#xD;
The type, grade and frequency of AEs will be reported.</description>
