      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of total hip arthroplasty and conservative&#xD;
      treatment to hip pain, to activities of daily life and to the quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with hip osteoarthritis.&#xD;

      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare the effect of total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty and conservative treatment (that consists of self-driven exercises that physical&#xD;
      therapists teach to the patients) to hip pain, to activities of daily life and to the quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with hip osteoarthritis. Also the ill effects and cost effectiveness of&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty and conservative treatment are evaluated. Further more the aim is to&#xD;
      investigate if total hip arthroplasty alleviates osteoarthritic pain in 12-month follow-up&#xD;
      and if it enhances performance and quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints.&#xD;
The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties. Higher scores indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Hip Score (OHS)</measure>

    <description>The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) is a patient self-completion patient reported outcome containing 12 questions on activities of daily living. The OHS has been developed and validated specifically to assess function and pain for patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) surgery.&#xD;
Score each question from 0 to 4 with 4 being the best outcome. This method, when summed, produces overall scores running from 0 to 48 with 48 being the best outcome.</description>

    <measure>Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one year</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is an self-reported measure of health. It stems from a study called the Medical Outcomes Study.&#xD;
It comprises 36 questions which cover eight domains of health:&#xD;
Limitations in physical activities because of health problems.&#xD;
Limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems&#xD;
Limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems&#xD;
Bodily pain&#xD;
General mental health (psychological distress and well-being)&#xD;
Limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems&#xD;
Vitality (energy and fatigue)&#xD;
General health perceptions&#xD;
Patients or individuals are asked to fill out the questionnaire (tick boxes) by themselves and then it is scored by a clinician or researcher.&#xD;
Scores for the different domains are converted and pooled using a scoring key, for a total score indicating a range of low to high QOL.</description>

    <measure>painDetect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one year</time_frame>
