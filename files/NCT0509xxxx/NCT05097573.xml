    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single centre, evaluator-blind study of the performance of fractional&#xD;
      radiofrequency (RF) for the treatment and revision of stretch marks. The study will evaluate&#xD;
      the progress of 15 subjects requesting treatment of stretch marks. The study will involve&#xD;
      four treatments on both sides of the face with 4 week intervals between each treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed at 12 and 16 weeks after their last treatment. Analysis will be&#xD;
      performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Stretch Mark Improvement Assessed by the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at 16 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of overall stretch mark improvement assessed live by the Investigator and a subject assessment of stretch mark including the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).&#xD;
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a seven-grade subjective test.&#xD;
PI evaluated before and after photographs and graded them for change.&#xD;
Possible responses were (3) Very Much Improved, (2) Much Improved, (1) Improved, (0) No Change, (-1) Worse, (-2) Much Worse, and (-3) Very Much Worse. For reporting of outcomes, the higher the GAIS value, the greater the improvement (Range -3 to 3).</description>

    <description>Subjects' assessment of satisfaction with the treatment using a 5 point Subject Satisfaction Scale at 12 Weeks and 16 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
The Subject Satisfaction Scale is a five-grade subjective test.&#xD;
Participant were asked their satisfaction level post treatment.&#xD;
Possible responses were (4) Very Satisfied, (3) Satisfied, (2) Having No Opinion, (1) Unsatisfied, and (0) Very Unsatisfied.</description>

    <time_frame>12 and 16 Weeks Post-Final Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's assessment of discomfort and pain after treatments as measured by a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS).&#xD;
The Visual Analog Scale is a scale from 0 cm (no pain) and 10 cm (pain as bad as it can be).&#xD;
Possible responses were of 0 to 0.4 cm can be considered (no pain); 0.5 to 4.4 cm (mild pain), 4.5 to 7.4 cm (moderate pain), and 7.5 to 10 cm (severe pain).</description>

Participant were asked their tolerability level post treatment.&#xD;
Possible scores were; (4) Very Tolerable, (3) Tolerable, (2) Having No Opinion, (1) Intolerable, and (0) Very Intolerable.</description>
