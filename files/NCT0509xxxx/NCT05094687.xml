      INTRODUCTION: An outbreak of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2) occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China&#xD;
      in December 2019. Although pulmonary health has been the primary focus of studies during the&#xD;
      early days of COVID-19, recent studies show that cutaneous symptoms appear in patients of all&#xD;
      ages of COVID-19 patients, with differing levels of severity even in those patients who were&#xD;
      once thought to be asymptomatic to the infection. Recent studies show association of skin&#xD;
      manifestations of COVID-19 with severity of COVID-19 infection, which These days, ongoing&#xD;
      interest of clinical trials. Although not much is known concerning the pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms of these cutaneous manifestations, their identification may be vital to early&#xD;
      diagnosis and lead to possible better prognosis in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To examine cutaneous manifestations of Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLACE OF STUDY: Department of Dermatology Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Karachi,&#xD;
      Sindh, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: This descriptive longitudinal study will be conducted on patients&#xD;
      admitted in COVID-19 isolation unit of JPMC Karachi. Permission from the institutional&#xD;
      ethical review committee will be taken prior to conduction of study and demographic data and&#xD;
      written informed consent will be taken from every patient or their caregivers.Non-probability&#xD;
      convenience sampling method will be used. Sample size of study would be 350 polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients of any gender, any age will be included.&#xD;
      Detailed history and examination of patients including cutaneous examination be conducted in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. The data would included sex, age at the time of onset of COVID-19,&#xD;
      presence/ absence of comorbidities, the presence/absence of cutaneous manifestation,&#xD;
      cutaneous patterns, the duration of skin manifestations, skin-related symptoms, systemic&#xD;
      symptoms, the duration of systemic symptoms, the latency between the cutaneous manifestations&#xD;
      and systemic symptoms, death, and the severity of COVID-19. Patients with prior skin disease&#xD;
      will be excluded. Photographs of skin lesions will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: Data will be analysed using SPSS version 23 registered for Microsoft windows.&#xD;
      Mean and standard deviation will be calculated for expression of quantitative variables like&#xD;
      age, weight, duration of disease of skin and systemic symptoms, the latency between the&#xD;
      cutaneous manifestations and systemic symptoms. Frequencies and percentages will be&#xD;
      calculated for the gender, addiction, co-morbidities, presence or absence of cutaneous&#xD;
      manifestations, cutaneous patterns, presence of skin manifestations prior to onset of&#xD;
      systemic symptoms and systemic disease outcome. Effect modifiers like age, gender, weight,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, duration of symptoms will be controlled through stratification.&#xD;
      Poststratification will be recalculated and chi-square test will be applied. P-value of&#xD;
      &lt;0.05% will be considered as significant.&#xD;
