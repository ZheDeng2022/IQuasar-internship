      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of surufatinib, thereby&#xD;
      identifying the MTD and/or RP2D of surufatinib administered in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
      in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - evaluation of tolerability and safety of surufatinib administered in combination&#xD;
      with gemcitabine, and confirmation of the recommended clinical dose of surufatinib in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - evaluation of anti-tumor activity and confirmation of tolerability of surufatinib&#xD;
      administered in combination with gemcitabine in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, RMS, and non-RMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will enroll 2 to 6 patients per dose level cohort (up to 4 cohorts) with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors. During cycle 1, surufatinib will be administered, orally, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), as a single agent for 14 days followed by surufatinib daily in combination with&#xD;
      gemcitabine intravenously on days 15 and 22 (cycle 1 duration=35 days) and days 1 and 8 of&#xD;
      all subsequent cycles (cycle duration=21 days). Assessment based on dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) criteria will be performed in the first 35-day cycle (DLT Evaluation Period). This&#xD;
      study will utilize a rolling 6 design for part 1, with 3 dose escalation levels and 1 de&#xD;
      escalation level, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study will use a Simon 2-stage design with a maximum of 18 patients per cohort&#xD;
      (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, RMS, and non-RMS). Surufatinib will be administered orally at&#xD;
      identified MTD/RP2D daily in combination with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 weekly × 2 doses)&#xD;
      intravenously on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts 1 and 2, patients can remain on treatment until completing cycle 17, or until&#xD;
      progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or death; whichever comes first.&#xD;
