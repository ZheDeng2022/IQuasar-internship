  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of intranasal Dexmedetomidine sedation at Dose&#xD;
      of 2 mcg/kg and 4 mcg/kg in Children Undergoing MRI at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-four pediatric subjects who would undergo MRI with sedation were recruited. Subjects&#xD;
      aged between 1-10 years old, ASA I-II, weighed between 1-30 kg were included in this study&#xD;
      and assigned into two groups randomly. One group received 2 mcg/kg (IND2 group) and the other&#xD;
      group received 4 mcg/kg (IND 4 group) of intranasal dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done by the third party, who was not participated in the data collection,&#xD;
      by using randomization tool from www.randomizer.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of intranasal dexmedetomidine for each participant was concealed using closed envelope&#xD;
      and was opened preprocedure by the second party who prepared the sedation drugs. The doctor,&#xD;
      who gave sedation drug to the patient and recorded the data, was also blinded. All patients&#xD;
      were blinded to data collection. Patients were allowed to drink clear fluid until 2 hours and&#xD;
      required to fast for 6 hours before the procedure. Baseline heart rate, SpO2 was recorded&#xD;
      premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in IND 2 and IND 4 group received 2 mcg/kg and 4 mcg/kg intranasal dexmedetomidine.&#xD;
      Intranasal drugs were given 45 minutes before the MRI procedure through both nostrils using a&#xD;
      1 mL syringe. Patient was maintained in supine position for 1-2 minutes to maximize&#xD;
      absorption. After the patient was sedated, peripheral intravenous access was performed. The&#xD;
      level of sedation was assessed using RSS. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and RSS are recorded&#xD;
      every 10 minutes until the procedure was done. After the target sedation has been reached,&#xD;
      MRI started immediately. If the sedation target was not reached and/or the child moved, 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg rescue dose of propofol would be given. After completing the MRI procedure, the patient&#xD;
      was then transferred to the recovery room to record the recovery time. Outpatients were&#xD;
      allowed to go home when they reached Aldrete score of 9-10.&#xD;

Operational definition: Time calculated from the completion of the MRI procedure until the Aldrete score 9 is achieved&#xD;
(The Aldrete's scoring system is a commonly used scale for determining when patient can be safely discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit. A score of 8-10 is considered adequate to discharge a patient from Phase I of post anesthesia care.)</description>

Bradycardia (Heart Rate &lt; 60 x/min and/or decrease in HR &gt; 20% from baseline) Desaturation (Moderate desaturation if SpO2 &lt; 95% for 15 seconds, Severe desaturation if SpO2 &lt; 90% for 15 seconds) Allergic reaction (rash, itchy sensation, and hypotension)</description>

This study calculated the amount of rescue dose of propofol needed during the MRI procedure under following conditions:&#xD;
If sedation targets are not achieved, inadequate, or the patient is immobile, boluses of propofol 0.5 mg/kg intravenously could be given to the patient.</description>
