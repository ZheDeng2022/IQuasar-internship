  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to use immune molecule-specific drug treatment to leverage a&#xD;
      mechanistic understanding of the brain changes that drive sickness behaviour. This will&#xD;
      combine current therapy with innovative neuroimaging technologies to obtain data in humans&#xD;
      that has hitherto only been available in animal studies. Data supporting the role of&#xD;
      inflammatory molecules in sickness behaviours and other cognitive disorders are increasingly&#xD;
      compelling. A putative mechanism linking inflammatory proteins to sickness behaviour is&#xD;
      Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-driven increases in extracellular glutamate leading to changes&#xD;
      in neural function and brain network integrity and ultimately to sickness behaviour.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesise that TNF antagonism will effect changes in brain network&#xD;
      connectivity and sickness behaviour score, that Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients will show&#xD;
      changes in brain network connectivity and glutamate quantification in the brain and that RA&#xD;
      patients will show changes in monocyte infiltration into the brain that are correlated with&#xD;
      changes in sickness behaviours. This is a randomised, placebo-controlled waiting list study.&#xD;
      All patients will be eligible for anti-TNF treatment i.e. moderate to severe active disease&#xD;
      as defined by Physician. Participants will be randomised to immediate (fast tracked)&#xD;
      treatment or to treatment after 6-8 weeks (the routine waiting time). The latter group will&#xD;
      receive placebo during the treatment phase.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve participants aged over 18 years with RA and are scheduled to start&#xD;
      outpatient anti-TNF treatment (with Adalimumab) as part of standard clinical care, who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and none of the specified exclusion criteria. All will give full&#xD;
      informed consent. This is a single-blind, randomised placebo-controlled waiting list study&#xD;
      and after screening and consent, eligible participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive&#xD;
      either adalimumab or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises standard care screening for anti-TNF therapy (incorporated into the study&#xD;
      to allow us to fast track screening), a total of 7 research visits and one remote visit via&#xD;
      telephone. At Visit 1 (Day 0) and Visit 5 (Day 42), participants will undergo 7T MRI and MRS&#xD;
      Neuroimaging protocols that incorporate resting-state and task-based fMRI and glutamate MRS&#xD;
      measures. At Visit 2 (Day 1) and Visit 6 (Day 43), participants will undergo a SPECT scanning&#xD;
      protocol. This visit will involve a 160ml blood draw, from which monocytes will be isolated&#xD;
      and radiolabelled before being reinjected prior to SPECT scanning.&#xD;
