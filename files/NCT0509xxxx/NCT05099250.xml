  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgical procedures for the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis Laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy has clear benefits when compared with open surgery, but post-operative pain&#xD;
      is still a common complaint after it The patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy&#xD;
      suffers from severe post-operative pain, it can prolong hospital stay and lead to increased&#xD;
      morbidity Post-operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy pain can be relieved by some methods&#xD;
      pre-emptive analgesic regimens containing ketamine, regional anesthesia techniques including&#xD;
      paravertebral block Paravertebral Block is a regional anesthetic and analgesic technique&#xD;
      which may offer comparable analgesic effectiveness with minimal side effects Paravertebral&#xD;
      Block has been used a lot in the last two decades, several studies show its efficacy in,&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery and laparoscopic cholecystectomy .Paravertebral block is the technique&#xD;
      of injecting local anesthetic adjacent to the thoracic vertebra close to where the spinal&#xD;
      nerves emerge from the intervertebral foramina, resulting in ipsilateral somatic and&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve blockade in multiple dermatomes above and below the site of injection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic that is capable of producing prolonged high quality&#xD;
      analgesia in the postoperative period It is shown that paravertebral block using bupivacaine&#xD;
      significantly reduces pain score Many drugs have been used as adjuvants to local anesthetic&#xD;
      in peripheral nerve block in order to augment its analgesic effect and prolong the duration&#xD;
      of the block such as opioids and magnesium sulfate Many studies have reported safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of adding magnesium to local anesthetics in various regional anesthetic procedures,&#xD;
      such as intrathecal, epidural, caudal, brachial plexus blocks and intravenous regional&#xD;
      anesthesia. Magnesium play a major role in central nociceptive transmission, modulation and&#xD;
      sensitization of acute and chronic pain states due to its antagonistic effect on N-methyl&#xD;
      D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors .&#xD;

      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a blind prospective randomized controlled study that will be conducted for one year&#xD;
      in Mansoura university hospitals after approval from the Institutional Research Board (IRB),&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, patients will be interviewed and written informed&#xD;
      consents will be obtained. This study will include 26 patients of American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists physical status grade I and grade II, of both sexes, aged between 20-60&#xD;
      years who will be scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation A Priori G-power analysis was done to estimate study sample size. A&#xD;
      power of 90% was estimated with type I error of 0.05 to get an analgesic duration difference&#xD;
      between groups of approximately 30% to yield of total sample size of 50 cases (25cases per&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients (number = 50) had laparoscopic cholecystectomy and bilateral paravertebral&#xD;
      block during the study period. These patients were randomly allocated to undergo bilateral&#xD;
      ultrasound guided paravertebral block. The groups allocated are concealed in sealed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes which were not opened until patient consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: Bupivacaine Group (B group) Number=25 :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Included patients who received 17 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine + 3 mL mili saline 0.9% in a&#xD;
           total volume of 20 ml on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Magnesium Group (M group) N=25 :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients who received 17 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine + 3 mL of 75 mg milgram magnesium&#xD;
      sulfate diluted in 0.9% saline in a total volume of 20 ml on each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were performed by the same anesthetic team with standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be visited a day prior to surgery and will be assessed preoperatively by&#xD;
      History, physical examination and laboratory evaluation (complete blood picture, coagulation&#xD;
      profile, liver function and renal function tests). The study protocol and paravertebral block&#xD;
      procedure will be explained to all patients. All patients will be familiar with the use of&#xD;
      0-10 visual analogue scale score identifying 0 as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain.&#xD;
      Patient fast 6-8 hour before the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival of the patient to the operating room routine monitoring will be applied,&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous cannula 20 gauge will be inserted and 0.9% saline will be started to&#xD;
      be infused. All patients will be premedicated using midazolam 0.03 mg/kg kilo intravenous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block will be performed before induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of ultrasound guided paravertebral nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard precautions for the performance of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks will be&#xD;
           followed which include continuous routine monitoring, the skin overlying the injection&#xD;
           site should be free of signs of infection and prepped with an antiseptic solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will lay in the lateral position, paravertebral block will be done using a 38 mm&#xD;
           mile meter broadband linear array ultrasound probe.The probe surface in contact with the&#xD;
           skin should be covered with a sterile adhesive dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sagittal paramedian view of the paravertebral space will be obtained by applying the&#xD;
           probe at a point 2.5 cm centimeter lateral to the tip of the spinous process in a&#xD;
           vertical orientation, The fifth thoracic vertebral level will be identified by palpating&#xD;
           and counting down from the seventh cervical body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The midpoint of the transducer will be aligned midway between the transverse processes&#xD;
           of thoracic vertebra T5 and T6, 4 ml of 1 % lidocaine was injected subcutaneously at the&#xD;
           puncture site,and 22 gauge spinal needle will be inserted in an in plane approach in a&#xD;
           cephalad orientation and will be advanced perpendicularly to all skin planes under&#xD;
           direct vision to puncture the superior costotransverse ligament where a click may be&#xD;
           appreciated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following negative aspiration, 1-2 ml of study solution will be injected to verify&#xD;
           correct position of the needle tip and the rest of study solution will be injected in&#xD;
           fractioned doses following intermittent aspiration between the superior costotransverse&#xD;
           ligament and the parietal pleura which will be displaced anteriorly by the injectate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Similar approach will be used for the paravertebral block on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory block over the area of surgical incision will be confirmed by loss of cold&#xD;
           sensation using an alcohol swab and pinprick sensation using a 23 G gauge needle every 3&#xD;
           mint until 15 min after injection of the study solutions and before starting general&#xD;
           anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Anesthesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Anesthesia will be induced using intravenous propofol (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl IV&#xD;
      (1Âµ/kg) microgram/kilo and atracurium besylate (0.6 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation. Then&#xD;
      patient will be mechanically ventilated using a volume control mode with Tv 6-8ml/kg,&#xD;
      respiratory rate 10-14 breath/min and I.E. ratio 1:2 to maintain Etco2 35-40 mmHg mli&#xD;
      mercury. Anesthesia will be maintained using minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane&#xD;
      1.2% and 60% air in O2 mixture with top up dose of atracurium. Intraoperative IV fluids will&#xD;
      be given per body weight and according to intraoperative loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be extubated at the end of surgery after neuromuscular reversal with&#xD;
      administration of neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and IV atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and fulfilling the&#xD;
      criteria of extubation. The duration of the surgery will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In operating room, monitoring will be achieved by five lead electro cardi gram, oxygen&#xD;
           saturation and non-invasive mean arterial blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Base line values of heart rate, oxygen saturation and non-invasive mean arterial blood&#xD;
           pressure will be collected before and after paravertebral block, just after induction of&#xD;
           anesthesia, at skin incision, then recording will be done every 15 mint till the end of&#xD;
           the first hour and then every 30min interval till the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensory block onset will be defined when the patient subjectively evaluate the&#xD;
           intensities of both cold and pinprick sensations in the blocked side decrease 75 % or&#xD;
           more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery will be defined as the time from induction to discharge from the&#xD;
           operating room will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of increased in intra-operative systolic blood pressure and heart rate of more&#xD;
           than 20% of baseline for longer than 5min, incremental doses of fentanyl IV 0.5Âµ/kg will&#xD;
           be given and the case will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On admission into the post operative care unit, all vital data &amp; hemodynamics&#xD;
           (non-invasive mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) will be&#xD;
           recorded at 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hrs. postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative complications will be recorded including post-operative nausea and&#xD;
           vomiting treated by metoclopramide, hypotension treated by phenylephrine drops,&#xD;
           bradycardia treated by atropine or pneumothorax, respiratory depression and chest pain,&#xD;
           respiratory depression is defined as respiratory rate less than 8 per minute or oxygen&#xD;
           saturation below 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis of data will be done by using excel program for&#xD;
      figures and Statistical Package for Social Science program version 22. To test the normality&#xD;
      of data distribution Kolmogorov- Smirnov test will be done only significant data revealed to&#xD;
      be nonparametric. Unpaired student-t test will be used for comparisons of numerical variables&#xD;
      between-group, if its assumptions were fulfilled, otherwise for non-parametric; the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test will be used. The description of data done in the form of mean (Â±SD)&#xD;
      stander division for quantitative data and frequency and proportion for qualitative data. Any&#xD;
      difference or change showing probability (P) less than 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant at confidence interval 95%.&#xD;
