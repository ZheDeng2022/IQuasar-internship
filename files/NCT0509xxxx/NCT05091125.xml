  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with mild head trauma, a large number of CT scans are performed. The S100B&#xD;
      protein allows, when the dosage is below the threshold, to rule out the diagnosis of brain&#xD;
      damage with a negative predictive value of 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients over 65 years old it was found that the dosage of S100B came back positive more&#xD;
      often compared to a younger population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to determine the positivity threshold value for S100B dosage in patients&#xD;
      over 65 years old. In patients over 65 years suffering from mild head trauma, a head CT will&#xD;
      systematically be performed (in accordance with the recommendations) and the S100B will be&#xD;
      measured (taken from an additional tube on the blood test carried out in these patients). The&#xD;
      results of the TDM will then be compared with the results of the S100B to determine the&#xD;
      values of sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of different&#xD;
      thresholds.&#xD;
