  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the effects of chewing efficiency on human gut microbiome&#xD;
      composition and function.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our working hypothesis is that increased chewing will lead to an increase in short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acid production We further expect this effect to lead to a detectable decrease in fecal&#xD;
      particle size and distinct changes in gut microbial community composition. Here, we will&#xD;
      explore this hypothesis using a fixed-order within-subjects study design in a group of&#xD;
      healthy participants. Each participant will have one week of normal dietary habits and one&#xD;
      week of increased chewing time. We will collect stool samples three times per week in order&#xD;
      to measure microbial abundance and metabolism.&#xD;
