      Popular topic:Clinical trials of the consistency and non-inferiority bridging between batches&#xD;
      of recombinant new coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) Research purpose:Main purpose:1)To&#xD;
      evaluate the interbatch consistency of immunogenicity of three batches of recombinant Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) following process validation in 18-59 year olds. 2)To&#xD;
      evaluate the non-inferiority of immunogenicity of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO&#xD;
      cells) from the combined batch and pilot scale batch after process validation in 18-59 years&#xD;
      of age. Secondary purpose:1)To evaluate the safety of each batch of recombinant Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) in patients aged 18-59 years.2)To evaluate the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of immunogenicity of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) from&#xD;
      the combined batch and commercial batch after process validation in 18-59 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:This trial adopts a randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled trial&#xD;
      design. Study population:The study involved people aged 18-59. Test groups:A total of 1680&#xD;
      subjects were enrolled in this clinical trial and randomly divided into 4 groups at 1:1:1:1&#xD;
      (pilot scale batch: process verification batch 1: process verification batch 2: process&#xD;
      verification batch 3) , 420 cases per group.&#xD;

      Overall design: In this study, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled trial design&#xD;
      was used to evaluate the inter-batch consistency of immunogenicity of the three batches of&#xD;
      recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) after process validation in 18-59 year olds&#xD;
      and the non-inferiority of immunogenicity between the three batches after process validation&#xD;
      and the pilot scale batches. Non-inferiority of immunogenicity between the three batches&#xD;
      after process validation and the commercial scale batches (clinical trials have been&#xD;
      conducted), and the safety of each vaccine batch after vaccination was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Group A: 3 doses of experimental vaccine (pilot scale batch) were given at day&#xD;
      0, 30 and 60; Group B: 3 doses of experimental vaccine (process validation lot 1) at day 0,&#xD;
      30 and 60; Group C: 3 doses of experimental vaccine (process validation lot 2) at day 0, 30&#xD;
      and 60; Group D: 3 doses of experimental vaccine (process validation lot 3) at day 0, 30 and&#xD;
      60;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity observation:Blood samples were collected before the first dose and 14 days&#xD;
      after the whole immunization, and the serum was separated for detection of live virus&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies (CPE method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) All adverse events (AE) were collected 30 minutes after each dose, all AE (including both&#xD;
      solicitation and non-solicitation AE) at 0-7 days, and all AE (non-solicitation AE) at 8-30&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solicitation AE (the following events occurring within 7 days of vaccination) :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adverse events at the inoculation site (local) : pain, swelling, induration, redness,&#xD;
           rash, pruritus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vital signs: fever;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non-inoculated site (systemic) adverse events: headache, fatigue/fatigue, nausea,&#xD;
           vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain (non-inoculated site), cough, acute allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) All SAE were collected from the first dose to 12 months after full immunization.&#xD;
