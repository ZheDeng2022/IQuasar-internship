    <textblock>
      As part of a post approval commitment, the MFDS has requested a study to characterize safety&#xD;
      in patients who are treated with FASENRA for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype by&#xD;
      physicians in normal clinical practice settings. This study is designed to confirm or assess&#xD;
      the known safety profile or identify previously unsuspected adverse reactions and to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of FASENRA under conditions of routine daily medical practice in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information on the Korean patient population that is treated with&#xD;
      this drug.&#xD;
