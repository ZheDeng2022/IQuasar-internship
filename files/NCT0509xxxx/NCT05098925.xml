  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human beings are characterized by their extraordinary ability to thermoregulate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a physical exercise, only 20% of the energy provided by the substrates is converted&#xD;
      into muscular mechanical work. The remaining 80% is released as heat. In temperate&#xD;
      environments, so-called metabolic heat is dissipated by several physical phenomena&#xD;
      (radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation). However, if the dissipation capacity (in&#xD;
      a hot and humid environment for example) is lower than the production of metabolic heat, the&#xD;
      body temperature increases progressively until exercise stops or heat-related pathologies&#xD;
      develop. This pathological entity defined by the acronym EHI for Exertional Heat Illness&#xD;
      gather a wide spectrum of clinical forms ranging from oedema or heat rash, to muscle cramps,&#xD;
      to syncope; up to more serious forms such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heatstroke during exercise is the second most common cause of death in athletes after heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the results of the epidemiological studies and the recommendations are limited to&#xD;
      events with effort durations or distances not exceeding those of the marathon. They therefore&#xD;
      do not consider ultra-endurance disciplines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These disciplines, defined by durations of effort of at least 6 hours, have specific&#xD;
      characteristics (duration of effort, intensity, steep gradients, exotic destinations, extreme&#xD;
      environments) which means that extrapolation of the results and knowledge of the physiology&#xD;
      of thermoregulation from &quot;classic&quot; endurance events, such as marathons, to ultra-endurance&#xD;
      events is hazardous. There are therefore significant areas of uncertainty in understanding&#xD;
      the thermoregulatory function, prevalence of EHI (Exertional Heat Illness) and health&#xD;
      implications of ultra-endurance running in a hot environment. This is the context of&#xD;
      ERUPTION-2.&#xD;
