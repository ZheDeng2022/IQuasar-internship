      This study was conducted to see the effect of proprioceptive exercises on pain and function&#xD;
      in Non-specific chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty participants with chronic Non-specific neck pain were enrolled in this study. During&#xD;
      the final week of treatment, 14 patients were assessed at the end of the sixth treatment&#xD;
      week. Participants were randomized into two groups treatment group and control group. Both&#xD;
      groups were treated with conventional treatment which were strengthening exercises. Treatment&#xD;
      group was also treated by proprioception exercises. For measurement of pain and disability&#xD;
      NPRS and NDI scales were used. Exercise regime distributed in six weeks period one session&#xD;
      per week exercise, 10-12 repetitions with 1-minute rest interval, lasted 45 minutes in both&#xD;
      groups. pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements were taken.&#xD;

There are four items that relate to symptoms(pain intensity ,headache, concentration ,sleeping)and six items that relate daily activities of life(lifting, work, driving, recreation, personal care, reading) 5-14 score :mild disability,15-24 score moderate disability,25-34 score severe disability,&gt;35 complete disable</description>

Head relocation it involve the practice of relocating head back to natural head posture and to predetermined positions in range first with eyes open using feedback from a laser attached to their head and then with closed all active movement of cervical flexion extension lateral flexion and rotations were used.&#xD;
Gaze stability oculomotor exercises commencing with eyes movement with the head stationary, progressing to movement of head with visual fixation on a target.&#xD;
Eye head coordination exercises, commenced with rotation of eyes and head to the same side in both right and left directions. Then progressed with both eyes and head move in opposite direction</description>
