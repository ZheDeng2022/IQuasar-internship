  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Portugal, there is an increase in cases of depression (from 6.9% to 9.8%) and anxiety&#xD;
      (from 3.5% to 6.5%), among those enrolled in health care centers. Although the prevalence of&#xD;
      both disorders' peaks in older adulthood, depression and anxiety often have their onset in&#xD;
      youth. The high prevalence of psychological morbidity has been a cause for concern, given the&#xD;
      associations between depression and anxiety in youth and other chronic mental disorders,&#xD;
      stress, physical health problems and poorer quality of life (QoL), and physical disorders in&#xD;
      older age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevention of psychological morbidity in young people is crucial to reduce its adverse&#xD;
      effects on young adults' development, school performance, social functioning, and to prevent&#xD;
      its harmful impact on QoL. Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered the most effective&#xD;
      intervention for the treatment of anxiety and depression in young people. In this study, a&#xD;
      behavioral relaxation technique, i.e., relaxation, will be used. This technique has positive&#xD;
      effects on psychological morbidity, specially Schultz's autogenic relaxation training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrostimulation therapy, a non-invasive technique that uses electrical micro current for&#xD;
      therapeutic purposes, is an innovative way of treating psychological morbidity, and has&#xD;
      proven to be effective in reducing stress, depression and anxiety. Recently, studies found&#xD;
      that cortical stimulation was associated with a reduction in depression, effects maintained&#xD;
      after the treatment end. Also, there is evidence that there are improvements in depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, pain and sleep, which were maintained after 4 treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high incidence of psychological morbidity in emerging adulthood, as well as&#xD;
      its harmful impact on adulthood, the importance of this research aimed at reducing&#xD;
      psychological morbidity in young adults and promoting QoL throughout life stands out. This&#xD;
      study aims to answer the question &quot;Does an electrostimulation therapy intervention have an&#xD;
      impact on psychological morbidity and QoL when compared to a cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      intervention?&quot;, with the main objective of contributing to reducing psychological morbidity&#xD;
      in young adults, as well as promoting their QoL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an&#xD;
      intervention of electrostimulation versus relaxation with guided imagery (Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy-TCC), according to four conditions: 1) Electrostimulation - Experimental&#xD;
      Group 1 (EG1); 2) Relaxation with guided imagery + Electrostimulation - Experimental Group 2&#xD;
      (EG2); 3) Relaxation with guided imagery (standard) - Active Control Group (ACG); 4) Placebo&#xD;
      (patients will be connected to the electrodes but receive no electrical stimulation) -&#xD;
      Passive Control Group (PCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically Pilot RCT specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare ACG and PCG versus EG1 and EG2, over time, on physical and psychological&#xD;
           morbidity, emotional reactivity, perceived stress, emotional regulation, satisfaction&#xD;
           with life and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyse the differences over time in the two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) in&#xD;
           physical and psychological morbidity, emotional reactivity, perceived stress, emotional&#xD;
           regulation, life satisfaction and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore, in EG1 and EG2, the mediating role of psychological morbidity in the&#xD;
           relationship between emotional reactivity and life satisfaction/QoL over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the mediating role, in EG1 and EG2, of emotional regulation in the&#xD;
           relationship between perceived stress, life satisfaction and QoL over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study design is longitudinal with 3 evaluation moments: pre-test (T0), post-test&#xD;
           (T1), and 1-month post-intervention follow-up (T2). At the end of the study, the PCG&#xD;
           will be offered the opportunity to receive intervention whether electrical stimulation&#xD;
           or relaxation with guided imagery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b) Procedure The study plan is experimental (RCT) with randomization across four&#xD;
           conditions: 1) Electrostimulation therapy - Experimental Group 1 (GE1); 2) Relaxation +&#xD;
           Electrostimulation therapy - Experimental Group 2 (GE2); 3) Relaxation (standard) -&#xD;
           Active Control Group (ACG); 4) Placebo (participants connected to the electrodes, but&#xD;
           without emission of electrical frequency) - Passive Control Group (PCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The young adults (students) of the different courses of the University will be contacted&#xD;
           online for participation in the study. Participation is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Experimental Group (EG1 and EG2) Electrostimulation therapy will include six 20-minute&#xD;
           sessions, weekly. The EG2 will receive two sessions in the same week, one of&#xD;
           electrostimulation therapy and another of relaxation (CT). The first session of EG1 and&#xD;
           EG2 will include a psychoeducational component, where it will be explained that&#xD;
           psychological morbidity and stress influence the immune system, with repercussions on&#xD;
           QoL, and the objective of the intervention is to reduce depressive and anxious symptoms&#xD;
           and the impact of stress. The relaxation sessions (CT) are based on Schultz's autogenic&#xD;
           relaxation training, a relaxation technique based on autosuggestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Passive Control Group Participants in the PCG will undergo a placebo in which they will&#xD;
           be connected to the handles but will not receive any frequency during the 20 minutes.&#xD;
           These sessions will take place at the same location and with the same weekly frequency&#xD;
           as EG1 and EG2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Active Control Group (ACG) Participants in thr ACG will undergo relaxation (CT). The&#xD;
           sessions, as the PCG, EG1 and EG2, will have weekly frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c) Sample size calculation The sample size calculation for a pilot RCT, considering the&#xD;
           average effect size of 0.5, a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 5%,&#xD;
           revealed that 12 participants were needed in each of the groups. This approach considers&#xD;
           that one-sided 80% confidence interval for the effect size will exclude the minimum&#xD;
           clinically significant difference if the null hypothesis is true.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d) Data analysis To assess the feasibility of this pilot study (aim 1), the rates of&#xD;
           eligibility, recruitment and adherence to the study protocol, participation in the&#xD;
           follow-up and withdrawal will be calculated and its results will be presented in&#xD;
           percentage. To obtain preliminary estimates of the intervention effects' on health&#xD;
           outcome measures (aim 2), descriptive measures of the respective variables (means and&#xD;
           standard deviations) will be calculated and Generalized Mixed Models will be used to&#xD;
           check for statistically significant differences over time, in the different groups. Data&#xD;
           will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS) version&#xD;
           27.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e) Ethical considerations Young adults will be informed about the objectives of the&#xD;
           study. If they accept to participate, they will be asked to complete the informed&#xD;
           consent form. At the end of the suty, participants in the passive and active control&#xD;
           groups will be given the opportunity to receive the relaxation intervention with guided&#xD;
           imagination and electrostimulation therapy, respectively. The participants who, in the&#xD;
           follow-up assessment, presented anxiety/depression symptoms above 8 will be informed of&#xD;
           the possibility of enrolling in the Psychology Association to receive psychological&#xD;
           support if they wish.&#xD;
