  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are among the important health problems that cause mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity both in our country and in the World (Sidar vd 2013). According to the data of the&#xD;
      Turkish Statistical Institute (2021), circulatory system diseases were the first cause of&#xD;
      mortality in our country in 2018 with a rate of 38.4%. According to the data of the World&#xD;
      Health Organization, the disease that causes the most death in the world is ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease with 16% (World Health Organization,2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to acute care, the aim of education in patients with cardiovascular surgery is to&#xD;
      support patients' self-care and post-operative recovery, to enable patients and their&#xD;
      families to self-manage their care at home, to reduce postoperative complications and&#xD;
      rehospitalization rates(Akyolcu vd 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training can be delivered using a combination of formats including brochures, online, books,&#xD;
      audio cassette, videotape, and/or skype (Fredericks &amp; Yau, 2012). Booklets, brochures,&#xD;
      tele-health, and web design methods were used in the training given to patients who had heart&#xD;
      surgeries in previous years in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the training booklet to be used in the education to be given to the patients&#xD;
      will be prepared by the researchers. The content of the prepared training booklet will be&#xD;
      presented to patients in the form of a mobile application that can run on smart phones with&#xD;
      Android operating system so that patients can follow it. With this research, it is aimed to&#xD;
      facilitate access to information and accelerate post-operative recovery. In the future, this&#xD;
      practice will also contribute to reducing stationery costs.&#xD;

      In this study, the training booklet to be used in the education to be given to the&#xD;
      participants will be prepared by the researchers. In addition, the content of the prepared&#xD;
      training booklet will be presented to participants in the form of a mobile application that&#xD;
      can run on smart phones with Android operating system so that participants can follow it. In&#xD;
      the content of the mobile application, there will be an interface with the information in the&#xD;
      booklet and the video narration of the exercises that the participants should do. This&#xD;
      application will be downloadable through the server and then there will be no internet&#xD;
      requirement to use the application. The mobile application will be installed on the&#xD;
      participants' own phones. The participants will be able to adjust the font size in the&#xD;
      application. The participants will see the titles in the booklet and will reach the&#xD;
      information by choosing the subject curious about. Participants will also be able to listen&#xD;
      to the information in the booklet in the form of an audio recording. In addition, reminder&#xD;
      notifications for medications and exercises will be set for participants in the mobile&#xD;
      application. In this way, it will be easier for participants to access information, and it&#xD;
      will be ensured that participants do not forget participants medication hours and that they&#xD;
      do the exercises participants need to do during the day without forgetting. Every day between&#xD;
      18.30-20.30, a questionnaire will be sent to the user to evaluate the amount/time of exercise&#xD;
      participants has applied for that day. Thus, it will be ensured that the answers of the&#xD;
      participants are sent to the server and the daily follow-up of the participants will be&#xD;
      carried out. The device will need internet access to send information. The information sent&#xD;
      will be kept on the database and can be easily processed. However, it will be possible to&#xD;
      easily access the user's historical information without data confusion. It is planned to&#xD;
      store the data on MySql (My Structured Query Language) database. If any update is required to&#xD;
      the application, it will be carried out quickly through the server. After the research, the&#xD;
      use of the mobile application will be continued and sustainability will be ensured in the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and psychological well-being of the participants.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This research was planned as an experimental randomized controlled trial. Randomization will be done using a computer program. With the computer program (www.randomizer.org), the participants will be divided into 2 subgroups (group 1: patient education group; group 2: patient education group not provided). With the randomization program, the order of the experimental and control groups will be provided.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Postoperative Recovery Index (PoRI) at month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 3</time_frame>
    <description>There are 5 sub-dimensions of PoRI; psychological symptoms, physical activities, general symptoms, intestinal symptoms, and craving-desire symptoms. The scores of the items included in the sub-dimensions are summed, their arithmetic average is taken, and the sub-dimension score is determined. A minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 points can be obtained from the PoRI. High scores from the index reflect more difficulty in post-operative recovery, while low scores indicate that post-operative recovery is easier.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Psychological Well-Being at month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Flourishing Scale (FS), which is a psychological well-being scale in Turkish identifies important elements of human function, from positive relationships to feelings of efficacy to having a meaningful and purposeful life. The items of FS are answered between 1 and 7, as I strongly disagree (1) to I strongly agree (7). A minimum of 8 and a maximum of 56 points can be obtained from the FS. A high score indicates that the person has many psychological resources and strengths.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in StateTrait Anxiety Inventory at month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of two parts, the 'state anxiety scale', which is created with the aim of determining the instantaneous feelings, and the 20-item 'trait anxiety scale', which was created to determine the feelings in general. It is a four degree scale ranging from 'Nothing' to 'All'. Scores range from 20 (low anxiety) to 80 (high anxiety).</description>
