      The protocol, in accordance with the objectives of ORCHESTRA project - Work Package 2, aims&#xD;
      at investigating the characteristics and determinants of COVID-19 long-term sequelae. This&#xD;
      goal will be reached through the harmonization of follow-up strategies across the&#xD;
      participating cohorts to allow a standardized collection of data on COVID-19 long-term&#xD;
      sequelae. The result will be a platform including a set of data and biomaterials from large&#xD;
      scale international cohorts, that will be uniformly recorded, prospectively tracked and&#xD;
      analysed. The ultimate goal will be that of providing evidence to contribute to the&#xD;
      optimization and improvement of the management of COVID-19 sequelae and to their prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will be organized in multiple levels of tests according to the capability of&#xD;
      each cohort and will include questionnaires to collect demographic, epidemiological and&#xD;
      clinical data, physical examination, radiological exams and biological sampling. The&#xD;
      long-term follow-up will also allow the assessment of long-term immunological response to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and its association to different treatment strategies, including&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies and vaccination.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, observational, prospective cohort study investigating COVID-19&#xD;
      sequelae in hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients up to 18 months after the diagnosis of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in multiple European and non-European countries, accounting for&#xD;
      the participation of approximately 7500 individuals in the prospective follow-up data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of clinical data, administration of questionnaires, collection of biological&#xD;
      samples and imaging will take place at fixed time-points to allow a comprehensive follow-up&#xD;
      of COVID-19 patients. The follow-up will include two levels of assessments: the first one is&#xD;
      mandatory, the second one will be customized according to the feasibility of each cohort. An&#xD;
      ad hoc database will be provided to each COVID-19 cohort involved to allow homogeneous and&#xD;
      standardized data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORCHESTRA has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation&#xD;
      programme under grant agreement No 101016167&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Main objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe characteristics of COVID-19 sequelae, including type, rate, and length&#xD;
           through clinical, laboratory, and radiological assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate valuable, confounder-adjusted, associations between COVID-19 sequelae and&#xD;
           COVID-19 severity, comorbidities, aetiology (SARS-CoV-2 variants), COVID treatment&#xD;
           (including monoclonal antibodies), and trends in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the rate, the aetiology (SARS-CoV-2 variants), severity, and clinical&#xD;
           determinants of COVID-19 re-infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, data retrieved from COVID-19 cohorts will address the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the time course of the immunological response of the population with sequelae&#xD;
           with the immunological response of the population without sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate immunological patterns related to specific long-term sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate possible associations of SARS-CoV-2 variants with COVID-19 severity, time&#xD;
           course of the immunological response, and long-term sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the rate and severity of sequelae and immunological trends of COVID-19 in&#xD;
           patients vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the time course of intestinal and pulmonary microbiome after SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate possible associations of long-term sequelae with hypercoagulability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the relationship between risk perception of reinfection and the adherence to&#xD;
           preventative measures over time after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, including vaccine&#xD;
           acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the use of health care services among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify human and viral genetic markers indicative of disease severity using WGS or&#xD;
           WES followed by functional analysis of the most promising variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients will be recruited by the study team at the treating hospital. Outpatients will be&#xD;
      recruited by the study team in the emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, and through the&#xD;
      coordination with regional primary care networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for up to 18 months after the SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.&#xD;
      The recruitment can take place at any time between the SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis and the&#xD;
      end of the 18-month follow-up, provided that the patient ensures at least one follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Discharged inpatients as well as recovered outpatients will be invited to participate&#xD;
      by a phone call (which will be repeated once in case of no reply). The screening/baseline&#xD;
      data collection (including the informed consent process) can be carried out on the same day&#xD;
      of a follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first patient is recruited at a location, the responsible investigator will ensure&#xD;
      that all legal and regulatory requirements are met. Patients can revoke their consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study without restriction at any time and at their own request, without&#xD;
      giving reasons and without any consequences for their future treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by the cohort of University of Verona (UNIVR), the cohort of&#xD;
      University of Bologna (UNIBO), the French Covid-19 cohort (INSERM), COVID-HOME study from&#xD;
      University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche Médicale&#xD;
      (FCRM) cohort - Republic of The Congo, Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS) cohort, the cohort of&#xD;
      the Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena (HUVM), the cohort of Universidade Federal de São&#xD;
      Paulo (UNIFESP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to improve the COVID-19 patient care in the context of routine clinical care.&#xD;
      Considering the lack of standardized follow-up pathways for COVID-19 patients, the selection&#xD;
      of assessments has been based on available evidence and according to the definition of good&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organization of follow-up visits will be up to each center, according to the facilities&#xD;
      and logistics of outpatient monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will last 18 months. Day 0 corresponds to the time of the first positive&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 test. The screening/baseline data collection (including the informed consent&#xD;
      process,) can be carried out on the same day of a follow-up visit. Procedures conducted as&#xD;
      part of the participant's routine clinical management at the time of SARS-CoV-2 active&#xD;
      infection and obtained before the signature of the informed consent form may be recorded,&#xD;
      provided that the procedures meet the criteria specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will occur at the following time-points: 3, 6, 2, 18 month(s). During each&#xD;
      time-point, epidemiological data collection (SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status), treatment data&#xD;
      collection (comorbidity management), clinical assessments (relevant medical new events,&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptom assessment, physical examination, vital signs, 6-minute walking test), and&#xD;
      the administration of questionnaires on functional status, respiratory impairment, and mental&#xD;
      health will be performed as part of level I (mandatory) assessments, as well as the&#xD;
      assessment of the SARS-CoV-2 immunological status (SARS-CoV-2 antibodies). A SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      molecular test will be repeated only if positive at the previous follow-up visit.&#xD;
      Self-administered questionnaires on symptoms, will be completed daily by the participant to&#xD;
      provide timely data on the symptom length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level II (imaging, biochemistry, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiography) will be&#xD;
      performed according to the capability of each cohort and will be based on the clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, according to the participant's healthcare status. Imaging and biochemistry tests&#xD;
      will be reassessed only if outside the normal ranges at the previous follow-up visit or if&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 biological samples (including blood, naso-pharingeal swabs, urine, and stool) will&#xD;
      be collected and stored in the biobank of each participating center (according to local ethic&#xD;
      commission recommendations). Test to be performed in a centralised laboratory (genomic,&#xD;
      transcriptomic, cytokine, viral analyses, PBMCs and genetic and epigenetic) will be sent,&#xD;
      following international regulation, to the University of Antwerp, INSERM, University of&#xD;
      Bologna or HMGU. Stool sample for microbiological analysis will be sent to the University of&#xD;
      Bologna. Whole blood samples for epigenetic and genetic analysis will be sent out to UNIBO,&#xD;
      INSERM and Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen (HMGU). In-depth human genetic analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using WGS or whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by functional analyses of the&#xD;
      most promising variants. Genome-wide methylation analyses of COVID-19-positive patients in&#xD;
      addition to a small number of control patients will enable differentiation of inherited and&#xD;
      acquired genomic regulatory features through COVID-19 infection, which result in severe&#xD;
      disease or an efficient clearing of infection through immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of inclusions will depend on the progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is&#xD;
      unknown at this time. Therefore, the number of patients who will be included cannot be&#xD;
      determined in advance. However, depending on the timing of the project and the included&#xD;
      cohorts, the expected enrollment is around 10000 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive descriptive analyses taking into account sociodemographic factors and&#xD;
      clinical courses will be carried out. The frequency distributions of the characteristics will&#xD;
      be given in absolute and relative numbers, median plus interquartile range (IQR) or mean&#xD;
      values plus 95% confidence interval (CIs). Associations with specific treatment strategies,&#xD;
      disease severity patterns and laboratory results will be analysed using chi-square tests,&#xD;
      t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests, depending on the data. To evaluate potential risk factors,&#xD;
      multivariate regression models will be carried out. Outcome time analyses using Cox&#xD;
      proportional-hazards regression models with time-dependent covariates will be performed to&#xD;
      examine factors associated with each endpoint (including death). In addition, cumulative&#xD;
      incidence functions, such as the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard regression model, will be&#xD;
      used to account for competing events (i.e., relocation, discharge against medical advice,&#xD;
      etc.). For missing values, a different strategy to understand the causes and the significance&#xD;
      for the analysis will be developed and a graduated procedure for dealing with censorship and&#xD;
      imputations via linked regressions will be developed. The significance level is defined with&#xD;
      a p-value &lt;0.05. All statistical analyses will be carried out with STATA, Python and/or R&#xD;
      statistics software by trained staff (epidemiologists, statisticians) using the latest&#xD;
      analysis methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be collected through a specific eCRF created for the study, which will not&#xD;
      contain personal data suitable for identifying the patient. The clinical and outcome&#xD;
      information collected in relation to the study will be limited to the objectives of the&#xD;
      study, taking care to reduce as much as possible the burden for the patient and for the&#xD;
      enrolling clinical center. Only the enrolling clinical center will have access to the&#xD;
      patient's identity and will be able to contact him if the coordinating center needs to have&#xD;
      further information or for follow-up checks during or after the closure of the study being&#xD;
      analyzed and reporting. For each patient, a special unique digital identification code&#xD;
      (barcode) will be provided. The code will consist of a three-character part to identify the&#xD;
      recruiting center and a second part consisting of 5 digits to identify the enlisted person.&#xD;
      The code will be associated with the patient by the clinical center, which will keep a copy&#xD;
      of it in the patient file and in the medical record. Each patient enrolled will have a&#xD;
      specific study file with all ethical and clinical documentation. The manual for compiling the&#xD;
      eCRF will be provided in the Trial Master File.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered directly into the patients' eCRF and the related clinical and&#xD;
      outcome information will be digitized in a specific database that will be developed using the&#xD;
      RedCap® data capturing platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed, or eCRF unless&#xD;
      transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The Investigator&#xD;
      is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or&#xD;
      electronically signing the eCRF or paper CRF. The Investigator must maintain accurate&#xD;
      documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the eCRF or paper CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory&#xD;
      agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. The Promotor is&#xD;
      responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of the data. All&#xD;
      source documents must be accurate, clear, unambiguous, permanent, and capable of being&#xD;
      audited. They should be made using some permanent form of recording (typing, printing,&#xD;
      optical disc). They should not be obscured by correction fluid or have temporary attachments&#xD;
      (such as removable self-stick notes). Source documents are original records in which raw data&#xD;
      are first recorded. These may include hospital/clinic/general practitioner records, charts,&#xD;
      diaries, x-rays, laboratory results, pharmacy records, care records, ECG or other printouts,&#xD;
      questionnaires, or video, for example. Source documents should be kept in a secure, limited&#xD;
      access area.&#xD;
