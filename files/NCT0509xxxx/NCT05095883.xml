  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with functional decline , altered spatiotemporal gait parameters (e.g.&#xD;
      lower gait speed, shorter strides, and increased step width), and a significantly higher&#xD;
      metabolic cost of walking compared to people with normal body weight. Obesity also negatively&#xD;
      affects balance control.This study will investigate foot progression angle in adolescents&#xD;
      related to their weight and category classification based on the CDC (Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention) growth charts.&#xD;
