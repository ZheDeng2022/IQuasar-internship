      After the explanation about the study is made, informed consent form will be obtained from&#xD;

      floor pandemic obstetrics service) due to covid 19 and who agreed to participate in the&#xD;
      study. In our study, the clinical status of pregnant patients with SarsCoV2 positive test&#xD;
      results, who were followed up and treated in the pandemic service in Başakşehir Çam and&#xD;
      Sakura City Hospital, will be obtained by asking the patient about the symptoms and&#xD;
      vaccination status in the patient follow-up form prepared in advance. Laboratory findings and&#xD;
      imaging results ( CT/posteroanterior X-ray) will be obtained from the recorded data.&#xD;
