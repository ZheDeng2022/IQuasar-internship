      Multicenter Phase II Study of Axitinib +/- Pembrolizumab in First Line Treatment for Patients&#xD;
      With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (PRCC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common subtype of renal carcinoma&#xD;
      accounting for approximatively 10-15% of all renal cancers. Different types of PRCC have been&#xD;
      described on the basis of two histologic subtypes, type 1 in 25 to 30% cases, and type 2,&#xD;
      with a worse prognosis reported for type 2 metastatic disease. There is currently no standard&#xD;
      of care specifically dedicated to metastatic PRCC patients (mPRCC) and treatments developed&#xD;
      for metastatic clear cell carcinomas are commonly used ; therefore, mPRCC enrollment in&#xD;
      clinical trials is encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials investigated treatments such as sunitinib, or everolimus approved for&#xD;
      advanced clear cell carcinoma, or the dual kinase inhibitor directed both towards VEGF&#xD;
      receptors (VEGFr) and the MET pathway foretinib, or more recently, the selective MET&#xD;
      inhibitor savolitinib. Response rates (RR) were disappointing since generally below 15%,&#xD;
      except in a subset of patients with MET germline alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib which is indicated as second-line treatment in advanced clear cell carcinoma was&#xD;
      investigated in a recent specific trial : the Axipap trial. This multicentric phase II trial&#xD;
      was conducted after central pathology review to confirm the histologic subtype and a central&#xD;
      review was performed to assess the primary endpoint : the 24 week progression free rate&#xD;
      (24wPFR). With a median follow up time of 30 months this 24wPFR was found to be over 45%. The&#xD;
      best response rate was 28.6% according to the investigators with a median duration of&#xD;
      response near 8 months. The investigator assessed response rate was 35.7% in the type 2&#xD;
      subgroup indicating a more important effect of anti-VEGFr in this subtype than in the type 1.&#xD;
      The median PFS was around 6 months and was virtually identical in both subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, some preliminary results of the use of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in metastatic&#xD;
      non clear cell carcinoma were made available. The PD1 directed antibody Pembrolizumab showed&#xD;
      a 28% response rate in 118 patients with papillary tumors including a 6% complete remission&#xD;
      rate ; the median duration of response was of 15.3 [2.8-21.0+] months. Atezolizumb&#xD;
      (anti-PDL1) combined with Bevacizumab and Durvalumab (anti-PDL1) combined with savolitinib&#xD;
      (Met directed TKI) obtained response rates in the same range. These preliminary results&#xD;
      demonstrated the potential interest of combining axitinib with an immune check point&#xD;
      inhibitor. The results of pembrolizumab as monotherapy were obtained in the largest subset&#xD;
      with mPRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these results obtained, the combination of axitinib and pembrolizumab seems&#xD;
      promising in type 2 papillary tumors.&#xD;
