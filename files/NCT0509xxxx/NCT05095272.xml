      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is caused by a parasite (a type of germ called P. vivax) that is carried by&#xD;
      mosquitoes. People get the disease when they are bitten by infected mosquitoes. To make drugs&#xD;
      and vaccines for malaria, researchers need malaria-infected blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to infect people with early-stage malaria, then collect infected&#xD;
      blood samples to store in a cell bank for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18-50 who will not be living alone during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, heart health test, and medical history.&#xD;
      They will have blood and urine tests. They will take a mental health survey. They must pass&#xD;
      an exam to prove they understand the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have red blood cells infected with P. vivax injected into an arm vein. They&#xD;
      will be observed for side effects. They will get a thermometer to measure their temperature&#xD;
      at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the next 3 days, they will be monitored via phone call or text. Starting on day 4 after&#xD;
      the infection, they will have daily study visits to give blood samples. They will likely&#xD;
      develop symptoms of malaria, such as fever, chills, headache, and muscle pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital for 2-3 days when either they develop symptoms&#xD;
      or the daily blood tests detect a certain amount of parasites. Once malaria is confirmed, a&#xD;
      sample of their blood will be collected for the cell bank. Then they will be treated for&#xD;
      malaria with oral medication that will cure the infection. Those who do not develop malaria&#xD;
      will begin treatment after 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits 28 and 90 days after infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 3-5 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study using induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) to produce&#xD;
      a human malaria parasite (HMP) bank for use in future studies. This study will be conducted&#xD;
      in up to two participants. Participants will be inoculated intravenously (IV) with human&#xD;
      malaria parasite blood stage P. vivax (HMPBS02-Pv) parasite-infected erythrocytes (day 0) and&#xD;
      then monitored closely via outpatient clinic visits, phone visits, and while inpatient at the&#xD;
      NIH Clinical Center (CC) for symptoms and signs of malaria to characterize the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and infectivity in healthy malaria-naive participants inoculated with P. vivax.&#xD;
      Blood sampling will be done periodically to measure parasitemia via quantitative polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the P. vivax 18S rRNA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The threshold for the commencement of collection of blood for production of the HMP bank and&#xD;
      subsequent antimalarial rescue treatment with artemether/lumefantrine will occur when the&#xD;
      Malaria Clinical Score is &gt;6 (within 24 hours of notification), or parasitemia is &gt;20,000&#xD;
      parasites/mL, or at the investigator s discretion. When this threshold is reached, the&#xD;
      participant will be admitted to the NIH CC for further safety assessments before undergoing&#xD;
      the blood collection procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After blood collection, the first dose of artemether/lumefantrine will be administered and&#xD;
      the participant will remain inpatient for 48-72 hours to monitor for safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of rescue therapy, and to ensure adequate clinical and parasitological response to treatment.&#xD;
      In the unlikely and unprecedented event that artemether/lumefantrine fails to clear&#xD;
      parasitemia, participants will be treated with chloroquine. If oral administration of either&#xD;
      artemether/lumefantrine or chloroquine is not possible (e.g., the participant is vomiting),&#xD;
      the participant will receive IV treatment with artesunate. After discharge, participants will&#xD;
      be followed on an outpatient basis for monitoring of safety and parasite clearance. Follow-up&#xD;
      for safety assessments will be performed on day 28 plus or minus 3, day 56 plus or minus 7&#xD;
      (phone call only), and day 90 plus or minus 7 (End of Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be evaluated for the presence of sexual parasite stages (gametocytes)&#xD;
      and other parasite lifecycle stages in the blood during the study using quantitative reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR).&#xD;

             levels of chloroquine and thus should not have been used for at least 8 weeks prior to&#xD;
             administration of the study drug). If needed (i.e., an incidental and limited need),&#xD;
             ibuprofen up to 1.2 g/day or acetaminophen up to 4 g/day is acceptable. The&#xD;

             next convenient time. Limited use of other non-prescription medications or dietary&#xD;
             supplements not believed to affect participant safety or the overall results of the&#xD;
             study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following approval by the sponsor in&#xD;
             consultation with the investigator. Participants are requested to refrain from taking&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             will be discussed with the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation of any volume within 4 weeks prior to study day 0, or participation in&#xD;
             any research study involving blood sampling (more than 450 mL/unit of blood), or blood&#xD;

          -  Participant who, in the judgment of the investigator, is likely to be noncompliant&#xD;
             during the study, or is unable to cooperate because of a language or mental deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other finding that, in the judgment of the investigator, would interfere with, or&#xD;
             serve as a contraindication to, protocol adherence, assessment of safety or&#xD;
             reactogenicity, or a participant s ability to give informed consent&#xD;
