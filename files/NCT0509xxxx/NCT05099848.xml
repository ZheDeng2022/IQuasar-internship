      The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of conversion treatment of&#xD;

      A single-arm exploratory clinical study of conversion treatment of Hepatic Arterial Infusion&#xD;
      Chemotherapy combined with Camrelizumab and Apatinib. After screening, subjects who meet the&#xD;
      requirements for entry and exclusion signed the informed consent, received carrelizumab&#xD;
      combined with apatinib and HAIC for conversion therapy, and After received 2-8 cycles (1&#xD;
      treatment cycle every 21 days) of HAIC combined camrelizumab and apatinib treatment, assess&#xD;
      whether the subjects can undergo surgery every 2 cycles during the period: patients who are&#xD;
      assessed as being able to undergo radical surgical resection receive elective radical&#xD;
      resection surgery, and PD1 antibody should be stopped before surgery For 1 month, TKI drugs&#xD;
      will be discontinued for 2-6 weeks; subjects who are assessed as not undergoing radical&#xD;
      surgical resection will end this treatment plan. After leaving the group, they can receive&#xD;
      any treatment according to the doctor's instructions and continue to follow up until the&#xD;
      disease progresses and cannot be tolerated Toxic side effects, withdrawal of informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;

On the 3rd to 4th day of treatment, HAIC was conducted through a catheter intubated into the tumor feeding artery under DSA guidance with the following chemotherapeutic drugs (mFOLFOX, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 in 0-2 hours, folinic acid 400 mg/m2 in 2-3 hours, 5-FU 2500 mg/m2 46 hours) pumped into the tumor artery. The HAIC is repeated every 3 weeks. The cumulative maximum sessions of HAIC is up to 8 times.&#xD;
The cumulative maximum drug use period is up to 8 cycles. Patient will be administratied radical resection if possible during treatment. The patient is concurrent on medication until the treatment discontinuation criteria specified in the protocol appear.</description>
