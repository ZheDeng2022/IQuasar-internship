  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The availability of symptom monitoring and self-management (SMSM) interventions is especially&#xD;
      important for civilians and military populations with spinal cord injuries (SCI). High rates&#xD;
      of depressive disorders (20-40%) and anxiety disorders (20-25%) have been found in both&#xD;
      civilian and military populations and are significant contributors to both quality of life&#xD;
      and well-being after SCI. Previous self-management interventions targeting physical activity&#xD;
      and self-reliance in individuals with SCI have demonstrated significant health and lifestyle&#xD;
      benefits. However, it has been shown that the injured individual's psychological outlook and&#xD;
      mood can either enable or hinder self-management efforts and that currently available&#xD;
      SCI-specific self-management programs may be inadequate. Developing interventions to reduce&#xD;
      mental health symptoms following SCI is therefore critical to improve the lives of&#xD;
      individuals, alleviate resource strain on military and civilian health care systems, and&#xD;
      potentially reduce the rate of mortality by suicide in Veterans and civilians living with&#xD;
      SCI. The current study will build on prior work developing an intervention platform to assess&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this eHealth SMSM system and will test the feasibility and effectiveness&#xD;
      of the intervention platform.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention platform is an interactive, web-based self-management program comprised of computer-adaptive tests (CATs) to assess depression, anxiety, and resilience and multimedia-assisted components. Participants will access the system once a week for 6 weeks, complete the symptom monitoring CATs, receive score reports, and watch a system-assigned self-management strategy video (which is selected by the system based on the participant's current level of depression/anxiety symptoms).</description>

    <description>The active control condition is a static web-based program which also includes computer-adaptive tests (CATs) to assess depression, anxiety, and resilience, but does not provide score reports and plays a predetermined educational video (related to health promotion after SCI) each week. Participants will access the system once a week for 6 weeks, complete the symptom monitoring CATs and watch the educational video.</description>

    <description>The intervention platform is interactive, and uses multimedia-assisted components. The system uses three SCI-QOL computer-adaptive tests (CATs) to assess depression, anxiety, and resilience; cut scores are used to tailor multi-media content that specifically addresses users' emotional health concerns.</description>
