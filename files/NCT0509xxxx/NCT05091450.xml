    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, with equal randomization, parallel randomized controlled trial. It&#xD;
      compares the efficacy of a couple-based Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit (I-BMS) group&#xD;
      intervention to a waitlist control group in improving dyadic couple flourishing and&#xD;
      fertility-related quality of life among couples who are diagnosed of infertility in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. It also aims to investigate the dyadic associations between infertile husbands' and&#xD;
      wives' baseline primary outcomes and changes in primary outcomes following the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a global public health issue, affecting approximately 15% of childbearing-aged&#xD;
      couples around the world. It is often a challenging dyadic life experience that generates&#xD;
      adverse impacts on the psychosocial well-being of couples at childbearing age. Numerous&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions have been developed for infertile women, and their efficacy and&#xD;
      effectiveness were supported empirically. This study attempts to address the limitations&#xD;
      incurred in existing psychosocial interventions for infertility by: (1) including infertile&#xD;
      men and couples who have not sought fertility treatment and (2) incorporating relational&#xD;
      outcomes within psychosocial interventions for infertile couples. This is a two-arm, with&#xD;
      equal randomization, parallel randomized controlled trial. It compares the efficacy of a&#xD;
      couple-based Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit (I-BMS) group intervention to a waitlist control&#xD;
      group in improving dyadic couple flourishing and fertility-related quality of life among&#xD;
      couples who are diagnosed of infertility in Hong Kong. It also aims to investigate the dyadic&#xD;
      associations between infertile husbands' and wives' baseline primary outcomes and changes in&#xD;
      primary outcomes following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On hundred and seventy-eight infertile couples will be recruited through hospitals, clinics&#xD;
      and local communities in Hong Kong. Each prospective couple will complete an online screening&#xD;
      survey. Eligible couples will complete the baseline assessment, and then be randomized in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1 into one of the two arms. Arm 1 is the couple-based I-BMS intervention for&#xD;
      infertility, which consists of four 3-hour sessions within one month. Arm 2 is the waitlist&#xD;
      control. Randomization will be performed by a computer. All eligible couples will be&#xD;
      contacted by a research assistant for a pre-group interview prior to the commencement of the&#xD;
      I-BMS intervention. The primary outcomes are changes over the measurement points in dyadic&#xD;
      couple flourishing and fertility quality of life. The secondary outcomes include changes over&#xD;
      the measurement points in empathy towards partner, partnership, relationship satisfaction,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, infertility-related blame, and resilience. Assessments are administered&#xD;
      at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. Structural equation modelling will be&#xD;
      employed to examine the efficacy of the couple-based I-BMS intervention based on the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle, as well as the dyadic association between infertile husbands'&#xD;
      and wives' primary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight hypotheses are generated. First, it is hypothesized that, after controlling for&#xD;
      baseline dyadic couple flourishing, couples in the I-BMS intervention group will report&#xD;
      significantly higher dyadic couple flourishing than their counterparts in the waitlist&#xD;
      control group following the intervention. Second, it is hypothesized that, after controlling&#xD;
      for post-intervention dyadic couple flourishing, couples in the I-BMS intervention group will&#xD;
      report significantly higher dyadic couple flourishing than their counterparts in the waitlist&#xD;
      control group at one-month follow-up. Third, it is hypothesized that, after controlling for&#xD;
      baseline dyadic fertility quality of life, couples in the I-BMS intervention group will&#xD;
      report significantly higher dyadic fertility quality of life than their counterparts in the&#xD;
      waitlist control group following the intervention. Fourth, it is hypothesized that, after&#xD;
      controlling for post-intervention dyadic fertility quality of life, couples in the I-BMS&#xD;
      intervention group will report significantly higher dyadic fertility quality of life than&#xD;
      their counterparts in the waitlist control group at one-month follow-up. Fifth, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that wives' baseline fertility quality of life is predicted by their own and&#xD;
      their husbands' baseline couple flourishing. Sixth, it is hypothesized that husbands'&#xD;
      baseline fertility quality of life is predicted by their own and their wives' baseline couple&#xD;
      flourishing. Seventh, it is hypothesized that wives' post-intervention improvements in&#xD;
      fertility quality of life is predicted by their own and their husbands' post-intervention&#xD;
      improvements in couple flourishing. Eighth, it is hypothesized that husbands'&#xD;
      post-intervention improvements in fertility quality of life is predicted by their own and&#xD;
      their wives' post-intervention improvements in couple flourishing.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Couple-based I-BMS intervention for infertility</intervention_name>
    <description>It is based on the previous I-BMS intervention for women undergoing IVF treatment, and aims to improve fertility quality of life and couple flourishing by (1) increasing awareness of the interconnectedness between physical and psychosocial well-being, (2) practicing body-mind-spirit techniques, (3) facilitating personal growth and partner empathy and compassion, and (3) creating the shared meaning of life, family, children. As a strength-focused and meaning-oriented approach, it utilizes experiential and self-reflective exercises to help participants reconstruct the meaning behind their ordeal and rediscover the strengths that keep them going.</description>
