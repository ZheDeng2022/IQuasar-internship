  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), Sevagram, District Wardha, Maharashtra,&#xD;
      India is located in a rural setup and caters to a very underprivileged patient population&#xD;
      with limited resources to even pay for their treatment. As per the latest Indian Cancer&#xD;
      Registry Report 2020, of the 28 population based cancer registries (PBCR), the age adjusted&#xD;
      incidence rates (AAR) in males and females are 64.9 and 69.9. This makes the AAR in Wardha&#xD;
      District (district where MGIMS is located) as one of the lowest ranked AAR both for male&#xD;
      (national range: 39.5 - 269.4) and females (national range: 49.4 - 219.8) in the country.&#xD;
      However, the %mortality / incidence, is one of the highest for Wardha, both for males (65.9%,&#xD;
      national range: 14.7% - 71.9%) and females (53%, national range: 9% - 63%). This indicates&#xD;
      that the prognosis of patients in this district is one of the worst in India and thus&#xD;
      requires a new approach to their standard therapeutic option. This has to be cost-effective,&#xD;
      without any significant additional morbidity, and should used in conjunction to the standard&#xD;
      treatment of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperthermia, which is raising the tumor temperature to 40 - 43°C is perhaps one of the&#xD;
      oldest forms of treatment for cancer. Hyperthermia, being a potent radiosensitizer, a&#xD;
      chemosensitizer, an immunomodulator with no significantly added side effects, could be an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic modality that could be expected to improve the outcome in these&#xD;
      patients. However, it also needs to be cost-effective and require low capital cost investment&#xD;
      so that other centers, especially in low and low-middle income countries could also introduce&#xD;
      hyperthermia to the therapeutic armamentarium for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a registry trial for patients being treated with hyperthermia along with radiotherapy&#xD;
      and/or chemotherapy as per the standard departmental protocol for various locally advanced&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To carry out a registry trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hyperthermia delivered&#xD;
      by a repurposed short wave diathermy unit working at 27.1 MHz along with radiotherapy and/or&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced tumours of head neck cancers, cancer cervix,&#xD;
      breast, oesophagus and anorectum attending the department of radiotherapy, MGIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would help to create an organized system that uses observational methods to collect&#xD;
      uniform data on safety and efficacy of hyperthermia when used in conjunction with standard&#xD;
      therapeutic modalities of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The study would help to,&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Evaluate the specific outcomes with hyperthermia in terms of the following clinical&#xD;
      endpoints with hyperthermia&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Locoregional tumour control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local disease free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Evaluate the safety of hyperthermia along with standard therapeutic modalities of&#xD;
      radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Late morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Evaluate the feasibility of carrying out hyperthermia by repurposing 27.12 MHz short&#xD;
      wave diathermy unit that could be cost-effective&#xD;
