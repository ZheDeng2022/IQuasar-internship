    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a&#xD;
      dialectical behavior therapy skills training webapp known as &quot;Pocket Skills&quot; in outpatients&#xD;
      seeking treatment for substance use, across those who receive immediate versus delayed access&#xD;
      to the intervention (e.g., a waitlist control condition).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy adult outpatients seeking treatment for substance use from the Centre for Addiction&#xD;
      and Mental Health Addictions Program will be randomized to receive immediate or delayed&#xD;
      (eight weeks) access to a web-based DBT skills training intervention called Pocket Skills in&#xD;
      addition to standard care. Participants will complete interviews and questionnaires at week&#xD;
      0, at week 8, and at 2 month follow-up. Measures will assess alcohol and drug consumption,&#xD;
      substance use disorder symptoms, and other clinical features.&#xD;
