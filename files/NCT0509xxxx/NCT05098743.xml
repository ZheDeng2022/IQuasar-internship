  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication adherence is a critical aspect of achieving optimal health outcomes. Thirty to 50%&#xD;
      of patients adhere to long-term medication treatment of chronic diseases. Non adherence has&#xD;
      been shown to result in worsening disease, increased healthcare expenditures, complications&#xD;
      and even death. Medically underserved communities have higher rates of medication&#xD;
      nonadherence and a higher prevalence of chronic conditions and often receive care at&#xD;
      Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) which are reporting caring for increasingly&#xD;
      complex chronic conditions. Smartphone mobile phone ownership has increased to 76% in low&#xD;
      income Americans, but this population has been underrepresented in mobile health intervention&#xD;
      studies. This two-group, cluster randomized by site, randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a medication adherence smartphone mobile application (app) which&#xD;
      provides reminders on patient medication adherence, on medication self-efficacy, medication&#xD;
      knowledge and medication social support. Independently, each of these concepts have been&#xD;
      shown to support medication adherence. However in the context of delivery by a medication&#xD;
      adherence app in a variety of chronic illnesses in a medically underserved population, little&#xD;
      is known. It will also explore if those who accessed educational materials within the app&#xD;
      report greater medication knowledge than those who do not and if participants who choose to&#xD;
      use the additional Medfriend feature report greater medication social support than those who&#xD;
      do not. The study will also explore patients' perceptions on the usefulness and satisfaction&#xD;
      with the app features.&#xD;

    <description>The ARMS is a global (continuous) 12-item scale, responses range from 1 (none) to 4 (all of the time) with a possible score of 12-48, patients with low ARMS scores indicate better adherence, it is valid and reliable in a low-literacy chronic disease population.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medication self-efficacy as measured by the Self-efficacy for Appropriate Medication Use Scale (SEAMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The SEAMS is a global (continuous) 13-item scale, responses range from 1 (not confident) to 3 (very confident), with a possible score of 13-39. Patients with higher scores indicate higher levels of self-efficacy for medication adherence. It is valid and reliable in low-literacy chronic disease populations. Patients are asked their level of confidence about taking medications correctly.</description>
