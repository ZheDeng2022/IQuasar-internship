      A prospective, single-blinded, controlled, and randomized trial to find if physician's use of&#xD;
      the Portuguese Advance Directives, in palliative care, as a communication tool between&#xD;
      patients and caregivers, improves the agreement and reliability between patients and their&#xD;
      health surrogates, in their decisions about end-of-life care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a prospective, single-blinded, controlled, and randomized study analyzing if&#xD;
      Advance Directives' discussion between patients and caregivers, promoted by a palliative care&#xD;
      physician, improves concordance between them, concerning to patients' last wishes, therefore&#xD;
      improving surrogates' accuracy when they decide and act on behalf of the patients. This trial&#xD;
      was conducted in a central hospital of Portugal's north inland, serving an estimated&#xD;
      population of 465.000 habitants. Patients referenced to all three units of the palliative&#xD;
      care service from September 2018 to September 2019, and their caregivers were sequentially&#xD;
      approached and recruited on their first consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants gave written consent to enroll in the trial. This study occurred in two&#xD;
      phases, within a 1-month interval. At baseline (phase 1) participants separately fulfilled&#xD;
      the Advance Directives' document considering patients' preferences for end-of-life care.&#xD;
      Caregivers also fulfill a similar document with their own end-of-life preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyads were then randomly assigned to two different groups - The Intervention and the Control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple individual randomization was previously informatically achieved and the randomization&#xD;
      sequence was disclosed by a sealed envelope only after trial enrollment of the dyad, to&#xD;
      ensure proper investigator concealment. Both patients and caregivers were blinded to the&#xD;
      assigned group until the end of the trial. In both groups (Intervention and Control), dyads&#xD;
      were engaged in a conference meeting, in the same room, with the same average duration, with&#xD;
      the same investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Intervention group, the palliative care physician promoted an open discussion between&#xD;
      patients and caregivers, about patients' answers to the Advance Directives document. In the&#xD;
      Control group, the palliative care physician undergone a conference with both patients and&#xD;
      caregivers to evaluate patients' clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At phase 2, one month after the first interview, caregivers were asked to fill another&#xD;
      Advance Directives document, as patients´ surrogates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant had the choice to drop out at any moment of the trial, and the pair was&#xD;
      excluded from data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portuguese official Advance Directives was the central instrument used in this trial.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to choose 1 to 3 different scenarios, to apply the following 12&#xD;
      questions regarding end-of-life preferences. Each question in each scenario was&#xD;
      informatically registered as a Yes or No item, respectively corresponding to items selected&#xD;
      or not by all participants. For each participant, the investigators expected 36 possible&#xD;
      answers for concordance analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables were described by absolute and relative frequencies. Age was described&#xD;
      by the mean and standard deviation (mean ± SD), as its distribution was not deviated from&#xD;
      normality in each group, according to visual analysis of histograms and confirmed with the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk's test of normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agreement between patients and their caregivers was assessed (in each question) with the&#xD;
      Overall Proportions of Agreement (Overall PA) and Proportions of Specific Agreement (for Yes&#xD;
      and No), with respective 95% confidence intervals. Reliability was accessed with Cohen's&#xD;
      kappa (k).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data analysis was performed using SPSS® Statistics. Proportions of agreement and&#xD;
      Cohen's κ with respective confidence intervals were computed using packages &quot;obs. agree&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;psych&quot; from R software, v 3.4.0.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After enrollment and some sociodemographic data were collected, participants were asked to, separately, fulfill the Advance Directives document, concerning patients' last wishes. Caregivers also fulfill one document with their own end-of-life preferences.&#xD;
The pair was then randomly assigned to one of the two parallel groups (Intervention or Control Group).&#xD;
Both groups had a conference meeting with the same palliative care physician, in the same room, with the same average duration (40 to 50 minutes). The intervention Group discussed patients' answers to the Advance Directive document, and the Control Group talked about patients' clinical status.&#xD;
Two months later, caregivers only, were asked to fulfill another Advance Directive document as patients' surrogates.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Reliability was accessed with Cohen's kappa (k). (Cohen, 1960). We assumed Landis and Koch's (1977) interpretation of κ value. According to these authors, a κ value of 0.20 represents slight reliability, a value between 0.21 and 0.40 fair reliability, a value between 0.41 and 0.60 moderate reliability, a value between 0.61 and 0.80 substantial reliability, and a value of 0.81-1.00 indicates almost perfect reliability</description>
