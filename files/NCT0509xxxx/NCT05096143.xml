      A non-interventional retrospective cohort study conducted to compare the naive&#xD;
      sacubitril/valsartan Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) patient population&#xD;
      to a matched naive ACEi/ARB HFrEF patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a non-interventional retrospective cohort study using the US secondary EHR dataset,&#xD;
      Optum EHR, to compare the naive sacubitril/valsartan HFrEF patient population (aged ≥ 18&#xD;
      years) to a matched naive ACEi/ARB HFrEF patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprised of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification period: 01-Jul-2015 to 31-Mar-2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  01-Jul-2014 to 31-Mar-2020 for primary objective and secondary objective 2 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  01-Jul-2008 to 30-Sep-2020 for secondary objective 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period: Patients were followed up until 31-Mar-2020, death or patient transfer out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline period: 365 days prior to index&#xD;
