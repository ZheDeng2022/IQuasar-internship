    <textblock>
      The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a standard method for measuring exercise capacity in&#xD;
      patients with cardiopulmonary disease such as pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and measures how&#xD;
      far a patient can walk in 6 minutes. The test is usually performed in the hospital, by&#xD;
      walking along a hospital corridor. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, there has been a need to&#xD;
      minimise patient contact with hospitals and their staff to reduce transmission of the virus.&#xD;
      In a previous research project called 6APP, the investigators designed, developed and&#xD;
      evaluated a mobile phone app, to allow them to perform the 6MWT in the community. Given the&#xD;
      current circumstances, cardiovascular outpatients including patients in the PAH clinic at&#xD;
      Oxford University Hospitals are being recommended to use an app derived from that project to&#xD;
      provide their 6MWT distance to the clinical team for assessment, in addition to their&#xD;
      symptoms and general well-being. This is felt to be more appealing to the patients, and would&#xD;
      reduce the time spent in hospital on the day of their outpatient appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to measure the usefulness of adopting remote, mobile-based 6MWT among&#xD;
      hospital outpatients, within the constraints imposed by the SARS-COV2 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, health care systems have been subject to increased&#xD;
      pressures. This is mainly due to infected patients being admitted to the medical wards and&#xD;
      intensive care units, but also due to the requirement to reduce exposure of both healthcare&#xD;
      professionals and patients to COVID by minimising contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are indications that reduced access to healthcare services during the pandemic is&#xD;
      responsible for more than half of excess deaths in the United States . In response to this,&#xD;
      the CDC is advocating the use of telemedicine to keep providing a remote version of&#xD;
      healthcare services . A study of telemedicine services in China used during COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      showed that they reduced burden on hospitals, prevented overcrowding, reduced the risk of&#xD;
      cross-infection, and relieved patients' anxiety . The use of telemedicine is also being&#xD;
      developed in Europe, where many patients are being denied the use of clinical services, like&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation , because of centres being closed. In the context of the NHS, an&#xD;
      increased use of telemedicine services is being observed . The NHS long-term plans do, in&#xD;
      fact, include tele-consultations as a pillar for its sustainability . Healthwatch have&#xD;
      produced useful advice for outpatient clinicians to consider avoiding asking patients to&#xD;
      attend physical outpatient appointments where a clinically-appropriate and accessible&#xD;
      alternative exists. Where an appointment is clinically necessary, the national benchmark is&#xD;
      that at least 25% could be conducted by telephone or video including 60% of all follow-up&#xD;
      appointments. Initial promising results are being seen in the context of diabetes, where&#xD;
      virtual clinics are recommended as mitigation to the pandemic .&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. The 6MWT To assess patient's exercise capacity, the six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a&#xD;
      standard method used in patients with cardiopulmonary disease such as Heart Failure (HF) or&#xD;
      Pulmonary arterial Hypertension (PAH). The 6MWT measures how far a patient can walk in 6&#xD;
      minutes. Walking is an activity performed every day, by most patients except for those most&#xD;
      severely limited. By assessing patients' ability to exercise, the 6MWT provides a global&#xD;
      assessment of respiratory, cardiovascular, neuromuscular and cognitive function. The 6MWT&#xD;
      does not differentiate what limits the patient, nor does it assess maximal exercise capacity.&#xD;
      Instead, the 6MWT allows the patient to exercise at a daily functional level, and is a useful&#xD;
      tool for assessing changes after a therapeutic intervention, and correlates with a subjective&#xD;
      improvement in dyspnoea .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PAH the 6MWT is used to evaluate patients' response to treatment, with an increase in 6MWT&#xD;
      distance of greater than 42 m being considered a clinically significant improvement .&#xD;
      Furthermore, change in 6MWT distance correlates with VO2 max, NYHA class and mortality in&#xD;
      those patients, providing an objective assessment of disease progression, prognosis and&#xD;
      response to treatment. It is a universally accepted test as it is safe and easily performed&#xD;
      by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. Cardiovascular outpatient management during the pandemic Since the outbreak of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the standard regime of care for outpatients with cardiovascular disease has been&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For example, in PAH patients, the normal regime of a 6MWT, echocardiogram and face to face&#xD;
      consultation was abandoned as those patients were felt to be extremely clinically vulnerable,&#xD;
      and therefore were recommended to shield at home. Therefore patients needed to be assessed&#xD;
      without having any face to face contact, unless in an emergency. This situation continued for&#xD;
      five months until August, when shielding was initially withdrawn, however we are now back in&#xD;
      this situation with a highly transmissible variant SARS-CoV-2. Therefore the need to reduce&#xD;
      time spent in hospital continues as the virus continues within the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cardiovascular outpatient clinics in Oxford, patients are now being regularly contacted by&#xD;
      phone to replace face to face visits. During these phone calls, questions about the general&#xD;
      status of the patient are asked, i.e. how far they think they can walk and whether they have&#xD;
      noticed a change in their exercise capacity or functional capacity, but currently no&#xD;
      objective data, like the results of the 6MWT, are available for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4. Telemedicine services for pulmonary hypertension In a previous research project called&#xD;
      6APP, we designed, developed and evaluated a mobile-health &quot;app&quot; (a type of telemedicine&#xD;
      where patients use their mobile phones), to allow them to perform the 6MWT in the community.&#xD;
      We hypothesized that a test conducted by patients, in their environment, would reflect more&#xD;
      the patient's functional status, would free up healthcare resources and would be less&#xD;
      stressful and costly for the patients themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app allowed patients to perform the test both indoors, by walking back and forth along a&#xD;
      corridor of fixed length, and outdoors, using the localization system (like the GPS). In our&#xD;
      study with 30 PAH patients, we proved that the app is accurate when used outdoors, the&#xD;
      measurements are reliable and repeatable and the method is well-accepted by patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these encouraging results, the app has been simplified and made available for free for&#xD;
      both Android and iPhones under the name of &quot;Timed Walk&quot;. The original app was developed by&#xD;
      Dario Salvi at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering of the Oxford University. The current&#xD;
      app, which uses the same validated outdoors test approach, is instead maintained by the&#xD;
      University of Malmo, Sweden, where Dr. Salvi is currently employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current circumstances, the PH clinic in Oxford and other cardiovascular outpatient&#xD;
      clinics are recommending patients to use the Timed Walk app, the results of which are being&#xD;
      used by the clinical team to assess patients in addition to their symptoms and general&#xD;
      well-being. This is felt to be more appealing to the patients, and would reduce the time&#xD;
      spent in hospital on the day of their outpatient appointment. The app only allows outdoor&#xD;
      tests (as these proved to be more reliable and practical) and to share 6MWT data via email if&#xD;
      patients want to.&#xD;
