      Study Title: A Phase I Open Label, Placebo-controlled Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate&#xD;
      Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Natrunix via Subcutaneous Injection in Healthy Subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sponsor: XBiotech USA, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Chair: Neha Reshamwala, MD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Planned Subjects: Eight healthy subjects per cohort (including six for Natrunix and&#xD;
      two for placebo). Three cohorts for a total of 24 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate Duration: Approximately 38 days for each subject which includes a screening&#xD;
      period of up to 10 days followed by one subcutaneous dose of Natrunix, and then evaluation&#xD;
      over 28 days. Blood will be sampled at various time points for blood chemistry, hematological&#xD;
      analysis and Natrunix serum/plasma concentrations.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject will receive a single subcutaneous injection of Natrunix at one of the three doses (200 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg) or placebo. For each dose cohort, six subjects will be administered Natrunix and two subjects will be administered placebo. The study will not proceed to the next dose level unless the tested dose level has been deemed to have acceptable tolerability and safety. Subjects will undergo blood sampling for toxicity and pK analysis. Subjects will also be evaluated for the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).</intervention_model_description>
