  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency application is a treatment method that temporarily prevents the transmission&#xD;
      of pain in the nerve where the application is made through the heat emitted by radio&#xD;
      waves.Partial inhibition of the functions of the nerves carrying the joint pain sensation&#xD;
      with this method is the basis of the treatment.The intermedius genicular nerve carries the&#xD;
      sensation of subpatellar pain due to chondromalacia.In this study,investigators aim is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of radiofrequency neurotomy applied to the intermedius genicular&#xD;
      nerve, which receives the sensation of the patella, on pain and knee function in patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of chondromalacia patella who have anterior knee pain that does not resolve&#xD;
      despite conservative treatment, under the guidance of ultrasonography.&#xD;

      The study was designed as prospective, randomized, controlled trial. 46 people who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups of 23 people. The first group will be&#xD;
      designated as Nerve blockage group and nerve blocking program will be applied to these&#xD;
      patients. Patients in the second group will be designated as the Radiofrequency group and&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation after the blockade program will be applied in accordance with the&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation protocol.Participants were evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      (VAS), Patello Femoral Pain Severity Scale (PFPSS), Kuala's Patellofemoral Scoring System&#xD;
      (KPSS).&#xD;

    <description>the radiofrequency needle will be advanced percutaneously towards the intermedius genicular nerve on the periosteum of the distal femoral shaft region until bone contact is achieved. In addition to imaging the nerve with ultrasound, sensory stimulation at 50 Hz frequency will be applied with a threshold value less than 0.6 V in order to determine its position more accurately. In order to prevent the inactivation of the motor nerves, the relevant nerve will be tested for the absence of fasciculation in the region of the lower extremity compatible with the application with the stimulation with a frequency of 2.0 V and 2 Hz. Before the activation of the radiofrequency generator, an injection of 1 ml of 2% lidocaine will be made, then the radiofrequency electrode will be added to the needle and the temperature level at the tip of the electrode will be increased to 80 degrees for 2 minutes, the procedure will be performed for each genicular nerve.</description>
