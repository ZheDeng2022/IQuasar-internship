  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional endoscopic release directly accesses the carpal tunnel and thus carries a higher&#xD;
      risk of nerve irritability, even nerve injury. Based on our anatomical study, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a new endoscopic technique through a single-portal palm approach that&#xD;
      passes superficially to palmar aponeurosis, and cut the full transverse carpal ligament. The&#xD;
      investigators will compared the technique with the standard dual-portal endoscopic technique.&#xD;

      Conduct a multi-center, comparison clinical trial according to clinical Trial Reporting&#xD;
      Standards (CONSORT). Patients in the single-portal group were treated with a single-portal&#xD;
      palm approach that passes superficially to palmar aponeurosis and cut the full transverse&#xD;
      carpal ligament. The comparison group were treated with Chow endoscopic technique. In order&#xD;
      to assess efficiency of single-portal palm approach, the investigators will compared the&#xD;
      technique with the standard dual-portal endoscopic technique. The study was approved by&#xD;
      Shenzhen People's Hospital and informed consent was signed.&#xD;

    <description>The Levine Questionnaire is regarded as a valuable assessment of severity of symptoms and functional status in carpal tunnel syndrome. It is self-administered and is in two sections. The symptoms severity scale is 11 questions and evaluates symptoms regarding severity, frequency, time and kind. The functional status scale is eight questions and evaluates how the syndrome affects daily life.Each question had five ordinal response categories ranging from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (very severe symptoms). Responses to individual items were averaged to yield an overall score for each scale.</description>
