    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and its&#xD;
      association with demographic information, medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals,&#xD;
      exposure history of close contacts, vaccination status, and compliance with the strategies&#xD;
      for self-quarantine to prevent the transmission in the community where SARS-CoV-2 infected&#xD;
      individuals were home-quarantined and treated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the 4th outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic in Ho Chi Minh City since 27 April 2021,&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mild covid-19 patients were self-quarantined and treated at home. This home&#xD;
      care setting could yield risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the index cases to the people&#xD;
      living surroundings. Therefore, this study will be performed to investigate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 in household members or people lived in the same&#xD;
      municipality with home-quarantined covid-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All people over 18 years old, living in 2 blocks (V and Y) of Ngo Gia Tu apartment, which is&#xD;
      located in District 10, Ho Chi Minh City, will be recruited into this study. A survey will be&#xD;
      conducted using a questionnaire to collect the data related to the basic demographic&#xD;
      information, medical history of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, exposure history of close&#xD;
      contacts, vaccination status, and compliance with the strategies for self-quarantine to&#xD;
      prevent the transmission in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of recruitment, Covid-19 rapid antigen detection tests using nasopharyngeal swabs&#xD;
      will be performed for all study subjects. In addition, a total of 5mL of intravenous blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for serum extraction and DNA isolation. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody levels in serum samples will be evaluated by a surrogate virus neutralization test&#xD;
      by using NeutraLISA kit® (Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany). DNA will be isolated and stored for&#xD;
      further use in investigating the association of ACE2 genetic polymorphisms with the&#xD;
      prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.&#xD;

    <description>3ml of blood samples are collected, contained in heparin-free tubes, and centrifuged. Blood serum samples are collected and stored at the -80 Celcius degree. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in human serum and plasma are detected using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) technology on the ARCHITECT I 1000r System. Quality Control procedures will take place once daily, with three levels: one negative control and two positive controls. Sample, SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coated paramagnetic microparticles, and assay diluent are combined and incubated. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies present in the sample bind to the antigen-coated microparticles. The resulting chemiluminescent reaction is measured as a relative light unit (RLU). There is a direct relationship between the titres of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the sample and the RLU detected by the system optics. Interpretation of Results: &lt; 50.0 AU/mL, Negative, ≥ 50.0 AU/mL, Positive</description>
