  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease is a severe pathology in which some toxic waste and an excessive&#xD;
      amount of water can accumulate in the human body with life threatening consequences.&#xD;
      Maintenance hemodialysis is one of the possible treatment for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis filter the blood through a membrane according to a dialysis bath and so can be&#xD;
      able to purify the blood of the toxic waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, since the 1980s, the investigator know that patient in maintenance hemodialysis&#xD;
      can have some deficiency in water soluble vitamins and trace elements. Mechanisms of the&#xD;
      deficiency are multiple (a decreased of food intake, a diminution of the appetite, digestive&#xD;
      malabsorption du to medics and comorbidities and loss in hemodialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of this deficiency have an important impact on vital prognosis for these patients.&#xD;
      These nutrients are essential for AND synthesis, mechanism of inflammation, cells membranes&#xD;
      synthesis, etc. DOPPs study in 2004 have shown a decreased of 16% in the mortality within 4&#xD;
      years with supplemented patients. Also, since this study, international recommendations were&#xD;
      wrote in 2009, then in 2020, in order to supplement in vitamins and trace elements patients&#xD;
      in maintenance conventional hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these recommendations, some supplementary efforts are necessary, especially since&#xD;
      online hemodiafiltration, a new process, is widely available and used in particular in&#xD;
      Europe. This process combines 2 phenomena, diffusion and convection, through high-flux&#xD;
      membranes. This process can remove a large quantity of molecule present in blood and&#xD;
      especially the middle-molecule. In return, a more important quantity of water soluble&#xD;
      vitamins and oligo-elements could be removed by this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the investigator would like to measure this loss of vitamins and trace-elements in&#xD;
      patients with maintenance online post-dilution hemodiafiltration process with dialysate&#xD;
      sample and blood concentrations measured (usual patient monitoring) during the session.&#xD;

    <description>We would like to measure the concentrations of water-soluble vitamins and trace elements in dialysate by collecting 1% of this by Theraflux® device, and compare to the blood concentration collecting during the half-yearly report at the beginning then at the end of one hemodialysis session with online post-dilution hemodiafiltration session.</description>

    <description>We would like to measure water-soluble vitamins (B1, B6, B9, B12, C) and trace elements (zinc, selenium) in blood and dialysate for the patients treated by online post-dilution hemodiafiltration patients. There measures on blood are done systematically during the half-yearly report of our patients in our hemodialysis center. Only results are collect for the study.</description>

      This study collect and analyse dialysate sample through a device called sampler was developed&#xD;
      by the THERADIAL® company. Sampler collect continuously during the dialysis session, one&#xD;
      hundred of the effluent liquid (ie a calibrated sample of dialysate) before it is eliminated&#xD;
      in the sewer. The dialysate samples will be analyzed by the Lyon Sud biochemistry laboratory&#xD;
      immediately after the end of the session&#xD;
