  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific research on the beneficial effects of botanical extracts has led to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the role of its bioactive compounds, but the bioavailability in human&#xD;
      remains largely unknown. Indeed, the most of publications investigated the bioavailability of&#xD;
      metabolites of spices in in vitro cells model or animal experiments but few clinical studies&#xD;
      have been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize and quantify in blood, the main&#xD;
      metabolite compounds of a botanical extract, following its administration by different routes&#xD;
      (oral or sublingual) and with different preparations (extract or powder), in quantity&#xD;
      equivalent to those having demonstrated biological properties.&#xD;
