      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that in patients with CRSwNP who demonstrate sinus&#xD;
      colonization with staphylococcus aureus, the administration of dupilumab will be associated&#xD;
      with decreased staph colonization and an increase in microbial diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective will be to demonstrate that dupilumab reduces staphylococcus aureus (phyla&#xD;
      firmicutes) abundance while increasing microbial diversity in patients with CRSwNPs who are&#xD;
      culture positive for staph aureus at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives will be to correlate reduction in Staph aureus abundance and improved&#xD;
      bacterial diversity with increased expression of anti-microbial proteins (ß-defensins1-4) and&#xD;
      cathelicidin LL-37. In addition, the investigators will correlate improvements in microbial&#xD;
      diversity/decreased staph abundance with clinical improvements as assessed via questionnaires&#xD;
      and objective/subjective smell function and also as improvements in cellular/immune T2&#xD;
      inflammation as assessed by reduced expression of T2 cytokines/chemokines and&#xD;
      eosinophil/eosinophil-derived proteins.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is an important clinical problem and is&#xD;
      associated with profound unmet medical needs given the absence - until recently - of adequate&#xD;
      medical therapies. It has an estimated prevalence of 2-4% in the USA and Europe but also has&#xD;
      disproportionate burden on quality of life and economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRSwNPs is predominantly (in 62-85% of patients) a type 2 (T2) disease, as demonstrated by an&#xD;
      IL-4high, IL-5high, IL-13high cytokine signature and prominent infiltration with eosinophils,&#xD;
      basophils, and newly recruited mast cells. Another characteristic feature of CRSwNPs is the&#xD;
      colonization of the sinonasal space with Staphylococcus aureus (Staph). Staph comprises &lt;10%&#xD;
      of the bacterial biomass of the healthy nose but infections with this pathogen is observed in&#xD;
      the majority of CRSwNP patients and especially in those with asthma comorbidity or AERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence exists for an upregulatory vicious circle involving type 2 inflammation promoting an&#xD;
      immune deficient state with reduced innate immune responsiveness to staph, leading to&#xD;
      colonization/infection with staph and then with the staph producing exotoxins and other&#xD;
      pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that promote and exacerbate the T2high state.&#xD;
      A central endogenous immune defense to protect against colonization and infection with staph&#xD;
      consists of innate immune-derived anti-microbial proteins (AMPs). There are two major&#xD;
      families of AMPs, the defensins and the cathelicidins that together comprise &gt;2000 proteins.&#xD;
      These cationic proteins provide immune defenses against a range of pathogens. Downregulation&#xD;
      of the ß-defensins (BD)-2 and BD-3 and cathelicidin LL-37 is particularly relevant to atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD) and underlies the particular susceptibility of AD skin to colonization and&#xD;
      infection with staph. Thus, in AD staph can comprise up to 90% of the bacterial species&#xD;
      present on the skin. These AMPs are predominantly expressed in epithelial cells including of&#xD;
      the skin but are also expressed by airway epithelial cells (AECs). Sinonasal AECs produce all&#xD;
      the ß-defensins (BD1-4) and BD1-3 expression is reduced in allergic inflammatory diseases of&#xD;
      the airway. In addition to AMPs shared with the dermis, another important AMP, S100A7&#xD;
      (psoriasin) is also uniquely reduced in CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This diminished expression of ß-defensins and cathelicidin in AD has been ascribed to&#xD;
      overproduction of IL-4/IL-13. Inhibition of AMP expression in upper airway allergic disease&#xD;
      has also been ascribed to these cytokines. In addition to inhibiting its production,&#xD;
      IL-4/IL-13 also block the mobilization of BD-3 to the surface of staph. T2 cytokines further&#xD;
      promote staph infection in AD by enhancing binding of these pathogens to atopic skin.&#xD;
      Finally, IL-4/IL-13 may further enhance susceptibility to infection through their adverse&#xD;
      impact on tight junction barrier function, thereby promoting microinvasive disease and access&#xD;
      of PAMPs to submucosal targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final component of the pro-inflammatory vicious circle is the capacity of Staph-derived&#xD;
      enterotoxins to feedback to enhance production of T2-associated cytokines, thereby further&#xD;
      exacerbating eosinophilic inflammation and the reduced innate immune defense against&#xD;
      pathogens. This enhancement of the T2 signature has traditionally been ascribed to the&#xD;
      production of superantigens (and antigens) by staph that engage Th2 effector cells residing&#xD;
      in the sinuses via their T cell receptor and stimulates their further activation and cytokine&#xD;
      secretion. However, staph-derived PAMPs including lipoteichoic acid and staph enterotoxin B&#xD;
      (SEB) can also induce secretion of T2-promoting cytokines such as IL-33 and TSLP by&#xD;
      engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and other pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on&#xD;
      AECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary CRSwNPs frequently comprises a state in which staph-derived PAMPs exacerbate an&#xD;
      already established T2high inflammatory condition, T2-derived cytokines but in particular&#xD;
      IL-4 and IL-13 interact with AECs to reduce AMP production, and reduced expression of AMPs&#xD;
      promotes the colonization and further infection with staph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pathogenic mechanism is now unambiguously established in atopic dermatitis. This was&#xD;
      demonstrated via the ability of blockade of IL-4/IL-13 via administration of anti-IL-4R to&#xD;
      decrease Staphylococcus aureus colonization and increase microbial diversity in atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis - an effect that strongly correlated with clinical benefit. The investigators&#xD;
      propose that a similar molecular mechanism for dupilumab will be observed in CRSwNPs.&#xD;

These parameters will be determined using quantitative PCR. In addition, we will correlate improvements in microbial diversity/decreased staph abundance with clinical improvements as assessed via questionnaires and objective/subjective smell function and also as improvements in cellular/immune T2 inflammation as assessed by reduced expression of T2 cytokines/chemokines and eosinophil/eosinophil-derived proteins. These will be determined using proximity extension assays (for cytokines/chemokines) and enzyme immunoassays for eosinophil products.
