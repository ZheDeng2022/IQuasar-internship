    <textblock>
      This research study involves the study drug lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has two parts. The first part is being done to determine the tolerability of&#xD;
      lurbinectedin with doxorubicin in people with soft tissue sarcoma. The second part is a&#xD;
      randomized study to determine which is more effective at treating leiomyosarcoma,&#xD;
      lurbinectedin with doxorubicin or lurbinectedin alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase 1b/2 study exploring the safety and efficacy of lurbinectedin&#xD;
      with doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The phase 1b trial will follow a standard 3+3 design. Upon determination of the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lurbinectedin plus doxorubicin,&#xD;
      the randomized phase 2 trial in participants with advanced leiomyosarcoma (LMS) will&#xD;
      commence. Participants will be randomized 1:1 for enrollment to one of two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Lurbinectedin with Doxorubicin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Doxorubicin Monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase Ib/II clinical trial. A Phase Ib clinical trial tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug combination and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved lurbinectedin for this specific&#xD;
      disease but it has been approved for the treatment of small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. FDA has approved doxorubicin as a treatment option for soft-tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lurbinectedin is a synthetically derived chemical that binds to DNA. The binding to DNA&#xD;
      likely induces cell death. Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic chemotherapy drug that kills cancer&#xD;
      cells by several mechanisms including binding to DNA.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of lurbinectedin or doxorubicin on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;

             without archival tissue available may be enrolled with approval of the&#xD;
             Sponsor-Investigator. Note: confirmation of availability of archival tissue is the&#xD;
             only requirement for eligibility, archival tissue does not need to be received by the&#xD;
             study team or site prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen as assessed by the treating investigator may be included with&#xD;
             the approval of the Sponsor-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior anthracycline or trabectedin (Yondelis, ET-743),&#xD;
             including prior exposure to doxorubicin or liposomal doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received more than 2 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for&#xD;
             the phase 1b study and no more than 1 prior line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for the&#xD;
             phase 2 study. There is no limit on the number of prior lines of non-cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy (e.g., pazopanib, immunotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior exposure to lurbinectedin (PM01183).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior radiation treatment of &gt; 45 Gy to the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received or undergone prior chemotherapy within 14 days of cycle&#xD;
             1 day 1, therapeutic radiation therapy within 21 days of cycle 1 day 1 or major&#xD;
             surgery within 21 days of cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior palliative radiation therapy within 7 days of&#xD;
             cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior antibody-based therapy (e.g., nivolumab) within 4&#xD;
             weeks or 3 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior oral small molecule or tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
             (TKI) therapy within 2 weeks or 3 half-lives (whichever is shorter) of cycle 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline from adverse events&#xD;
             attributed to any prior anti-cancer therapy, with the exceptions of alopecia,&#xD;
             controlled endocrine toxicity (e.g., hypothyroidism), and cutaneous toxicity which&#xD;
             will be permitted at Grade 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known CNS disease involvement, with the exception of patients with&#xD;
             brain metastases that have been previously treated and have remained stable on MRI ≥&#xD;
             28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 without use of steroids or anti-epileptic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to lurbinectedin or doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong or moderate&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A, CYP2D6, or P-gp are ineligible. Because the lists of&#xD;
             these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the participant must be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the participant&#xD;
             is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, chronic indwelling drains, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lurbinectedin and doxorubicin are&#xD;
             anti-cancer agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with lurbinectedin or doxorubicin, breastfeeding&#xD;
             must be discontinued if the mother is treated with lurbinectedin or doxorubicin. A&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test is required for women of childbearing potential prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised patients, including patients who are known to be seropositive for&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to the increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. HIV testing is not required as part of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
