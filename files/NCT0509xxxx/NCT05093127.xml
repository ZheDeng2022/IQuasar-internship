    <intervention_name>Carotid Artery Stenting</intervention_name>
    <description>R-OneTM system is a tool available to physicians for performing CAS without changing the treatment of the pathology. R-OneTM system is designed to remotely deliver and manipulate guidewires and stent/balloon devices during Carotid Artery Stenting. The system is composed of the R-OneTM robotic platform used in combination with two accessories, the Mobile radioprotection screen and a sterile and single-use R-OneTM consumable kit. The physician, seated at the remote radio-protected control station, manipulates guidewires and/or balloon/stent catheters using joysticks on the Command unit.</description>
