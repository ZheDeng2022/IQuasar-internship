  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 100 overweight/obese (BMI ≥25.0-35.9 kg/m^2) men and women between&#xD;
      18-65 years with prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose of 5.6 mmol/L to &lt;7.0 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim to investigate the effect over time (26-weeks) of daily Appethyl® treatment&#xD;
      compared to placebo on change in fasting glucose (primary endpoint) and several other health&#xD;
      markers (secondary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is whether the null hypothesis (no difference between Appethyl®&#xD;
      and placebo with regard to endpoint data) can be rejected.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in bodyweight</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (week 0) to end of intervention (week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured at baseline (week 0), week 12 and after end of intervention (week 26) in a fasting state. Body weight will be measured wearing only underwear or light clothing as well as no shoes and stockings. Body weight will be measured on a calibrated scale and subjects will be instructed to stand in the middle of the platform of the scale with straight neck and eyes looking straight ahead, whilst distributing their weight evenly on body feet after having emptied their bladder. Two measurements are made when the scale has stabilized and both results are recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg and the average of the two measurements is used for further analysis.</description>

    <description>Venous blood samples will be collected at baseline (week 0), week 12 and after end of intervention (week 26) by a vein puncture in the antecubital vein after an overnight fast from at least 10 pm the night before. HOMA-IR and HOMA-IS will be calculated from fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations.</description>

    <description>Waist- and hip circumference will be measured at baseline (week 0), week 12 and after end of intervention (week 26) in a fasting state. The measurements of waist- and hip circumference will be performed with an empty bladder and performed with a non-elastic tape measuring. Waist circumference is measured mid-way between the lower rib and iliac crest (top of the hip bone) at the end of expiration with the subject in a standing position with their weight distributed evenly on both feet. Hip circumference is measures at the widest point between the hips and buttocks observed from the front at the end of expiration with the subject in a standing position with their weight distributed evenly on both feet. Two measurements of waist- and hip circumference will be made and both results will be recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm and the average of the two measurements is used in further analysis</description>

    <measure>Change in body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (week 0) to end of intervention (week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be assessed by a whole body DXA scan at baseline (week 0), week 12 and after end of intervention (week 26) assessing lean mass (kg), fat mass (kg), abdominal fat (kg), visceral fat (kg) and bone mineral density (g/cm^2). The DXA scan will be performed in a fasting condition with the subjects only wearing light clothing and after emptying the bladder.</description>

Leptin (pg/ml), adiponectin (ng/ml), IL-6 (pg/ml), TNF-alfa (pg/ml) and hsCRP (mg/L) will be assessed.</description>

The blood pressure will be measured on the right arm with an appropriate arm cuff after 5-10 min rest in a resting position. The measurement will be performed three times approximately two minutes apart, and the reading is recorded to the nearest 1 mmHg for blood pressure. A mean value of the three readings will be used in further analysis.</description>
