  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of conducting a home-based reducing exercise&#xD;
      sensitivity with exposure training (RESET) intervention among acute coronary syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      survivors. RESET is an at-home, 4 visit intervention that involves psychoeducation, a brief,&#xD;
      low-to-moderate intensity walking session (i.e., interoceptive exposure), and interoceptive&#xD;
      counseling, and is designed to reduce exercise sensitivity (i.e., fear of exercise&#xD;
      sensations) and improve participation in exercise-based secondary-prevention guidelines&#xD;
      (cardiac rehabilitation and physical activity). The primary purpose of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      test the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of recruiting and administering the&#xD;
      RESET intervention in ACS patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear of exercise may be prominent among acute coronary syndrome (ACS) survivors due to the&#xD;
      presence of physical disease states that can exacerbate uncertainty about bodily sensations.&#xD;
      For instance, patients may perceive physical sensations experienced during exercise (e.g.,&#xD;
      increased heart rate, shortness of breath, fatigue) as dangerous, intolerable, or similar to&#xD;
      sensations experienced or attributed to their ACS, resulting in a fear of exercise sensations&#xD;
      (i.e., exercise sensitivity). As a result, patients may avoid heart healthy activities, such&#xD;
      as cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and physical activity, that prompt these physical sensations&#xD;
      or terminate activities at the first sign of discomfort. Novel programs that target&#xD;
      patient-level fears related to exercise sensations (i.e., exercise sensitivity) during the&#xD;
      first-year post-discharge (the time window patients are eligible for CR) may be needed to&#xD;
      improve CR participation and physical activity levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, no intervention has been developed specifically to reduce&#xD;
      exercise sensitivity in ACS survivors within the first year post-hospital discharge; a&#xD;
      vulnerable population that is extremely sedentary, fails to meet physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines, and with the most to gain from CR and physical activity participation. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigator developed a de novo protocol for a reducing exercise sensitivity with exposure&#xD;
      training (RESET) intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The investigator will assess pre- to post-intervention change in exercise sensitivity using the Exercise Sensitivity Questionnaire (ESQ). The ESQ is an 18-item instrument designed to assess exercise sensitivity, specifically for use in adults with cardiac rehabilitation-qualifying conditions. Items reflect fear and anxiety of various bodily sensations and are rated from 0 to 4 (&quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much), based on agreement with each statement. Scores of all the items are summed to create a total score, where higher scores reflect more sever exercise sensitivity.</description>

The short form IPAQ is a 7-item, open-ended questionnaire eliciting participant's last 7-day recall of physical activity to assess the time spent in different physical activities (vigorous, moderate, walking) and sitting as part of their everyday lives. The outcome is an estimate of total physical activity in MET-min/week and time spent sitting.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group complete 4, at-home reducing exercise sensitivity with exposure training (RESET) intervention visits with research-trained personnel via video visits. They complete psychoeducation with an exercise physiology-trained scientist, and a brief walking activity (i.e., interoceptive exposure), followed by a session reflecting upon their walking experience with research-trained personnel (i.e., interoceptive counseling). Participants also complete weekly physical activity journals throughout the intervention. Each RESET intervention visits can occur once or twice per week over the course of 4 weeks, based on patient preference.</description>

    <intervention_name>Reducing Exercise Sensitivity with Exposure Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants complete 4, home-based intervention visits on a secure video visit platform. Video visits include psychoeducation, interoceptive exposure, and interoceptive counseling. For homework, participants are asked to document their weekly physical activity and exercise sensations in a journal.&#xD;
Psychoeducation: Participants are educated about the benefits and safety of exercise and cardiac rehabilitation, the role of fear and anxiety in exercise avoidance, and the concept of interoceptive exposure.&#xD;
Interoceptive Exposure: A gradual six-minute walk (G6MW) serves as a low-risk form of interoceptive exposure. Exercise sensations and ratings of perceived intensity and distress are collected before and after the G6MW.&#xD;
Interoceptive Counseling: Participants review and reflect upon their pre-walking and post-walking physical sensations and ratings (intensity and distress) with a research team member. Homework is also reviewed.</description>
