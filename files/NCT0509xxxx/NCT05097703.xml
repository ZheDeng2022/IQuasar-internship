  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests sleep difficulties in pre-school children (aged 3-6 years) are highly&#xD;
      prevalent and that carer knowledge of good sleep hygiene practices and the importance of them&#xD;
      is relatively poor. Establishing a regular bedtime routine, involving activities shown to&#xD;
      induce relaxation and prepare the child for sleep, is important in promoting optimal sleep&#xD;
      duration and quality. However, there appears to be a lack of evidence-based resources that&#xD;
      are empirically evaluated for carers to use with children within the family home. This study&#xD;
      proposes to co-develop and pilot a new sleep resource. This will be an interactive storybook&#xD;
      which guides children and their carers through a number of activities, designed to increase&#xD;
      relaxation and prepare the child for sleep. A randomised control trial (RCT) design will be&#xD;
      used, with an intervention group and a waitlist control group who will receive the resource&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention period. Both groups will be asked to complete&#xD;
      pre-intervention, post-intervention and follow-up measures; as well as keep sleep diaries for&#xD;
      their children for the duration of the intervention period. The intervention group will also&#xD;
      be asked to keep a diary of resource use and then to complete a feedback survey&#xD;
      post-intervention. They will be asked to use the resource for a minimum of three days a week&#xD;
      for a one-month period. This pilot aims to assess the acceptability of the resource and&#xD;
      provide initial findings in terms of its efficacy on a range of sleep related outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typically, 3-6-year olds are estimated to require around 10-12 hours of sleep per day (The&#xD;
      Sleep Council, 2019). This is thought to be essential for healthy growth and wellbeing, and&#xD;
      is significantly associated with predictors of adult health (Bathory &amp; Tomopoulos, 2017).&#xD;
      Sleep disturbances and difficulties are found to be highly prevalent amongst infants and&#xD;
      young children (Honaker &amp; Meltzer, 2014). The literature estimates between 25% to 50% of&#xD;
      pre-school aged children get too little sleep (Owens &amp; Mindell, 2011), and a quarter of&#xD;
      parents report sleep difficulties in their child's first five years of life (Bathory &amp;&#xD;
      Tomopoulos, 2017). This is a concern as evidence suggests early childhood to be a critical&#xD;
      time for establishing sleep habits which have implications for sleep quality throughout the&#xD;
      lifespan (Bonuck, Blank, True-Felt &amp; Chervin, 2016). Research also shows a well-established&#xD;
      link between sleep and long-term health outcomes for children. A recent review shows poor&#xD;
      sleep to negatively effect physical health factors such as weight problems, as well as&#xD;
      cognitive development, cognitive performance and behavioural functioning (Spruyt, 2019).&#xD;
      Thinking more broadly about the impact on families, sleep problems in children have been&#xD;
      found to impact the quality of maternal sleep, which then acts as a significant predictor of&#xD;
      maternal mood, stress and fatigue (Meltzer &amp; Mindell, 2007). Mindell and Williamson (2018)&#xD;
      highlight that investing in not only interventions for disordered sleep but preventative&#xD;
      strategies to promote healthy sleep is therefore essential in promoting positive health&#xD;
      outcomes for children and their family systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing sleep hygiene practices with children has been found to be positively associated&#xD;
      with better sleep across a range of ages (Mindell, Meltzer, Carskadon &amp; Chervin, 2009). Sleep&#xD;
      hygiene can be defined as a set of specific behaviours and activities that are conducive to&#xD;
      increasing healthy and adequate sleep (Perlis, Smith &amp; Pigeon, 2005). This includes the&#xD;
      consideration of factors such as environmental noise, bedroom environment, light exposure,&#xD;
      exercise, temperature and electronic device use (Richdale &amp; Schreck, 2019). Mindell and&#xD;
      Williamson (2018) also suggest appropriate communication and contact with carer as an&#xD;
      important aspect of sleep hygiene. The literature suggests that such techniques should be&#xD;
      encompassed within a regular and structured bedtime routine to be most effective. Following a&#xD;
      bedtime routine is associated with positive sleep outcomes; such as earlier bedtimes,&#xD;
      increased sleep duration, reduced night time awakenings and reported caregiver sleep quality&#xD;
      (Mindell and Williamson, 2018). Such outcomes have been observed in as little as two weeks&#xD;
      from implementing sleep hygiene practices (Mindell, Leichman, Lee, Williamson &amp; Walters,&#xD;
      2017). Encouraging bedtime routines that include sleep hygiene practices could therefore be a&#xD;
      cost-effective way to promote positive childhood sleep outcomes, which could then have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on a broad range of child development factors. Despite this, research&#xD;
      suggests that caregiver knowledge in regards to their children's sleep habits is poor&#xD;
      (McDowall, Galland, Campbell &amp; Elder, 2017). Studies have shown increased knowledge of sleep&#xD;
      hygiene to be associated with an increased number of positive sleep practices and increased&#xD;
      sleep duration in young children (Owens &amp; Jones, 2011). It has therefore been suggested that&#xD;
      caregiver education on sleep hygiene could be used as a first line intervention for sleep&#xD;
      problems in young children (McDowall, Galland, Campbell &amp; Elder, 2017). This indicates that&#xD;
      preventative interventions and resources for childhood sleep problems would likely benefit by&#xD;
      including a degree of caregiver education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based interventions to promote healthy sleep habits in young children have largely&#xD;
      focused on sub-groups of children and so may not be transferable to the general population&#xD;
      (Busch, Altenburg, Harmsen and Chinapaw, 2017). For example, sleep interventions have been&#xD;
      developed for children with autistic spectrum condition (Johnson et al., 2013; Turner &amp;&#xD;
      Johnson, 2013), intellectual disabilities (Stuttard, Beresford, Clarke, Beecham &amp; Curtis,&#xD;
      2015), children with lymphoblastic leukaemia (Zupanec, Jones, McRae, Papaconstantinou, Weston&#xD;
      &amp; Stremler, 2017), those with specific sleep difficulties (Schlarb &amp; Brandhorst, 2012; Kuhle,&#xD;
      Urschitz, Eitner &amp; Poets, 2009), as well as children living in socioeconomic adversity&#xD;
      (Caldwell, Ordway, Sadler &amp; Redeker, 2020; Ordway et al., 2020). In terms of interventions&#xD;
      for the general population to promote healthy sleep, Busch, Altenburg, Harmsen and Chinapaw&#xD;
      (2017) provide a review of those developed for children aged 4-12 years. They conclude that&#xD;
      due to few high-quality studies, the effectiveness of any specific intervention strategy is&#xD;
      inconclusive. They recommend the need for further evaluation of systematically developed&#xD;
      interventions to encourage positive sleep habits in children. This current study's&#xD;
      investigators argue the need for further research evidence examining which methods are&#xD;
      effective in promoting healthy sleep in pre-school aged children, to then aid the development&#xD;
      of widely accessible evidence-based resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources (e.g. storybooks, games) designed to be used with young children before bed are&#xD;
      widely available. However, the efficacy of these in terms of promoting positive sleep&#xD;
      outcomes relies mainly on anecdotal evidence from carer in the form of online reviews and&#xD;
      blogs. Resources that have been evaluated in research for this age group tend to be in the&#xD;
      form of educational interventions rather than ones that can be used at home. For example, the&#xD;
      'Sweet Dreamzzz Early Childhood Sleep Education program (Wilson, Miller, Bonuck, Lumeng &amp;&#xD;
      Chevrin, 2014) was developed for pre-school children and parents. This included a one-off&#xD;
      workshop for parents and a two-week classroom curriculum for children to help establish&#xD;
      bedtime routines involving positive sleep hygiene activities. Results included an increase of&#xD;
      30 minutes per night for children's sleep at one-month follow-up and increased parental&#xD;
      knowledge of sleep hygiene practices; though this effect was not lasting. Schlarb and&#xD;
      Branhorst (2012) developed an internet-based intervention, 'Mini-KiSS Online', for sleep&#xD;
      disturbances in children aged 6-months to 4-years and their parents. Parents attended six&#xD;
      online intervention sessions which included psychoeducation on sleep and implementing&#xD;
      strategies to promote sleep hygiene including; imaginational exercises, bedtime stories,&#xD;
      improving sleep environment; cognitive-behavioural techniques and relaxation exercises.&#xD;
      Results indicate the intervention was highly accepted by parents and included improvements in&#xD;
      falling asleep, less night time awakenings and less bedtime resistance. Though effect sizes&#xD;
      were small to medium and results were limited by a high dropout rate (46%). Educational&#xD;
      treatment programs rely on carer to independently implement learnt techniques which may be a&#xD;
      reason for high dropout rates, as well as a high variation in how the strategies are&#xD;
      implemented. This suggests that carer may benefit from resources they can use within the&#xD;
      home, to help scaffold the bedtime routine and promote sleep hygiene activities in 'real&#xD;
      time' with their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of an evaluated resource that can be used at home, one study evaluated the game&#xD;
      'Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well'. This is a digital interactive game for 7-9-year olds,&#xD;
      which encourages children to map out their bedtime routine to include sleep promoting&#xD;
      activities and limit negative sleep hygiene activities such as the use of electronic devices.&#xD;
      Preliminary results indicated the potential for this tool to be effective in promoting&#xD;
      healthy sleep habits (Almondes &amp; Leonardo, 2019), though the sample size was small (n=13).&#xD;
      The authors also described this as the first study that used a 'serious game' (game designed&#xD;
      for a primary purpose other than entertainment) to promote healthy sleep habits in children.&#xD;
      In terms of study's evaluating serious games that promote healthy sleep habits for a younger&#xD;
      age group in the home environment, this current project would therefore be the first to our&#xD;
      knowledge to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature highlights a need for the development and evaluation of evidence-based&#xD;
      preventative resources that can be used at home as part of a child's bedtime routine. This&#xD;
      study aims to provide a resource that pre-school children can play before bedtime with&#xD;
      carers; in which they follow the characters on a journey through a fictional land, helping&#xD;
      its inhabitants get a good night's sleep along the way. This will work by incorporating and&#xD;
      encouraging positive sleep hygiene practices and relaxation exercises. It will include&#xD;
      evidence-based practices shown to aid relaxation, using elements of mindfulness, deep&#xD;
      breathing, imagery techniques and muscular relaxation. It will also include soothing&#xD;
      activities and an appropriate level of child-caregiver interaction. The intervention is novel&#xD;
      in that it aims to support children's sleep practices within the home environment, and&#xD;
      therefore will have strong ecological validity. This research project therefore aims to&#xD;
      develop and evaluate the sleep resource on a range of outcomes for both children and carer&#xD;
      when played regularly together before bedtime.&#xD;
