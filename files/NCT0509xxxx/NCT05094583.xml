  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SmokeFree is a theory-driven and evidence-based stop smoking mobile application. Based on&#xD;
      NICE guidance and best practice for smoking cessation, the application employs over 30&#xD;
      behaviour change techniques used in NHS Stop Smoking Services. It has been downloaded over 4&#xD;
      million times and has an average user rating of 4.7 out of 5, from over 120,000 ratings.&#xD;
      Whilst user feedback has been highly positive, there is a need for further objective studies&#xD;
      to demonstrate its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational, two arm feasibility study, which aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, attrition rate and user experience of the SmokeFree App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients in the Acute Medical Unit and ambulatory emergency care unit at Chelsea and&#xD;
      Westminster Hospital who are current smokers will be offered to participate in the study, in&#xD;
      addition to all other smoking cessation interventions, which will also be offered to them.&#xD;
      Care will be taken to ensure that all available options of smoking cessation support are&#xD;
      offered in addition to the SmokeFree application. Subjects agreeing to participate will be&#xD;
      given access to the application for a period of 12 weeks, with a target quit date no later&#xD;
      than week 8 of use of the application. At the end of 12 weeks they will be offered a follow&#xD;
      up appointment in a purposely designed clinic, where their CO level will be measured, as well&#xD;
      as being invited to complete feedback questionnaires on their experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of the study will be the quit rate for a period of minimum of 4 weeks&#xD;
      by the completion of the 12 week trial. This will be confirmed with exhaled carbon monoxide&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include user experience, engagement with the mobile application and&#xD;
      attrition rate.&#xD;
