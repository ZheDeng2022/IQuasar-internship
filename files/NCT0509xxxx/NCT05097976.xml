      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an oral methylprednisolone taper on&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain, function, opioid consumption, nausea, and complications following&#xD;
      outpatient total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We hypothesize that administration of an oral&#xD;
      methylprednisolone taper starting on postoperative day 1 (POD 1) following TKA will be&#xD;
      associated with improved pain and decreased opioid use, nausea, and complications at POD1-7,&#xD;
      as compared to similar patients who receive placebo. Additionally, those taking&#xD;
      methylprednisolone will report decreased pain and greater objective functional outcomes at 3&#xD;
      and 6 weeks postoperatively as compared to controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been associated with severe pain in the acute postoperative&#xD;
      period. Studies have demonstrated highest pain scores on POD 1 following TKA, however over&#xD;
      50% of patients describe the first two weeks at home as the most painful period of recovery&#xD;
      marked by moderate to severe pain. This is an important finding as higher levels of acute&#xD;
      pain have been associated with chronic opioid use, disturbed sleep, and impaired early&#xD;
      mobilization, which can prolong recovery time and increase rates of adverse events, including&#xD;
      venous thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, extensive research in pain management has been conducted with the purpose of&#xD;
      reducing acute postoperative pain. This is of particular interest because over the past two&#xD;
      decades average length of hospital stay has decreased while rates of outpatient TKAs with&#xD;
      same day discharge has increased. A multimodal pain regimen enables the on-boarding of&#xD;
      several medications, including anesthesia and analgesics working at varied pathways to target&#xD;
      pain and inflammation, and has proven to be efficacious. This not only decreases patient&#xD;
      reported pain scores but is also associated with improved sleep and functional recovery.&#xD;
      Despite efficacious multimodal pain regimens, including periarticular injection cocktails,&#xD;
      rebound pain in the early postoperative period and medication-induced nausea and vomiting can&#xD;
      be problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory and pain pathway modulators, and therefore have&#xD;
      become an important component of multimodal pain regimens. Corticosteroids have been shown to&#xD;
      decrease postoperative levels of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and C-reactive protein.&#xD;
      Corticosteroids also block the synthesis of prostaglandins, a nociceptive pain receptor&#xD;
      sensitizer and inflammatory mediator that is associated with edema via increased vascular&#xD;
      permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of perioperative steroids to mitigate potential impairments in&#xD;
      postoperative TKA recovery has been studied extensively in the orthopedic literature. The&#xD;
      addition of corticosteroids to multimodal pain regiments, including systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
      or perioperative periarticular joint cocktails, has demonstrated improved acute postoperative&#xD;
      pain scores function and decreased opioid use without an increase in adverse outcomes, as&#xD;
      compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have investigated the effect of additional doses of corticosteroids in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period. Administration of IV dexamethasone 24 hours postoperatively&#xD;
      correlated with lower acute opioid and antiemetic use, and improved pain scores, nausea,&#xD;
      length of stay and range of motion, as compared to controls or perioperative corticosteroids&#xD;
      alone. The addition of a second postoperative corticosteroid dose, at 24 and 48 hours, have&#xD;
      been associated with even greater improvements in pain and function scores, without an&#xD;
      increase in complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of a methylprednisolone taper within a standard multimodal pain regimen in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period has been evaluated in other orthopedic subspecialties. A&#xD;
      methylprednisolone taper following lumbar laminectomy and distal radius repair demonstrated&#xD;
      acute reductions in patient reported pain scores, without an increase in adverse events. The&#xD;
      current literature supports these findings, demonstrating the safety of short term and low&#xD;
      dose corticosteroid treatments, including a methylprednisolone taper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no prior study has compared the administration of a&#xD;
      methylprednisolone taper to a placebo in the immediate postoperative period following TKA.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a methylprednisolone taper within a standard postoperative&#xD;
      multimodal pain regimen. The authors predict improved pain and decreased opioid use and&#xD;
      nausea from POD 1 to POD 7, as well as improved pain, function, and complication rate at 3-&#xD;
      and 6-weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
