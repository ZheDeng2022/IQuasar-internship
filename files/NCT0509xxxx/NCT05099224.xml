      Mindfulness meditation was used to reduce stress and its responses such as cortisol and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) among healthy and ill individuals in various cultures, but their&#xD;
      effects have not yet been studied among Jordanian nursing students, experienced tremendous&#xD;
      stress. Thus, the purpose of study was to examine the effects of three of such intervention&#xD;
      on perceived stress (MM) on Trait mindfulness, perceived stress, cortisol, and CRP in&#xD;
      Jordanian nursing students. The hypothesis was &quot; mindfulness meditation will improve trait&#xD;
      mindfulness, perceived stress, serum cortisol and serum CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a Randomized controlled study conducted in a large university in Jordan, 108 nursing&#xD;
      students were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups equally. The experimental&#xD;
      group participated in 5 30-minute weekly sessions of mindfulness meditation. Trait&#xD;
      mindfulness, perceived stress, serum cortisol, and CRP were measured at baseline and end of&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

      Introduction Like nursing students in other countries, nursing students in Jordan have&#xD;
      reported high stress, influencing students' health, academic performance, attrition, and&#xD;
      ability to care for patients and themselves. Previous studies have shown that stress can&#xD;
      negatively impact the body. Specifically, the immune system can be negatively impacted by the&#xD;
      activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system (e.g. cortisol). Elevated&#xD;
      cortisol increases the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      found to be associated with a variety of chronic illnesses. Mindfulness meditation is a&#xD;
      mind-body therapy that has been gaining increasing attention in the recent literature and has&#xD;
      demonstrated promising results across different populations and settings. In Jordan, there is&#xD;
      a lack of evidence related to the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on stress and its&#xD;
      physiological indices such as cortisol and CRP in Jordanian people generally and nursing&#xD;
      students specifically. Thus, the aim was to examine the effects of three of such intervention&#xD;
      on perceived stress (MM) on Trait mindfulness, perceived stress, cortisol, and CRP in&#xD;
      Jordanian nursing students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Setting The study sample included undergraduate nursing students who were&#xD;
      selected using convenience sampling from Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation G* Power software 3.1 was used to calculate the required sample size,&#xD;
      given a MANOVA test, an alpha of .05, power of 0.95, number of dependent variables of 4,&#xD;
      number of groups of 2, and effect size of 0.25. A sample size of 80 was calculated, and an&#xD;
      attrition rate of 35% was added based on a previous study with variables similar to those of&#xD;
      the present study. Therefore, this resulted in a final total sample size of 108 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure First, approval from the institutional review board at JUST was obtained. After&#xD;
      obtaining permission from the dean of the nursing college at JUST and the students'&#xD;
      instructors, the PI visited the students in their classrooms. After the students' lecture had&#xD;
      finished, the PI made an announcement explaining the study title and objectives and asked any&#xD;
      students who were interested in participating to contact him either on the phone number&#xD;
      assigned for the purposes of the study or via email. The PI arranged an initial meeting to&#xD;
      meet with students who were interested in participating, which was to be held on another day&#xD;
      in a private room at the university. At this meeting, the PI informed the students of the&#xD;
      study objectives, risks, and benefits, in addition to answering the students' questions and&#xD;
      assuring them that all collected data would be kept confidential. The students were also&#xD;
      assured that they had the full right to refuse or discontinue participation at any time and&#xD;
      that such refusal or discontinuation would not affect their academic achievement in any way.&#xD;
      At the same meeting, informed consent was obtained from participants who agreed to&#xD;
      participate and who met the eligibility criteria. After that, the participants were randomly&#xD;
      assigned equally to the study groups using a computerized random numbers procedure carried&#xD;
      out by a research assistant who was not involved in any other parts of the study. Finally,&#xD;
      the dates and times of the sessions were determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2-hour educational session, baseline measurements of the study variables were taken.&#xD;
      Then, the PI delivered a PowerPoint presentation for the participants in each subgroup, as&#xD;
      previously explained. At the end of the workshop, to avoid experimental contamination, the&#xD;
      participants in each experimental group were asked not to share any information related to&#xD;
      the intervention with the participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual training sessions were introduced to the participants in the experimental groups&#xD;
      by the PI based on the ABC relaxation theory's guidelines and protocols. Based on the ABC&#xD;
      Relaxation Theory, at least two, and preferably five, weekly sessions of actual mind-body&#xD;
      training should be provided to evoke relaxation and optimize health. The sessions were held&#xD;
      in a private, quiet, comfortable, and spacious room at the university. As previously&#xD;
      mentioned, the dependent variables were measured twice, at baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention (i.e., In the next morning after the 5th session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various strategies were followed to decrease measurement errors that could potentially be&#xD;
      affected by variations in the data collection procedure. For example, filling out the&#xD;
      questionnaire may be stressful for some subjects, hence influencing the objective measures.&#xD;
      Therefore, the self-report measures were completed after the physical measures were taken.&#xD;
      Also, all of the study measures in the intervention and control groups were taken in similar&#xD;
      conditions, including similar room temperature and environment. In addition, quiet&#xD;
      environments were maintained, with a &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign placed on the doors of the rooms&#xD;
      during the interventions and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (version 25).&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample. The sample and study variables were&#xD;
      described by measures of central tendency and dispersion appropriate to the level of&#xD;
      measurement. Initial independent t-tests and Chi-squared tests were conducted to ensure that&#xD;
      the randomization across the covariates was successful, and one-way MANOVA was used to test&#xD;
      the study hypotheses. Post hoc one-way ANOVAs were run to examine if there were significant&#xD;
      differences in each of the dependent variables between the study groups. Due to multiple&#xD;
      testing, the p-value was adjusted by dividing the p value of .05 by 4 (i.e., the number of&#xD;
      dependent variables), with a level of .0125 considered as the level of significance for the&#xD;
      ANOVA tests.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trait Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trait mindfulness was measured using the Arabic version of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) (28), which is a one-dimensional scale that includes 15 items measured on a six-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). The total possible score ranges between 15 and 90, with higher scores indicating higher levels of trait mindfulness. The original scale has been shown to have strong psychometric properties when validated among college students (28). Further, the Arabic version of this scale has been shown to have excellent internal consistency and convergent validity for use among Arab populations (29). In the current study, the Cronbach's alpha for the Arabic version of the MAAS was .79, indicating good internal consistency.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (30) is used to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful (unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded). The scale comprises 10 items which are measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0=never, 4= very often) and which are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation group. The total possible score ranges from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stress (30). The PSS has been validated for use among college students, with internal consistency coefficients ranging from .84 to 36 and a test-retest reliability of .85 (30). The Arabic version of the PSS, which was used in the present study, has been shown to have adequate reliability and validity and is considered a suitable instrument for assessing perceived stress among Arab populations (31). In the current study, the Cronbach's alpha for the Arabic version of the PSS was .81, indicating good internal consistency.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ELISA method has been found to be accurate, sensitive, specific, and precise in terms of determining the plasma concentration of cortisol (32). In the current study, the ELISA kit and protocols were used to analyze the blood sample for the serum cortisol (CEA462Ge) . Three research assistants with at least 10 years of experience collected 10 mL blood samples via venipuncture both at baseline and next day morning after the last session, between 8:30-9:30 AM. The results were read using a SYNERGY (HTZ) multi-mode reader, connected to a computer which showed each reading value. The participants were asked to avoid caffeine consumption on the days of data collection. To decrease venipuncture-related pain during blood sampling, the EMLA cream was used, as it has been found effective in decreasing venipuncture-related pain among different populations (33).</description>
