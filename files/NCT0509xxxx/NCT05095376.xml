  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the effect of adding lomustine to temozolomide and radiation&#xD;
      therapy versus temozolomide and radiation therapy alone in shrinking or stabilizing newly&#xD;
      diagnosed MGMT methylated glioblastoma. Chemotherapy drugs, such as lomustine and&#xD;
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding lomustine to usual&#xD;
      treatment of temozolomide and radiation therapy may help shrink and stabilize glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) significantly prolongs overall survival (OS) versus (vs.) standard&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) with&#xD;
      MGMT promoter methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine with&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) significantly prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) vs. standard&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter&#xD;
      methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the two different chemotherapy regimens on patient-reported outcomes (PROs),&#xD;
      as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if the regimen with the two alkylating agents temozolomide and lomustine&#xD;
      with radiotherapy (RT) is associated with inferior short-term change in patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (PROs) as measured by MDASI-BT vs. standard chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed GBM with MGMT promoter methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess toxicity in the two different chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the association between absolute lymphocyte counts and outcomes. II. To assess&#xD;
      the association between CD4+ lymphocyte counts and outcomes. III. To compare the two&#xD;
      different chemotherapy regimens in terms of long-term PROs as measured by MDASI-BT at years 1&#xD;
      and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week and receive temozolomide orally&#xD;
      (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients then receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive lomustine PO on day 1 and&#xD;
      temozolomide PO QD on days 2-6. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 6 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1,&#xD;
      every 4 months for year 2, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 REGISTRATION: No known IDH mutation. (If tested before step 1 registration,&#xD;
             patients known to have IDH mutation in the tumor on local or other testing are&#xD;
             ineligible and should not be registered)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 REGISTRATION: Availability of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor&#xD;
             tissue block and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slide to be sent for central&#xD;
             pathology review for confirmation of histology and MGMT promoter methylation status.&#xD;
             Note that tissue for central pathology review and central MGMT assessment must be&#xD;
             received by the NYU Center for Biospecimen Research and Development (CBRD) on or&#xD;
             before postoperative calendar day 23. If tissue cannot be received by postoperative&#xD;
             calendar day 23, then patients may NOT enroll on this trial as central pathology&#xD;
             review will not be complete in time for the patient to start treatment no later than 6&#xD;
             weeks following surgery. Results of central pathology review and central MGMT analysis&#xD;
             will generally be conveyed to NRG Oncology within 10 business days of receipt of&#xD;
             tissue. Note: In the event of an additional tumor resection(s), tissue must be&#xD;
             received within 23 days of the most recent resection and the latest resection must&#xD;
             have been performed within 30 days after the initial resection. Surgical resection is&#xD;
             required; stereotactic biopsy alone is not allowed because it will not provide&#xD;
             sufficient tissue for MGMT analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 REGISTRATION: Contrast-enhanced brain MRI within 4 days after surgery&#xD;

                  TSE/FSE and 3D contrast-enhanced T1 sequences are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3-dimensional (3D) pre contrast-enhanced T1 sequences are strongly suggested&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 REGISTRATION: Willing to use highly effective method of contraception for&#xD;
             participants of childbearing potential (participants who may become pregnant or who&#xD;
             may impregnate a partner) during therapy and for 6 months after completing treatment;&#xD;
             this inclusion is necessary because the treatment in this study may be significantly&#xD;
             teratogenic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 1 REGISTRATION: The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide&#xD;
             study-specific informed consent prior to study entry and, for patients treated in the&#xD;

             gliosarcoma as a subtype of glioblastoma) confirmed by central pathology review&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 2 REGISTRATION: MGMT promoter with methylation confirmed by central pathology&#xD;
             review (See Section 10 for details). Note: Patients with tissue that is insufficient&#xD;
             or inadequate for analysis, fails MGMT testing, or has indeterminate or unmethylated&#xD;
             MGMT promoter are excluded. Patients with unmethylated MGMT may be considered for&#xD;
             enrollment on NRG-BN007&#xD;

          -  STEP 2 REGISTRATION: IDH mutation testing by at least one method (such as&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry for IDH1 R132H) must be performed as part of standard of care and&#xD;
             no mutation must be found (i.e IDH wildtype). (If a mutation is identified then the&#xD;
             patient will be ineligible and must be registered as ineligible at Step 2.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  STEP 2 REGISTRATION: History/physical examination within 28 days prior to Step 2&#xD;
             registration&#xD;

             infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if&#xD;
             indicated&#xD;

               -  Note: Known positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg)&#xD;
                  indicating acute or chronic infection would make the patient ineligible unless&#xD;
                  the viral load becomes undetectable on suppressive therapy. Patients who are&#xD;
                  immune to hepatitis B (anti-hepatitis B surface antibody positive) are eligible&#xD;

                  acid [RNA]) indicating acute or chronic infection would make the patient&#xD;
