  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have explored the effects of inhalation anesthetics, intravenous anesthetics,&#xD;
      and muscle relaxants on spectral entropy, but most did not monitor the degree of&#xD;
      neuromuscular block. In addition, they do not explore the effects of different degrees of&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade on spectral entropy under different concentrations of isoflurane&#xD;
      inhalation. Therefore, the present study will evaluate different levels of MAC to quantify&#xD;
      the isoflurane concentration, as well as different degrees of neuromuscular blockade&#xD;
    </textblock>

      The study will include 40 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. They will be randomized&#xD;
      into 2 equal groups by a computer generated random numbers table, each consisting of 20&#xD;
      patients, namely group A and group R.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Patients will receive Atracurium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group R: Patients will receive rocuronium. No premedication will be given. After the&#xD;
           patients enter the operating room, a venous cannula will be inserted into a large&#xD;
           peripheral vein. Data from routine monitoring, including non-invasive arterial blood&#xD;
           pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal oxygen concentration (ETO2) and end-tidal&#xD;
           carbon dioxide concentration (ETCO2) will be collected. Neuromuscular blockade will be&#xD;
           continuously assessed by acceleromyography using the Train-of-Four-watch SX system (made&#xD;
           in Ireland), starting when the patients will be unconscious. RE and SE will be monitored&#xD;
           using a Datex Ohmeda Entropy Module (M-Entropy) and the Entropy Sensor system (made in&#xD;
           finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline RE and SE will be recorded. Anesthesia will be induced by propofol (dose 2-3 mg/kg)&#xD;
      and fentanyl as analgesia (dose 1-2 mg/kg). Tracheal intubation will be facilitated with&#xD;
      rocuronium (dose 0.6 mg/kg) /atracurium (dose 0.5 mg/kg) after an acceleromyography count of&#xD;
      0. Anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane in an air-O2 mixture (FiO2 0.6, 2 L/min).&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation will be maintained at a tidal volume of 5-7 ml/kg. Ventilator&#xD;
      frequency will be adjusted for maintenance of an ETCO2 of 35-40 mmHg. After equilibrium for&#xD;
      30 minutes SE, RE and the difference between them will be recorded at MAC 0.8 and MAC 1 at&#xD;
      two levels of muscle relaxation assessed by TOF value of 50% and 100%. Rocuronium (dose&#xD;
      0.01-0.012 mg/kg/min ) /atracurium (dose 0.005-0.01 mg/kg/min) will be administered as a&#xD;
      continuous IV infusion adjusted until 50% and 100% depression of T1 ( first twitch by&#xD;
      acceleromyography) will be observed. The entire experiment ended before the start of surgery.&#xD;
