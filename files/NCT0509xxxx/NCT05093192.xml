  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common adult blood cancer in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. CLL means that many cancer cells appear in the blood, bone marrow and other tissues,&#xD;
      for example, the spleen where some blood cells reside. Most patients with CLL have been&#xD;
      diagnosed by chance, have no symptoms as a result of CLL, and do not need urgent treatment.&#xD;
      However, when the cancer cells build up, people experience symptoms of CLL, and treatment is&#xD;
      required. One of the current treatments for CLL is chemo-immunotherapy, that targets and&#xD;
      kills cancer cells in the blood. However, this treatment does not kill all cancer cells. Some&#xD;
      cancer cells survive by 'hiding' in the bone marrow and tissues, like the spleen, where the&#xD;
      treatment cannot get to, this is called minimal residual disease (MRD). MRD eventually builds&#xD;
      up and patients experience symptoms of CLL again. New approaches to detect and treat MRD are&#xD;
      needed. Research has shown, that the number of blood cells, increases after exercise and that&#xD;
      many of these blood cells come from the bone marrow and other tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate if exercise can move CLL cancer cells that are 'hiding' in the&#xD;
      bone marrow and other tissues into the blood, thus improving the detection of MRD. By moving&#xD;
      cancer cells into blood, the investigators also think this will improve the way&#xD;
      chemo-immunotherapy works. In this study, the investigators will investigate the number of&#xD;
      cancer and natural killer (NK) cells in the blood after exercise, in three different groups&#xD;
      of people with CLL: before treatment; during treatment; and after treatment has finished.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whilst repeated cycles of anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)20 immunotherapy are effective&#xD;
      at killing large numbers of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood circulation, minimal residual disease (MRD) persists diffusely in the bone marrow and&#xD;
      secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes and spleen. This is thought to be for a&#xD;
      number of reasons. Firstly, malignant cells sequestered in lymphoid compartments receive&#xD;
      protection from their stromal microenvironment. For example, T cells, dendritic cells and&#xD;
      macrophages release pro-proliferative and apoptosis-inhibiting signalling pathways, that&#xD;
      prolong CLL survival. Consequently, CLL cells in lymphoid tissues are much less susceptible&#xD;
      to anti-CD20 immunotherapy, than CLL cells trafficking in the blood. This may be because the&#xD;
      circulating CLL cells are not embedded into a protective stromal microenvironment. Secondly,&#xD;
      to exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC; i.e., the primary mechanism of&#xD;
      action elicited by anti-CD20 immunotherapy against CLL cells) NK cells need to express CD16,&#xD;
      a molecule expressed by CD56dim NK cells. However, these potent NK cells are unable to&#xD;
      traffic from blood, where NK cells are more abundant, to secondary lymphoid tissues, because&#xD;
      NK cells lack lymphoid homing markers. Thus, CLL cells are able to 'hide' from NK cells in&#xD;
      lymphoid tissue, ensuring their ongoing survival. In light of the pro-survival features of&#xD;
      the CLL microenvironment, new approaches to detect and treat MRD are sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been repeatedly shown, in one of the most reproduced findings in human physiology,&#xD;
      that immune cell frequency in the peripheral blood increases profoundly, by approximately&#xD;
      50-100%, during a bout of aerobic exercise of moderate to vigorous intensity. This response&#xD;
      reflects a redistribution of immune cells from marginal pools in the blood vessels, as well&#xD;
      as from lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes into the blood,&#xD;
      driven by increased haemodynamic forces and increased levels of catecholamines during&#xD;
      exercise. In response to increased levels of exercise-induced catecholamines, beta-2&#xD;
      adrenergic receptors on the cell surface of lymphocytes, induce detachment from the vascular&#xD;
      endothelium, thus promoting the mobilisation of lymphocytes into the peripheral blood&#xD;
      circulation, during a bout of exercise, returning to pre exercise values in the 1 hour&#xD;
      following exercise. The migration of immune cells into blood is comprised of all major immune&#xD;
      cell types, including neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes. Due to the adrenergic&#xD;
      mechanisms responsible there is a preferential mobilisation of the subtypes with the highest&#xD;
      expression of beta-2 adrenergic receptors on the cell surface. NK cells are the most exercise&#xD;
      responsive T lymphocyte population, followed by CD8+ T cells, B cells and CD4+ T cells. B&#xD;
      cells express beta-2 adrenergic receptors and are therefore susceptible to mobilisation via&#xD;
      exercise-induced catecholamines. In healthy persons, B cell frequency is increased in blood&#xD;
      by approximately 50-100% during various different types of exercise including, cycling,&#xD;
      running, rowing and resistance exercise. Furthermore, a rodent model of acute psychological&#xD;
      stress - which induces similar adrenergic responses as exercise - demonstrated a similar B&#xD;
      cell mobilisation pattern. An additional rodent model observed that acute stressors appear to&#xD;
      redirect B cells from the bone marrow, suggesting that the B cells mobilised in response to&#xD;
      exercise may have been mobilised from lymphoid tissue. Given these changes to immune cell&#xD;
      kinetics, exercise may be an effective means of mobilising CLL cells from diffuse lymphoid&#xD;
      tissues into the peripheral blood circulation, which may, in turn, facilitate the detection&#xD;
      of MRD in CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exercise-induced mobilisation of CLL cells from lymphoid tissues may also increase the&#xD;
      efficacy of anti-CD20 immunotherapy. Indeed, this process may facilitate the removal of CLL&#xD;
      cells from protective, pro-survival microenvironments into the blood circulation. CLL cells&#xD;
      survive in lymphoid tissue receiving external signals from the microenvironment promoting&#xD;
      growth and survival. Furthermore, CD16+ NK cells, the primary effector cell in ADCC, do not&#xD;
      express lymphoid homing markers on their cell surface, and cannot traffic to the lymphoid&#xD;
      tissue to elicit potent ADCC responses. Therefore, in order to improve the depth and efficacy&#xD;
      of treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), strategies need to be explored that&#xD;
      remove CLL cells from their protective stromal microenvironment within lymphoid tissues, and&#xD;
      mobilise into the blood circulation where CLL cells will encounter NK cells capable of&#xD;
      eliciting ADCC. Exercise has the potential to redistribute B cells, and exercise has also&#xD;
      been shown to increase the frequency of CD16+ NK cells, by over 500% into the blood&#xD;
      circulation. Therefore, exercise may mobilise both CLL cells from their protective&#xD;
      microenvironment and large numbers of effector NK cells capable of ADCC into the blood&#xD;
      circulation, simultaneously. Thus, this process has the potential to improve the depth and&#xD;
      efficacy of anti-CD20 mAb treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of importance to examine the effects of exercise on CLL and CD16+ NK cells at different&#xD;
      stages of the CLL survivorship. For instance, people with watch and wait CLL, who have not&#xD;
      yet received anti-CLL therapy, enables investigations into the impact of exercise on both CLL&#xD;
      tumour cell and immune cell kinetics, without the presence of confounding variables like&#xD;
      anti-CLL treatments, or disease associated morbidities. Indeed, people with watch and wait&#xD;
      CLL have no disease symptoms and are thus likely to have fewer contra-indications to exercise&#xD;
      than CLL patients later in the CLL survivorship continuum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating the impact of exercise in people receiving anti-CLL treatments is also&#xD;
      warranted, as those likely to benefit from the adjuvant effects of exercise on immunotherapy&#xD;
      are, by reason, patients undergoing cycles of immunotherapy treatment. Thus, it is essential&#xD;
      to explore how acute exercise is tolerated in people undergoing cycles of treatment, and&#xD;
      assessment of the safety and acceptability of exercise is warranted. Moreover,&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy induces immune-suppression which may nullify the immune changes induced by&#xD;
      exercise. Accordingly, investigation of the effects of exercise on immune cell kinetics, as&#xD;
      well as residual CLL tumour cells, is warranted in people receiving anti-CLL&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, examining the impact of exercise in people in CLL remission, following completion of&#xD;
      anti-CLL treatment, is required as any exercise induced mobilisation of CLL cells may also&#xD;
      facilitate the detection of MRD following anti-CLL treatment. Several studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients who achieved a clinical complete remission (CR) but with&#xD;
      detectable MRD, can experience a disease relapse due to expansion of the residual CLL cells.&#xD;
      Patients with CLL who achieve undetectable MRD (&lt;1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes in blood or&#xD;
      bone marrow), following anti-CLL treatment have better clinical outcomes than those with&#xD;
      detectable MRD. A meta-analysis of eleven international studies with a total of 2457 patients&#xD;
      observed that undetectable MRD status after treatment with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
      in newly diagnosed CLL is associated with overall and progression free survival. Therefore,&#xD;
      MRD is a robust post-treatment prognostic biomarker of tumour burden, required for predicting&#xD;
      disease recurrence. However, due to the multicompartmental nature of CLL, the bone marrow and&#xD;
      secondary lymphoid tissue may serve as reservoirs for residual disease. Therefore, exercise&#xD;
      may be utilised to facilitate the detection of MRD by mobilising CLL cells from diffuse sites&#xD;
      into the blood circulation, thus potentially accelerating the identification of disease&#xD;
      progression in patients following anti-CLL treatment. It is also important to assess immune&#xD;
      competency in people in remission following completion of anti-CLL therapy, as any immune&#xD;
      suppression at this time may hinder any effects of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this pilot study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An acute bout of exercise will increase the frequency of CLL tumour cells in the&#xD;
           peripheral blood of people with CLL at different stages of CLL survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An acute bout of exercise will increase the frequency of immune cells (e.g., CD16+ NK&#xD;
           cells) in the peripheral blood of people with CLL at different stages of CLL&#xD;
           survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise induced mobilisation of immune cells (e.g., NK cells) will improve the efficacy&#xD;
           of anti-CD20 immunotherapy against CLL cells ex vivo.&#xD;

                  may remain stable over a long period; this does not automatically require&#xD;
                  therapeutic intervention). Cut-off levels of haemoglobin less than 10 g/dL or&#xD;
                  platelet counts less than 100 × 109/L are generally regarded as an indication for&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Massive (i.e., ≥6 cm below the left costal margin), progressive, or symptomatic&#xD;
                  splenomegaly.&#xD;

                  lymphadenopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of 50% or more over a 2-month period,&#xD;
                  or lymphocyte-doubling time (LDT) less than 6 months. LDT can be obtained by&#xD;
                  linear regression extrapolation of absolute lymphocyte counts obtained at&#xD;
                  intervals of 2 weeks over an observation period of 2 to 3 months; patients with&#xD;
                  initial blood lymphocyte counts less than 30 × 109/L may require a longer&#xD;
                  observation period to determine the LDT. Factors contributing to lymphocytosis&#xD;
                  other than CLL (e.g., infections or steroid administration) should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Autoimmune complications, including anaemia or thrombocytopenia that respond&#xD;
                  poorly to corticosteroids.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Significant fatigue (i.e., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance&#xD;
                       scale 2 or worse, cannot work, or unable to perform usual activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Fevers of 38.0°C or higher for 2 or more weeks without evidence of&#xD;
                       infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Night sweats for at least 1 month without evidence of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recently initiated first-line treatment on one of the following regimes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR)&#xD;
