  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study participants will receive NNC0385-0434. NNC0385-0434 is being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a fat metabolism disorder characterized by high levels of&#xD;
      cholesterol in the blood. The dose to be tested in this study is 40 mg NNC0385-0434.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NNC0385-0434 is a new potential medicine that is currently being tested for intake as a&#xD;
      tablet. It is not yet approved and cannot be prescribed yet. Besides 40 mg of NNC0385-0434,&#xD;
      each tablet also contains 500 mg of the absorption enhancing agent SNAC, which helps to move&#xD;
      NNC0385-0434 from the stomach into the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of food intake on the amount of&#xD;
      NNC0385-0434 in the blood after multiple tablet intake. For this purpose, NNC0385-0434 is&#xD;
      given either after a high-fat breakfast or on an empty stomach. After dosing, participants&#xD;
      must either fast for another 4 hours or receive a meal 30 minutes after dosing, depending on&#xD;
      the group participants are assigned to. After taking the NNC0385-0434 tablets, the amount of&#xD;
      NNC0385-0434 (and of SNAC) in the blood will be measured. The effect of food intake on the&#xD;
      uptake of NNC0385-0434 into the body will be investigated so that correct and safe intake&#xD;
      recommendations and medicine labels can be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study can last for up to approximately 14 weeks for each participant, with a total of 7&#xD;
      clinic visits. This includes a screening period (up to 4 weeks) and one in-house treatment&#xD;
      period (together a total of 13 consecutive days). It also includes a follow-up period with 5&#xD;
      ambulatory visits at the clinic (for approximately 7 weeks [total of 50 days] after the last&#xD;
      dosing). participants will have blood tests at every clinic visit. Participants must be&#xD;
      healthy and have a body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 34.9 kg/m2 (both inclusive). Only&#xD;
      men can participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
