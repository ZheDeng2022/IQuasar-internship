    <textblock>
      This trial will investigate the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      LEO 138559 in healthy Japanese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a single treatment with either LEO&#xD;
      138559 or placebo, and 8 follow-up visits to Day 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 healthy subjects will be enrolled in 3 dose groups (n=8 per dose group) and&#xD;
      randomized to either LEO 138559 or placebo in a ratio of 6:2.&#xD;

             administration.&#xD;

         15. Less than 4 weeks after the second COVID-19 vaccination or booster (if on a single&#xD;
             dose vaccination, it should be 4 weeks after).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Live attenuated viral vaccine administration within 12 weeks before LEO 138559 or&#xD;
