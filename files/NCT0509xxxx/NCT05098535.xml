  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disclosure of anticipated risks to individuals considering undergoing an elective operative&#xD;
      procedure is an important aspect of informed consent process. Recent Canadian Guidelines have&#xD;
      highlighted the importance of perioperative risk discussion within the context of&#xD;
      preoperative assessment but there is little prior research into potential interventions to&#xD;
      optimize the communication of risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocaridal injury (MINS) is the most common complication and this study is focused on&#xD;
      determining the effectiveness of current communication strategies in our presurgical&#xD;
      consultations and to quantifying the impact of introducing a visual aid and scripted risk&#xD;
      discussions has on patients ability to recall their individualized perioperative risk of&#xD;
      myocardial injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Informed consent is an important aspect of the patient-physician relationship. Prior to&#xD;
      agreeing to undergo treatment patients must have risks and benefits disclosed to a&#xD;
      &quot;reasonable patient&quot; standard.1 The 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines on&#xD;
      Perioperative Cardiac Risk Assessment made strong recommendations emphasizing the need for&#xD;
      clear communication of perioperative cardiac risk to patients.2 Myocardial injury is the most&#xD;
      common post-operative complications and has significant impact on patient outcomes including&#xD;
      survival.2. However, very few studies have examined the communication of risk to patients,&#xD;
      particularly when communicating perioperative cardiac risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to formally evaluate the effectiveness of perioperative risk&#xD;
      communication and examine if the introduction of visual aids can improve communication and&#xD;
      preoperative patient education. During this study, all patients presenting to the Presurgical&#xD;
      Screening clinic for consultation with an anesthesiologist will receive a standardized&#xD;
      scripted discussion of the risk of myocardial injury following noncardiac surgery (MINS)&#xD;
      based on their revised cardiac risk index. During the study period, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in blocks to exposure to a visual aid representing their individualized risk of&#xD;
      MINS during the risk discussion. Immediately following the anesthesiology consultation, all&#xD;
      patient will be invited to participate in the study and complete a survey that will assess&#xD;
      ability to recall individualized cardiac risk and examine current risk discussion practices,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with cardiac risk discussion, importance of cardiac risk disclosure,&#xD;
      assess anxiety related to risk discussion, and seek general feedback from participants. This&#xD;
      study is structured to assess the effectiveness of incorporating the use of structured,&#xD;
      scripted risk discussion with and without the use of a visual aid. A subset of consenting&#xD;
      patients will be followed-up post operatively (within 48h) to assess recall of preoperative&#xD;
      cardiac risk discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesizes that the use of visual representation of perioperative risk of&#xD;
      Myocardial Injury after Non-Cardiac Surgery during the pre-anesthetic assessment will improve&#xD;
      the patients' satisfaction with the cardiac risk discussion and the participant's&#xD;
      understanding and retention of the risk in the post-operative period.&#xD;
