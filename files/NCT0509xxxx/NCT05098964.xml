  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home based and tele-rehabilitation programs may be potentially useful to deliver and to&#xD;
      maintain the benefits in difficult-to-reach areas. Tele-health technologies allow for&#xD;
      distribution of healthcare services and exchange of information between healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients in different geographical locations and provide an important tool to reach&#xD;
      people living in rural communities. In a previous single center study, we had shown that a&#xD;
      home pedometer assisted program to enhance physical activity was as effective as and cheaper&#xD;
      than a standard outpatient supervised exercise training program.13 We wondered whether the&#xD;
      results of that study 13 might be confirmed in a larger multicenter randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT). Therefore the aim of this multicenter RCT was to evaluate the benefits and costs&#xD;
      of a program of pedometer assisted physical activity as compared to standard hospital&#xD;
      outpatient supervised exercise training program.&#xD;

      A multicenter RCT was conducted in Moewardi (Surakarta, Central Jawa, Indonesia) and Mohammad&#xD;
      Rabain (Muara Enim, South Sumatra, Indonesia) hospitals from February the 1st, 2019 to&#xD;
      February the 29th 2020. The study was performed according to the Helsinki Declaration,&#xD;
      approved by the Committee of Moewardi Hospital, Surakarta, Central Jawa, Indonesia (Number&#xD;
      713/IX/HREC/2018, September 26th, 2018 and Indonesian Ministry of Health).Participants with&#xD;
      COPD as defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD)&#xD;
      guidelines and eligible for this study were allocated into two groups using a randomly&#xD;
      generated sequence. Before and after the program, the following outcome measures; 6MWT, BODE,&#xD;
      physical activity, MRC and CAT Score.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with COPD as defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
             Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) guidelines,2 40-80 years old, were recruited from the&#xD;
             outpatient clinics of Moewardi and Mohammad Rabain hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects had to be in stable conditions as assessed by absence of worsening in&#xD;
             symptoms, i.e. no change in cough, and/or sputum beyond day-to-day variability which&#xD;
             would have been sufficient to warrant a change in the management prescribed at&#xD;
             discharge from hospitals or prescribed at home by their GP, and stability in blood gas&#xD;
             values (e.g. no respiratory acidosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals refusing to participate, participated in a pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
             program during the previous 6 months, or with active malignancy, previous lung&#xD;
             surgery, unstable cardiovascular diseases, orthopaedic and/or neuromuscular diseases&#xD;
             interfering with their ability to walk, or inability to connect with internet and&#xD;
             operate WhatsApp video call applications were excluded.&#xD;
