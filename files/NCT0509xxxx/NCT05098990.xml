    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter real-world study, which aims to investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of Jinfukang oral liquid combined with chemotherapy as first-line&#xD;
      treatment regimen for patients with driver-negative advanced NSCLC. 328 patients with&#xD;
      unresectable stage IIIB-IV NSCLC and Qi-Yin deficiency will be divided into experimental&#xD;
      (n=164) and control groups (n=164) according to the stratified blocked randomization.&#xD;
