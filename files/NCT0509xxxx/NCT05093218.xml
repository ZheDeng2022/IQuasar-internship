  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is now a well-known complication of cirrhosis and various studies, including&#xD;
      pediatric studies, have recognized it as a poor prognostic factor. At the molecular level,&#xD;
      branch chain amino acids upregulate muscle protein synthesis by acting through the mTOR&#xD;
      pathway. Although effect of Branch Chain Amino acids has been studied extensively with&#xD;
      respect to hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic adults, there is paucity of literature on the&#xD;
      effect of BCAA on sarcopenia and frailty. Also, there is very limited data on the effect of&#xD;
      BCAA therapy in children with chronic liver disease. Through this study, we aim to assess the&#xD;
      effect of BCAA therapy on Mid Arm Muscle Area in cirrhotic children after 12 weeks. Our&#xD;
      secondary objective will be to study the prevalence of sarcopenia in children with CLD using&#xD;
      cut-off as Mid Arm Muscle area less than 2SD (using published centiles) and muscle thickness&#xD;
      (quadriceps and biceps) on ultrasound, and to study serum follistatin levels in those with or&#xD;
      without sarcopenia. Other secondary objectives will include determination of mTOR gene&#xD;
      expression at baseline and 7 days of BCAA therapy and change in creatinine height index after&#xD;
      12 weeks of BCAA therapy, occurrence of clinically significant events in the BCAA group vs&#xD;
      placebo group and to study the increase in MAMA and USG muscle thickness after 6 months of&#xD;
      BCAA therapy.&#xD;

      Study Design: Single centre randomized double blinded placebo Control Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess increase in Mid-arm muscle area (MAMA) after 12 weeks of BCAA therapy in children&#xD;
      with CLD and sarcopenia (MAMA &lt;2 SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of Sarcopenia defined by MAMA &lt;2SD for age in children with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of sarcopenia based on USG muscle size (biceps and quadriceps) in children&#xD;
           with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follistatin levels in children with CLD with and without sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in mTOR gene expression levelsafter 7 days of BCAA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in creatinine-height index after 12 weeks of BCAA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in MAMA (muscle size) after 6 months of BCAA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in muscle size (biceps and quadriceps) using ultrasound at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of significant events including HE, UGI bleed, SBP, AKI, new onset or&#xD;
           increase in ascites, hospital stay and mortality in the BCAA group versus placebo at 3&#xD;
           and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Albumin requirement over 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with cirrhosis with Sarcopenia (6 mo - 12 years) fulfilling the conditions as per&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline parameters that will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters: Jaundice, Organomegaly, HE(overt and minimal), ascites, SBP, cholangitis&#xD;
      , upper GI bleed, AKI Laboratory parameters: Complete blood count, LFT, KFT, PT-INR, ammonia,&#xD;
      mTOR gene expression, serum follistatinlevel, 24hr urine creatinine Imaging parameters:&#xD;
      Splenic size on USG, Splenic Z-score, PV diameter, USG muscle - biceps and quadriceps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight for age Height for age Triceps skin fold thickness Subscapular skin fold thickness Mid&#xD;
      arm circumference MAMC calculated as MUAC-(TSF*3.14) MAMA calculated as&#xD;
      (MUAC-(〖3.14*TSF)〗^2)/(4*3.14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of Sarcopenia cut-off:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cut-off for sarcopenia will be defined as Mid Arm Muscle area less than 2 SD based on MAMA&#xD;
      centiles of normal healthy American children as studied by Addo OY et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology for USG for muscle thickness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scans, both baseline and at follow-up, will be done in the same setting with the&#xD;
      participant in supine lying position with the knee fully extended, hip in a neutral position&#xD;
      and ankles relaxed in a slight plantar flexion for the lower limb and arm fully extended for&#xD;
      the upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Site of measurement Definition of muscle thickness Biceps brachii Two third of&#xD;
      distance from acromion to antecubital crease Distance between humerus and ventral fascia of&#xD;
      biceps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps One half of distance between ASIS and superior aspect of patella Distance between&#xD;
      femur and ventral fascia of rectus femoris&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site of measurement will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scanning site will be marked with a skin-marking pen. The transducer will be coated with&#xD;
      a generous amount of ultrasound water-based transmission gel and placed perpendicular to the&#xD;
      skin applying the lightest contact pressure to ensure that underlying tissues are not&#xD;
      compressed. Scanner parameters will remain the same for all measurements, ensuring uniformity&#xD;
      to the baseline measurements procedure. Three consecutive readings will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cut-off for normal muscle thickness will be taken from the following formula provided by&#xD;
      Scholten RR et al:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal biceps brachii muscle thickness (in cm) = 0.77+0.028*weight (SD 0.16) Normal&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle thickness (in cm) = 1.63+0.042* weight( SD 0.34) To look for inter-observer&#xD;
      variation in assessing muscle size on Ultrasound, this will be done by 2 persons for around&#xD;
      50% of observations in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongwith routine investigations including Complete Blood counts, Liver function and Renal&#xD;
      function test, PT-INR, serum Ammonia, the following investigations will also be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum follistatin levels at baseline: This will be done with kit-based ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mTOR gene expression at baseline and at Day 7: 1 ml blood will be drawn in EDTA vial. The&#xD;
      total RNA will be isolated by Trozol RNA isolation protocol. Further these isolated RNAs will&#xD;
      be reverse transcribed by CDNA kit. Following this, Real time PCR will be performed in the&#xD;
      presence of SYBER Green fluorescent dye. Reverse primers of targeted genes of mTOR-pathway&#xD;
      includes p-mTOR (Ser2448), mTOR, p-Akt (Thr308), Akt, Nrf2, UCP-2 (C-terminal) p-AMPK (Thr172&#xD;
      or Ser485/491) and AMPK, p-p65. GAPDH, a housekeeping gene, will be used as a normalization&#xD;
      control. The thermal cycling conditions will be 10 min 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec&#xD;
      at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Each measurement will be performed in triplicate and relative gene&#xD;
      expression will be determined by the ∆CT method. The same process will be done in the blood&#xD;
      samples procured after 7 days of BCAA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatinine height index at baseline and at 12 weeks: This will be calculated as per the&#xD;
      following formula(24 hour urine creatine)/(Expected 24 hr urine creatinine for same sex&#xD;
      andheight)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following enrolment and those fulfilling inclusion criteria, patient will then be allocated&#xD;
      into BCAA or placebo group as per block randomization method and there will be&#xD;
      allocation-concealment with sealed 4 digit and coded envelopes. BCAA or placebo will be&#xD;
      supplemented for a period of 12 weeks. Patient will be followed up for a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
      At the end of 12 weeks, mid arm muscle circumference will be repeated. USG muscle thickness,&#xD;
      routine blood investigations, creatinine height index will also be repeated. mTOR gene&#xD;
      expression will be repeated at 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occurrence of clinical events including new onset ascites, AKI, hepatic encephalopathy, upper&#xD;
      GI bleed and overall hospital stay as well as mortality over 12 weeks and 6 months will be&#xD;
      noted in both groups during this period and treated as per standard of care. These events&#xD;
      will be defined as follows- Acute Kidney Injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per KDIGO guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increase in serum creatinine by more than 0.3mg/dl within 48 hours, OR Urine output less than&#xD;
      0.5ml/kg/hour for more than 6 hours, OR Increase in serum creatinine by more than 1.5 times&#xD;
      the baseline presumed/known to have occurred within prior 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic encephalopathy: as per Modified West-Haven's criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grades of ascites Grade 1- ascites only detected by ultrasound Grade 2 -moderate ascites&#xD;
      evident by distension of abdomen with shifting dullness Grade 3- gross/tense ascites with&#xD;
      marked abdominal distension&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size with justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational part: Assuming prevalence of sarcopenia in children with chronic liver disease&#xD;
      is 40%, with alpha of 5%, permissible error of 10%, we need to enroll 96 cases to estimate&#xD;
      the prevalence of sarcopenia in children with CLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional (RCT part): Assuming that baseline MAMC values in BCAA and control group are&#xD;
      same, after follow up of 3 months, the MAMC value in BCAA by a value of 4.6 cm (18% change,&#xD;
      30.5 vs 25.9 cm) (Ruiz-Margain A et al, Rev de Gastroenterol de Mexico 2018) with alpha -5%&#xD;
      and power of 90%, we need to enroll total 40 cases. Assuming attrition rate of 10%, it was&#xD;
      decided to enroll 44 cases randomly allocated into 2 groups by block randomisation method&#xD;
      with block size of 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branch chain amino acid at a dose of approxiametely 0.35g/kg will be supplemented in two&#xD;
      divided doses group for a period of 12 weeks.For the sake of administration, it will be&#xD;
      prescribed as per the following weight band categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;5kg 2 gm 5-10kg 4 gm 10-20kg 8 gm 20-40kg 12 gm 40-60kg 24 gm Placebo will have the similar&#xD;
      colour, taste and consistency. Both groups will be given the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be advised a calorie intake of 150cal/kg/day and protein intake of&#xD;
      2-2.5gm/kg/day, and this will be ensured in regular follow-up as a standard care of practice&#xD;
      developed by the department of Pediatric Hepatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a period of at least 6 months. Occurrence of clinical events&#xD;
      including new onset ascites, AKI, hepatic encephalopathy, upper GI bleed, significant&#xD;
      infections will be noted in both groups during this period and treated as per standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 12 weeks, mid arm muscle circumference and other anthropometric parameters,&#xD;
      muscle thickness on ultrasonography, and creatinine height index will also be repeated. mTOR&#xD;
      gene expression will be repeated at the end of 7 days. Mid arm muscle circumference and other&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters, and muscle thickness on ultrasonography will again be repeated at&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis All the categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies, whereas&#xD;
      continuous ones will be expressed as mean or median ± SD. Chi-square test and student's&#xD;
      t-test (Fisher's exact test) will be applied for assessment of causality. Kaplan-Meyer&#xD;
      statistics will be done for survival and liver related morbidity. Significance will be&#xD;
      mentioned in the form of p-value &lt;0.05 and as Odd's ratio and 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no expected adverse effects of Branch chain amino acids as seen in previous&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interruption of supplementation for 15 consecutive days due to non-compliance or clinical&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression to exclusion criteria i.e. development of malignancy, AKI, potential liver&#xD;
      transplant within 1 month.&#xD;
