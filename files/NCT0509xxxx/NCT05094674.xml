  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor has developed a rapid screening tool intended to determine if the subject tested&#xD;
      is COVID-19-free (Negative to COVID-19).&#xD;

      Within this proposed project, the NHS will collect two diagnostic or screening tests per&#xD;
      participant. One sample will be used by NHS and be run through regular diagnostics. The&#xD;
      second, will be breath sample which will be tested using the BioSafety Technologies Ltd,&#xD;
      rapid screening tool. This will use a pre-defined protocol. These tests would then be&#xD;
      compared to assess the diagnostic efficacy including sensitivity and specificities. We will&#xD;
      be aiming to achieve a significant comparison to ensure certainty and to exploit the&#xD;
      information for proposing a novel diagnostic system to enhance capabilities to scale up the&#xD;
      testing of patients. The proposed activity involves clinical validation of BioSafety Testing,&#xD;
      to enhance the performance of detection along with clinicians.&#xD;
