  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have aimed to explore and interpret the neuropathic pain (NP) descriptors&#xD;
      of spinal pain in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). For this purpose they have&#xD;
      attempted to initiate a prospective, cross-sectional study with AS patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NP descriptors have been investigated in several pain syndromes such as post-herpetic&#xD;
      neuralgia, post-surgical nerve trauma, peripheral diabetic neuropathy and low back pain. But&#xD;
      there is no study examining descriptors of inflammatory spinal pain with or without&#xD;
      neuropathic characteristics seen in AS. To date, only one study reported distribution of&#xD;
      sensory descriptors in neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain (nonNP) in AS patients, but in&#xD;
      this paper the painful region was not specified and the results related to sensory&#xD;
      descriptors were not discussed. Therefore, investigators have aimed to explore and interpret&#xD;
      the sensory descriptors of inflammatory spinal pain in patients with AS. For this purpose&#xD;
      investigators have attempted to initiate a study investigating whether sensory descriptors in&#xD;
      neuropathic pain (NP) are differ from those seen in non-neuropathic pain (nonNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine NP descriptors that associated with spinal pain in ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the patients with and without NP with respect to sensory descriptors&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the relation between neuropathic pain (NP) descriptors and functional status&#xD;

    <description>It will be assessed using the painDETECT questionnaire. This questionnaire, contains nine questions all of which are selfreport. Seven items are rated on a six point Likert scale and thus are scored between 0-5. These seven questions query some sensations such as burning, tingling or prickling, allodynia, numbness etc. Apart from these seven items, one item assesses the radiation of pain and the other one item looks for the temporal characteristics of pain. A total score of 12 or less indicates neuropathic component is unlikely, 13-18 means possible neuropathic component and 19 or greater means a neuropathic component is likely. Beside these, there are three items in a separate section measuring severity of pain at the time of evaluation, on average and maximum over the past month. This section is not taken into account in scoring.</description>

    <description>In the painDETECT questionnaire, seven items querying sensory abnormalities are scored between 0-5. Each of these abnormal sensations represent a pain descriptor. These descriptors are; burning, tingling, allodynia, pain attacks, thermal hyperalgesia, numbness and pressure hyperalgesia. A descriptor will accepted as positive if it is scored between 3 to 5</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>Once, at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To measure functional status of patients, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index will be used. It is a 10 item questionnaire querying patients' ability in performing daily activities (such as dressing, bending forward, climbing stairs, reaching a shelf, etc.) on a line of 10 centimeters. The final score is the average of the items, between 0 (no limitation) to 10 (maximal limitation in function).</description>
