    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the use of non-nutritive sucking vs&#xD;
      non-nutritive sucking combined with breast milk on neonatal comfort during diaper change in&#xD;
      preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newborns are faced with many painful interventions including tactile stimulation such as&#xD;
      diaper change, axillary temperature measurement, intraoral and endotracheal aspiration during&#xD;
      the postnatal period in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) at the beginning of their&#xD;
      lives. Painful interventions negatively affect the physiological parameters, comfort, sleep,&#xD;
      growth and hospital stay of newborns. As a result of these interventions, the stress level&#xD;
      increases in preterm infants. Increased stress level can cause long-term sequelae, risk of&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage, increased oxygen consumption and hypertension. In addition, the&#xD;
      increased stress experience may make the infant sensitive to pain and stress in other periods&#xD;
      of his life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled prospective study was planned to be conducted in the NICU of a&#xD;
      private hospital with branches in Istanbul until the whole sample group would be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the NICU, where the study will be conducted, preterm infants will be divided into two&#xD;
      groups as control and experimental groups. Non-nutritive sucking (NNS) combined with breast&#xD;
      milk will be used during diaper change for newborns in the experimental group, and only NNS&#xD;
      will be used in the control group. NNS will be given to both groups 5 minutes before diaper&#xD;
      change. The comfort level of the newborns will be measured with the Premature Infant Comfort&#xD;
      Scale before the NNS, 5 minutes after the NNS, during the procedure, immediately after the&#xD;
      procedure and 5 minutes after the procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Infant's comfort level is evaluated with Premature Infant Comfort Scale.Premature Infant Comfort Scale (PICS), which is a multidimensional scale used in evaluating comfort and pain behaviorally and psychologically. The lowest score obtained from the scale is 35, and the highest score is 7. A high score on the scale indicates a low level of comfort.</description>
