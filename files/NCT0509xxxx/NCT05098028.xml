    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in sickle cell disease&#xD;

      with sickle cell disease will be enrolled and randomized: 12 participants in each of four&#xD;
      active novel formulation rifaximin groups and 6 participants in each of 2 placebo groups.&#xD;
