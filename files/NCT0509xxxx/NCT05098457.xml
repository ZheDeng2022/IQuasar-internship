&#xD;
               -  Facial psoriasis, eczema, acne, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, herpes simplex or&#xD;
                  herpes zoster;&#xD;

             the baseline visit, or subjects susceptible to keloid formation, hyperpigmentation or&#xD;
             hypertrophic scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Presence of tattoo, piercing, beard or facial hair, which, in the Treating&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study injections and/or study&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of a dental, oral, or facial condition which, in the Treating Investigator's&#xD;

             dentures or any device covering all or part of the upper palate, and/or severe&#xD;
             malocclusion or dentofacial or maxillofacial deformities. Any planned procedure (e.g.&#xD;
             dental implants, tooth extractions, orthodontia) during the study period, that would&#xD;
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. An underlying known disease, a surgical or medical condition that would expose the&#xD;
             subject to undue risk, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis,&#xD;
             autoimmune disease, history of bleeding disorders, connective tissue diseases such as&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, or&#xD;
             scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Use of concomitant medication that have the potential to prolong bleeding times such&#xD;
             as anticoagulants or inhibitors of platelet aggregation (e.g. aspirin or other&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Omega 3 or Vitamin E), within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to injection. Omega 3 and Vitamin E are acceptable only as part of a standard&#xD;
             multivitamin formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulatory therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies, antiviral treatment for HIV or hepatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (inhaled corticosteroids are allowed) within 3&#xD;
             months prior to Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Use of topical facial corticosteroids or prescription retinoids near or on the area to&#xD;
             be treated within 1 month of the Baseline visit or systemic retinoid treatment within&#xD;
             6 months of the Baseline visit, or plan to receive such treatment during participation&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Presence of any condition or situation, which in the opinion of the Treating&#xD;
             Investigator makes the subject unable to complete the study per protocol, e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject is not likely to avoid other prohibited facial cosmetic treatments;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject is not likely to complete the study because of other commitments;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject is anticipated to be unavailable for visits, incapable of understanding&#xD;
                  the investigational assessments or having unrealistic expectations of treatment&#xD;
                  result;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subject who has a concomitant condition (e.g. acute viral or bacterial infection&#xD;
                  with fever) that might confuse or confound study treatments or assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject who plan to lose or has a medical condition that may cause them to lose a&#xD;
             significant amount of weight during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Study center personnel, close relatives of the study center personnel (e.g. parents,&#xD;
             children, siblings, or spouse), employees or close relatives of employees at the&#xD;
             Sponsor company.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Participation in any other interventional clinical study within 30 days before&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
