  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is intended to collect data using standard clinical tests and psychophysics to&#xD;
      quantify the effect of visual cortical damage on the structure of the residual visual system,&#xD;
      visual perception, spatial awareness, and brain function. The investigators will also assess&#xD;
      the effect of intensive visual retraining on the residual visual system, processing of visual&#xD;
      information and the use of such information in real-world situations following damage. This&#xD;
      research is intended to improve our understanding of the consequences of permanent visual&#xD;
      system damage in humans, of methods that can be used to reverse visual loss, and of brain&#xD;
      mechanisms by which visual recovery is achieved.&#xD;

    <measure>Direction Discrimination Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-months, 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject, the investigators will measure the change in ability to detect differences in the motion direction of visual stimuli relative to horizontal, measured in degrees of visual angle. These assessments will be based on what can be reliably detected at a 72-75% correct level of performance.&#xD;
These measures of change will be evaluated baseline and at each subsequent visit to the laboratory; minimally from baseline to 4-months, then baseline to 12-months from start of training.</description>

    <description>Assessment of visual perception transfer to untrained psychophysical tasks of contrast sensitivity for direction discrimination. This is a change metric as transfer must be compared from pre- to post- each course of training.&#xD;
For each subject, the investigators will measure the ability to correctly detect the motion direction of visual stimuli that are also varying in contrast against a grey background. We will measure the luminance contrast that can be reliably detected at a 72-75% correct level of performance.&#xD;

    <description>A computer software and chin-rest necessary to perform visual training will be loaned to each subject to be used at home. Subjects will perform one to two daily training sessions in their home, consisting of 200-300 trials each. The visual task performed repetitively will involve discriminating the direction of motion, the presence of motion, or the orientation of a visual stimulus (either a small cloud of dots or bars) located at a predetermined location in the blind field. The computer program will automatically create a record of patient performance during each home training session. Subjects will train daily (about 40-60 minutes total), 5 to 7 days per week for at least 3 and up to 12 months at a time.</description>
