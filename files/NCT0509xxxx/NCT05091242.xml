    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation is a clinical condition in which the child experiences a variety of&#xD;
      behavioural disturbances including crying, thrashing, and disorientation during early&#xD;
      awakening from anaesthesia. Emergence agitation is a common challenge in children with a&#xD;
      reported incidence of approximately 25% ranging from 10 to 80 %. Clonidine is often used&#xD;
      off-label in paediatric anaesthesia e.g. sedation in the intensive care unit, prevention of&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms after long-term sedation, as premedication before induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia or as treatment/prevention of emergence agitation. The study is designed as a&#xD;
      randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating efficacy and safety of a single dose&#xD;
      of intraoperative clonidine in children 3-12 months, including pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
