      This clinical trial studies the effect and underlying mechanisms of sleep and circadian&#xD;
      rhythm factors on oral mucositis pain in head and neck cancer patients treated by&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Poor sleep may have a correlation to increased pain. A behavioral&#xD;
      intervention, Brief Behavioral Therapy for Cancer related Insomnia, may improve patients'&#xD;
      sleep and may also reduce oral mucositis pain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effect and underlying mechanisms of sleep and circadian rhythm factors on&#xD;
      oral mucositis pain in head and neck cancer patients treated by chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To assess the impact of chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) on the onset and duration of sleep&#xD;
      disturbance in head and neck carcinoma (HNC) patients, and identify factors that trigger or&#xD;
      aggravate sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. To examine the effect of the association between sleep and CRT-induced oral mucositis&#xD;
      (OM) pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the pathways by which sleep disturbance may aggravate radiation-induced OM&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBSERVATIONAL STUDY: Patients wear actigraphy watch and complete sleep log at baseline (over&#xD;
      the weekend prior to first day of CRT), and weeks 1, 3, and 6 during treatment. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo collection of cheek cell samples and may undergo collection of blood samples at weeks&#xD;
      1, 3 and 6 during treatment. Patients' medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION STUDY: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients participate in BBT-CI over 60 minutes for 2 sessions and phone calls over 15&#xD;
      minutes once weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients meet with therapist over 60 minutes for 2 sessions and phone calls over 15&#xD;
      minutes once weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
