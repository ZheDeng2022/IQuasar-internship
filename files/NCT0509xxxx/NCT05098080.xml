    <intervention_model_description>At least three healthy subjects will be in each of the three dose cohorts (1,000 mg, 3,000 mg and 5,000 mg). For each dose cohort, three subjects will be administered HutrukinTM and the study will not proceed to the next dose level unless the tested dose level has been deemed to have acceptable tolerability and safety. Subjects will undergo blood sampling for toxicity and pK analysis. Subjects will also be evaluated for the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>HutrukinTM that binds the human cytokine IL-1α with high affinity and is an effective blocker of IL-1α biological activity. HutrukinTM is a True Human™ therapeutic antibody. That is, the antibody was generated by a natural human immune response and was cloned directly from a human peripheral B lymphocyte. No in vitro affinity maturation or modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity. A true human antibody should be effectively non-immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit optimal activity and pharmacokinetics indistinguishable from native IgG1 immunoglobulin.</description>
