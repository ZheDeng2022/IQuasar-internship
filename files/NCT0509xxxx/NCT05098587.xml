  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to explore the association of changes in pain perception with&#xD;
      changes in brain activity (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)) and metabolic&#xD;
      (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)) patterns of individuals with SCI and chronic NeP&#xD;
      after a Virtual Walk (VW) therapy. The brain activity patterns will be assessed in resting&#xD;
      state and under a specific task, before and after a VW training program, done as part of the&#xD;
      clinical routine, as well as at a four weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this pilot study will serve as basis for a bigger project that aims to&#xD;
      investigate and compare brain activity and long-term effects of non-immersive VW therapy on&#xD;
      chronic NeP in individuals with SCI (traumatic SCI with chronic NeP at- or below level,&#xD;
      complete or incomplete) taking into account confounding factors such as time since injury,&#xD;
      level of injury and type of NeP.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study consists of specific assessments at four different time points&#xD;
      (T0=screening, T1=baseline, pre measurement, T2=post measurement, T3=four week follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapeutical assessment at T0 involves the evaluation of the imagery capacity. At&#xD;
      T1, the participant will be assessed for baseline measures before starting with the VW&#xD;
      training. At T2 (after the last VW training) and at T3 (four weeks after the last VW&#xD;
      training), the participant will be assessed for outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (age, sex, education level, workability, age at&#xD;
      injury, lesion level, comorbidities, complications, concomitant injuries, SCI pain basic&#xD;
      dataset 2.0 and medication) will be collected in the screening/recruitment phase but only&#xD;
      used after receiving informed consent from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a non-invasively MRI examination without application of contrast&#xD;
      agents. The functional activity of the brain will be assessed by a blood oxygenation&#xD;
      level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI. The metabolic profile will be assessed non-invasively by means&#xD;
      of single voxel MRS. Prior to the fMRI and MRS measurements, a high-resolution anatomical MRI&#xD;
      will be performed, which serves for tissue segmentation and planning purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI will consist out of the following sequences conducted in an MRI scanner (six minutes&#xD;
      duration each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MRS sequence: The metabolic profile will be assessed with single voxel spectroscopy in&#xD;
           the Anterior Cingulate Cortex and the Thalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resting-state fMRI: The participant will stay rested with open eyes and does not have to&#xD;
           perform a specific task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Task-based fMRI: In an on-off scheme, a sequence of neutral (not pain related) pictures&#xD;
           on a screen, mounted outside of the MRI machine will be shown. The pictures will change&#xD;
           every 20 seconds in a random order to keep the participant alert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Task-based fMRI: In an on-off scheme, a sequence of pain-related pictures on a screen,&#xD;
           mounted outside of the MRI machine will be shown. The pictures will change every 20&#xD;
           seconds in a random order to keep the participant alert.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Resting-state fMRI: The participant will stay rested with open eyes and does not have to&#xD;
           execute a task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain images shown during the task-based fMRI are a validated set of pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive a pain diary. This pain diary is filled in daily for the&#xD;
      one-week period before the baseline assessments, during the VW therapy and in the week before&#xD;
      the last assessments at T3. To minimise the risk of missing data in the pain diary the&#xD;
      participants will be called one week before T3 and get reminded to fill in the pain diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting with the VW therapy the participants will first perform a subitem of the&#xD;
      standardised Graded Motor Imagery (GMI) training over four weeks, five times a day using the&#xD;
      Recognise Foot App and the Recognise Hand App. The participants will train their capacity to&#xD;
      perform a left-right discrimination for hands and feet. This training will help to improve&#xD;
      the therapeutic effect of the following VW therapy program, by improving the imagery&#xD;
      capacity. Reaction time as well as accuracy while performing a left-right discrimination task&#xD;
      will be measured. More than 80% correct answers and a reaction time of less than two seconds&#xD;
      is interpreted as good imagery capacity. The imagery capacity will be assessed right before&#xD;
      the start of the discrimination training, after two weeks and after four weeks. This serves&#xD;
      on one hand as information about participant characteristics and on the other hand as a&#xD;
      control mechanism that each participant keeps performing this training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the discrimination training, the participants will perform a non-immersive VW therapy&#xD;
      program at the pain clinic, which consists of five sessions of 10 to 20 minutes per week,&#xD;
      over a two-week period, then three treatments per week for the following two weeks and&#xD;
      finally in the last two weeks only two treatments per week are scheduled. This is the&#xD;
      standard protocol for this kind of therapy and is not changed in any way for the participants&#xD;
      of the MRI study. For the VW, the participants will sit on an electric wheelchair in front of&#xD;
      a canvas with an integrated camera. The camera films the participant's head and trunk, which&#xD;
      are then projected on the canvas, overlapping with the recording of the feet of an actor&#xD;
      walking. This way the participants will see themselves walk through a forest from a&#xD;
      third-person view. To improve the embodiment, the participants will be asked to swing their&#xD;
      arms in the rhythm of the gait and imagine that they are walking themselves through the&#xD;
      forest. In addition to this, the chair moves minimally in the frontal plane to imitate the&#xD;
      natural movements of the pelvis while walking.&#xD;
