    <textblock>
      This open, single-center, randomized phase II study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of&#xD;
      apatinib plus camrelizumab which is an anti-Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, versus apatinib in patients with metastatic gastric cancer refractory to two or&#xD;
      more lines of treatment, fully evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combined regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors with the highest mortality in the&#xD;
      world. Post-line treatment options for metastatic gastric cancer (mGC) are limited.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies targeting Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) and&#xD;
      small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown benefits on progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in second-line or third-line treatment of mGC.&#xD;
      Following a phase III randomized clinical trial, apatinib, an oral small-molecule drug&#xD;
      targeted with VEGFR-2, has been proved to significantly prolong patients' OS in the&#xD;
      third-line or later-line treatment of mGC, thus becoming the standard third-line or&#xD;
      later-line regimen for gastric cancer in China. In immunotherapy of mGC, pembrolizumab has&#xD;
      been approved for third-line treatment of programmed cell death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive&#xD;
      advanced gastric cancer, and nivolumab also become the standard third-line treatment regimen.&#xD;
      What is the best option for third-line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer remains&#xD;
      unclear. Analysis from the subgroup of the Attraction 2 study showed that patients who had&#xD;
      previously been treated with anti-VEGFR targeted drug ramucizumab had significantly higher&#xD;
      PFS and OS than those who had not. The REGONIVO study also showed that the anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      TKI regorafenib combined with nivolumab achieved a good objective response rate after the&#xD;
      failure of standard treatment in gastric cancer. Therefore, it is worth exploring whether&#xD;
      apatinib combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody could bring improvements in PFS and OS&#xD;
      while compared with apatinib monotherapy. This open, single-center, randomized phase II study&#xD;
      was to evaluate the clinical benefit of apatinib plus camrelizumab which is an anti-PD-1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody, versus apatinib in patients with metastatic gastric cancer refractory to&#xD;
      two or more lines of treatment, fully evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combined&#xD;
      regimen. A total of 102 patients were planned for enrollment in this study. This trial was&#xD;
      expected to start in March 2021, and the end of recruitment will be approximately on March&#xD;
      2024, and the end of follow-up will be approximately on October 2023. The control group would&#xD;
      take apatinib monotherapy regimen, with 500mg oral apatinib every day, and the experimental&#xD;
      group would take apatinib plus camrelizumab regimen, with 250 mg oral apatinib every day&#xD;
      continuously and 200mg intravenous camrelizumab every 14 days. Patients would be assessed&#xD;
      every 8 weeks and those patients with disease control would be received the treatment until&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity. The maximum treatment duration of&#xD;
      camrelizumab was 2 years.&#xD;
