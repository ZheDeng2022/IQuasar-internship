  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a family navigator training and an app (a&#xD;
      technology-based treatment support system) for low-resourced families of young children (aged&#xD;
      3-5) with autism. The hypothesis is that the navigator training and treatment support system&#xD;
      will help enable navigators to support families of young children with autism in accessing&#xD;
      needed services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine whether access to a family service&#xD;
      navigator/treatment support system improves outcomes among families of young children (aged&#xD;
      3-5) from low-resourced communities. Pilot work includes interviews and pre/post surveys.&#xD;
      Then, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted by randomly assigning families to&#xD;
      navigators/treatment support systems or the non-personalized comparison condition&#xD;
      (information, training, and referral services). Three-month, six-month, and nine-month&#xD;
      follow-up survey data will be collected. Each of the 20 navigators will support two families.&#xD;
      Intervention families will have access to the navigator and the treatment support system,&#xD;
      which includes a dashboard showing their child's service needs, resources, and a platform to&#xD;
      facilitate and document communication between navigators and families. The treatment support&#xD;
      system will also allow the navigator supervisor to ensure fidelity of the navigators' support&#xD;
      to the family. The statistician will randomize 55 families who meet the inclusionary criteria&#xD;
      to each condition--40 individuals will receive navigator/treatment support system&#xD;
      (intervention group) and 15 individuals will receive information, training, and referrals&#xD;
      (comparison group).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Later in the project, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted. 40 participants will be in the intervention group and 15 participants will be in the non-personalized comparison group (i.e., information, training, and referral). Families will complete pre/post measures related to: intervention targets (except the ability to facilitate knowledge), service delivery outcomes, adaptive and maladaptive behavior, and autism symptoms. Information will also be collected via the treatment support system; such information will include the type and frequency of communication between the navigator and the family. Individual interviews will be collected with the navigator supervisor and the 20 navigators to identify barriers to the navigator model for low-resourced families.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>Sharing of data generated by this project will be an important part of the proposed activities of this research and will be carried out in several ways. All research resources developed in this project will be made readily available to the scientific community for non-profit research purposes. The main mechanism for the transfer of information will take the form of peer-reviewed publications and presentations/posters at scientific conferences. Information is collected from participants upon enrollment will be generated to a Global Unique Identifier. Annual reports with de-identified information will be presented to National Institute of Mental Health annually and more often upon request. By the completion of the project, all data will be de-identified and relevant documentation to facilitate data sharing will be available.</ipd_description>
