    <textblock>
      A single dose study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oxycodone, when PF614 is solution&#xD;
      is administered alone and with nafamostat as an immediate-release (IR) solution and/or&#xD;
      extended-release (ER) capsule prototypes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label formulation development study for the&#xD;
      nafamostat formulation (IR solution and/or ER prototype capsules) and will have the option to&#xD;
      assess the effect of food on a selected formulation of healthy subjects. It is planned to&#xD;
      enroll 64 healthy subjects, with roughly equal number of males and an even number of females&#xD;
      with roughly equal number of males and females in each cohort if possible. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to regimen stratified by gender prior to first dose. In Cohort 1 and Cohort 6,&#xD;
      will consist of 8 subjects who will receive dosing on two occasions in a 2-period sequential&#xD;
      design. Cohorts 2 to 5 and Cohorts 7 to 10 will consist of 6 subjects in each cohort and they&#xD;
      will receive dosing on a single occasion only. Cohorts 2 to 5 and Cohorts 7 to 10 can be&#xD;
      dosed in parallel after Cohort 1 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1 and Cohort 6, subjects will receive the PF614 solution alone and concomitantly&#xD;
      with nafamostat. In addition, prior to and following each regimen in all periods, subjects&#xD;
      will receive blocking doses of the opiate antagonist naltrexone to reduce the opioid-related&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim reviews of the safety and PK data for oxycodone and PF614 to 48h post-dose will take&#xD;
      place after Cohorts 1 and 6, Cohorts 2 and 7, Cohorts 3 and 8 and Cohorts 4 and 9 to decide&#xD;
      upon the following: nafamostat formulation to dose in the subsequent period; After Cohorts 3&#xD;
      and 8 only: The prandial status (fed vs fasted) for Cohort 4 and Cohort 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended-release prototype capsule formulations will be selected from a 2-dimensional design&#xD;
      space describing formulation variables for release rate and dose; however the maximum&#xD;
      nafamostat dose to be administered with be 10 mg.&#xD;
