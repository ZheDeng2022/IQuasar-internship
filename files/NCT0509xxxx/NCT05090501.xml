  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercising in a nature setting has been credited with benefits for health and well-being,&#xD;
      more so than exercising in indoor environments. Additionally, performance in the same&#xD;
      exercise (e.g., running speed, more strenuous physical activity) has been reported in some&#xD;
      studies to be better if practiced in an outdoor natural environment. The explanation may be&#xD;
      in the inherent variability of natural landscapes, the textures, elevations, obstacles and&#xD;
      objects which are not found in standard built and indoor settings. Indoor settings are&#xD;
      characterized by safe, organized, patterned textures and objects created for specific ends,&#xD;
      which inhibits variability in physical and physiological behavior. Variability in the&#xD;
      environment turns into variability in body systems, which benefits health, well-being, and&#xD;
      skill acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is essentially a journey&#xD;
      throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles, puddles, and other runners is&#xD;
      part of the variability of the activity. However, HICT is done in a small area, and is a&#xD;
      scripted, prescribed activity, lowering the amount of variability in behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
      push-ups, sit-ups). The aim of this trial is to test if a low variability activity shows&#xD;
      differences in performance, wellbeing, and behavior measures according to the amount of&#xD;
      variability in the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial the participants will engage in two high intensity circuit training (HICT)&#xD;
      interventions - one in an indoor setting, and another in a nature setting. The HICT&#xD;
      intervention includes 12 calisthenic exercises, and will be performed at a self-selected&#xD;
      intensity by the participants. Each exercise will be performed during one minute, followed by&#xD;
      30 seconds of rest where the participants will be instructed what the next exercise will be.&#xD;
      Before exercising, the participants put a heart rate monitor and two inertial measurement&#xD;
      units (IMUs) on the right arm and leg, according to the correct usage guidelines, and rate&#xD;
      their positive affect, arousal, and perceived exertion. Immediately after exercising, they&#xD;
      rate the same measures again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Greater movement variability, heart rate variability, performance, wellbeing, and arousal&#xD;
      during HICT in nature setting than indoor setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Nature environments are &quot;any outdoor spaces that retain noticeable elements of&#xD;
      nature, ranging from pristine or seminatural areas to urban green or blue spaces, including&#xD;
      green infrastructure&quot;. Exercising in nature settings has been shown to improve well-being&#xD;
      outcomes such as lower anxiety and greater positive mood, more so than exercising in&#xD;
      artificial environments like urban spaces or indoors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decades, the well-being benefits of nature-based exercise have been extensively&#xD;
      reported in the literature, but exercise and sport performance have not been studied as much,&#xD;
      in spite of some studies showing that performance may be better in natural settings than&#xD;
      indoor conventional settings (e.g., dancing more vigorously, more power in cycling, ability&#xD;
      to run more distance until exhaustion). This raises the question of how nature may impact&#xD;
      performance efficacy (the product of performance, i.e., running faster) and efficiency (the&#xD;
      psychological and physiological processes that may enhance performance efficacy) in exercise&#xD;
      and sport activities, especially since many studies show, for example, that achieving the&#xD;
      same goal in nature is less effortful than doing the same activity indoors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between the exercise factor and the environment factor for potential health&#xD;
      and performance benefits can be seen as sub-additive (less than total independent benefits of&#xD;
      both exposures), additive (equal to the sum of the parts), and synergistic (greater than the&#xD;
      sum of the parts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms: The mechanism by which physical activity in nature environments induces greater&#xD;
      health and may enhance performance is not yet fully understood. Historically, the exercise&#xD;
      and sport communities have created &quot;proper&quot; spaces to undertake their physical activities,&#xD;
      such as gyms, stadiums, tracks. However, these standardized and artificial spaces are&#xD;
      believed to offer limited variability in action. The ecological dynamics perspective views&#xD;
      nature settings as a more varied and challenging landscape of affordances (possibilities for&#xD;
      action) than that of built environments. Variability in the environment turns into&#xD;
      variability in body systems, allowing for degenerate behavior (changing movement structure&#xD;
      without compromising functionality). Assuming that the nature environment presents a richer&#xD;
      and more variable landscape of affordances to exercisers has given birth to a theory within&#xD;
      the ecological dynamics framework, labelled EVA, or the Empowering Variability of Affordances&#xD;
      of Nature. To this end, EVA assumes that the uneven surfaces, objects and obstacles of nature&#xD;
      settings such as grassland and trees allow for more variable athletic behavior, which has&#xD;
      been deemed beneficial for exercise and sport performance. It must not be a coincidence that&#xD;
      activities mostly practiced in natural environments such as extreme sports, are notorious for&#xD;
      their demand for adaptability and creativity, and for promoting health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, for exercisers, the nature environment is known to elicit&#xD;
      dissociative/exteroceptive attentive focus (i.e., focus on the environment), while the&#xD;
      built/indoor environment elicits associative attentive focus (i.e., focus on the task&#xD;
      itself). An associative cognitive process (focus on the task) is known to cause lower&#xD;
      affective responses and greater exertion during exercise, particularly in high intensity&#xD;
      physical activities. In short, exercising in nature may improve wellbeing and athletic&#xD;
      performance due to inherent variability in action, and by eliciting exteroceptive attentive&#xD;
      focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a trial: Variability in behavior depends also on the task. Running or walking is&#xD;
      essentially a journey throughout the environment in which interaction with obstacles,&#xD;
      puddles, and other runners is part of the variability of the activity. However, HICT is done&#xD;
      in a small area, and is a scripted, prescribed activity, lowering the amount of variability&#xD;
      in behavior (e.g., push-ups, sit-ups). Thus, the aim of this study is to test if a closed&#xD;
      circuit, scripted, anaerobic exercise (HICT) shows differences in movement variability,&#xD;
      performance, and wellbeing, depending on the exercise environment (nature vs. indoor), in&#xD;
      healthy, fit adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization session: Each participant goes individually to the Sport Expertise Laboratory&#xD;
      (Spertlab) in Faculdade de Motricidade Humana and delivers the Informed Consent. The&#xD;
      investigator then places the chest band (Polar H10) on the participant according to the&#xD;
      correct usage guidelines, for familiarization purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant is then shown and instructed on the Greenness Rating Scale and International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (baseline questionnaires), followed by the Feeling Scale,&#xD;
      Felt Arousal Scale, and Rating of Perceived Exertion (pre- and post-exercise measurement&#xD;
      scales). Then the investigator demonstrates all the exercises planned for the exercise&#xD;
      sessions, explaining to the participant the correct way to perform each one. The&#xD;
      investigators remind that the participant should not exercise for 24 hours before the&#xD;
      exercise sessions, and schedule two exercise sessions 48 hours apart (to prevent carry-over&#xD;
      effects) in the following two weeks. Finally, the investigators collect the chest band and&#xD;
      inform the participants that they must avoid ingesting caffeine, alcohol, and practicing high&#xD;
      intensity physical activity in the 24 hours prior to the intervention sessions, and avoid&#xD;
      ingesting food and liquids (except water) in the 3 hours prior to the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of the Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs): Two IMUs are placed at the midpoint&#xD;
      between the lateral epicondyle and the greater tubercle of the humerus, and between the&#xD;
      lateral epicondyle and the greater trochanter of the femur, both on the right side. The upper&#xD;
      (UL) and lower limbs (LL) are the body segments with greater activity during these&#xD;
      calisthenic exercises; additionally, the proximal segment of the limbs is biarticular and&#xD;
      does not run the risk of being fixed to the ground, as is the case of the hands/forearms&#xD;
      during push-ups, and the feet/legs during squats, which would reduce the range of motion, and&#xD;
      consequently have lesser detectable acceleration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: As the exercise session approaches, the investigators get in touch to remind&#xD;
      the participants about the session, to bring comfortable clothes (sports equipment). On the&#xD;
      appointed day and time, the investigators and the participants meet at Faculdade de&#xD;
      Motricidade Humana (FMH), and are escorted to the exercise site (Spertlab if indoor, Jamor&#xD;
      park if outdoor). The investigators place the IMUs and the chest band on the participants as&#xD;
      defined, deliver the Greenness Rating Scale, Feeling Scale, Felt Arousal Scale, and Rating of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion (available on a tablet or paper support) and inform participants that they&#xD;
      can exercise at whatever pace they wish. The exercise session is made of 12 calisthenic&#xD;
      exercises and is 20 minutes long (60 seconds active and 30 seconds resting per exercise),&#xD;
      including warm-up and cool-down. The exercise session intervention will be conducted by a&#xD;
      certified fitness instructor who will not know the objectives of the study (blinding).&#xD;
      Exercise times will be controlled by the instructor, who will remind and if needed&#xD;
      demonstrate to the participants what the next exercise is during the rest periods.&#xD;
      Immediately after performing the exercises, before cool-down, participants complete the&#xD;
      Rating of Perceived Exertion, and after returning to calm, they complete the remaining&#xD;
      post-exercise questionnaires, and the investigators collect the chest bands and IMUs. After&#xD;
      the session, the investigators accompany the participants again to FMH, confirm the next&#xD;
      session in a minimum of 48 hours, and answer any queries. Participants who performed the&#xD;
      indoor session will do the next session outdoors, and vice versa.&#xD;

    <description>Engagement in physical activity is a time-series measure collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The gyroscope of the IMU is capable to measure the angular velocity (degrees/second, 142 Hz) of the body it is attached to, thus expressing a measure of physical activity. The greater the angular velocity, the greater the engagement in physical activity.</description>

    <description>All exercises in the intervention have cyclical concentric and eccentric phases, which will be apparent in the IMU (gyroscope) time-series. When angular velocity in any axis (x,y,z) becomes zero, and direction changes in the opposite way, it is possible to count repetitions in the specific exercise. Alternatively, the investigators will count and register the number of repetitions by notation. The final value per exercise will be a measure of the performance of the individual in that specific exercise.</description>

    <description>Feeling Scale (FS): Affective responses to exercise will be collected with the Feeling Scale (Hardy &amp; Rejeski, 1989). The scale allows the measurement of mood fluctuations during exercise through a single item &quot;How are you feeling now&quot;, in which subjects respond on a scale from -5 (&quot;very bad&quot;) to +5 &quot;very good&quot;, 0 being &quot;neutral&quot;. The scale shows high reliability and validity (Emanuel et al., 2021).The scale was built to assess affective states during exercise and has been widely used in comparative studies of exercise environments.</description>
