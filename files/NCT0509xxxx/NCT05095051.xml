  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the safety and tolerability of limb cryocompression in&#xD;
      preventing of Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy via a newly developed limb&#xD;
      cryocompression device in healthy subjects and cancer patients. The limb cryocompression&#xD;
      device will be tested for its safety in delivering limb cryocompression and efficacy in&#xD;
      improving the preservation of peripheral nerves during chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two parts. The first part of the study will consist of up to 18 healthy&#xD;
      subjects to assess safety and tolerability of the new limb cryocompression device. The&#xD;
      occurrence or lack of core hypothermia will be studied. The second part of the study will&#xD;
      consist of 15 cancer patients recruited from the National University Hospital. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo cryocompression over multiple cycles of chemotherapy to establish safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of repeated therapy. Cryocompression of the limbs will be administered using&#xD;
      cooling wraps attached to a cooling device. The limbs will be cooled from the digits to the&#xD;
      elbow/knee.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Healthy subjects will undergo cryocompression of the various temperature and pressure levels in the cryocompression device. One temperature will be tested on 3 subjects for 3 hours. Tolerability of the temperature will be determined through a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Should 1 out of 3 subjects display intolerance to the temperature level, 3 more healthy subjects will be tested to ensure consistency.&#xD;
Cancer patient limb cryocompression sessions will comprise of a pre-cooling period, continued with paclitaxel infusion and a post-cooling period. Overall, hypothermia will be administered for no longer than four hours.&#xD;
Each patient will undergo maximum limb cooling. The initial device settings for the first cycle for each patient will be based on the optimal temperature determined to be safe and tolerable in healthy subjects. Safety and tolerance of the concomitant cryocompression will be measured using VAS.</intervention_model_description>

The cryocompression device used in this study consists of a control unit, and limb wraps. The control unit contains the coolant reservoir and pump to circulate the coolant and air for compression. It is able to thermoregulate (control the temperature of the circulating coolant) and offer cyclic air pressure in the wraps. The wraps cover the limbs from the elbow/knee to the fingers/toes.</description>
