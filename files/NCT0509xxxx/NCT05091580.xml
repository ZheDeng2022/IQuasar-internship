  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation trial will increase understanding of the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrating a brief evidence-based treatment for&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD) within the tuberculosis (TB) care platform to improve TB and&#xD;
      MDD. Findings from this R01 are likely to inform policy and treatment guidelines for the&#xD;
      integrated management of TB and MDD in low- and middle-income countries globally.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TB and major depressive disorder (MDD) are the leading infectious cause of death and the&#xD;
      leading cause of disability, respectively. Furthermore, they are commonly co-occurring and&#xD;
      negatively synergistic. TB and MDD comorbidity is associated with a 2.85 greater chance of&#xD;
      death and 8.70 higher risk for loss to follow up (LTFU) from treatment, which has a cascade&#xD;
      of negative individual-, community-, societal-, and health system-level implications. As a&#xD;
      treatable condition, MDD is a remediable driver of the TB epidemic. The WHO has called for a&#xD;
      global policy framework for TB and mental health integration, recommending brief&#xD;
      psychological interventions to address mental disorders in primary care settings.&#xD;
      Interpersonal counseling (IPC) is a brief version of one such evidence-based intervention&#xD;
      that has demonstrated efficacy and effectiveness in treating MDD when delivered by non-mental&#xD;
      health specialists, including in South Africa. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrating IPC (for MDD) into the TB care platform&#xD;
      to improve TB and MDD outcomes, as well as mitigate TB-related catastrophic costs. As the&#xD;
      country with the highest TB burden in the world, nearly 60% of whom are co-infected with HIV,&#xD;
      South Africa is the ideal setting for this study. This 3-year hybrid type I&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial will be implemented in eight clinics (n~1410 individuals&#xD;
      with TB/MDD) in the Eastern Cape of South Africa to integrate IPC to treat MDD comorbidity&#xD;
      within the TB care platform with the following aims: Aim 1) To evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation outcomes of integrating IPC treatment for MDD into the existing TB care&#xD;
      platform to improve TB and MDD outcomes; Aim 2) To determine the influence of theoretically&#xD;
      based intervention mediators and moderators on TB treatment outcomes; Aim 3) To assess the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of integrating MDD treatment into the TB care platform from the patient&#xD;
      and health system perspectives. This research will provide critical clinical, programmatic,&#xD;
      and economic data to inform the WHO global policy framework for TB and mental health&#xD;
      integration, and cost-effective clinical practice to improve TB outcomes, especially in&#xD;
      low-resource settings.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>

    <description>Patient level TB treatment success (yes/no) will be extracted from clinic records and defined based on the South African National TB Control Guidelines as all smear-positive patients that were cured (negative smear in last month of treatment) and those that completed treatment but did not meet the criteria for cure or failure.&#xD;
Alternative outcomes include loss to follow up (a treatment interruption greater than 2 consecutive months), drug-resistant (documented resistance to one or more anti-TB medications), treatment failure (positive smear in the last month of treatment), death (mortality), or transferred out.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient level depression remission (yes/no) will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and defined as a score less than 10.</description>

    <description>New adult TB patients will be screened for depression and those with significant symptoms (PHQ-9 &gt; 15 and/or suicidal ideation) will be referred to the clinic nurse for evaluation and referral to specialized mental health care as needed. Routine screening for depression is not a standard practice for TB patients; therefore assessment and referral is considered &quot;enhanced&quot; treatment as usual. Individuals will be interviewed at baseline and treatment completion.</description>

    <description>Interpersonal Counseling is a brief (four sessions) psychological intervention that was developed to treat depression in primary care. In IPC, counselors provide psychoeducation about the connection of depressive symptoms to social triggers and support patients in leveraging social networks to address these stressors and reduce depressive symptoms. Since depressive symptoms are often a transient reaction to life stress (e.g. TB diagnosis), many individuals are able to achieve significant alleviation of symptoms in as few as four sessions. IPC focuses on reducing interpersonal conflict and improving social cohesion in families, which may have the advantage of strengthening the ability of families to support TB patients in completing treatment to achieve cure.</description>
