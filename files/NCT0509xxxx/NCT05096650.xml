      Photoaging is characterized by cellular changes and alterations in dermal extracellular&#xD;
      matrix proteins with degeneration of connective tissue caused by intrinsic and extrinsic&#xD;
      factors. The clinical manifestations of photoaging included wrinkles, pigmented changes,&#xD;
      tissue loss, and sagging. Autologous platelet-rich plasma is a preparation of platelets in&#xD;
      concentrated plasma from peripheral blood. The α granules of platelets contained many growth&#xD;
      factors. According to previous literature, growth factors in platelet-rich plasma directly&#xD;
      stimulate fibroblast proliferation to boost collagen production. It has also been shown to&#xD;
      modulate extracellular matrix metabolism and remodeling by increasing the expression of&#xD;
      specific matrix metalloproteinases. In review of previous literatures, there was only limited&#xD;
      researches of platelet-rich plasma for treatment of photoaging. Therefore, the present study&#xD;
      was conducted for analyzing the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich plasma in&#xD;
      photoaging therapy.&#xD;

      Autologous platelet-rich plasma is a preparation of platelets in concentrated plasma from&#xD;
      peripheral blood. The α granules of platelets contained many growth factors, such as&#xD;
      platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor, vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor, and epithelial growth factor. These growth factors can trigger intracellular&#xD;
      signaling cascades that ultimately alter gene expression and protein synthesis. Clinically,&#xD;
      autologous platelet-rich plasma has been applied for treatment of hair loss, chronic wounds,&#xD;
      and atrophic scars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photoaging is characterized by cellular changes and alterations in dermal extracellular&#xD;
      matrix proteins with degeneration of connective tissue caused by intrinsic and extrinsic&#xD;
      factors. The clinical manifestations of photoaging included wrinkles, pigmented changes,&#xD;
      tissue loss, and sagging. The therapeutic modalities of photoaging included energy-based&#xD;
      device, filler injection, and surgical treatment. However, there are some limitations and&#xD;
      drawbacks of these therapies. For example, filler injection may cause foreign body granuloma,&#xD;
      vascular occlusions, or tissue necrosis. Surgical treatment is an invasive procedure which&#xD;
      may cause hematoma, infection, or scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous literature, growth factors in platelet-rich plasma directly stimulate&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation to boost collagen production. It has also been shown to modulate&#xD;
      extracellular matrix metabolism and remodeling by increasing the expression of specific&#xD;
      matrix metalloproteinases. Platelet-rich plasma-enhanced expression of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases -1 and -3 helps clear photodamaged extracellular matrix components and&#xD;
      allow for a better quality, more organized collagen meshwork. This process helps soften fine&#xD;
      lines and minimize scarring. In addition, transforming growth factor and epithelial growth&#xD;
      factor in platelet-rich plasma are known to modulate keratinocyte propagation and migration&#xD;
      as well as repair barrier function. In review of previous literatures, there was only limited&#xD;
      researches of platelet-rich plasma for treatment of photoaging. Therefore, the present study&#xD;
      was conducted for analyzing the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich plasma in&#xD;
      photoaging therapy.&#xD;
