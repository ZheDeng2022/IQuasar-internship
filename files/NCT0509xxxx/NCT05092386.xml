      This study is an open-label combined randomized double-blind, positive control phase Ⅰ&#xD;
      clinical trial in subjects aged 2 months (minimum 6 weeks) and above. The experimental&#xD;
      vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd. .And one of the positive&#xD;
      control vaccine was manufactured by WALVAX Biotechnology Co., Ltd( WALVAX PCV13) ,the other&#xD;
      manufactured by Pfizer(Pfizer PCV13).A total of 310 subjects including 20 adults aged 18-49&#xD;
      years,20 adolescents and children aged 6~7 years ,60 children aged 2-5 years,60 infants aged&#xD;
      12~23 months,60 infants aged 7 ~11 months,60 infants aged 2 months (minimum 6 weeks), and 30&#xD;
      infants aged 3 months will be enrolled.Subjects will be assigned to receive one dose , two&#xD;
      doses ,three doses or four doses of experimental vaccine or different positive control&#xD;
      vaccines . Subjects aged 18-49 years will receive one dose of experimental vaccine.Subjects&#xD;
      aged 6~17 years will receive one dose of experimental vaccine.Subjects aged 2~5 years will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups in a ratio of 1:1,and each group will receive one dose of&#xD;
      experimental vaccine or control vaccine(WALVAX PCV13）.Subjects aged 7 ~ 11 months and&#xD;
      subjects aged 12 ~23 months will be randomly divided into two groups in a 1:1 ratio,the&#xD;
      subjects aged 12 ~ 23 months will receive two doses of experimental vaccine or control&#xD;
      vaccine on the schedule of month 0,2 .Subjects aged 7 ~11 months will receive 3 doses of&#xD;
      experimental vaccine or control vaccine (WALVAX PCV13）on the immunization schedule of month&#xD;
      0,2,4.Subjects aged 3 months will receive 4 doses of experimental vaccine.Subjects aged 2&#xD;
      months will be randomly divided into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio and each group will receive 4&#xD;
      doses of experimental vaccine or control vaccine (Pfizer PCV13).&#xD;
