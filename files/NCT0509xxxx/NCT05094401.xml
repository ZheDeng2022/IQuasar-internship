  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BT-001 is a software program intended to help patients with type 2 diabetes, under the&#xD;
      guidance of their physician, improve glycemic control (i.e., levels of blood sugar). The&#xD;
      BT-001 software delivers a type of behavioral therapy to patients via a mobile application&#xD;
      that targets behaviors related to achieving glycemic control. The effectiveness of BT-001&#xD;
      will be measured by its ability to help patients reduce Hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c (a marker in&#xD;
      the blood that measures blood sugar) in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will utilize an open-label, pragmatic design to confirm and characterize the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of BT-001 used in addition to standard of care (SOC) in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The screening period will consist of review of Electronic Health Record (EHR) for&#xD;
      participants that meet inclusion criteria and telephonic outreach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once confirmed consented, patients will then be given access to BT-001 for 90 days with an&#xD;
      opportunity to continue using the product for an additional 275 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue their standard of care with their provider in addition to using&#xD;
      BT-001.&#xD;
