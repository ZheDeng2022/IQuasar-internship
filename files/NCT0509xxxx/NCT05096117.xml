    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of ASP8062, 25 mg once a day&#xD;
      and matched placebo, on alcohol cue-elicited alcohol craving during a human laboratory&#xD;
      paradigm after 2 weeks of daily dosing among subjects with moderate to severe alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) as confirmed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -&#xD;
      Fifth Edition (DSM-5™). Secondary objectives include evaluation of ASP8062, 25 mg once a day,&#xD;
      and matched placebo on reduction of alcohol consumption, alcohol craving, cigarette smoking&#xD;
      (among smokers) and nicotine use (among nicotine users), mood, sleep, alcohol use negative&#xD;
      consequences, study retention, and safety and tolerability throughout the last 4 weeks of the&#xD;
      treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
