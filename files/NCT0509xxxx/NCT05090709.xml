  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to measure the effect of a spinal mobilisation intervention on&#xD;
      para-spinal muscle tissue quality, functional balance measures, pain and fatigue in people&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis. The mobilisation intervention group will be compared to a general&#xD;
      massage group to analyse the difference between the specificities of the intervention&#xD;
      compared to general manual touch. Participants will be randomly allocated to a group&#xD;
      condition for a between-subject, repeated measures study. The study hypothesises a decrease&#xD;
      in lumbar stiffness, body sway, pain and fatigue post the intervention compared to the&#xD;
      general massage group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long term management of multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms may often involve manual&#xD;
      therapeutics due to observed improvements in muscle stiffness, pain, fatigue and balance.&#xD;
      Though these improvements are often anecdotal without objective measurement and without&#xD;
      analysis of the manual therapeutic. This is partly due to the vast array of manual&#xD;
      therapeutics available as well as the many possible influencing factors contributing to these&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to measure and analyse the cumulative effect of a spinal&#xD;
      mobilisation intervention on muscle tissue quality, functional balance, pain and fatigue in&#xD;
      people with MS. The intervention will be analysed at a specific rate, pressure and location&#xD;
      and compared to a general manual touch session with no specificities on rate, pressure or&#xD;
      location. Both therapy sessions will be 30 minutes long. The force of both therapy sessions&#xD;
      will be recorded in real time by monitoring the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) profile&#xD;
      using 2 Kistler force plates placed underneath the treatment plinth. A 0 force will be&#xD;
      generated once each participant is lying supine and still on the plinth and recordings will&#xD;
      be taken in 30 second samples during the treatment sessions. The summation of the vertical&#xD;
      GRFs will be graphed and monitored to check consistency of the treatment force. The&#xD;
      mobilisation intervention will be given at a rate of 0.37Hz (22 beats per minute) maintained&#xD;
      by a metronome on silent within view of the therapist, the pressure will be maintained at a&#xD;
      pressure grade of less than 1 (equal to a threshold of 80N), and maintained consistent&#xD;
      physical contact on paraspinal region within L1-L5. The general massage will be applied on&#xD;
      the mid-lower back, with no specificities or consistencies; physical contact, rate and force&#xD;
      magnitude will not be kept constant. This will be tested on 20 participants with MS who are&#xD;
      randomly allocated to a group condition for a between-subject, repeated measures study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to either an intervention or general massage group&#xD;
      for which they will attend 4 separate therapy sessions. During the 1st session, the&#xD;
      participants will carry out tests for lumbar muscle response, measured stiffness, tone and&#xD;
      elasticity (using MyotonPro), functional balance measures in a single-leg balance and&#xD;
      sit-to-stand tests (using Kistler force plates), self-reported pain and self-reported fatigue&#xD;
      for pre and post treatment sessions. During the subsequent 3 sessions, the participants will&#xD;
      complete tests for the myometer, balance and pain post the treatment sessions, and the final&#xD;
      fatigue test will be completed after their last session. Participants will therefore complete&#xD;
      5 set of tests for the myometer, balance and pain and the fatigue test is completed pre and&#xD;
      post all therapy sessions due to the set-up of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an online questionnaire before their 1st to screen for eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and collect anthropometric details and information on their MS condition. This will&#xD;
      be analysed with the results into descriptive statistics and summarised into mean, range and&#xD;
      dispersion values. All dependent variables measured for muscle tissue response, functional&#xD;
      balance, pain and fatigue will be analysed in between-subject repeated measured ANOVA to&#xD;
      determine differences between the 2 treatment groups and between the different treatment time&#xD;
      points. Pearson correlations will be carried out on the myometer variables to compare the&#xD;
      baseline values to the level of change after their final session due to previously found&#xD;
      significant correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More participants were intended for recruitment in the study, a post-hoc power calculation&#xD;
      revealed a power of 0.9 with an alpha level at 0.05 with a range of large effect sizes in the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
