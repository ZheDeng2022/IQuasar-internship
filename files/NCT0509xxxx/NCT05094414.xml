  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a collective term referring to&#xD;
      disorders which is characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms, including bladder&#xD;
      pain/discomfort, frequent urination without evidence of bacterial infection. The etiology of&#xD;
      IC/BPS is still uncertain, and most current treatment for IC/BPS are only symptoms control.&#xD;
      Our previous study revealed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection presented in the IC/BPS&#xD;
      bladders and involved the pathogenesis. Hence, using anti-viral medication valacyclovir for&#xD;
      the patients with IC/BPS might have clinical efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We would like to conduct a prospective study to evaluate to therapeutic effect of oral&#xD;
      valacyclovir for the patients with IC/BPS. The diagnosis of IC/BPS was made through following&#xD;
      the clinical symptom index of the American Urological Association guideline. The IC/BPS&#xD;
      patients with concurrent urological diseases, such as neurogenic voiding dysfunction,&#xD;
      ketamine cystitis or acute bacterial cystitis in recent one month would be excluded. The&#xD;
      IC/BPS patients with possibility of pregnancy also would be rule out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, the enrolled patients would be investigated for urinary analysis and culture to&#xD;
      rule out current bacteriuria. The enrolled patients would receive a comprehensive medical&#xD;
      history review. A pregnancy test would be performed for women of childbearing potential. The&#xD;
      patients would be asked to provide urine sample to urinary virus investigation before the&#xD;
      treatment. The IC/BPS patients would be investigated for baseline clinical symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaire including VAS, QoL, ICPI, ICSI, and OSS. The parameters in the VUDS report also&#xD;
      would be record. The Informed consent would be obtained from all individual participants&#xD;
      before the intervention. Due to higher bioavailability, we would use valacyclovir in this&#xD;
      study. The dose of valacyclovir we use is according to previous valacyclovir study for&#xD;
      genital HSV infection. [18] According previous valacyclovir study for chronic recurrence&#xD;
      herpesvirus infection disease, long-term therapy of oral valacyclovir &lt; 1000mg/day should be&#xD;
      effective and safe; the safety profiles of valacyclovir and placebo were similar. All of our&#xD;
      patients would receive open-label oral valacyclovir 500 mg twice per day for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate to enroll 30 IC/BPS patients with evidence of EBV infection in bladder into this&#xD;
      study. After the beginning of valacyclovir therapy, the patients would receive a telephone&#xD;
      interview to evaluated current symptoms changes at first and second weeks. The overall&#xD;
      improvement of current therapy would be assessed with Global Response Assessment (GRA) (3:&#xD;
      symptoms free, 2: &gt;50% symptoms improvement, 1: 25-50% symptoms improvement, 0: 0-25%&#xD;
      symptoms improvement, -1: symptoms worse). The GRA, VAS, and any adverse effect would be&#xD;
      investigated in the telephone interview. After the full 4 weeks treatment, the patients would&#xD;
      be asked to back to our clinic. All symptoms questionnaire (GRA, VAS, QoL, ICPI, ICSI, and&#xD;
      OSS) and adverse effect would be evaluated again. The patients would be asked to provide&#xD;
      urine sample again. The primary endpoint of this study is the GRA at 4 weeks. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include the changes of VAS, VAS, QoL, ICPI, ICSI, and OSS between baseline and end&#xD;
      of the study. The following figure showed the study flow diagram.&#xD;
