    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy (including durability) of up&#xD;
      to 2 REACT injections given 3 months (+30 days) apart and delivered percutaneously into&#xD;
      biopsied and non-biopsied contralateral kidneys in participants with T2DM and CKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized multi-center, blinded intervention, two cohort, study whereby eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1, prior to kidney biopsy, to 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1&#xD;
      participants will undergo sham procedures and be followed for 24 months post-last sham REACT&#xD;
      injection. Cohort 2 participants will receive 2 REACT injections 3 months apart (+30 days)&#xD;
      and be followed for 24 months post-last REACT injection.&#xD;

             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The participant has a clinical diagnosis of T2DM in their health record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The participant has a clinical diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy as the underlying&#xD;
             cause of renal disease (diagnosis does not have to be confirmed via renal biopsy) in&#xD;
             their health record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The participant has a serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) less than 10% at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The participant has a documented clinical diagnosis of an eGFR greater than or equal&#xD;
             to 20 and less than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73m², not requiring renal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The participant has a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 30 and less than or equal to 5,000 mg/g.&#xD;

             and/or mean diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg at screening.&#xD;
             Participants with blood pressure outside of this range prior to biopsy and injection,&#xD;
             may continue if approved by the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
