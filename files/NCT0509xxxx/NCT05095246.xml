  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sponsor is developing KB407, a replication-defective, non-integrating herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus type 1 (HSV-1)-derived vector engineered to deliver functional full-length human Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) to the airways of people with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis via nebulization. This study is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      KB407 in people with cystic fibrosis. This study will enroll 4 participants into each of the&#xD;
      first two cohorts and will enroll five subjects into the last cohort. Cohort 1 will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of KB407 and be followed for 60 days. Subjects in Cohort 1 may rollover into&#xD;
      Cohort 2 at the Day 28 Visit. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will meet to determine&#xD;
      study progress from Cohort 2 into Cohort 3. In Cohort 2, subjects will be dosed bi-weekly at&#xD;
      Day 0 and Day 14. In Cohort 3 subjects will be dosed weekly at Day 0, Day 7, Day 14 and Day&#xD;
      21. All subjects will be followed for a year after the last dose of KB407.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The subject or legally appointed and authorized representative must have read,&#xD;
