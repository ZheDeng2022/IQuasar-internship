  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) uses light to influence the mitochondria of cells. PBMT of&#xD;
      the brain enhances the metabolic capacity of neurons and stimulates anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant responses, as well as neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Its&#xD;
      therapeutic role in disorders such as dementia and Parkinson's disease, as well as to treat&#xD;
      stroke, brain trauma, and depression has gained increasing interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BioFlex is a form of PBMT consisting of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes.&#xD;
      BioFlex utilizes red and near infrared light which penetrates tissues up to a certain tissue&#xD;
      depth and studies have shown stimulates tissue growth and repair at the cellular level. PBMT&#xD;
      has been proven useful for the treatment of soft tissue pain. Several studies have shown&#xD;
      benefit in using PBMT in the treatment of certain neurological conditions, including chronic,&#xD;
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this exploratory investigation, therefore, is to examine efficacy of BioFlex&#xD;
      laser therapy on measures of brain function in patients suffering from PCS after&#xD;
      mild-moderate, closed-head, traumatic brain injury cases.&#xD;
