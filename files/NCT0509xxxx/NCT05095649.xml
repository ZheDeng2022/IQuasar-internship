      Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy of donor regulatory enriched T cells in&#xD;
      steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease patients who did not obtain complete&#xD;
      remission under treatment with ruxolitinib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of 15 patients will be included to assess the efficacy of donor regulatory enriched&#xD;
      T cells in steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease patients who did not obtain&#xD;
      complete remission after 12 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses of Treg-enriched cells will be 2x10^6 cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival at 1 year after Treg infusion will be represented based on the clinical data with&#xD;
      Kaplan Meier curves.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Recipient of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have steroid-refractory cGVHD and had obtained a partial response&#xD;
             after at least 12 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib. Steroid-refractory cGVHD is&#xD;
             defined as having persistent signs and symptoms of cGVHD despite the use of prednisone&#xD;
             at ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks (or equivalent&#xD;
             dosing of alternate glucocorticoids) without complete resolution of signs and&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable dose of glucocorticoids for 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;

          -  No addition or subtraction of other immunosuppressive medications (e.g.,&#xD;
             calcineurin-inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate-mofetil) for 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. The dose of immunosuppressive medicines may be adjusted based on the&#xD;
             therapeutic range of that drug.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;

          -  History of active thrombotic microangiopathy, hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic&#xD;
             thrombocytopenic purpura in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New immunosuppressive medication in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;

          -  Extra-corporeal Photopheresis or rituximab therapy in the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-transplant exposure to T-cell or interleukin-2 targeted medication within 100&#xD;
             days prior to enrollment.&#xD;

          -  Active uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ transplant (allograft) recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with active uncontrolled hepatitis B or C are ineligible as they are at&#xD;
             high risk of lethal treatment-related hepatotoxicity after hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
             transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other investigational drugs within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, unless cleared by the&#xD;
