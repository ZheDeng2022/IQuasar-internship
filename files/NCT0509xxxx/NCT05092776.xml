  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of&#xD;
      investigational product RPH-104 (R-Pharm Overseas, Inc., USA) for treatment of Familial&#xD;
      Mediterranean Fever (FMF) in adult patients resistant/intolerant to colchicine (crFMF).&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of RPH-104 single or multiple doses in this&#xD;
      patient population will be assessed as well.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is supposed to enroll (randomize) 60 subjects with familial Mediterranean fever&#xD;
      (FMF) with colchicine inefficacy or intolerance. Given potential withdrawal at the screening,&#xD;
      the number of screened subjects (signed informed consent) will be approximately 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consists of three following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (up to 12 weeks); Throughout the screening the subjects will be&#xD;
           monitored to identify &quot;marker&quot; attacks and verify the subject eligibility. The subjects&#xD;
           having an attack during screening period and meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will&#xD;
           be enrolled into treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled treatment period (16 weeks);&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects enrolled will be randomized to one of the treatment groups in 1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test product group receiving RPH-104 at 80 mg as subcutaneous (s.c.) injections or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo group receiving the equivalent placebo dose also as s.c. injections every 2&#xD;
                weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further the efficacy assessments will be performed at Visit 2 (Day 7) then at Visit 3&#xD;
           (Day 14) and subsequently every 2 weeks: the subjects will be monitored for resolution&#xD;
           of &quot;marker&quot; attacks and development of new attacks based on which the decision on&#xD;
           further treatment approach will be made (dose escalation to 160 mg for the test product&#xD;
           group or switch from placebo to the study product RPH-104 80 mg for placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the results of efficacy assessment throughout the treatment period the subjects&#xD;
           may undergo blinded dose escalation or be switched from placebo to active therapy with&#xD;
           preserved randomization group: subjects may receive additional therapy with the study&#xD;
           product RPH-104 at 80 mg without the randomization group unblinding. Such blinded dose&#xD;
           escalation may only be made once for each subject throughout the whole treatment period&#xD;
           both in placebo group and in RPH-104 group. After the first dose escalation based on the&#xD;
           results of efficacy evaluation the subjects may undergo the second or unblinded dose&#xD;
           escalation. The second dose escalation is only allowed in the group of the subjects&#xD;
           receiving placebo + RPH-104 80 mg. Further dose escalation is forbidden for the subjects&#xD;
           receiving RPH-104 at 160 mg. These two dose escalation steps are possible within the&#xD;
           period from study Visit 2 to Visit 10 (Days 7-112) for all the subjects from placebo&#xD;
           group and the first step&#xD;
&#xD;
           - for the subjects receiving RPH-104 at 80 mg. After reaching the total dose of RPH-104&#xD;
           of 160 mg once in 2 weeks no dose escalation will be performed. Subjects already&#xD;
           receiving the maximum 160mg dose may continue therapy with RPH-104 at 160 mg only at the&#xD;
           investigator's discretion. No dose reduction is made throughout the study. In case of a&#xD;
           recurrent attack the subject should make a visit to the study center within 48 hours.&#xD;
           Maximum treatment period is 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects receiving both blinded and unblinded therapy will undergo regular evaluation of&#xD;
           efficacy and safety; the visits will be performed every 2 weeks for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up period (8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first follow-up visit the subjects with therapeutic response to RPH-104 will be&#xD;
      invited to proceed in an open-label long-term safety study of RPH-104. In case of lacking&#xD;
      relevant clinical response and if the subjects do not wish to participate in the open-label&#xD;
      study, they should complete all safety follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall expected study period is approximately 37 months.&#xD;
