      A Double-blind, Multi-Center, Prospective, Randomized Placebo-controlled Pilot Study&#xD;
      Evaluating Intra-articular Injection of Axolotl Ambient Compared to Saline in Subjects with&#xD;
      Ankle Osteoarthritis. The goal of this pilot study and subsequent pivotal trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Axolotl Ambient intra-articular injection for&#xD;
      ameliorating the pain and dysfunction associated with ankle OA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a double-blind multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial. Upon randomization, patients will receive 1 intraarticular injection of the&#xD;
      investigational product or control fluid. Follow-up will be conducted at 4 weeks, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months, with 6 months serving as the primary endpoint. The primary outcomes will consist of&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes of pain and functional assessment by the physician, specific to the&#xD;
      foot and ankle. Subjects will be monitored for an additional 6 months to establish safety&#xD;
      over a 1-year follow-up and evaluate the durability of benefit.&#xD;
