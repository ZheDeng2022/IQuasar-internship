      This study is an open phase Ⅳ clinical trial in subjects who enrolled in the clinical trial&#xD;
      and included in the immunogenicity subgroup PPS set from August to September 2016 .The&#xD;
      experimental vaccine and placebo (Freeze Dired Dilution) were manufactured by Sinovac&#xD;
      (Dalian) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd.A total of 703 subjects will be enrolled including 349&#xD;
      subjects in experimental group and 354 subjects in control group .And 3.0-3.5ml of venous&#xD;
      blood was collected from all subjects at 5 and 8 years after primary immunization, and the&#xD;
      serum was separated for varicella antibody detection. The window period of blood collection&#xD;
      was six months.&#xD;
