    <textblock>
      Assessment of the effect reached with the different doses of AV5080 on the duration and&#xD;
      severity of influenza symptoms based on the incidence of their resolution within 96 hours&#xD;
      from study treatment initiation compared to Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of influenza symptoms or their reduction to mild severity for at least 24 hours&#xD;
      indicates the resolution of influenza.&#xD;

      The study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel- group clinical study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of different AV5080 doses as compared to placebo in patients&#xD;
      with influenza during the 5-day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included only patients with influenza of mild and moderate severity, without&#xD;
      complications, both outpatients and those hospitalized for epidemiological reasons. The study&#xD;
      included three periods for each patient: Screening, randomization, and study treatment,&#xD;
      follow up period.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study was double-blinded. The staff of the clinical sites and the patients were unaware of the treatment and its doses assigned to each specific patient. Blinding was provided by a placebo mask (each patient received capsules containing either 80 mg of AV5080 or placebo), and drug distribution was controlled by the IWRS. Each patient was given two bottles containing the capsules, a bottle A and a bottle B. The two bottles had the same number and differed in lettering and label color: the bottle A had a white label and the bottle B had a yellow label. Patients were to take one capsule in the morning - from bottle A, and one capsule in the evening - from the bottle B.</masking_description>
