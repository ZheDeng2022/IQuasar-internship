  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of iCHART (Interactive CBT for Headache And Relaxation Training),&#xD;
      an interactive voice response (IVR) based delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for&#xD;
      Veterans with post-traumatic headache. Participants will receive iCHART treatment through the&#xD;
      IVR system over a period of 10 weeks, which will include an automated daily assessment of&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, retrieval of fortnightly tailored feedback from a study therapist,&#xD;
      and additional weekly one-way motivational enhancement messaging. Delivery of traditional&#xD;
      evidence-based behavioral treatments for headache management through technology-based&#xD;
      interventions, such as IVR may ultimately increase much needed access to these treatments and&#xD;
      allow patients to receive care at a time that is convenient for them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headache disorders are prevalent and highly disabling chronic neurological pain conditions,&#xD;
      especially among women and people with traumatic brain injury, yet remain underdiagnosed and&#xD;
      undertreated. Cognitive behavioral therapy for headache is an evidence-based psychological&#xD;
      treatment that is effective in reducing headache frequency and severity, addressing&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities, and improving an individual's quality of life, yet it remains&#xD;
      hugely underutilized and inaccessible to many. Delivery of traditional evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral treatments for headache management through technology-based interventions may&#xD;
      ultimately increase much needed access to these treatments. Interactive voice response (IVR)&#xD;
      is an automated telephone-based technology where people receive tailored messaging which&#xD;
      allows them to track symptoms, target behavior change, and engage in disease self-management.&#xD;
      This mixed-methods pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of iCHART (Interactive CBT for Headache And Relaxation Training),&#xD;
      an IVR-based delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for Veterans with headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be thirty-five Veterans receiving care within VA Connecticut Healthcare&#xD;
      System, who are diagnosed with post-traumatic headache. All eligible participants will&#xD;
      complete an initial intake interview and a 28-day electronic headache diary. Following the&#xD;
      baseline assessment period, eligible participants will then receive iCHART treatment through&#xD;
      the IVR system over a period of 10 weeks, which will include an automated daily assessment of&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, retrieval of fortnightly tailored feedback from a study therapist,&#xD;
      and additional weekly one-way motivational enhancement messaging. Participants will access a&#xD;
      patient workbook via the iCHART study website and iCHART providers will visualize&#xD;
      patient-reported data through the secure iCHART provider dashboard. Assessment measures will&#xD;
      be completed at baseline, immediately post-treatment completion, and one month post-treatment&#xD;
      completion. Analysis of primary and secondary outcome measures will employ mixed methods.&#xD;
