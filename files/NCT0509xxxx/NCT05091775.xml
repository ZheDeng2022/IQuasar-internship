    <textblock>
      Anal fissure define as a superficial tearing in mucosa on the anoderm surface distal to&#xD;
      dentate line . The most important factor is hard stool passing with trauma to anal mucosa.&#xD;
      But, diarrhea diarrhea has been another important etiology that happen after some conditions&#xD;
      like gastroenteritis, laxative over use, during chemotherapy, and ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      exacerbation . In these conditions, it seems the change of stool PH maybe the main reason of&#xD;
      inflammation and ulcer in acute phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of acute is medical management with change in bowel habits and conservative&#xD;
      therapy such as local lubricant, local vasodilator, and warm sitz bath to improve blood&#xD;
      supply and wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research clinical trial is designed to show the effect of Asacol suppository in the&#xD;
      management of acute fissure due to diarrhea. The hypothesis of this research clinical trial&#xD;
      has been referred to the cause of acute fissure ulcer because of diarrhea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cases with acute anal fissure after diarrhea will included in this research clinical&#xD;
      trial. They will be divided in two groups as an interventional group and control by blind&#xD;
      randomization allocation. The interventional group will have received Asacol suppository 1&#xD;
      supp every night and Diltiazem jelly (standard management) twice per day. The control group&#xD;
      will have received Diltiazem jelly and placebo suppository like interventional group. Both&#xD;
      group will have used warm sitz bath with enough hydration for 10 days. Then the patients will&#xD;
      have visited by another surgeon after 4 weeks to evaluate the healing of acute anal fissure.&#xD;
      Pain will have performed if the patients can tolerate.&#xD;
