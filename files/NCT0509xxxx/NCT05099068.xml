  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposal is to conduct a prospective, multi-cohort study aiming to decipher molecular&#xD;
      profiles/biological characteristics of advanced cancer patients during the course of their&#xD;
      disease with longitudinal and sequential analyses of tumor and liquid biopsies. This approach&#xD;
      will allow i) to develop a model in order to predict tumor response / resistance in real life&#xD;
      conditions and to better understand adaptive mechanisms and ii) to potentially propose&#xD;
      therapeutic options to enrolled patients following the review of the biological/molecular&#xD;
      data generated during this study and during a Molecular Tumor Board in case of disease&#xD;
      progression. This study will include 12 cohorts according to tumor type and standard&#xD;
      treatment received (See Inclusion criteria I1). Patient will be enrolled before the&#xD;
      initiation of standard anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of the molecular screening programs have allowed to successfully guide patients to&#xD;
      personalized therapy only for a minority of patients (10-20%) and few patients have actually&#xD;
      benefit from these programs with low objective response under personalized therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of disease and / or of treatment, tumors become more heterogeneous and&#xD;
      include a collection of cells harboring distinct molecular signatures with differential&#xD;
      levels of sensitivity to treatment. Assessment of tumor heterogeneity and plasticity are&#xD;
      essential for the development of effective therapies. Longitudinal analysis of biopsy samples&#xD;
      is of considerable interest to assess the complex clonal architecture of cancers and&#xD;
      potentially adapt cancer treatment to tumor profile/characteristics overtime. In this&#xD;
      context, profiling of circulating tumor DNA using non-invasive liquid biopsies is also an&#xD;
      interesting approach to assess cancer evolution by showing the contribution of clonal&#xD;
      heterogeneity to chemotherapy resistance and metastasis in high-risk patients.&#xD;
