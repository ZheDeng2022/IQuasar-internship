    <textblock>
      Collection of venous blood samples in male T1D patients to evaluate the behavior of different&#xD;
      biomarkers (beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, glucose) during and after morning Aerobic (60% of&#xD;
      VO2 max) and Symptom Limited Maximal Exercise Test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compare values and trends of different biomarkers (glucose, lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate)&#xD;
      before, during and after morning aerobic and symptom limited maximal exercise (cycling) to&#xD;
      predict glycemic fluctuations (hypo- and hyperglycemic events) during and after exercise in&#xD;
      order to create treatment algorithms to prevent these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Evaluate values and trends of glucose, lactate and beta-hydroxybutyrate before, during and&#xD;
      after morning exercise in venous blood.&#xD;
