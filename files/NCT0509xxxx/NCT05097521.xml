      The APPROACH Study (Assessing Pain, Patient-Reported Outcomes and Complementary and&#xD;
      Integrative Health) assesses the effects of use of 1) practitioner-delivered CIH therapies&#xD;
      alone or 2) self-care CIH therapies alone compared to 3) the combination of self-care and&#xD;
      practitioner-delivered CIH therapies among Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The&#xD;
      APPROACH study is predominately conducting a secondary analysis of patient-reported data&#xD;
      being collected by the Veterans Health Administration's (VA) Office of Patient Centered Care&#xD;
      and Cultural Transformation among Veterans using 18 VA medical centers. Those facilities&#xD;
      received funding as part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to expand&#xD;
      availability of CIH therapies. That patient-reported data is being supplemented with VA&#xD;
      electronic health record data and data on the 18 medical centers' business practices (nudges,&#xD;
      the instrumental variable). Practitioner-delivered therapies under study include chiropractic&#xD;
      care, acupuncture and therapeutic massage, and self-care therapies include Tai Chi/qigong,&#xD;
      yoga and meditation. The primary outcomes are improvement in pain severity and pain&#xD;
      interference, using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), 6 months after initiating CIH therapies&#xD;
      compared to baseline. Patients will enter treatment groups based on the CIH therapies they&#xD;
      use, as randomizing patients to specific therapies would require withholding therapies&#xD;
      routinely offered at VA. The investigators will address selection bias and confounding by&#xD;
      using sites' variations in business practices and other encouragements (nudges) to receiving&#xD;
      different CIH therapies as a surrogate for direct randomization using instrumental variables&#xD;
      econometric methods.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: The investigators are employing a quasi-experimental encouragement study design in&#xD;
      which subjects are able to choose their own CIH therapies, but some are offered extra&#xD;
      encouragements (nudges) to choose specific CIH therapies. Instead of being randomized to a&#xD;
      CIH therapy, individuals will enter one of the three study groups based on what CIH therapies&#xD;
      they used six months after they initiate any CIH therapy. Although accrual to study group is&#xD;
      not random, some sites have strong business practices/nudges that lead to considerable&#xD;
      variation in which CIH therapies patients use. The variation induced by these business&#xD;
      practices/nudges provides a quasi-experimental natural experiment that can be assessed&#xD;
      through an instrumental variables analytic approach. The purpose of using business practices&#xD;
      as an instrument for accruing patients to treatment group, similar to the use of&#xD;
      randomization, is to reduce potential selection and confounding bias. The 6-month treatment&#xD;
      window will allow for patients to initiate one type of CIH therapy and add additional CIH&#xD;
      therapies based on business practices/nudges at their site within the evaluation period. The&#xD;
      CIH therapies that patients receive will be as they are delivered by the 18 VHA Whole Health&#xD;
      flagship study sites and community care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites: The study sites are the VA's 18 Whole Health Flagship sites: VA Boston Health Care&#xD;
      System, VA New Jersey Health Care System, Erie VAMC, Beckley VAMC, W. G. (Bill) Hefner VAMC,&#xD;
      Atlanta VAMC, Tampa VAMC, Tennessee Valley Health Care System, Aleda E. Lutz VAMC, Tomah&#xD;
      VAMC, St. Louis VA Health Care System, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, South&#xD;
      Texas Veterans Health Care System, Salt Lake City VAMC, VA Portland Health Care System, Palo&#xD;
      Alto VAMC, Tucson VAMC, VA Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Data from the CIH Experience Survey/ VA Office of Patient Centered Care and&#xD;
      Cultural Transformation's Survey: The APPROACH study is predominately conducting a secondary&#xD;
      analysis of patient-reported data being collected by VA OPCC&amp;CT's survey. That is a 4-time&#xD;
      point survey (baseline and months 1, 3, 6). Almost all of the outcomes listed below are from&#xD;
      that survey.&#xD;
