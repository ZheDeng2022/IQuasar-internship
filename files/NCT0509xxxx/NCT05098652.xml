  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-phase study. In the first phase, 35 family caregivers will complete 3 weeks of&#xD;
      daily diaries, receive the Care-Resistant Behavior Internet Training (CuRB-IT) intervention,&#xD;
      then complete 3 weeks of daily diaries. During the 2nd phase, 266 family caregivers will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either immediate intervention or delayed intervention groups. All&#xD;
      caregivers will complete baseline surveys and 3 weeks of daily diaries. The immediate&#xD;
      intervention group will receive 12 weeks of CuRB-IT. They will complete 3 rounds of 3-week&#xD;
      daily diaries at 12 week intervals for the next 33 weeks. The delayed intervention group will&#xD;
      receive 12 weeks of attention, complete 12 weeks of CuRB-IT, and complete 2 rounds of 3--week&#xD;
      daily diaries at 12-week intervals for the next 18 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-phase study where Phase 1 deploys a quasi-experimental design (N=35 family&#xD;
      caregivers) and Phase 2 has a delayed-intervention randomized clinical trial (N=266). Both&#xD;
      Phases involve the delivery of an evidence-based, tele-coaching intervention, Care-Resistant&#xD;
      Behavior Internet Training (CuRB-IT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this two-phase study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to examine the feasibility of delivering the CuRB-IT intervention [Phase 1];&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examine the efficacy of CuRB-IT in increasing the self-efficacy of family caregivers of&#xD;
           persons living with dementia to handle care-resistant behaviors (CRB) [Phases 1&amp;2];&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. further test the efficacy of CuRB-IT in improving caregivers coping strategies (a) among&#xD;
           the experimental (immediate-intervention group) as compared to the control&#xD;
           (delayed-intervention group) (between groups) and (b) within-person from pre- to post-&#xD;
           intervention [Phase 2];&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. examine intervention decay at 3- and 6-months post intervention to determine performance&#xD;
           of intervention and inform scheduling of booster sessions [Phase 2];&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. assess the efficacy of the CuRB-IT intervention in preventing onset of poor coping&#xD;
           strategies by family caregivers [Phases 1&amp;2];&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. evaluate [Phase 1] and test [Phase 2] the hypothesized mechanism of action that&#xD;
           increased CRB self-efficacy and use of CuRB-IT problem-focused coping strategies mediate&#xD;
           the relationship between CRB stress appraisal and caregiving activities.&#xD;
