      RATIONALE: Acupuncture may help relieve joint stiffness related to aromatase inhibitors in&#xD;
      patients with early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This single arm clinical study aims to evaluate how well acupuncture as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment, works in treating patients with joint stiffness related to&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in patients with early-stage breast cancer.&#xD;

      Objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether acupuncture as a non-pharmacological treatment, administered twice weekly&#xD;
      for 6 weeks can significantly reduce joint stiffness related to AIs in women with early-stage&#xD;
      breast cancer as measured by the Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      (WOMAC) stiffness score at weeks 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of acupuncture on joint stiffness measured by the WOMAC stiffness&#xD;
      score at weeks 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of acupuncture on joint stiffness measured by the Modified Score for&#xD;
      the Assessment of Chronic Rheumatoid Affections of the Hands (M-SACRAH) stiffness score at&#xD;
      weeks 6 and weeks 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of acupuncture on quality of life (QOL) assessed by the Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscales (FACT-ES) at weeks 6 and weeks 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of acupuncture in the enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify potential genetic determinants to response to acupuncture.&#xD;
