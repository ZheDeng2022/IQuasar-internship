  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is widely administrated as anticancer treatment in metastatic setting. Despite&#xD;
      a proved efficacy in several cancer types and clinical situations, it exists a wide&#xD;
      variability of responses in terms of efficacy and toxicity. The rate of responders depends&#xD;
      mostly on the type of pathology, with 40% of responders among melanoma patients, 20-30% among&#xD;
      lung and head and neck cancer patients and only 1% of responders among pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients. Thus, the main challenge today is to be able to select patients for whom the&#xD;
      treatment is likely to be effective. Several studies suggested that tumors with a high&#xD;
      mutational burden and expressing PD-L1 are better responders to immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a proportion of PD-L1 negative cancers responds to immunotherapy, suggesting that&#xD;
      other parameters have to be considered together with PD-L1 expression. Of that, the&#xD;
      immunotherapy clearance seems to have an impact on overall survival, but larger studies,&#xD;
      including different molecules and cancer types, are needed to better understand the&#xD;
      correlation between the clearance and the response to immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cells released from the primary tumor in the blood circulation (CTCs, for circulating&#xD;
      tumor cells) are considered as &quot;liquid biopsies&quot;, as they contain the entire genetic and&#xD;
      phenotypic information representative of the tumor, including PD-L1 expression. Thus, the&#xD;
      variation of PD-L1 expression under treatment can be easily followed-up on blood samples&#xD;
      collected during the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of MADMAS is to study the correlation between the immunotherapy clearance,&#xD;
      measured at the different times during treatment, and the variation of the number of CTCs&#xD;
      expressing PD-L1 after two cures of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MADMAS will enroll patients with lung or head and neck cancers, treated with an&#xD;
      immunotherapy-based therapy. Blood samples will be collected at the baseline and before the&#xD;
      first two cures of treatment. The immunotherapy clearance will be measured with an innovative&#xD;
      approach of Mass Spectrometry, and PD-L1 expression will be measured on CTCs, purified with a&#xD;
      highly sensitive microfluidics technology.&#xD;
