      Objective: To compare the impact of pictorial and video demonstration oral health educational&#xD;
      interventions on oral hygiene status of children aged 12-16 years with hearing impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This randomized controlled trial spanned over the period of three months was&#xD;
      conducted in purposively selected three schools of deaf children of Karachi. Baseline dental&#xD;
      examination was performed to assess the dental plaque and gingival status of study&#xD;
      participants. Dental plaque and gingival status of the participants was assessed by employing&#xD;
      the World Health Organization recommended Plaque Index and Gingival Index. The 60 children&#xD;
      were than randomly allocated into three interventional groups, pictorial, video and control,&#xD;
      20 in each group. The children were examined again after one month of oral health education&#xD;
      provision by single examiner. Tooth brushes were provided to students at the time of baseline&#xD;
      examination to use for one month. Collected data was subjected to statistical analysis and&#xD;
      described in terms of Mean and Standard Deviation, mixed model ANNOVA was applied to see the&#xD;
      difference between the mean plaque and gingival scores of three groups after one month. The&#xD;
      p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval.&#xD;

      Background: Health education, conventionally and appropriately, one of the foundation of&#xD;
      preventive dentistry, has over the years involved in significant investments of time, power,&#xD;
      human resources and funds. Children with impaired hearing have difficulties in speaking and&#xD;
      communication and so learning process would be longer and even more challenging than the&#xD;
      other children without such disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the impact of pictorial and video demonstration oral health educational&#xD;
      interventions on oral hygiene status of children aged 12-16 years with hearing impairment.&#xD;
