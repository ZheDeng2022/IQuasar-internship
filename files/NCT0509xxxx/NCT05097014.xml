      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A signed and dated written informed consent obtained prior to any study-related&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Outpatient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. COPD diagnosis for at least 12 months before the Screening visit in accordance with&#xD;
             the definition by the GOLD 2020 report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current or ex-smokers (who quit smoking for at least 6 months prior to Screening&#xD;
             Visit) with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years [pack-years = (number of&#xD;
             cigarettes per day x number of years)/20]. E-cigarettes smoking cannot be used to&#xD;
             calculate pack-year history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 within 30 min after 4 puffs (4 x 100 µg) of&#xD;
             salbutamol pMDI and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 40% and &lt;80% of the predicted normal&#xD;
             values. If this is not met at screening, the test can be repeated once before&#xD;
             randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pre-bronchodilator functional residual capacity (FRC) of &gt; 120% of predicted normal&#xD;
             FRC values at Screening visit 1. If this criterion is not met at screening, the test&#xD;
             can be repeated once before randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A score of &gt;2 on the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) at Visit&#xD;
             1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects on mono- or dual inhaled maintenance COPD treatment at a stable dose for at&#xD;
             least 3 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A cooperative attitude and ability to correctly use the study inhalers.&#xD;
&#xD;

             physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant (i.e. post-menopausal or permanently&#xD;
             sterile) or physiologically capable of becoming pregnant (i.e. women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (WOCBP)).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. CWRCE at Visit 1b: between 2 min and 11 min at 80% of maximum workload. In case the&#xD;
             subject cycles for a shorter (i.e. &lt; 2 min) or longer (i.e. &gt; 11 min) period, the&#xD;
             visit can be repeated with an adjusted workload once within a 1-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Oxygen saturation (SpO2 measured by pulse oximeter) at least 82% during the&#xD;
             incremental exercise test (IET) performed in the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects must be able to complete CWRCE at Visit 1b and then at Visit 2 without&#xD;
             requirement for supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known respiratory disorders other than COPD which may impact the efficacy of the study&#xD;

             current diagnosis of asthma, alfa-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active tuberculosis, lung&#xD;
             cancer, severe bronchiectasis unrelated to COPD, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary&#xD;
             hypertension and interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unstable concurrent disease: e.g. fever, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus or other endocrine disease; significant hepatic impairment;&#xD;
             significant renal impairment; uncontrolled gastrointestinal disease (e.g. active&#xD;
             peptic ulcer); uncontrolled cardiac disease, uncontrolled neurological disease;&#xD;
             uncontrolled haematological disease; uncontrolled autoimmune disorders, or other which&#xD;
             may impact the efficacy or the safety of the study drug according to investigator's&#xD;
             judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Moderate (requiring prescriptions of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics) or&#xD;
             severe (leading to hospitalization) COPD exacerbation in the 3 and 12 months,&#xD;
             respectively, prior to Screening visit 1 and during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects requiring long term (&gt; 15 hours a day) oxygen therapy for chronic hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects who have clinically severe cardiovascular condition (such as but not limited to&#xD;
        unstable ischemic heart disease, NYHA Class IV, left ventricular failure, myocardial&#xD;
        infarction in the prior 6 months, not controlled arrhythmia etc.), which may impact the&#xD;
        efficacy or the safety of the study drug according to the investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. An abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) which may impact&#xD;
        the safety of the subject according to investigator's judgement. Subjects whose 12-lead ECG&#xD;
        shows QTcF &gt;450 ms for males or QTcF &gt;470 ms for females at screening visit are not&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. History of hypersensitivity to M3 receptor antagonists, β2-agonist, corticosteroids or&#xD;
        any of the excipients contained in any of the formulations used in the trial which may&#xD;
        raise contra-indications or impact the efficacy of the study drug according to the&#xD;
        investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects with serum potassium levels ≤ 3.5 mEq/L (or 3.5 mmol/L) 9. Subjects with body&#xD;
        mass index less than 15 or greater than 35 kg/m2. 10. History of alcohol abuse and/or&#xD;
        substance/drug abuse within 12 months prior to screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Subjects with contraindications to cardiopulmonary exercise testing, including those&#xD;
        whose exercise test is limited by non-respiratory or cardiovascular condition, e.g. by&#xD;
        neurologic, orthopaedic, or other disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        12. Participation in another clinical trial where investigational drug was received less&#xD;
        than 30 days or 5 half-lives whichever is longer prior to screening visit.&#xD;
