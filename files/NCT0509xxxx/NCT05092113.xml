  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy regimens not only improve the survival of patients with gastric cancer and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, but also cause obvious adverse reactions of digestive tract, such as&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and so on. These&#xD;
      adverse reactions seriously affect the patients' quality of life and the efficacy of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid in the human body. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that oral glutamine can help to keep the integrity of mucosal epithelium&#xD;
      during chemotherapy and reduce the gastrointestinal side effects caused by chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      addition of glutamine to parenteral nutrition can better maintain nitrogen balance and reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of infection-related complications. A compound glutamine capsule, composed of&#xD;
      L-glutamine and the traditional Chinese herbal formula Si-Jun-Zi-Tang which composed of&#xD;
      ginseng, Atractylodes macrocephala, Poria cocos and licorice, has been widely used in China&#xD;
      for 23 years to treat many types of gastrointestinal diseases, including gastrointestinal&#xD;
      reactions induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome. However, so far, only a small sample of clinical trials have explored the role of&#xD;
      glutamine in chemical mucositis, and there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials to further verify its value in the prevention and treatment of chemical&#xD;
      mucositis. The purpose of this study is to observe the efficacy and safety between a compound&#xD;
      glutamine capsule and placebo in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in patients&#xD;
      with gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
