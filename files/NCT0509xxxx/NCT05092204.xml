  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term dermatoporosis, by analogy to osteoporosis, was proposed by Professor Saurat to&#xD;
      define all the manifestations linked to skin aging leading to fragility and skin failure.&#xD;
      With age, the gradual disappearance of hyaluronic acid and its CD44 cell receptor leads to&#xD;
      the degeneration of the extracellular matrix and then to the loss of the protective&#xD;
      mechanical functions of the skin. It thus appears an alteration of the viscoelasticity of the&#xD;
      skin. The most common skin manifestations of dermatoporosis are mainly located on the upper&#xD;
      limbs. Several clinical manifestations characterize dermatoporosis: skin atrophy, senile&#xD;
      purpura, stellate pseudo-scars, delayed healing and finally dissecting skin hematoma. There&#xD;
      are 4 evolutionary stages of dermatoporosis described by Professor Saurat and by Doctor Kaya,&#xD;
      in 2007: Stage 1: strong thinning of the skin with senile purpura and stellate pseudo-scars.&#xD;
      Stage 2: manifestations of the previous stage and small, localized skin lacerations resulting&#xD;
      from a cleavage between the dermis and the epidermis. Stage 3: more and larger skin&#xD;
      lacerations with a noticeable delay in healing Stage 4: the progression of the lesions&#xD;
      described above leads to the formation of dissecting skin hematomas which may progress to&#xD;
      skin necrosis. (Saurat JH Dermatoporosis - the functional side of skin aging. Dermatology&#xD;
      2007 and Kaya G, dermatoporosis: A chronic cutaneous insufficiency / fragility syndrome.&#xD;
      Clinicopathological features, mechanisms, prevention and potential treatments. Dermatology&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Mengeaud et al found a significant association between severe renal failure and&#xD;
      dermatoporosis. Two studies, one in Toulouse and the other in Finland, looked at the&#xD;
      prevalence and risk factors of dermatoporosis in patients over 60 years of age. The&#xD;
      observational study on 202 patients over 60 years old in Toulouse shows a prevalence of 32%,&#xD;
      with preferentially localization on the upper limbs. Stage 1 is the most common. Multivariate&#xD;
      statistical analyzes show that dermatoporosis is significantly associated with the use of&#xD;
      local and oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and chronic renal failure. On the other hand,&#xD;
      it has not been shown to be associated with diabetes and the patient's sun exposure.Another&#xD;
      study, dating from 2018 also found that kidney failure, taking antiaggregants and&#xD;
      anticoagulants, corticosteroid therapy (local or systemic) are risk factors for&#xD;
      dermatoporosis. However, no study has been carried out on a geriatric population, and the&#xD;
      association between phototype, sun exposure and dermatoporosis has to our knowledge never&#xD;
      been systematically investigated in the few studies conducted.&#xD;

      This study will allow us to know the prevalence and the risk factors of dermatoporosis in a&#xD;
      poorly understood geriatric population. No study on the subject in patients over 75 years in&#xD;
      the literature. We will be interested in collecting on the observations of patients recorded&#xD;
      in Orbis (Initial medical assessment and evolution), in particular if the patient has chronic&#xD;
      renal failure, is diabetic, has anticoagulants, antiaggregants or corticosteroids as a&#xD;
      background treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective To assess the prevalence of dermatoporosis in patients over 75 years of age&#xD;
      hospitalized in reeducation. Secondary objectives: Investigate risk factors for&#xD;
      dermatoporosis - Evaluate the prevalence of complications of dermatoporosis&#xD;
