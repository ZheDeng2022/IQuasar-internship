  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Discovery of the circadian clock first established a genetic basis for behavior, and our&#xD;
      understanding of circadian rhythm (CIR) has since expanded to provide molecular insights into&#xD;
      physiology and disease. Yet the challenge remains to translate these insights regarding the&#xD;
      role of the CIR in cells and tissues into the clinic. Many mechanistic pre-clinical&#xD;
      experiments have shown that the CIR is directly linked with the Nicotinamide Adenine&#xD;
      Dinucleotide (NAD) levels and the NAD redox ratio and that the NAD oscillation amplitude is&#xD;
      diminished during aging and in the model of neurological diseases. Human ex-vivo data have&#xD;
      also shown that NAD oscillates over time in human red blood cells. While mounting evidence in&#xD;
      model organisms illustrate the central role of brain NAD for maintaining energy homeostasis&#xD;
      and the CIR, similar data in human are sparse. To date, no study has been reported in human&#xD;
      on the effect of the CIR on brain NAD levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAD is a vital cofactor involved in brain bioenergetics for metabolism and Adenosine&#xD;
      Tri-Phosphate (ATP) production, the energy currency of the brain. NAD exists in an oxidized&#xD;
      (NAD+) or reduced (NADH) form, with NAD+/NADH (the redox ratio) being an important&#xD;
      determinant of cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, NAD+ is a key&#xD;
      substrate for multiple NAD+-dependent enzymes and is consumed by at least four class of&#xD;
      enzymes involved in genomic stability, mitochondrial homeostasis, adaptive stress responses,&#xD;
      and cell survival, including Sirtuins. Modulation of subcellular NAD+ synthesis can regulate&#xD;
      the timing of signaling pathways. Mammalian circadian rhythms are coordinated with metabolic&#xD;
      activity through controlled expression of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT).&#xD;
      Regulation of NAMPT, in turn, results in oscillating NAD+ levels. The rhythmic oscillation of&#xD;
      NAD+ serves as a feedback 'timer' by modulating the activities of NAD+-dependent enzymes,&#xD;
      including sirtuins, helping to establish the periodicity of the cycles. NAMPT oscillations&#xD;
      also dictate mitochondrial NAD+ levels and coordinate cellular respiration with awake&#xD;
      periods. In these cases, modulation of NAMPT levels drives the rise and fall of NAD+&#xD;
      concentrations that serve to limit the duration of Sirtuins activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fine control of neurometabolism is necessary for brain function, because neuronal firing&#xD;
      produces dynamic changes in local energy demand. The Astrocyte Neuron Lactate Shuttle&#xD;
      Hypothesis (ANLS) provides one way of understanding how these changing needs are met. In this&#xD;
      model, neuronal activity increases extracellular glutamate, which stimulates increased&#xD;
      glucose uptake and glycolysis in astrocytes. Within astrocytes, lactate is produced from&#xD;
      pyruvate in a reversible manner by the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme in the cytoplasm. This&#xD;
      enzyme requires NAD as a co-factor and one NADH is converted to NAD+ when one pyruvate&#xD;
      molecule is converted to lactate. The astrocytes then release this lactate, increasing its&#xD;
      extracellular concentration. Important to the ANLS hypothesis, lactate can be used by nearby&#xD;
      neurons as an energy source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, under the influence of the CIR regulation, the human psychological and&#xD;
      physiological functions fluctuate with time during the day. This effect has been observed in&#xD;
      many cognitive domains, as well as in risky decision-making and reward function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that brain NAD level is modulated by the CIR and that the NAD redox ratio&#xD;
      should increase during the day. The primary objective of this project is to determine the&#xD;
      brain NAD status in the morning and in the afternoon. Many pre-clinical results have&#xD;
      suggested a diurnal effect on brain NAD, yet no clinical data is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, NAD+ and NADH level of the occipital region will be determined by 31P-MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy at 7 T. Total NAD (tNAD) and NAD redox ratio NAD+/NADH will be calculated as&#xD;
      well. Measurement will be conducted in the morning in the fasted state (AM session) and in&#xD;
      the mid-afternoon (PM session) 3 hours after the lunch intake. To confirm that the AM and PM&#xD;
      measurements are done in two different circadian states, salivary cortisol will be measured.&#xD;
      Simultaneous detection of other energy metabolites (e.g. lactate, PCr, ATP) will be acquired&#xD;
      for exploratory analysis. To explore how the NAD status correlates with behavioral measures&#xD;
      of reward activation, the automatic Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) test will be performed&#xD;
      at the end of each AM and PM session.&#xD;
