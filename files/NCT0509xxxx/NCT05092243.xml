  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current proposal, investigators will investigate three crucial issues of FOG. Firstly,&#xD;
      investigators will identify the possible source(s) of FOG in PD and PSP patients during&#xD;
      unconstrained walking using a 64-channel ambulatory recorder. The investigators will explore&#xD;
      the electric neural sources of FOG and brain connectivity. Secondarily, fMRI during motor&#xD;
      imagery will be performed to examine the brain regions involved in the FOG patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will merge the electrophysiological and imaging findings to detect the possible&#xD;
      neurovascular coupling or uncoupling. Thirdly, electric intervention with transcranial direct&#xD;
      current stimulation (tDCS) will be conducted to see whether the FOG situation can be&#xD;
      ameliorated in PD and PSP patients. The investigators will deliver a 5-day session of tDCS to&#xD;
      the leg motor cortex of the FOG patients to examine whether the intervention will benefit the&#xD;
      patients in a double blind randomized design. Six assessments with different combinations of&#xD;
      clinical scaling, gait analysis, electrophysiological investigation and fMRI examinations&#xD;
      before and after tDCS will be conducted. Besides, there is no long-term cohort investigation&#xD;
      of tDCS on neurodegenerative patients with FOG. The investigators will have a 3-year&#xD;
      follow-up with a 1-month interval open-label stimulation paradigm for the patients who&#xD;
      remained voluntarily after the termination of the initial short-term trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the first part of the 3-year project is to identify the source(s) of FOG&#xD;
      with electrophysiological recording. The investigators will conduct concomitant high density&#xD;
      Electroencephalographic and leg electromyographic recording to investigate subjects with and&#xD;
      without FOG under unrestrained walking in the gait laboratory. The acquisitive signals from&#xD;
      64 montages will be decomposed first by independent component analysis (ICA) for further&#xD;
      source localization of FOG. The event (FOG) related synchronization and desynchronization of&#xD;
      different frequency bands of EEG will also be investigated to understand the&#xD;
      neurophysiological implications of brain wave oscillations for the generation of FOG. In&#xD;
      addition, the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway function will be assessed with magnetic&#xD;
      paired associative stimulation in patients to probe the role of cerebellum in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of FOG. In the second part of the project, fMRI study will be adopted by having&#xD;
      the subjects perform video-guided motor imagery of simple and complex walking situations.&#xD;
      Block design paradigms will be delivered for signal acquisition. The signals will be analyzed&#xD;
      by ICA before further processing for activation analysis. The connectivity map will&#xD;
      beoverlaid with that of electric recording to examine the neurovascular coupling or&#xD;
      uncoupling. In the third part of the project, investigators will deliver a 5-day session of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the leg motor cortex of the FOG patients to&#xD;
      examine whether the intervention will benefit the patients in a doubleblind randomized&#xD;
      cross-over design.&#xD;
