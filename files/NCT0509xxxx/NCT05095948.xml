    <textblock>
      This study examines how cancer care is delivered in oncology and supportive care clinics.&#xD;
      Collecting patient feedback may help doctors better understand the processes of cancer care&#xD;
      in oncology and supportive care clinics.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the total amount of follow-up clinic time spent on discussing&#xD;
      supportive/palliative care issues between primary palliative care provided by the oncology&#xD;
      team and specialist palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare between the specialist palliative care team and the oncology team the following&#xD;
      aspects of supportive/palliative care delivery: Ia. The number of supportive/palliative care&#xD;
      needs the patient reported before the clinic visit (SPARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. The number of supportive/palliative care needs the patient wanted to discuss with the&#xD;
      clinical team before the clinic visit (SPARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. The number of supportive/palliative care needs that were actually raised by the patient&#xD;
      during the clinic visit (audiotape).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Id. The number of supportive/palliative care needs that were actually discussed by the&#xD;
      clinical team during clinic visit (audiotape).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ie. The number of supportive/palliative care needs that were documented in progress note by&#xD;
      the clinical team after each visit (electronic health record).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If. The number of supportive/palliative care needs that the patient reported had been&#xD;
      adequate addressed after the clinic visit (SPARC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the amount of clinic time (both absolute and proportion) spent on discussing&#xD;
      supportive/palliative care issues by individual disciplines (e.g. medical doctor, registered&#xD;
      nurse, counselor, pharmacist, psychologist, social worker, and priest) between the specialist&#xD;
      palliative care team and the oncology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the nature of topics discussed by the specialist palliative care team and the&#xD;
      oncology team and compare the amount of clinic time (both absolute and proportion) spent on&#xD;
      each supportive/palliative care issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the number of empathic statements between the specialist palliative care team&#xD;
      and the oncology team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the processes of supportive/palliative care delivery between patients seeing&#xD;
      the oncology team without specialist palliative care (Cohort A) and patients seeing the&#xD;
      oncology team when specialist palliative care team is involved (Cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires over 15-20 minutes and undergo audio recording of clinic&#xD;
      conversations between the oncology team or the specialist palliative care team. Patients'&#xD;
      medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;
