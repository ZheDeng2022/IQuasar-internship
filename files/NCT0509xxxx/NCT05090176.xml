      To determine efficacy of using 3 minutes povidone-soaked suture in reducing surgical site&#xD;
      infection during wound closure in elective surgery.&#xD;

      Participant recruitment and randomisation based on eligibility based on CONSORT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will get either package A or B which determine whether they are getting&#xD;
      povidone-soaked suture or ordinary suture during wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative, follow up on D10 and D30 of patient well being and signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      surgical site infection&#xD;

    <measure>Povidone-soaked Sutures versus Ordinary Sutures for Reducing Surgical Site Infection: Randomize Control Trial Study in General Surgery Cases of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There is difference of outcome using povidone-soaked suture and ordinary suture. In this study, our hypothesis the suture with povidone-soaked will reduce the SSIs rate during closure and it will be assessed on day 10 and day 30 post-operative.&#xD;
Few measurement are used in detection of SSI based on clinical and biochemical measurement such as signs of inflammation and total white cell count.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There is difference in the extent of intervention needed to manage SSIs in wounds closed with povidone-soaked suture and ordinary suture.&#xD;
This hypothesis measure how far that the management of SSIs whether non-operative or operative treatment is needed.&#xD;
This is base on antibiotic use, dressing and surgical intervention such as debridement.</description>
