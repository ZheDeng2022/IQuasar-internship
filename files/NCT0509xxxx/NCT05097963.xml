  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)&#xD;
      shear wave elastography in liver fibrosis staging in both normal subjects and subjects with&#xD;
      advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, paired study. Study subjects who are scheduled to undergo EUS at Mayo&#xD;
      Clinic will be identified through Epic. Chart review will be performed including review of&#xD;
      prior imaging, medical history, and laboratory results as available in Epic to determine&#xD;
      study eligibility. Subjects without history of chronic liver disease (screened by low FIB-4&#xD;
      score) and those with known advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Eligible study subjects will then be contacted either before, or at the time of their&#xD;
      endoscopy procedure to discuss study participation. All subjects will then receive standard&#xD;
      clinical care based on the indication for the EUS procedure. During the EUS procedure, study&#xD;
      subjects with undergo shear wave measurements obtained in a non-invasive manner as part of&#xD;
      the endosonographic evaluation of the liver. 10 measurements (including shear wave velocity&#xD;
      (Vs), elastic modulus (E)) will be obtained for point SWE (pSWE). Measurements will be&#xD;
      obtained from both left and right lobes of liver unless technically infeasible to do so.&#xD;
      Study subjects will then undergo a paired MR elastography (same day or at later date) after&#xD;
      completion of EUS and only if consistent and reliable shear wave measurements were obtained&#xD;
      (e.g., VsN &gt; 70%(reliability index of each measurement expressed in percentages), IQR/M&#xD;
      (interquartile range/ Median) is &lt;15% for Vs and &lt;30% for E). Enrolled study subjects who had&#xD;
      undergone a previous MRE (within 6 months of enrollment) would be eligible for the study,&#xD;
      without the need to undergo further research MRE. After completion of MR elastography, the&#xD;
      subjects will then continue through their routine clinical care and will not be followed up&#xD;
      by research staff. The expected duration of subject participation is anticipated to begin at&#xD;
      the time of study enrollment and terminate after completion of MR elastography. There will be&#xD;
      no additional follow up.&#xD;
