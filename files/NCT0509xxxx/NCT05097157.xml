    <description>The Clinical Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (CGAIS) ranging from &quot;worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; is be used to judge the improvement as seen by the treating Investigator. The Investigator compared the baseline (pre-treatment) photographs to the follow up photographs to determine if the follow up image looks worse, if there is no change, if there is improvement, if there is much improvement, or if there is very much improvement in the follow up image when compared to the baseline image.</description>
