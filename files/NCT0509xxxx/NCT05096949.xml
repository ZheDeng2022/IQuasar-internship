    <textblock>
      This study seeks to address this gap by studying two Cabenuva delivery strategies conducted&#xD;
      at six outpatient HIV clinics in Arkansas, a Southern state with a large population of rural,&#xD;
      poor, and African-American residents. The two delivery strategies are clinic delivery and&#xD;
      home delivery. In the clinic delivery study arm, patients will receive Cabenuva injections&#xD;
      monthly at the clinic (50 patients), and in the home delivery study arm, patients will&#xD;
      receive the injection at home (50 patients). The study team will follow the patients in both&#xD;
      study arms for 10 months. After 5 months, the patients will complete a treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      survey, and after 10 months the study team will examine clinic records to assess their&#xD;
      medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include clinician perceptions of acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      appropriateness of Cabenuva delivery strategies. The study team will also collect qualitative&#xD;
      data from patients and clinic employees to learn more in depth about their perceptions of&#xD;
      Cabenuva, the delivery strategies, their implementation, and barriers and facilitators.&#xD;
      Finally, the study team will estimate the costs associated with the two delivery strategies&#xD;
      from the clinic and patient perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study provide information on what delivery strategies for long acting HIV&#xD;
      medications offer best results, how these strategies are perceived by patients and&#xD;
      clinicians, and how costly and feasible the strategies are to implement in practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Good medication adherence in patients living with HIV (PLHIV) is one of the key determinants&#xD;
      of their treatment success. Most current HIV medications are taken daily, which represents a&#xD;
      big burden and leads to many challenges for maintaining medication adherence. These&#xD;
      challenges are exacerbated by socio-economic factors, such as poverty, rurality,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, and stigma, leading to disparities in treatment and outcomes. Long acting&#xD;
      injectable medications offer promise of reducing medication adherence burden and barriers,&#xD;
      potentially improving the health and well-being of PLHIV, and helping limit the spread of&#xD;
      HIV. In January 2021, FDA approved Cabenuva, the first long acting HIV medication,&#xD;
      administered as monthly injections. The monthly injections hold promise to improve treatment&#xD;
      adherence and facilitate access to treatment for rural residents. However, it is currently&#xD;
      not known what delivery strategies would optimize delivery of long acting HIV medications for&#xD;
      best patient adherence and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to address this gap by studying two Cabenuva delivery strategies conducted&#xD;
      at six outpatient HIV clinics in Arkansas, a Southern state with a large population of rural,&#xD;
      poor, and African-American residents. The two delivery strategies are clinic delivery and&#xD;
      home delivery. In the clinic delivery study arm, patients will receive Cabenuva injections&#xD;
      monthly at the clinic (50 patients), and in the home delivery study arm, patients will&#xD;
      receive the injection at home (50 patients). The study team will follow the patients in both&#xD;
      study arms for 10 months. After 5 months, the patients will complete a treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      survey, and after 10 months the study team will examine clinic records to assess their&#xD;
      medication adherence.&#xD;
