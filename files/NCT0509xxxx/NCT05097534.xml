  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve diabetes self-management outcomes, patients with type 2 diabetes (n=150 - aged&#xD;
      13-84) recruited from St. Vincent Clinic (SVC) and Teen Health Center Inc., Clinics will be&#xD;
      randomized using block randomization to receive standard of care or the integrated model.&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention arm will be assessed for social and physical needs before being&#xD;
      enrolled in a year-long education program (iDSMES). Enrollees will receive dietary&#xD;
      counseling, physical and occupational therapy, in addition to other mental, financial and&#xD;
      social benefits counseling. The investigators will compare the intervention outcomes.&#xD;
