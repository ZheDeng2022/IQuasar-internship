  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This parallel-group randomized, controlled, clinical trial aims to investigate the influence&#xD;
      of a 6-month home-based, remotely-monitored, exercise training intervention on&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus who have undergone&#xD;
      glucocorticoid pulse therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid treatment is a frequently prescribed to individuals with autoimmune diseases,&#xD;
      such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, due to its anti-inflammatory effects. This treatment&#xD;
      strategy has proven clinical benefits, but it can also adversely influence musculoskeletal&#xD;
      health. Glucocorticoid pulse therapy is a particularly intensive treatment strategy, commonly&#xD;
      used when the disease state is at its most active. Patients who undergo pulse therapy have a&#xD;
      high risk of muscle and bone loss, and exercise training is a promising adjunct therapy to&#xD;
      potentially ameliorate these adverse effects, but the feasibility and efficacy of this&#xD;
      approach has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study, therefore, is to conduct a&#xD;
      parallel-group, controlled, randomized clinical trial, to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of a home-based, remotely-monitored, exercise training intervention on&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus who have undergone&#xD;
      glucocorticoid pulse therapy.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study comprises a 6-month parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, in which individuals with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus who have undergone glucocorticoid pulse therapy (500-1000mg/d methylprednisolone i.v., 1-3 days), will be randomized into one of two conditions: control, consisting of no intervention and standard medical care; and exercise training, consisting of standard medical care supplemented by a twice-weekly, home-based, remotely monitored exercise training program. Patients will be assessed at three timepoints, namely 1-3 weeks after pulse therapy (according to patient's health state and willingness, PRE); three months after baseline (MID); and six months after baseline (POST).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The present intervention will consist of a 6-month long, twice-weekly, home-based, monitored exercise training program, with training sessions lasting around 40 minutes, with 48 sessions in total. The program will be delivered in the form of 6 x 4-week &quot;blocks&quot;, which will progressively increase in intensity and complexity, as the participants physical capacities develop. Additionally, and in addition with current physical activity guidelines, participants will be instructed to perform at least an additional 70 minutes of purposeful activities per week. Study trainers will discuss the content of these activities with each individual participant to facilitate selection of suitable activities (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, stair climbing or bike riding), but their selection will be left to the discretion of the individual participants, and activity logs will be maintained throughout the study period.</description>
