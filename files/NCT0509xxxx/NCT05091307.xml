      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority (NI) of the humoral immune&#xD;
      response expressed by the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of hemagglutination inhibition (HI)&#xD;
      antibody titers against each of the 4 influenza vaccine strains after concomitant&#xD;
      administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent high-dose and&#xD;
      standard-dose influenza vaccine versus the administration of a seasonal quadrivalent&#xD;
      high-dose and standard-dose influenza vaccine administered alone; and to demonstrate the NI&#xD;
      of the humoral immune response expressed by the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody concentration after concomitant&#xD;
      administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent high-dose standard-dose and&#xD;
      standard-dose influenza vaccine versus the administration of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine administered&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(-2) (SARS CoV-2) is a highly transmissible and&#xD;
      pathogenic coronavirus that has spread rapidly and globally and Influenza is a worldwide&#xD;
      public health problem, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Ad26.COV2.S (also&#xD;
      known as VAC31518, JNJ-78436735) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant,&#xD;
      replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, stabilized in its prefusion conformation. The seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccines to be used in this study are quadrivalent (standard dose) and quadrivalent&#xD;
      (high-dose) or equivalent formulated. The concomitant administration of the Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
      vaccine and a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (standard-dose or high-dose) is&#xD;
      non-inferior than the administration of either seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine&#xD;
      (standard-dose or high-dose) alone as measured by HI titers against each of the 4 influenza&#xD;
      vaccine strains at 28 days after the administration of a quadrivalent seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccine or Ad26.COV2.S vaccine alone as measured by Spiked-Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay&#xD;
      (S-ELISA) antibody titers at 28 days after the administration of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.&#xD;
      This study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (Day -28 to 1), treatment phase (vaccination&#xD;
      visits on Days 1 and 29), and a follow-up phase (28 days after each vaccination). Safety&#xD;
      assessments will include physical examination, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory&#xD;
      assessments, pregnancy testing, monitoring of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESI). The total duration of the study is up&#xD;
      to 7-8 months.&#xD;
