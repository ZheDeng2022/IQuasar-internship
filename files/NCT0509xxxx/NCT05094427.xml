      The purpose of the this study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a&#xD;
      fluoroscopically-guided dorsal ramus block placed by the operative neurosurgeon prior to&#xD;
      lumbosacral surgery. The study will consist of a retrospective analysis of a cohort of&#xD;
      patients who underwent lumbosacral surgery patients between June 2018 and March 2021 with or&#xD;
      without a preoperative fluoroscopically-guided dorsal ramus (DR) block placed by the&#xD;
      operative neurosurgeon.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spine surgery poses unique challenges in postoperative pain management. Local anesthetic&#xD;
      blocks, namely the erector spinae plane and thoracolumbar interfacial plane blocks, placed by&#xD;
      anesthesia under ultrasound guidance have been shown to reduce postoperative pain after&#xD;
      spinal surgery and decrease perioperative opioid requirements by as much as 50%. Nonetheless&#xD;
      these procedures are not routinely performed, likely due to logistical hurdles and lack of&#xD;
      widespread knowledge of the procedure by anesthesiologists. A preoperative dorsal ramus block&#xD;
      performed by the operative neurosurgeon under fluoroscopy shows promise as an alternative&#xD;
      approach to perioperative pain control. The objective of this retrospective observational&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a dorsal ramus block block&#xD;
      performed by a neurosurgeon under x-ray guidance prior to lumbar surgery. The study will&#xD;
      include a cohort of patients who have undergone lumbar spine surgery with or without the&#xD;
      x-ray guided dorsal ramus block. A retrospective chart review of these patients will be&#xD;
      performed to assess for postoperative pain control, postoperative opioid requirements, time&#xD;
      to block completion, length of stay, and adverse events. Descriptive and comparative&#xD;
      statistics will be performed. No new data will be gathered from the subjects beyond&#xD;
      pre-existing data within the medical record, and no new procedures will be performed as part&#xD;
      of the study. If the current study suggests that a dorsal ramus block performed by the&#xD;
      operative neurosurgeon is feasible, safe, and effective, it will serve as a foundation for a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of such a block among patients undergoing lumbar surgery.&#xD;
