      This study will follow participants with a disease which is associated with an absence or&#xD;
      deficiency in Complement Factor I (CFI) as confirmed in the CFI-001 screening study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will include male and female participants ≥6 months of age (pediatric&#xD;
      participants enrolled as permitted by local Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics&#xD;
      Committee). This includes patients with recurrent bacterial infections (eg, meningitis,&#xD;
      sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis, otitis) and patients with autoimmune and immune&#xD;
      complex-mediated diseases (eg, glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
      leukocytoclastic vasculitis, Bickerstaff encephalitis, meningoencephalitis).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, age 6 months or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Affirmation of participant's informed consent or legally authorized representative&#xD;
             (LAR)'s willingness to provide informed consent with signature confirmation before any&#xD;
             study-related activities. (Study-related activities are any procedures that would not&#xD;
             have been performed during normal clinical management of the participant.) The&#xD;
             participant (if a minor) must also be willing to give written informed assent (if&#xD;
             able) if the minor is within the age groups 7 to 11 years old and 12 to 17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed CFI deficiency during the screening study, CFI-001, with a disease that is&#xD;
             associated with an absence or deficiency in CFI&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stated willingness of the participant to comply with all study procedures (including&#xD;
             multiple blood draws) and availability for the duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Stated willingness of the participant (or LAR) to allow access to his/her medical&#xD;
             records with the purpose of assessing disease status and progression during his/her&#xD;
             participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participation in an interventional clinical study within the previous 30 days prior to&#xD;
             screening or within ≤5 half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Having a major concurrent non-CFI-related disease that prevents the assessment of the&#xD;
             natural course of the CFI deficiency disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Having a medical, psychosocial, or familial issues that might prevent full&#xD;
             participation and cooperation with the procedures and requirements of the clinical&#xD;
             study as determined by the potential participant/guardian and physician investigator&#xD;
