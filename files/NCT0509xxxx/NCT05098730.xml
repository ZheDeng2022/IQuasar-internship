  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will administer an intervention called strategy training to adult stroke survivors&#xD;
      living in the community who do and do not have pets, and will examine the role of a pet in&#xD;
      promoting cognitive performance and community participation outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is a single site, two-group quasi-experimental design comparing the effects of strategy training on rehabilitation engagement, cognitive performance, and community participation of home-dwelling stroke survivors living with and without pets. The investigators will also conduct qualitative interviews with participants who have pets.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean engagement score as measured by the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is a valid and reliable criterion referenced measure that assesses engagement in rehabilitation therapy sessions. Each session is scored by the occupational therapist, 1 (no participation, refusal) to 6 (excellent participation). Scores are averaged across the 10-15 intervention sessions to generate the mean engagement score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attention as measured by the Color Trail Test 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses perceptual tracking, sustained attention and grapho-motor skills. It is a pencil and paper, timed test. Completion time in seconds for each task is recorded, with a lower score representing better function. Change in attention will be calculated by subtracting the time to do the task at baseline from the time to do the task at 3 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in executive function as measured by the Color Trail Test 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure assesses divided attention and sequencing skills, which are executive function performance. It is a pencil and paper, timed test of effortful executive processing abilities that assesses the ability to alternate between two colors. Completion time in seconds for each task is recorded, with a lower score representing better function. Change in executive function will be calculated by subtracting the time to do the task at baseline from the time to do the task at 3 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in community participation as measure by Community Participation Indicators score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This participant reported questionnaire will measure the frequency of community participation over a 7 days period. Each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1=no participation in that activity and 5=7 days of participation in that activity. A total of 20 items are summed to yield a total score. Change in community participation will be calculated by subtracting baseline total score from the 3 month total score.</description>
