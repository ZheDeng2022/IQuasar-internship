  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of using the OnLume Imaging System for&#xD;
      fluorescence-guided surgery along with indocyanine green (ICG) dye in the operating room for&#xD;
      the axillary reverse mapping (ARM) procedure in women with breast cancer scheduled to have&#xD;
      axillary dissection (AD) or sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic drainage from the upper arm is often different from that of the breast, allowing&#xD;
      safe removal of only the lymphatics of the breast and protection of the lymphatic channels&#xD;
      draining the upper extremity during axillary dissection (AD) or sentinel lymph node (SLN)&#xD;
      biopsy, thereby reducing the risk of arm lymphedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, breast cancer patients undergoing SLN biopsy (n=20) or axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection (n=5) will be enrolled to undergo axillary reverse mapping (ARM) using&#xD;
      isosulfan blue dye. Participants will also receive ICG injection with visualization through&#xD;
      the OnLume Imaging System to allow comparison of blue dye versus ICG lymphatic&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care (blue dye) will be used for clinical care while the OnLume Imaging&#xD;
      System is being used to determine feasibility of the product.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Imaging data will be collected on the day of surgery (Day 1) - CNR will be measured up to five minutes post-injection of ICG]</time_frame>
    <description>A time curve of contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio of lymphatic vessels to background tissue will be measured over the time frame of up to five minutes post-injection. The fluorescence signal intensity in both (1) the lymphatic vessels and in (2) the surrounding tissue will be measured in fluorescence arbitrary units. These two values will be aggregated to calculate and report the CNR, which is a unitless ratio. The maximum CNR will be reported.</description>
