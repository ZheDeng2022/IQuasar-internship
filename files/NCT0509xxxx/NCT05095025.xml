    <textblock>
      The effective dose of local anaesthetic used in PENG blocks to achieve analgesia in patients&#xD;
      with fractured neck of femur is unknown. It is planned to address this question using a&#xD;
      dixon/massey sequential dosing methodology to establish the ED50 of 0.25% Bupivacaine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neck of femur (NOF) fracture is a common presentation to the emergency department,&#xD;
      particularly in the older population. 77,210 NOF fractures were recorded in the UK and&#xD;
      Ireland in 2018 and the number of cases is projected to increase as life expectancy improves.&#xD;
      NOF fracture is associated with a high social and economic cost, estimated to cost â‚¬45&#xD;
      million annually in Ireland with significant effects on patients' quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest Irish Hip Fracture Database (IHFD) report from 2019 detailed 3,701 NOF fractures&#xD;
      in patients over 60 years of age in Ireland. These patients occupied 72,314 acute hospital&#xD;
      bed days nationally and 437 of these patients attended CUH. This frail and vulnerable group&#xD;
      had an average age of 81 and many people suffered numerous co-morbid conditions. This&#xD;
      population of patients is therefore at significant risk of complications and require&#xD;
      multidisciplinary input to optimise clinical outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a patient's perspective, NOF fracture is a very painful condition, requiring early&#xD;
      surgical fixation. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The 30-day&#xD;
      mortality for this condition has improved recently. This has likely multifactorial, in part&#xD;
      due to the introduction of clinical guidelines, national audits, a focus on processes and&#xD;
      changes in how hip fracture care is funded. However, 5% of patients who sustained a hip&#xD;
      fracture in Ireland in 2019 died. An additional 4% of patients required new admission to a&#xD;
      nursing home following this fracture and a further 13% required convalescent care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are also particularly at risk for under treatment of pain. Contraindications&#xD;
      to many commonly used analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exist&#xD;
      in this population, including renal dysfunction in 40%. Older adults suffer more adverse&#xD;
      effects from opiate analgesia such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness and&#xD;
      respiratory complications. This population also have a 25% incidence of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      which may make communication and assessment of their pain more challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anaesthesia (RA) has been extensively researched in this group of patients with a&#xD;
      view to improving the quality of pain relief while reducing the side effects of analgesic&#xD;
      medications used. In 2017, a Cochrane review on RA in the management of patients with NOF&#xD;
      fractures concluded that there was high quality evidence that RA reduces pain on movement&#xD;
      within 30 minutes after block placement and reduces opioid consumption and moderate quality&#xD;
      evidence that RA reduces the incidence of pneumonia, time to first mobilization and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Widespread use of RA on admission to hospital and in the early postoperative period is also&#xD;
      supported by the latest Association of Anaesthetists' (AoA)guideline: &quot;Guideline for the&#xD;
      management of hip fractures 2020&quot;. In this, femoral or fascia iliaca blocks are recommended&#xD;
      as pericapsular nerve group (PENG) blocks have not yet been compared with these more&#xD;
      established blocks in trials. It is also recommend that general anaesthesia or spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia should be routinely supplemented with RA and state that there is little evidence&#xD;
      at present for continuous catheter techniques which may delay remobilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single injection RA blocks are limited by their short duration which can be prolonged by&#xD;
      continuous catheter techniques. A study from Cork University Hospital published in 2012&#xD;
      demonstrated more effective perioperative analgesia, reduced opiate consumption and improved&#xD;
      patient satisfaction when continuous femoral nerve blockade was compared with a standard&#xD;
      opiate based regime in patients with NOF fractures for up to 54 hours on passive movement and&#xD;
      up to 42 hours at rest. However, femoral nerve blockade can be associated with weakness of&#xD;
      the quadriceps muscle, possibly reducing early postoperative mobility and increasing the risk&#xD;
      of falls. A study of healthy volunteers demonstrated a significant reduction in quadriceps&#xD;
      strength and balance scores following femoral nerve blockade. Another study suggested a&#xD;
      causal relationship between continuous peripheral nerve blocks and falls after hip and knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block, first described in 2018, is a RA technique which&#xD;
      aims to provide analgesia for patients with NOF fractures by blocking sensory branches of the&#xD;
      femoral nerve, obturator nerve and accessory obturator nerve to the anterior hip capsule.&#xD;
      This may improve analgesia to the NOF fracture site compared with femoral nerve blockade,&#xD;
      while sparing the branches of the femoral nerve which supply motor innervation to the&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle, thereby lessening muscle weakness. A published dissection of an embalmed&#xD;
      cadaver injected with 10ml and 20ml of dye via PENG block demonstrated that both volumes&#xD;
      spread to the articular branches of the femoral, obturator and accessory obturator nerves but&#xD;
      there is no published data in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous catheter techniques have also been described for this block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to measure the dose of bupivacaine required to provide adequate analgesia at&#xD;
      30 minutes. As described above, there is a lack of available data on the effective dose.&#xD;
      Given the proposed mechanism and the demonstrated spread of local anaesthetic injected via&#xD;
      PENG block, as well as published results from case series, it is plausible that PENG blocks&#xD;
      produce superior analgesia to the currently used femoral blocks and fascia iliaca blocks. For&#xD;
      similar reasons, PENG blocks are likely associated with significantly less leg weakness&#xD;
      compared with femoral nerve blocks; there are 2 reported cases in the published literature,&#xD;
      both attributed to inadvertent femoral block. Finally, the latest AoA guidelines cite a lack&#xD;
      of evidence and delayed remobilization as reasons against using continuous catheter&#xD;
      techniques. Lack of motor weakness is a proposed benefit of this block and the possibility of&#xD;
      improved pain relief postoperatively is likely to enhance a patient's remobilisation,&#xD;
      increasing the importance of this study.&#xD;
