  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This within-subjects study aims to evaluate the subjective rewarding value, the relative&#xD;
      reinforcing value, and the absolute reinforcing value of sweet flavored cigarillos across&#xD;
      three separate laboratory visits among 86 young adults (ages 18-24 years old) who have&#xD;
      previously smoked &gt; 10 or more cigarillos in their lifetime.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective rewarding value of cigarillo flavoring will be measured with the Cigarette Evaluation Scale (CES) adapted for cigarillo use. The CES is an 11 item Likert-format (1=not at all to 7=extremely) self-report instrument with established validity and reliability (Î± &gt; .80). The investigators will focus on the satisfaction subscale . Primary Outcome measured at visit 1.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relative reinforcing value of cigarillo flavoring</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Relative reinforcing value of cigarillo flavoring will be measured with a validated choice paradigm, evaluating the preference for sweet flavored vs non-flavored cigarillos. RRVF will be defined by the breakpoint (highest trial completed across 10 trials to earn puffs for sweet flavored versus non-flavored cigarillos) Primary Outcome measured at visit 2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute reinforcing value of cigarillo flavoring</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute reinforcing value of cigarillo flavoring is operationalized as the number of sweet flavored versus non- flavored cigarillo puffs consumed during the ad libitum smoking session. A research assistant will videotape, monitor, and count the number of cigarillo puffs taken during the 90-minute period. The primary comparison is the amount of consumption (puffs) of the sweet flavored versus non-flavored cigarillo. Primary Outcome measured at visit 3.</description>
