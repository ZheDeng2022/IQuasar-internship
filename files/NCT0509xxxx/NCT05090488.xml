  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease with increasing incidence globally. It needs a&#xD;
      comprehensive and continuous management approach that includes five pillars: education,&#xD;
      nutritional management, physical activity, pharmacological treatment, and monitoring. To&#xD;
      achieve good glycemic control, prevention of complications, and good quality of life as&#xD;
      diabetes management goals, patients' capability to properly navigate diabetes management is a&#xD;
      key. One evidence-based model to empower patients' self-management abilities is diabetes&#xD;
      education and health coaching. Diabetes management at primary health care needs special&#xD;
      concern since they play an important role in initial and continuing care for diabetes&#xD;
      patients in the community. Therefore, the implementation of diabetes education and health&#xD;
      coaching in primary health care is expected to improve the self-management abilities of&#xD;
      people with diabetes&#xD;

      A randomized control trial, pre and post study involving 180 subjects randomized into 2 arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control : received education in group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention : received education group + personal health coaching Education group&#xD;
           divided into 6 session, which for each session consist of 2 different topics and lasts&#xD;
           for 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health coaching was given by a coach, a healthcare professional who undergo training to&#xD;
      become a coach. Health coaching delivered as face to face between subjects and coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory examination, anthropometric measurement, echocardiography, electrocardiography,&#xD;
      Heart Rate Variability measurement, diabetic eye screening, and questionnaire collected at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 and 6 months after intervention&#xD;
