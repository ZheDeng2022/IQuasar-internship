      Sexual Function Changes in High-Risk Pregnancies&#xD;

      Background and Aim: Sexual functions generally decrease during pregnancy, and high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies are more severe clinical conditions that cause couples to reduce or abstain&#xD;
      entirely from their intimacy. However, the evidence on the sexual functions in high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the sexual function changes in&#xD;
      high-risk pregnancies compared to normal pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 200 pregnant women (100 women in high-risk pregnancy and normal pregnancy&#xD;
      groups each) were included. Demographic and obstetric data were collected, and participants&#xD;
      completed The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).&#xD;
