  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized-controlled trial to assess the safety of remote consultations (both video and&#xD;
      teleconsultation) in the follow-up of patients in the hospital setting. A total of 6000&#xD;
      patients will be randomly allocated into one of the three study arms: A) face-to-face&#xD;
      consultation (control) B) telephone consultation C) video consultation. Primary outcome will&#xD;
      be the frequency of complications of the underlying disease, including adverse reactions to&#xD;
      the treatment of the underlying disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for remote consultation, patients have to have adequate digital literacy at&#xD;
      physician discretion, technological capacity to use the video conferencing software, and&#xD;
      undergo a type of follow-up that, due to the moderate complexity of the pathology, do not&#xD;
      require physical examinations. Patients followed up in more than three departments, those&#xD;
      with visual or hearing impairments that may hamper patient-physician communication, and those&#xD;
      enrolled in another clinical trial that requires an experimental intervention during the&#xD;
      follow-up will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians can schedule and cancel appointments at their discretion. At least three visits&#xD;
      should be scheduled in the study setting: the baseline visit (i.e., screening visit),&#xD;
      intermediate visits (pre-defined by the physician based on the follow-up needed for managing&#xD;
      the baseline condition), and the final visit (i.e., either the follow-up visit closest to 12&#xD;
      ± 2 months after enrollment or before in case of discharge or early discontinuation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be assessed using a non-inferiority analysis of the cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of complications of the baseline disease between remote consultation (video and&#xD;
      teleconsultation arms) and face-to-face consultation, using a non-inferiority margin of 2%.&#xD;
      The analysis will be based on a modified binomial test to assess the non-inferiority of an&#xD;
      experimental intervention vs. a control group in a three-arm trial. The primary analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted on a per-protocol study sample, which will include all participants who have&#xD;
      finished the study and have not been withdrawn because of non-allowed visits using modalities&#xD;
      other than scheduled.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be scheduled with face-to-face appointments as usual (control arm). All phone calls (except reminders for scheduled visits) performed by the physician during the study will be recorded. Per protocol, participants allocated in the control arm can receive up to 25% of physician-doctor interactions by phone (that is, one phone call allowed for three face-to-face appointments).</description>
