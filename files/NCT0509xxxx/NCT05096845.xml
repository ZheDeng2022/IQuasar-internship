      A Global, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Clinical&#xD;
      Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Fusion&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      phase III clinical study. Approximately 22,500 participants aged 18 years and older will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of recombinant&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein vaccine (code: V-01, hereinafter referred to as V-01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio into investigational vaccine&#xD;
      group (V-01) and placebo group, with random stratification factors including 1) age (18-59&#xD;
      years vs ≥60 years); 2) gender (male vs female); and 3) whether or not being enrolled into&#xD;
      immunogenicity subgroup (yes vs no). The participants will receive investigational vaccine&#xD;
      V-01 or placebo on two doses schedule (one dose each on day 0 and 21, with +7 days' time&#xD;
      window for the second dose).&#xD;
