  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serious infections refer to life-threatening infections with a morbidity and mortality rate&#xD;
      of up to 50%, and are the main cause of death in critically ill patients, mainly including&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, infectious shock, or systemic multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction syndrome. Patients with severe infections have rapid disease development, which&#xD;
      can cause disorders of cellular circulation and metabolism and impairment of multi-organ&#xD;
      function in the early stage, mostly accompanied by clinical complications, and despite the&#xD;
      progress of medical technology and the popularization of antibiotic application, the&#xD;
      mortality and disability rate is high, which is a hot spot of clinical research today.&#xD;
      Patients with severe infections are exposed to a wide range of medical risk factors,&#xD;
      including patient factors (advanced age, frailty, malnutrition, long hospital stay, prolonged&#xD;
      bed rest), disease factors (immune deficiency, malignancy, diabetes, renal failure, liver&#xD;
      failure), drug factors (long-term use of steroid hormones, chemotherapeutic drugs, NSAIDs,&#xD;
      etc.), interventional factors (central venous catheter, recent invasive surgery,&#xD;
      hemodialysis, endotracheal intubation or mechanical ventilation, etc.), which bring great&#xD;
      challenges to clinical treatment. Therefore, early identification of risk indicators for&#xD;
      deterioration of infected patients provides a strategic basis for the medical team to take&#xD;
      early warning measures to prevent deterioration and poor prognosis, and to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      deterioration of patients, which is also the key to reduce the risk of death of infected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
