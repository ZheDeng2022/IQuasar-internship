  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal depression influences the development of children's behavior problems and vice&#xD;
      versa; however most interventions singularly address maternal depression or children's&#xD;
      behavior problems rather than both. This project assesses the efficacy of an intervention&#xD;
      that treats both mothers and children in an integrated manner. Effects are expected to&#xD;
      disrupt the reciprocal relations that perpetuate maternal and child mental health problems&#xD;
      over time.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an integrated intervention that dually treats maternal depressive symptoms and offspring&#xD;
      behavior problems. Families (n = 40 mothers and their 2-to-4 year-old children) will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive 10 sessions of ABC or 10 sessions of ABC+D in their home. ABC+D is an&#xD;
      expanded version of ABC that additionally treats maternal depressive symptoms using Mothers&#xD;
      and Babies adapted for mothers of toddlers. The specific aims of this proposed project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Collect preliminary data on the feasibility and acceptability of ABC+D in preparation&#xD;
      for a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Conduct a small pilot RCT to examine the effectiveness of ABC and ABC+D&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Assess the overall acceptability (mother- and provider-rated), appropriateness&#xD;
      (mother- and provider-rated), and feasibility (provider-rated) of ABC+D. Mothers will also&#xD;
      rate their satisfaction with each session and the degree to which it was helpful,&#xD;
      interesting, and comprehensible.&#xD;
