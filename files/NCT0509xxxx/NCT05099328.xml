  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) affects approximately seven percent of the population&#xD;
      and is characterized by grammatical deficits that cascade into lifelong academic challenges&#xD;
      and under-employment. Current treatments for DLD produce good outcomes under ideal, high&#xD;
      intensity conditions or when parents have been trained to deliver therapy using intense&#xD;
      coaching methods; however, current publicly funded service delivery systems and private-pay&#xD;
      reimbursement models do not support treatment being delivered in this ideal fashion for&#xD;
      children older than three. This project will examine alternative methods of delivering&#xD;
      treatment that may be more feasible under typical conditions and will identify implementation&#xD;
      barriers, with the goal of improving long-term outcomes for children with DLD. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that feasibility and palatability will influence dose, which will in turn affect the overall&#xD;
      language outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Children are stratified based on treatment site. Then they are randomly assigned to receive treatment for 1 of 2 targets, using 1 of 4 methods of intervention. Each child is randomly assigned to parent or clinician delivered intervention using books or recast therapy (2x2 design). Then assignment to treatment targets is assigned so that it is evenly distributed within each condition.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Accuracy on Elicited Production Probes</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week prior to the start of therapy; 2 week post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Children will respond to 20 item elicited production probes that ask the child to produce the treated structures and a control structure. Elicited Production Probes are highly reliable (ICC &gt;.9), valid measures of children's use of a grammatical form. They have clinical relevance and align with the types of items that occur on standardized tests of language use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Comprehension probes (Proportion Looking)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week prior to the start of therapy, 2 week post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Children will participate in an online looking while listening task with 24 items each for the treated target and a control (untreated) structure. Looks to areas of interest on the screen will be recorded. Proportion of time looking at the target picture will be the dependent variable. Looking patterns provide insight into the online processes associated with language comprehension and thus has the potential to inform future studies. These online measures have become well accepted as valid means of understanding comprehension. As far as we are aware there is limited psychometric data available for this age group, but Farris-Trimble &amp; McMurray (2013) have shown these types of paradigms to be reliable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Dose Delivered</measure>
    <time_frame>During 10 week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence (attendance, reported therapy delivery)and treatment fidelity derived from recordings will be combined to estimate the number of exposures/recasts the caregiver provided to the child. This primary measure is important for future studies given the need to understand how well treatment is provided by parents and lab staff for these types of syntactic forms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Semi-structured interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 weeks post therapy ( ~12- 14 week mark in study timeline)</time_frame>
    <description>Ethnographic interview examines the caregiver's comfort and understanding and motivation for participation in therapy. Ethnographic interviewing is a valid and reliable technique for qualitative data collection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Comprehension probes (Pointing)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week prior to the start of therapy, 2 week post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Children will participate in an online looking while listening task with 24 items each for the treated target and a control (untreated) structure. Points to the correct picture after the conclusion of eye gaze collection will be the dependent variable.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver grammar knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>In the first 1.5 weeks of the treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Written grammar quiz adapted from Brimo (in press). This questionnaire was previously validated for pre-service SLPs, early childhood educators, and practicing SLPs. The first two sections (implicit knowledge) have been used by Brimo. The last two sections (labeling) have been used in our lab to assess the knowledge of graduate clinicians.</description>

It is not possible to fully de-identify the interviews utilized in the mixed methods study (Aim 3). Thus, these data will not be shared. Additional data at the individual participant level may be sharable upon request and IRB approval for particular access.</ipd_description>
