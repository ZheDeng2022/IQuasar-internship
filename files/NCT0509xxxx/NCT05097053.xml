      This primary objective of the study is to measure the anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      titers in adult participants in order to demonstrate the immunogenicity and safety of&#xD;
      heterologous third-boost with MVC-COV1901, in terms of the neutralizing antibody GMTs at 28&#xD;
      days after the study intervention. This study also assesses the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the study intervention and explores the immunogenicity by the antigen-specific immunoglobulin&#xD;
      as well as the potential efficacy of study intervention in preventing COVID-19. This study is&#xD;
      aimed to recruit participants at single study site in Northern Taiwan.&#xD;
