  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to walk properly after stroke is a highly desired goal among stroke survivors and&#xD;
      their relatives; because the gait is believed as a yardstick for measuring recovery, too much&#xD;
      time is spent on gait re-education and recovery of mobility during rehabilitation. Despite&#xD;
      rehabilitation efforts, almost 80% of survivors still experience impaired walking function&#xD;
      and a further 22% do not regain any walking function at all.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death in both developed and developing countries.&#xD;
      Stroke as one of the major public health problems in the world is also one of the most common&#xD;
      causes of long-term disabilities among adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study has revealed that the use of additional weight on the affected lower limb in aquatic&#xD;
      exercise medium improves stability in the stance phase and decreased unwanted limb flotation&#xD;
      in people with stroke. However, the study was limited by the use of handrail which could&#xD;
      affect the study outcomes due to restriction of trunk and arm movements. Also, the outcome of&#xD;
      the study is not generalizable because water qualities such as buoyancy may have had an&#xD;
      influence on some gait outcomes. As such, the findings may not be the same as what can be&#xD;
      obtained with over-ground training. It is observed however that little attention has been&#xD;
      given to applying weight on the paretic lower limb during over-ground training as a means of&#xD;
      correcting Spatio-temporal gait asymmetry and improving lower limb motor functions in the&#xD;
      clinics and there is a paucity of research in that area. Only a cross-sectional study&#xD;
      reported that a single bout of weight application at the knee and ankle were both found to&#xD;
      influence changes in the Spatio-temporal parameters and gait symmetry with ankle loading&#xD;
      leading to changes in more gait parameters. It is apparent that there is a need for&#xD;
      well-designed research to evaluate the influence of paretic limb loading during over-ground&#xD;
      training on Spatio-temporal gait parameters and lower extremity recovery post-stroke.&#xD;
      Furthermore, paretic limb loading during the over-ground approach could also be more&#xD;
      accessible and affordable in a resource constraint setting compared to the aquatic and&#xD;
      treadmill training. This study is hoped to serve as an RCT to evaluate the effects of paretic&#xD;
      lower limb loading during over-ground training on gait characteristics (Spatio-temporal gait&#xD;
      parameters, gait symmetry) and motor functions among stroke survivors.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized into either group A (experimental: overground walking with limb loading) or group B (control: overground walking with limb loading).&#xD;
Both groups will receive a warm-up consisting of passive stretching to hamstrings and calf muscles, and a range of motion exercise to the lower limbs for 5 min. Participants allocated to group A will receive conventional exercises (15 min) and then rest for 2 min, then proceeded with overground walking training with lower limb loading (15-25 min), and rest for 2 min. Those assigned to group B will receive the same conventional exercises (15 min) and overground walking but without lower limb loading.&#xD;
Treatment in both groups will be delivered thrice weekly for 8 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Upon completion of all the baseline assessments, consenting participants will be stratified by Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) scores (i.e. 1, 2, and 3) and randomized into one of the two groups; overground walking with lower limb loading (experimental group), overground walking without lower limb loading (control group) in a 1:1 ratio (i.e. 30 participants per group) by a third party not involved in other aspects of the study. Allocation of participants will be concealed using consecutive numbered, sealed, and opaque envelopes prepared using a web-based randomization tool (available at http://www.randomization.com) with permuted block sizes of 2 and 6.&#xD;
All outcome assessors will be blinded to participants' group allocation. However, it will be impossible to blind the Physical therapists and the participants considering the nature of the interventions.</masking_description>

    <description>Each participant will perform three trials of walking and the spatial gait parameters will be recorded in each trial; the average will be computed. The measurements will be carried out in centimeters (cm) using measuring tape each for the paretic lower limb loading and paretic lower limb non-loading during the over-ground training. The parameters to be measured are: Step length, stride length, foot angle, and stride width.</description>

    <description>Each participant will perform three trials of walking and the temporal gait parameters will be recorded in each trial; the average will be computed. The measurements will be carried out in seconds (sec) using a stop watch each for the paretic lower limb loading and paretic lower limb non-loading during the over-ground training. The parameters to be measured are: Step time, stride time, single limb support time, stance time, swing time, cadence, and gait speed.</description>

    <description>The Motricity Index will be used to measure the lower limb functions of the participants. It is a reliable instrument for measuring the strength of the involved lower extremity when assessment following chronic stroke.&#xD;
Participant position: The test is administered in a sitting position. Patient will be asked to sit on a chair or on the edge of the bed. In the lower limb, the three movements to be tested are: hip flexion, knee extension, and dorsiflexion. The assessment will be carried out just before the over-ground training. All the data will be recorded. Thereafter, the total score of each participant will then be computed and documented.&#xD;
Scorings: 0 (No movement); 9 (Palpable contraction in muscle, but no movement); 14 (Visible movement, but not full range and not against gravity); 19 (Full range movement against gravity, but not resistance); 25 (Full movement against gravity, but weaker than the other side); 33 (Normal power).</description>

    <description>Participants will perform the over-ground training exercise with an external 1.5kg load on the paretic lower limb placed 2cm above the ankle joint. Before commencing the over-ground training, all the participants will observe a pre-exercise rest period of about two (2) minutes during which their heart rate and blood pressure measurements will be recorded.&#xD;
The over-ground training will involve the patients walking within a demarcated path. Each participant will be instructed to stand and walk 15meters to and fro for five (5) minutes after which they will be asked to stop and rest for two (2) minutes. The over ground training exercise will be repeated 3 times in the first 2 weeks of the training (15 minutes); 4 times in weeks 3-4 of the training (20 minutes); and 5 times in weeks 5-8 of the training (25 minutes).</description>
