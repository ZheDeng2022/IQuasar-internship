  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine if a standard group-delivered cognitive behavioral lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention for weight loss can be improved via the incorporation of a novel body image&#xD;
      intervention designed to address body image and improve weight loss outcomes in a sample of&#xD;
      women with overweight/obesity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss is associated with improved morbidity and mortality in people with&#xD;
      overweight/obesity. Lifestyle-focused interventions reliably produce modest weight loss.&#xD;
      While some comprehensive multidisciplinary weight management interventions include behavioral&#xD;
      and psychosocial aspects of behavior change, including brief body image education, few have&#xD;
      focused substantially on body image as a potentially salient influence on motivation and/or&#xD;
      successful outcomes. Body image is an individual's perception of their physical self. A&#xD;
      common psychosocial correlate of obesity is body dissatisfaction, and research has shown that&#xD;
      individuals with obesity are more often dissatisfied with their bodies than individuals&#xD;
      without obesity. Multiple studies suggest that improving body image might enhance eating&#xD;
      self-regulation during weight management interventions and engagement in physical activity.&#xD;
      Additionally, negative body image has been associated with detrimental health outcomes, such&#xD;
      as emotional eating and avoidance of physical activity. Although body image has been&#xD;
      addressed in the context of obesity and weight management, it is often done in a cursory&#xD;
      manner. To date, no weight loss programs have attempted to develop a novel body image&#xD;
      intervention that specifically targets the necessary dichotomy between body acceptance and&#xD;
      expectable desire for body changes in a weight loss program. As such, the investigators will&#xD;
      examine if a standard group-delivered cognitive behavioral lifestyle intervention for weight&#xD;
      loss can be improved via the incorporation of a novel body image intervention designed to&#xD;
      address body image and improve weight loss outcomes.&#xD;
