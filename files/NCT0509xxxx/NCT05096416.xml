    <textblock>
      Infiltration of a surgically-placed hemodialysis vascular access (HVA) is recognized as a&#xD;
      major contributor to the high hospital re-admission rate in dialysis-dependent patients.&#xD;
      Three dimensional modeling has been demonstrated as a critical tool for procedurists in&#xD;
      preparation for surgical interventions but no such modeling is yet available for dialysis&#xD;
      specialists to avoid the common complication of HVA infiltration. Contrast enhanced magnetic&#xD;
      resonance angiography (MRA) can be used to generate a three dimensional image data that could&#xD;
      render a three dimensional resin-based model of a vascular access.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis is the most common treatment for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). For an optimal&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy, a patent vascular access (VA) is essential. The importance of good&#xD;
      vascular access maintenance has been strongly supported by the guidelines (1). Various&#xD;
      hinderances render this goal unachievable. A well-known cause of VA failure is access&#xD;
      infiltration, which is usually overlooked in clinical practices (2). The calculated economic&#xD;
      burden attributable to VA complication is between $16,864 -US$20,961 and more than 50% is due&#xD;
      to access infiltration alone (3). Imaging has a pivotal pre- and post-operative role in&#xD;
      evaluating vascular access complications. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), Digital&#xD;
      Subtraction Angiography (DSA) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) are available but&#xD;
      their use is limited due to the limited view of plane available for visualization of vessel&#xD;
      anatomy(4) and because of the deleterious side effects of the contrast agents used (5,6).&#xD;
      Contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) provides an excellent means of imaging&#xD;
      the vasculature (7) which can be reconstructed in a three- dimensional(3D) print. The skill&#xD;
      set of dialysis technician nurses play a considerable role in achieving successful&#xD;
      cannulation of the fistula. Due oftentimes to complicated vascular anatomy, cannulation based&#xD;
      on cutaneous anatomic landmarks and physical examination can be deceiving. Even a minor error&#xD;
      in cannulation can impair access longevity(3). The 3D image reconstruction provides a&#xD;
      practical solution to generate a 3D VA model which can be used by the procedurists to&#xD;
      cannulate the patients, reducing the complications and rate of re admissions. Overall, a&#xD;
      significant reduction in the health care cost can be achieved&#xD;
