  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled unblinded trial to evaluate rates of&#xD;
      optimal blood pressure control between Nifedipine 60mg XL once daily vs. Nifedipine 30mg XL&#xD;
      twice daily in patients admitted for expectant management with pre-eclampsia with severe&#xD;
      features. Patients will be approached for consent when they are placed on 30mg of Nifedipine&#xD;
      daily by their primary provider and will be enrolled in the study when the primary provider&#xD;
      has made the decision to increase the patient's daily dose of Nifedipine XL from 30mg to&#xD;
      60mg.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled unblinded trial at The Ohio State University comparing&#xD;
      Nifedipine XL 60mg daily to 30mg twice daily in patients admitted for expectant management&#xD;
      for pre-eclampsia with severe features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be identified at the time of admission to the antepartum&#xD;
      unit. Inclusion criteria must be met, namely patient's age, gestational age, diagnosis of&#xD;
      preeclampsia with severe features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for consent when they are placed on 30mg of Nifedipine daily by&#xD;
      their primary provider and will be enrolled in the study when the primary provider has made&#xD;
      the decision to increase the patient's daily dose of Nifedipine XL from 30mg to 60mg.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized in to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once daily Nifedipine XL 60mg Vs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twice daily Nifedipine XL 30mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled and randomized, blood pressures will be monitored every 4 hours as is standard&#xD;
      on the antepartum unit. Blood pressures for the primary outcome will be collected 24 hours&#xD;
      after the patient is randomized and initiated on their above regimen. This is to allow the&#xD;
      medication to reach steady state prior to collected information on optimal blood pressures.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will consist of blood pressure values collected q4 hours beginning&#xD;
      24h-48h after receiving their first dose of the randomized dose regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithms for the administration of intravenous labetalol, Nifedipine or hydralazine will be&#xD;
      utilized by the primary provider at his or her discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women may take the medication concurrently with intravenous labetalol, hydralazine, or&#xD;
      immediate release Nifedipine for the treatment of severe blood pressures as determined by&#xD;
      their primary provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other obstetric care will be at the discretion of the primary provider, including but not&#xD;
      limited to addition of second long-acting hypertensive agents, decision to proceed with&#xD;
      delivery, IV magnesium for seizure prophylaxis and recommendations regarding mode of&#xD;
      delivery. Data will be collected on these components of routine obstetric care. Analysis will&#xD;
      be by intent to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of patients will be enrolled for a pharmacokinetic study and blood will be collected&#xD;
      at prespecified times following administration of the randomized Nifedipine XL regimen.&#xD;
