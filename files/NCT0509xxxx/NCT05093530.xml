  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled first in human study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The study will assess the safety and tolerability of single-ascending (Part&#xD;
      A) and multiple-ascending (Part B) doses of Neumifil, administered intranasally.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A will include up to 36 healthy subjects in up to 5 groups. 6 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Groups A1-A3 and 9 subjects will be enrolled in Groups A4 and A5. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive a single intranasal dose of Neumifil or placebo. In Groups A1-A3, 4 subjects will&#xD;
      receive Neumifil and 2 will receive matching placebo. In Groups A4 and A5, 6 subjects will&#xD;
      receive Neumifil and 3 will receive matching placebo. The planned dose levels are: 0.028 mg&#xD;
      (Group A1), 0.085 mg (Group A2), 0.28 mg (Group A3), 0.885 mg (Group A4), and 2.8 mg (Group&#xD;
      A5). Additional dose levels may be assessed in up to 2 optional groups of up to 9 subjects&#xD;
      each (Groups A6 and A7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 35 days before their dose of trial medication and reside at&#xD;
      the Investigator site from the day before their dose (Day -1) until approximately 24 hours&#xD;
      after dosing (Day 2). They will return for a follow-up visit on Day 8-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will include up to 24 healthy subjects in up to 3 groups of 8 subjects (Groups B1-B3).&#xD;
      Subjects will receive once-daily intranasal doses of Neumifil or placebo for 7 days. In each&#xD;
      group, 6 subjects will receive Neumifil and 2 subjects will receive matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose level (dose and dose regimen) for Group B1 will be decided after review of&#xD;
      safety and tolerability data from at least 3 dose levels in Part A, and will be no higher&#xD;
      than a dose that has previously been shown to cause no safety concerns in Part A . An&#xD;
      additional dose level may be explored in 1 optional group of up to 8 subjects (Group B4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 35 days before their dose of trial medication and reside. at&#xD;
      the Investigator site from the day before their first dose (Day -1) until about 24 hours&#xD;
      after their last dose (Day 8). Subjects will attend an outpatient visit on Days 15-16. They&#xD;
      will return for a follow-up visit on Days 21-23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, dose levels for study groups will be determined by a Safety Review&#xD;
      Committee in accordance with criteria defined in the study protocol and the Investigator site&#xD;
      operating procedures. Dose levels will only be increased if the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      previous dose levels are considered to be acceptable by the Safety Review Committee.&#xD;

    <description>Neumifil will be administered intranasally using an Aptar delivery system. Each dose will consist of 0.5ml to each nostril, with adjusted concentrations of solution to enable dose ranging. Participants in Part A will receive a single dose of Neumifil and participants in Part B will receive once daily doses of Neumifil for 7 days according to the randomization.&#xD;
Ascending single doses for Part A are anticipated to be 0.028mg (group A1), 0.085mg (group A2), 0.28mg (group A3), 0.885mg (group A4) and 2.8mg (group A5). Two further groups of up to 9 subjects may be investigated. The planned dose levels may change following review of the safety and tolerability of previous doses. The maximum dose will not exceed 2.8mg.&#xD;
The starting dose level (dose and dose regimen) in Part B will be determined following review of the safety and tolerability of at least 3 dose levels in part A and subsequent dose levels will be determined following review of the safety and tolerability of previous doses.</description>
