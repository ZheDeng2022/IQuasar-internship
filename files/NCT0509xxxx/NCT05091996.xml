    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the degree of relaxation of the anterior part of the&#xD;
      temporal muscles and the masseter muscles achieved with the use of post-isometric relaxation&#xD;
      and myofascial release methods in patients requiring prosthetic treatment due to&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD) with a dominant muscular component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 60 patients, both sexes, aged between 19 and 40. The patients who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were alternately assigned to one of the two study groups: I group&#xD;
      consisted of the patients received post-isometric relaxation treatment (PIR), II group -&#xD;
      patients received myofascial release treatment (MFR). Each group consisted of 30 subjects.&#xD;
      The series of ten treatments were performed in both groups. The comparative assessment was&#xD;
      carried out based on the data obtained from the physical examination, physiotherapeutic&#xD;
      examination of the masticatory system, surface electromyography (sEMG) of anterior temporal&#xD;
      and masseter muscles and the data on the intensity of spontaneous masticatory muscle pain&#xD;
      assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change From Baseline Electrical Activity of the Muscles at 10, and 14 days; Triple measurement: immediately before supportive treatment, after the last of the 10 relaxation treatments and on the 4th day after the end of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The electrical activity of the anterior part of the temporal and masseter muscles was assessed by surface electromyography (sEMG). The assessment was performed using a two-channel device - NeuroTrac MyoPlus 4 (Verity Medical Ltd.) and surface electrodes (Noraxon inc.). Examination of the same muscles on the right and left sides of the body was performed at the same time. The muscle tone of the anterior part of the temporal muscles was assessed first, followed by the masseter muscles. The parameter describing the degree of electrical activity of the muscle was the mean value of the thirty-second sEMG measurement.</description>

    <description>Assessment of the intensity of spontaneous pain in the masticatory muscles The intensity of spontaneous pain in the masticatory muscles was assessed on the basis of a 10-point visual analogue scale(VAS).This scale included 11 pain grades- from 0 to 10,where 0 was no pain at all, 5 was moderate pain, and 10 was the strongest pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>1: Therapist (T) abducted the patients' (P) mandible until the functional barrier. P performed isometric tension of the mandibular adductors with about 20% of the maximum force, balanced by the T. After 10 secs of isometric tension, P relaxed his muscles, and T abducted the mandible to a new functional barrier. During one treatment, the cycle was repeated 3 times, each time starting from the previously obtained barrier.&#xD;
2: T performed passive lateral translation of the mandible until the functional barrier. P performed isometric tension with about 20% of maximum force, as to initiate the movement of the mandible towards the resting position. T balanced the force generated by the P. After 10 secs of isometric tension, P relaxed his muscles and T deepened the lateral movement of the mandible until a new functional barrier was reached. During one treatment, the cycle was repeated 3 times, both to the right and left side, each time starting from the previously obtained barrier.</description>

    <description>The myofascial release procedure was performed successively in the area of: the anterior parts of the temporal muscles , the superficial parts of the masseter muscles and the sternocleidomastoid muscles.During one session, the above cycle was repeated six times on both sides separately. The was lying on his back, with his head turned to the side.The therapist was behind the patient's head, using the pad of the first finger placed on the skin in the area of the initial attachment of a worked muscle, he took out the tissue slack, moving the tissues towards the perceptible limitation of mobility (caudal direction).Reaching the tissue barrier, he kept the tension of the sliding structures, shifting them until the physiological tissue barrier.A single application of the myofascial release procedure consisted of one movement moving the soft tissues along the muscle</description>
