  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomized control trial with a blocking method to determine the&#xD;
      effect of an occupational therapy focused pre-operative education on 3 pre-determined&#xD;
      diagnosis: Carpometacarpal (CMC) Arthroplasty, Distal radius fracture requiring open&#xD;
      reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and tendon repairs of the hand. Possible participants will&#xD;
      be recruited through Cape Fear Orthopedics &amp; Sports Medicine and receiving care from an&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon &amp; hand specialist. Researchers hypothesize that those who receive the&#xD;
      occupational therapy consult will demonstrate improved adherence with occupational therapy&#xD;
      appointments, improved patient perceived function, and overall improved experiences with the&#xD;
      pre-operative patient experience.&#xD;

      Participants will be identified by orthopedic surgeon. Once informed consent is obtained&#xD;
      participants will subsequently be randomly assigned to the control or experimental block&#xD;
      associated with their diagnosis. Patients will be randomly assigned within their diagnosis&#xD;
      block through random number generation in Microsoft Excel. Participants randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the control group will receive the current &amp; typical educational information provided by&#xD;
      their orthopedic surgeon. Participants randomly assigned to the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive an additional occupational therapy (OT) focused pre-operation education consultation&#xD;
      provided by a third year occupational therapy student under the supervision of an orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeon &amp; Occupational Therapist &amp; Certified Hand Therapist. The additional OT pre-operative&#xD;
      consult will be included during participants scheduled pre-operative appointment. Specific&#xD;
      pre-op appointments are only conducted when patients have not been seen by a provider within&#xD;
      4-weeks of their surgical date. If surgery is scheduled within 4-weeks of the patients last&#xD;
      encounter with a provider an additional pre-op visit is not required. Since two of the three&#xD;
      pre-determined diagnosis of interest are typically associated with trauma, participants may&#xD;
      receive their OT consult at their first encounter with the orthopedic surgeon which is also&#xD;
      considered their pre-op visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OT consult provided to the individuals assigned to the experimental group will consist of&#xD;
      a one-on-one interaction with a third year occupational therapy doctorate (OTD) student&#xD;
      providing diagnosis specific educational materials inclusive of what to expect after surgery,&#xD;
      the importance of attending therapy as recommended by the orthopedic surgeon and how to&#xD;
      accurately complete the Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI). Outcomes of this research&#xD;
      will include UEFI scores at therapeutic evaluation, after 10 visits and upon discharge,&#xD;
      completion of a post operative survey via question pro utilizing a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)&#xD;
      at the initial therapeutic encounter, and patient compliance with attending therapy as&#xD;
      documented by therapy visit attendance. A semi-structured interview will be completed at&#xD;
      patient discharge from therapy to determine areas of possible improvement and further&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals randomly assigned to the control group will participate in the typical&#xD;
      pre-operative experience provided by the orthopedic surgeon. Control group participants will&#xD;
      not be made aware of experimental group participants experiences. Participants in the control&#xD;
      group will be informed that researchers are interested in the pre-operative patient&#xD;
      experiences at Cape Fear Orthopedics &amp; Sports Medicine and their participation in the study&#xD;
      and honest responses.&#xD;
