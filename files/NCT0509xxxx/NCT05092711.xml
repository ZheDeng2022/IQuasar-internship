      Using INTERASPIRE model to determine patients with established CHD whether the guidelines on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease prevention are being followed or not with incorporation of COVID 19 as&#xD;
      a risk factor with the other classical risk factors to understand significance of the new&#xD;

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels,&#xD;
      CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (commonly known as a heart attack. Other CVDs include stroke, heart failure, hypertensive&#xD;
      heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rhythms, congenital&#xD;
      heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease,&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 65th World Health Assembly in May 2012 Ministers of Health and Senior Health Officials&#xD;
      from the 194 WHO member states adopted a global target to reduce premature mortality from&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and in particular cardiovascular disease, by 25% by 2025.&#xD;
      The main objectives of CVD prevention are to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      improve quality of life, and increase life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 52 country INTERHEART study has shown that the classical risk factors for CHD account for&#xD;
      most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide. This scientific evidence has led to&#xD;
      international, regional and national guidelines on CVD prevention, which define patient&#xD;
      priorities for preventive action and lifestyle and treatment goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In 1994, 1998, 2003, 2007, 2012 and 2016. [3-7]. The European Society of Cardiology&#xD;
           together with other partner Societies has engaged in a comprehensive programme of CVD&#xD;
           prevention in clinical practice since 1994 with the acronym EUROASPIRE (European Action&#xD;
           on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. in 2012: Ministers of Health and Senior Health Officials: adopted a global target to&#xD;
           reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and in particular&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease, by 25% by 2025.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In [2], 2013 : The 52 country INTERHEART study has shown that the classical risk factors&#xD;
           for CHD account for most of the risk of myocardial infarction worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INTERASPIRE survey began when the ESC Euro Observational Research Programme decided to&#xD;
      expand the EUROASPIRE programme to include other WHO regions, starting with a pilot study in&#xD;
      Malaysia and Argentina in 2019. The main survey (2020-2022) is now being organised in&#xD;
      partnership with the World Heart Federation, Asia Pacific Society of Cardiology,&#xD;
      InterAmerican Society of Cardiology and the Pan-African Society of Cardiology and includes&#xD;
      selected countries in all 6 WHO regions: African Region, Region of Americas, Eastern&#xD;
      Mediterranean Region, European Region, South-East Asia Region, and Western Pacific Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This international study is being conducted through National Societies of Cardiology&#xD;
           which have responsibility for appointing National Coordinators, selecting geographical&#xD;
           regions (minimum of three) and hospital centres (minimum of 6 in each country) together&#xD;
           with Principal Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study population is a consecutive sample of coronary patients from each hospital&#xD;
           which meet the following diagnostic criteria: Acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial&#xD;
           infarction with ST elevation (STEMI) and Non ST elevation MI (Non-STEMI) and stable&#xD;
           coronary artery disease). Patients are interviewed and examined in hospital using&#xD;
           standardised methodology, including one central laboratory in Helsinki, Finland, for&#xD;
           measurement of fasting lipids, glucose, HbA1c, creatinine and urinary albumin, and then&#xD;
           followed up for hospitalisations, non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular events and all&#xD;
           cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using INTERASPIRE model to determine patients with established CHD whether the guidelines on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease prevention are being followed or not with incorporation of COVID 19 as&#xD;
      a risk factor with the other classical risk factors to understand significance of the new&#xD;
      pandemic virus in mortality and morbidity of CVD and coronary events in association with the&#xD;
      other known classical risk factors .&#xD;

        150 consecutive patients, men or women [≥18 years and &lt;80 years at the time of&#xD;
        identification]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient s may fulfil more than one of the following diagnostic criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elective CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elective PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute coronary syndromes (acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI) and&#xD;
             Non ST elevation MI (Non-STEMI) including those treated with primary PCI and/or CABG,&#xD;
             and unstable angina).&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is recognised that hospital diagnoses for AMI, and unstable angina without evidence of&#xD;
        infarction, may not always meet the World Heart Organisation (WHO) or other standard&#xD;
        diagnostic criteria. However, it is important to include all cases diagnosed as AMI or&#xD;
        unstable angina in hospital clinical practice because, as a consequence of these diagnoses,&#xD;
        they should all have received appropriate management for secondary prevention.&#xD;
