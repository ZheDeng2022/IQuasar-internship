  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of a surgical intervention is evaluated by different indicators: survival,&#xD;
      functional after-effects, regression of the clinical signs that led to the intervention, rate&#xD;
      of re-operation or re-hospitalization, etc. However, the success of an intervention and, more&#xD;
      generally, the quality of care are complex notions that include several aspects: technical,&#xD;
      human, narrative, relational, ethical and systemic aspects. Thus, quantitative criteria are&#xD;
      very useful and reliable indicators, but they must be integrated into a more global vision.&#xD;
      In particular, quality of care is not perceived in the same way by caregivers, patients and&#xD;
      their families. The integration of the patient experience in the design and implementation of&#xD;
      quality indicators opens new perspectives for reflection and action. For example,&#xD;
      patient-tracer questionnaires, which make it possible to evaluate the patient's experience&#xD;
      after the fact, have been developed by the High Authority for Health (HAS) and are now part&#xD;
      of the quality indicators in hospitals. Some studies have adopted a qualitative approach to&#xD;
      collect the patient's experience after surgery. However, there is currently no questionnaire&#xD;
      based on the patient's experience evaluating the success of a surgical procedure. The&#xD;
      objective of this work will be to report meta-narratives based on patients' experiences and&#xD;
      in a second step to build a quality questionnaire of the surgical pathway focused on&#xD;
      patients' needs.&#xD;
