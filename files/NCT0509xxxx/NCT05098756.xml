  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When aging, older people migrate to long-term care institutions. The elderly residents lack&#xD;
      autonomy due to the characteristics of group life. The decline of health function or the&#xD;
      occurrence of diseases can easily lead to reduced physical activity, decreased interpersonal&#xD;
      interaction, social withdrawal, low self-esteem, and decreased well-being. In current that&#xD;
      emphasizes the elderly in health promotion and disease prevention activities, art therapy can&#xD;
      be applied for the elderly to achieve the purpose of health promotion. Art therapy could&#xD;
      effectively improve social interaction, self-esteem, and well-being; but many researchers&#xD;
      still suggest that it is necessary to investigate the effectiveness of art therapy for&#xD;
      elderly residents in long-term care institutions. The purpose of this study is to explore the&#xD;
      effectiveness of art therapy in improving social interaction, self-esteem, and well-being for&#xD;
      elderly residents in long-term care institutions.&#xD;

    <description>An index-type instrument allows evaluating the quantity and quality of elders' participation in social activity in long-term care settings (Hsu, 2011). All organized into nine subcategories, including (1) all social contacts with family members and friends, (2) chatting with acquaintances, (3) holiday-related activities, (4) cognitive games, (5) involvement by outside organizations, (6) entertainment, (7) pleasure trips, (8) arts/crafts classes, and (9) religious activities (Hsu, 2011). Each subcategory contained three components: frequency, meaningfulness, and enjoyment (Hsu, 2011). The frequency ranged from 1 to 9, and meaningful-ness and enjoyment rated on a 4-point Likert rating ranged from 1 to 4 (Hsu, 2011). Higher scores represented more frequent participation in the activity, more significant meaning to one's life, and greater enjoyment in activity participation (Hsu, 2011).</description>
