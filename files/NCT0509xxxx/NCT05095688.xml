  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was considered as a heterogeneous&#xD;
      disease with multi-organ and multi-system design, which is related to various complications,&#xD;
      such as hypertension, obesity and arteriosclerosis. Studies have found that hypertension and&#xD;
      obesity are respectively associated with increased arterial stiffness. However, there is&#xD;
      still no research investigating the the relationship between lipids distribution and arterial&#xD;
      stiffness in HFpEF patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Before the 21st century, Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was&#xD;
      considered as a disease with simple diastolic dysfunction, but after the 21st century, HFpEF&#xD;
      was considered as a heterogeneous disease with multi-organ and multi-system design, which is&#xD;
      related to various complications, such as hypertension, obesity and arteriosclerosis. Other&#xD;
      studies have found that hypertension and obesity are respectively associated with increased&#xD;
      arterial stiffness. However, there is still no research investigating the the relationship&#xD;
      between lipids distribution and arterial stiffness in HFpEF patients.&#xD;
