  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 single-center, open-label, single-arm, study of a microbiological endpoint&#xD;
      using antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) for nasal disinfection in all patients&#xD;
      (universal) presenting for surgery at an acute care hospital for a wide range of surgical&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to gather data regarding the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      nasal photodisinfection treatment in eliminating colonization of the anterior nares with S.&#xD;
      aureus. The anterior nares are often considered the primary reservoir of S. aureus and other&#xD;
      pathogens on the body, therefore, this product could play an important role in helping to&#xD;
      eliminate this pathogen reservoir in patients. Since photodisinfection is a non-antibiotic&#xD;
      approach that does not generate antibiotic resistance, this could be a beneficial approach to&#xD;
      achieving nasal disinfection. Additionally, photodisinfection has an extremely broad spectrum&#xD;
      of activity and is effective against bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens including&#xD;
      emerging pathogens such as C. auris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2 study. Nasal cultures will be performed on all patients admitted for&#xD;
      surgery at Memorial Health University Medical Center over a 1-month period. This will&#xD;
      determine the prevalence rate of S. aureus and other pathogens in community patients who are&#xD;
      being admitted for surgery. The results of this culture will not be known to the research&#xD;
      staff until several days later. Clinical trial subjects will universally receive a nasal&#xD;
      disinfection treatment followed by a post-treatment culture. This will demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy of nasal disinfection against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;

    <description>All patients presenting for surgery will be offered nasal decolonization with the combination product. After informed consent a nasal culture will be obtained followed by a 4-minute nasal decolonization treatment and a post-treatment culture. The intervention consists of swabbing the nose with a methylene blue/chlorhexidine gluconate solution followed by non-thermal nasal illumination with red light. There will only be a single treatment.</description>
