  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      afflicting over 77,000 Canadians. Unfortunately, the therapeutic arsenal to relieve MS&#xD;
      symptoms is limited. It is therefore essential to develop better approaches to treat the&#xD;
      symptoms of MS. The use of cannabis for recreational purposes is now legal in Canada.&#xD;
      However, for many years, people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) have used cannabis either to&#xD;
      relax, to reduce pain and spasticity, or to improve sleep and daily functioning. Currently,&#xD;
      there is little scientifically established evidence that cannabis works on these symptoms in&#xD;
      people with MS. It is therefore important to carry out studies to better understand the&#xD;
      efficacy Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD) on MS symptoms . THC is known&#xD;
      for its analgesic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties and CBD seems to have&#xD;
      positive effects on anxiety and cognitive abilities (memory, concentration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, investigators hypothesize that administering different doses of THC alone,&#xD;
      CBD alone, and THC and CBD combined will result in a significant beneficial effect on&#xD;
      spasticity relief compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to document,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The efficacy of THC and CBD, alone and in combination, as add-on therapies to the&#xD;
           current standard treatments for relief of spasticity and other symptoms in PwMS (muscle&#xD;
           spasms and stiffness);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the tolerability profile of THC and CBD, alone and in combination, when used in&#xD;
           PwMS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify the mechanisms underlying such therapeutic and adverse effects of different&#xD;
           types of cannabis-based medicines in PwMS,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will initially receive THC 4mg/day or CBD 40mg/day or THC/CBD combination (THC&#xD;
      4mg and CBD 40mg/day), or placebo, on the first day. Dose will be increased up to 20mg (THC)&#xD;
      and 200mg (CBD) per day, if well tolerated. Participants will receive the allocated treatment&#xD;
      for a total of 4 weeks, followed by an additional 12 weeks of treatment for responders who&#xD;
      will be identified as patients who had a decrease from baseline in spasticity of at least one&#xD;
      point on the Numerical Rating Scale . THC and CBD will be taken as oil softgels in two&#xD;
      divided doses per day. Cannabis extract and placebo will taste and look exactly the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect from all contingencies and to minimize the risk of adverse reactions, the presence&#xD;
      of adverse events will be evaluated at each research visit, as well as through courtesy calls&#xD;
      between visits. If any mental or physical symptoms occur that require medical attention, the&#xD;
      PwMS will be referred as required to an attending neurologist, psychiatrist, or other&#xD;
      specialists .&#xD;

    <description>Eligibility, Screening and Baseline (T0):&#xD;
Candidates will be seen by both research staff and a neurologist. Full written informed consent will be obtained before completing questionnaires and administering physical and medical evaluations. If eligibility is confirmed, a blood sample will be collected followed by participant randomisation .&#xD;
Follow-up visits:&#xD;
Randomized participants come back after 4 weeks (T1) for the same assessments administered at T0. Only participants who had a decrease in their level of spasticity can continue their participation in the same allocated arm for an additional period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
At the end of the additional period of 12 weeks (T2), another visit is scheduled for a last assessments which are the same as T0 and T1.&#xD;
Throughout study, courtesy calls will be scheduled and standard care for MS will also be offered to ensure participants 'safety and well-being.</description>
