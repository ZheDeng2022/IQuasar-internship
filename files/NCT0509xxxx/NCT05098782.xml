  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A follow-up of a cohort of participants recruited for a prior study will be conducted. In the&#xD;
      prior study, 10-18 years olds were provided one of two treatments to improve the sleep of&#xD;
      adolescent night-owls. The follow-up will be approximately 6-years following participation in&#xD;
      the prior study. The goal is to establish long-term outcomes in sleep and circadian&#xD;
      functioning, in the five health-relevant domains and in engagement in sleep health behavior.&#xD;

      A follow-up of a cohort of participants recruited for a prior study will be conducted. In the&#xD;
      prior study, 10-18 years olds were provided one of two treatments to improve the sleep of&#xD;
      adolescent night-owls. This follow-up will be approximately 6-years following participation&#xD;
      in the prior study. The participants will be 18-28 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: At the 6-year follow-up, participants recruited for the prior study will be&#xD;
      assessed for sleep and circadian functioning and functioning in the five health- relevant&#xD;
      domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: The sample will also be assessed for their engagement in sleep health&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will advance knowledge on: (a) longer-term outcomes and (b) the role of&#xD;
      eveningness as a mechanism contributing to poorer outcomes.&#xD;
