  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study mainly investigates the therapeutic effect of Heart-Protecting Musk Pill (HMP) on&#xD;
      patients with diabetic microangiopathy. According to the indicators of diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      (DN), diabetic retinopathy (DR), oxidative stress and inflammatory factor in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic microvascular disease after using HMP, we aim to evaluate the effect of HMP on&#xD;
      diabetic microangiopathy, oxidative stress and inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes can lead to many diseases as diabetic macrovascular and microvascular complications&#xD;
      which result in high disability and mortality rate, thereby seriously affecting the quality&#xD;
      of life and life expectancy of diabetic patients. It not only aggravates the family burden of&#xD;
      patients, but also becomes the main burden of public health services around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are more serious in diabetic&#xD;
      microangiopathy. The glomerulus and retina have the similar tissue structure and&#xD;
      physiological function. Therefore, when they are exposured to the same risk factors can lead&#xD;
      to microcirculation damage of kidney and retina. DN and DR have similar pathogenesis and&#xD;
      development processes. Although the susceptibility genes and cytokines of DN and DR are&#xD;
      different, the two can still be predictors of each other and they often coexist in diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are few drugs with definite curative effect on the treatment of diabetic&#xD;
      microangiopathy, therefore the treatment of diabetic microangiopathy is an aspect that&#xD;
      urgently needs a breakthrough in chronic complications of diabetes. Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine has a history of preventing and treating diabetes for thousands of years. For the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic complications of diabetes by Chinese medicine, although there are not&#xD;
      many Chinese medicines that have obtained curative effects, it has indeed accumulated rich&#xD;
      experience in the process of research and clinical treatment that Western medicine could not&#xD;
      obtain. Therefore, seeking Chinese medicine to effectively treat diabetic microvascular&#xD;
      disease has become a direction worthy of attention and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart-Protecting Musk Pill (HMP) is a commonly used drug in clinical treatment, which&#xD;
      comprises seven medicinal substances: Radix Ginseng, Venenum Bufonis, Styrax, Calculus Bovis&#xD;
      Artifactus, Cortex Cinnamomi, Borneolum Syntheticum and Artificial Moschus. HMP is a&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicinal compound, which has been effectively used for treating coronary&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD) and diabetic macrovascular disease. However, studies on Chinese medicines&#xD;
      that are partially similar to HMP have shown that they can improve diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study of the efficacy of HMP on diabetic microangiopathy is extremely&#xD;
      valuable. Previous researches have shown that HMP owns the effects of reducing oxidative&#xD;
      stress, improving inflammation, anti-plateleting aggregation, promoting plasmin activity, and&#xD;
      improving hemodynamics. It is possible that HMP can delay or improve the occurrence and&#xD;
      development of diabetic microangiopathy through the above effects and even other unclear&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the drugs used for clinical treatment of type 2 diabetic microangiopathy are&#xD;
      limited. Although the pharmacological indications of HMP can be used to deal with the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications, there is still no clinical study of HMP&#xD;
      for the treatment of diabetic microvascular complications. Therefore, this study compared the&#xD;
      differences in indicators related to diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, oxidative&#xD;
      stress, and inflammatory factors between the control group and the HMP group before and after&#xD;
      treatment to clarify the therapeutic effect of HMP on diabetic microangiopaemia.&#xD;
