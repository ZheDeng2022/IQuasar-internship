      Offering PrEP care online and reducing the frequency of monitoring may increase access to HIV&#xD;
      PrEP. The objective of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of an internet-based HIV&#xD;
      PrEP-service and reduced frequency of monitoring visits in comparison to standard-of-care at&#xD;
      the Public Health Service in 4 regions in the Netherlands: Amsterdam, Rotterdam-Rijnmond,&#xD;
      Haagland and Gelderland-Zuid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The population impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) largely depends on&#xD;
      the uptake and consistent use of PrEP by people at high risk for HIV infection. In the Dutch&#xD;
      National PrEP Programme (NPP), PrEP care consists of quarterly monitoring visits, which&#xD;
      includes testing for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and renal function, and&#xD;
      provision of combination tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. PrEP&#xD;
      care is available for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender persons (TGP) at low&#xD;
      cost through the centers for sexual health (CSH) of public health services (GGD's). Offering&#xD;
      PrEP care online and reducing the frequency of monitoring may increase access to PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess the non-inferiority of an internet-based HIV PrEP-service and reduced&#xD;
      frequency of monitoring visits in comparison to standard-of-care at the Public Health&#xD;
      Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomised, non-blinded, controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: MSM and TGP of 18 years of age or older who are eligible for HIV PrEP&#xD;
      according to NPP guidelines based on self-reported sexual behavior indicating HIV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The study takes place in four GGD regions in the Netherlands: Amsterdam,&#xD;
      Haaglanden, Rotterdam-Rijnmond and Gelderland-Zuid. Participants will be assigned to one of&#xD;
      four arms: (1) routine care with quarterly monitoring at CSH; (2) routine care with biannual&#xD;
      monitoring at CSH; (3) internet-based PrEP-care (i.e. video consultations and online-mediated&#xD;
      testing for HIV, STIs and renal function) with quarterly monitoring; (4) internet-based&#xD;
      PrEP-care with biannual monitoring. Each participant will be followed for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is adherence to PrEP, determined by&#xD;
      self-reported daily data on pill-intake and sexual behavior. Non-adherence is defined as a&#xD;
      PrEP-less and condom-less anal sex act with a casual partner. Secondary outcomes include the&#xD;
      incidence of HIV and Hepatitis C virus infections and bacterial STIs; creatinine clearance,&#xD;
      glycosuria and proteinuria; retention in PrEP-care; psychosocial health; and acceptance and&#xD;
      usability of the internet-based PrEP service.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We will implement a multi-center, four-arm, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial to evaluate online PrEP care and/or a reduced schedule of monitoring visits against routine (face-to-face) PrEP care at the Centers of Sexual Health (CSH) of the Public Health Services (PHS) (standard-of-care). After eligibility screening and assessment, study participants are randomized (1:1:1:1) to the standard-of-care arm (i.e. location: CSH; 4 annual monitoring visits) or one of three interventions arms: arm 2 (location: CSH; 2 annual monitoring visit), arm 3 (location: online; 4 annual monitoring visits), arm 4 (location: online; 2 annual monitoring visits). In the randomization process, participants will be stratified based on PrEP experience (PrEP-naïve or experienced) and PHS catchment area (4 regions). In each arm, we aim to include at least 25% PrEP-naïve participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Non-adherence is defined as a PrEP-less and condom-less anal sex act with a casual partner, termed an unprotected act (UA). Self-reported daily data on sexual behaviour, pill intake and condom use are recorded in an electronic diary. Using these data, we will count the number of UAs (n), and the person-months at risk (pmar) per person; this will yield the incidence rate (IR) per person month (= n / pmar). This will be done for each study arm separately.</description>
