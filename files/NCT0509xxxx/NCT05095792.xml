  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will allow data to be collected to demonstrate changes in brain&#xD;
      activity following administration of standard of care (SOC) Ketamine. By comparing genetic&#xD;
      markers across participants, data on impact of genetic markers and response to Ketamine will&#xD;
      also be analysed. This data will contribute to the design of future studies utilizing&#xD;
      Ketamine for various psychiatric disorders. This study will focus on treatment-resistant&#xD;
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open Label Observational Study with the primary objective to assess brain activity&#xD;
      in patients prior to, during and after Ketamine treatment and to assess genetic markers prior&#xD;
      to Ketamine treatment. This is a non-interventional study that will observe the&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern of participants who, per standard of care, are treated&#xD;
      with intramuscular Ketamine. The administration of the Ketamine during this study is not&#xD;
      considered investigational. The experimental intervention, measurements via EEG, will be&#xD;
      offered to patients of the study site presenting for intramuscular (IM) ketamine treatment&#xD;
      per the site's established and evidence-based protocol as part of their regular clinical&#xD;
      care. Participants in this study have already been determined to have a medically appropriate&#xD;
      indication for IM Ketamine treatment, independent of enrollment in this study. Given the&#xD;
      requirement, per study protocol, to wear an EEG headset and complete study measures,&#xD;
      participants will be compensated by having treatment costs paid by the study sponsor. There&#xD;
      will be 36 participants enrolled at one study site.&#xD;
