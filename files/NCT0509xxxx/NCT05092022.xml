  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of offering self-sampled human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) tests in increasing participation in cervical cancer screening, compared to the&#xD;
      standard of care clinician-sampled test. The primary study endpoints are (1) patients'&#xD;
      acceptability of self-sampled HPV tests vs. clinician-sampled test, and (2) patients'&#xD;
      completion of self-sampled HPV test. The secondary study endpoint to be measured is the&#xD;
      increase in cervical cancer screenings of any type in the PSH St. Joseph's residency clinic&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited during their appointment at the PSH St. Joseph's residency clinic.&#xD;
      If a patient is due for cervical cancer screening, they will be presented with the study&#xD;
      letter that allows them to choose between (1) receiving the self-sampled HPV test after their&#xD;
      appointment, (2) scheduling an in-person cervical cancer screening at a later date, or (3)&#xD;
      indicating they are not interested in either option at this time (see study letter). If the&#xD;
      patient requests the self-sampled HPV test (option 1), they will be given a package that&#xD;
      contains the HPV self-sampling test and directions for use, the Summary Explanation of&#xD;
      Research, the package cover letter, the Penn State Health Clinical Laboratory Pathology&#xD;
      Services Special Account Requisition form, and a pre-paid return envelope. The patient will&#xD;
      fill in the Pathology Services Special Account Requisition form with their name, date of&#xD;
      birth, sex, and date and time of sample collection. The completed test and Pathology Services&#xD;
      Special Account Requisition form will be placed in the pre-paid return envelope and sent to&#xD;
      the Penn State Health Clinical Laboratory. A note will be added to the patient's medical&#xD;
      record stating that a self-sampled HPV test was provided, including the date it was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose option 2, to schedule an in-person cervical cancer screening at a later&#xD;
      date, will be given the time to do so when checking out from their current clinic&#xD;
      appointment. Appointment information will be shared with the study team to ensure that their&#xD;
      appointment is kept or rescheduled, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional follow-up is needed for patients who choose option 3. A note will be added to&#xD;
      the patient's medical record stating that they declined HPV screening, including the date the&#xD;
      screening was declined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the self-sampled HPV tests will be securely sent from the Penn State Health&#xD;
      Clinical Laboratory to the project manager for tracking. Then, the results will be sent to a&#xD;
      member of the study team at the PSH St. Joseph residency clinic, who will upload the results&#xD;
      into the patient's medical records. If the test result indicates that the patient is positive&#xD;
      for low-risk HPV, the patient will be contacted by their primary care physician to schedule a&#xD;
      Pap test. If the test result indicates that the patient is positive for high-risk HPV,&#xD;
      patient will be contacted by their primary care physician to schedule a colposcopy.&#xD;
      Scheduling a Pap test or colposcopy is standard of care for a low-risk or high-risk HPV&#xD;
      result, respectively. If the test result indicates that the patient is negative for HPV, the&#xD;
      results will be entered into the patient medical record and the patient notified via&#xD;
      telephone, but the patient will not receive any follow-up procedures after the self-sampled&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

    <description>This outcome is measuring the number of patients who select to receive a self-sampled HPV test out of all patients presented with the research opportunity. The results will be presented as the acceptance rate of the self-sampled HPV test. The measurement tool for this outcome is a patient-completed questionnaire where the patient can request 1) a self-sampled HPV test, 2) a clinician-sampled test, or 3) to not receive their cervical cancer screening at this time.</description>

    <description>This outcome is measuring the number of patients who complete and return the self-sampled HPV test out of all the patients who receive a self-sampled HPV test. A patient will have up to one month to complete and return the self-sampled HPV test. The final outcome results will be calculated one month after the last patient receives a self-sampled HPV test.</description>

    <description>This outcome is measuring the change in the number of patients considered up-to-date with cervical cancer screening of any type at the Penn State Health St. Joseph's residency clinic. This data will be collected 3 months after study enrollment ends, and will be compared to the number of patients considered up-to-date with cervical cancer screening in this patient population before study enrollment began to determine if overall screening rates have increased, decreased, or stayed the same.</description>
