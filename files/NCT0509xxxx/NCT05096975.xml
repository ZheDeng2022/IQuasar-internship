  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is frequently associated with emotional&#xD;
      dysregulation (ED). ED is characterized by excessive and inappropriate emotional reactions&#xD;
      compared to social norms, uncontrolled and rapide shifts in emotion and attention focused on&#xD;
      emotional stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to research, there are strong correlations between personality traits and&#xD;
      psychiatric disorder as ADHD. In a longitudinal study, the persistence of ADHD symptoms&#xD;
      during adolescence is associated with high neuroticism, low agreeableness and low conscience.&#xD;
      Studies show that these personality traits are factors of vulnerabilities for comordities&#xD;
      associated with ADHD and are predictive of overall functioning difficulties. Studies show&#xD;
      correlations between ADHD in childhood and personality disorders at adulthood .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD is frequently associated with emotional dysregulation (ED) that is characterized by an&#xD;
      inability to modulate emotional responses in a given context . ED is observed in 24% to 50%&#xD;
      children with ADHD . Children with ADHD and ED are more likely to present a severe and&#xD;
      complex symptomatology and are at risk for antisocial and bordeline personality disorders&#xD;
      than children without ED. To date, there would be no studies which would have been interested&#xD;
      in personality traits in children with ADHD and ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to determine if children with ADHD and ED present from childhood traits&#xD;
      of personality as low agreeableness, low conscience and high neuroticism that are predictive&#xD;
      of personality disorders at adulthood. It would involve earl identification of children at&#xD;
      increased risk of pejorative developmental trajectories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve understanding of the heterogeneity of ADHD symptom expression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a better understanding of the child's personalit and temperament traits to identify&#xD;
           riks and protective factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify children with ADHD with profiles at risk of personality disorders in order to&#xD;
           adapt the care according to the child's needs.&#xD;
