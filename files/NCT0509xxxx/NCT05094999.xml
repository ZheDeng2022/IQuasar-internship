  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious condition, common in young adults. It leads&#xD;
      to sensorimotor and cognitive sequelae that hinder social reintegration. Neuronal plasticity&#xD;
      must be used quickly before natural recovery impedes neuronal regrowth. In this respect,&#xD;
      stopping sedation as soon as possible and early mobilization, even if the patients are&#xD;
      unconscious, are recognized as useful measures to promote recovery. However, at the early&#xD;
      stage, the environment of the ICU and the acute condition of the patients limit the&#xD;
      rehabilitation possibilities. In such a context, functional proprioceptive stimulations&#xD;
      (Vibramoov™ system, Techno Concept, France) could be a tool of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the proprioceptive signatures of cyclic movements, proprioceptive stimulations can&#xD;
      elicit the illusion of these movements. A motor response can even be obtained through the&#xD;
      interactions between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. Finally,&#xD;
      such stimulations facilitate the initiation of the mimicked movements. Some studies have&#xD;
      already shown the benefits of proprioceptive vibrations. However, so far, these benefits have&#xD;
      only been studied at the chronic stage of neurological diseases. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that early functional proprioceptive stimulations (FPS) may reduce spasticity&#xD;
      and promote recovery in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis, the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial on patients&#xD;
      with severe traumatic brain injury. Every patient will be included as soon as possible in the&#xD;
      ICU and receive either FPS, either sham stimulations to the joints of the lower limbs, 4&#xD;
      times a week during 8 weeks. The primary outcome measures will assess spasticity. The&#xD;
      investigators also assess pain, coma recovery; muscle wasting and cognitive impairments. &quot;&#xD;
