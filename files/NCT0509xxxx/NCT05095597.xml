  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last years, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has emerged as a promising alternative to treat&#xD;
      endometrial pathologies affecting the endometrial lining. Different studies have tried this&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in human patient, but results are not conclusive at all. Also, in the&#xD;
      last years, different studies have suggested the umbilical cord blood has a stronger&#xD;
      reservoir of growth factors and other pro-regenerative molecules than the adult peripheral&#xD;
      blood. That is the reason why the present study aims to evaluate if using platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma obtained from umbilical cord blood is able to increase endometrial thickness and&#xD;
      prepare the endometrium for an embryo transference. However, due to the novelty of this&#xD;
      approach, the investigators have considered to include a 'proof of concept' group (women with&#xD;
      premature ovarian insufficiency) to obtain a deeper understanding of the clinical value of&#xD;
      this blood derivative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase II clinical trial, designed as a pilot study, single-center and open-label, which aims&#xD;
      to study the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma from umbilical cord after injection into a&#xD;
      pathological endometrium (thin endometrium, Asherman's Syndrome, endometrial atrophy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment will be applied to patients with the aforementioned endometrial pathologies&#xD;
      (group B), as well as to patients with premature ovarian failure (group A), which will serve&#xD;
      to study its clinical value in greater detail. Plasma samples as well as endometrial biopsies&#xD;
      will be analyzed to try to understand what molecular events are triggered in the endometrial&#xD;
      tissue after the application of the treatment under study.&#xD;
