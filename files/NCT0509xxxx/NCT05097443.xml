    <textblock>
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) is the most common type of NHL. Although novel&#xD;
      immunotherapies represented by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and CAR-T cell therapies have&#xD;
      significantly improved the prognosis of B-NHL patients, there are still nearly one-third of&#xD;
      patients who are resistant to initial treatment or relapse after remission. R-CHOP combined&#xD;
      with novel drugs was expected to improve the prognosis. Therefore, this study aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the potential of Orelabrutinib combined with Rituximab and chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with high aggressiveness and mortality, is one of the top ten&#xD;
      high-incidence tumors in the world and is among the ten most prevalent cancers worldwide with&#xD;
      the fastest growing incidence. B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) is the most common type&#xD;
      of NHL. Although novel immunotherapies represented by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies and&#xD;
      CAR-T cell therapies have significantly improved the prognosis of B-NHL patients, there are&#xD;
      still nearly one-third of patients who are resistant to initial treatment or relapse after&#xD;
      remission. In recent years, the continuous emergence of various novel targeted agents has&#xD;
      provided new hope for the treatment of B-NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a vital protein for immune B cell function, and a core&#xD;
      switch of B cell growth, controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and&#xD;
      migration. BTK inhibitors were available as a breakthrough therapy at the end of 2013,&#xD;
      providing a possibility of cure in patients with B-NHL. Orelabrutinib is a highly selective&#xD;
      novel BTK inhibitor, and its latest clinical data was announced at the 62nd Annual Meeting of&#xD;
      the American Society of Hematology (ASH) on Dec 7, 2020. In two clinical studies targeting&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL)/small cell leukemia (SLL), orelabrutinib showed a favorable overall remission&#xD;
      rate (ORR) and safety. In a phase II clinical study on the treatment of relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up of 14.3 months, ORR was 91.3%. The median time to response was&#xD;
      1.87 months, and the median PFS or DOR was not reached. In a phase II clinical study on the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed/refractory MCL, at a median follow-up of 16.4 months, ORR was 87.9%.&#xD;
      93.9% of patients achieved disease control. However, the efficacy of orelabrutinib in highly&#xD;
      aggressive B-cell lymphoma remains to be further studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we present this study protocol to add orelabrutinib to the first-line treatment of&#xD;
      highly aggressive B-NHL, applying orelabrutinib+R-CHOP/R-EPOCH/R-HD-MTX/R-other regimens, to&#xD;
      clarify the efficacy of orelabrutinib+R-CHOP/R-EPOCH/R-HD-MTX/R-other regimens and explore a&#xD;
      set of potent and safe treatments for B-NHL patients with high risks and further improve the&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
