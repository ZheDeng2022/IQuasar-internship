  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study investigated the validity and reliability of a new&#xD;
      postoperative track assessment tool. We hypothesized, first, that this tool estimates the&#xD;
      indication and benefit of a management in an intermediate care unit (IMC). Second, we&#xD;
      hypothesized that a) health care providers of IMC or postoperative anaesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) have similar estimations using this tool and b) that this estimation is accurately&#xD;
      established in the first 2 hours.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tool includes 2 visual analog scale (VAS) scores estimating indication of an IMC&#xD;
      admission and benefit of an IMC stay. The tool was tested in a PACU and in an IMC unit of a&#xD;
      Swiss tertiary centre in 2019/2020 (before COVID pandemic). Three raters: one nurse, one&#xD;
      physician in charge and the consultant physician, were asked to fill the VAS at the same time&#xD;
      for each included patient. The score was done in the 2 first hours following admission in the&#xD;
      unit and during the multi professional morning round at day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability was estimated by testing internal consistency (homogeneity), interrater&#xD;
      reliability and agreement and test-retest validity (stability). Validity included content&#xD;
      validity, construct validity and criterion validity.&#xD;

        This study was a random sample from the PACU and IMC patients' population. Included&#xD;
        patients' variables for demographic description of the population of interest and for the&#xD;
        validity testing were: Age in years, gender (male / female), ASA physical score&#xD;
        classification (ASA PS), do not resuscitate order (DNR), duration of intervention (min),&#xD;
        severity of intervention (minor/intermediate/major), type of surgery (abdominal,&#xD;
        orthopedic, trauma and other surgical and non-surgical interventions), elective or&#xD;
        non-elective, palliative intervention, SAPS II (admission (2 h after arrival in IMC)), NEMS&#xD;
        (admission (2 h after arrival) and during stay in IMC), SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participating raters were voluntary health care providers working in the&#xD;
        peri-interventional unit (PACU and IMC).&#xD;
