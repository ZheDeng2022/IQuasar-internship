    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel Paclitaxel-coated&#xD;
      balloon (Genoss® DCB) by demonstrating non-inferiority to in-lesion late lumen loss at 6&#xD;
      months after the procedure in Korean patients with coronary de novo lesions compared with a&#xD;
      product of the same category (SeQuent® Please NEO).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled trial to compare with the same-category drug device (SeQuent®&#xD;
      Please NEO), 180 patients with coronary de novo lesions were recruited from a total of 11&#xD;
      institutions, and the enrolled subjects were 1: 1 through randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio was assigned to the test group and the control group, and each of the test or&#xD;
      control devices was assigned to receive the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is the in-lesion late lumen loss of the target lesion at 6 months after&#xD;
      the procedure, and the secondary end point is the target vessel failure (Composite of cardiac&#xD;
      death, TV-MI, and ID-TVR) at 6 and 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;
