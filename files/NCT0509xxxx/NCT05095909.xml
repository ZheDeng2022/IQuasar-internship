    <textblock>
      Effective post - operative pain control following orthopedic surgical procedures without&#xD;
      excessive reliance upon opioid pain medication has garnered increased attention in recent&#xD;
      years. This study will evaluate the utilization of a non-invasive, novel cryo - compression,&#xD;
      post-operative modality to improve pain control versus standard ice wraps in the immediate&#xD;
      post-operative phase of arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery via a randomized controlled study&#xD;
      design. Furthermore, if this study demonstrates improved pain control, improved quality of&#xD;
      life and decreased opioid usage with the intermittent cold compression unit, recommendations&#xD;
      may be considered for system-wide utilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the proposed increase efficacy of combining both cold&#xD;
      and compression modalities through cryo-compression therapy in post-operative pain management&#xD;
      in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery versus a control group of standard ice wraps. As&#xD;
      opioid use within the field of orthopedics continues to grow as an area of investigation,&#xD;
      surgeons must look elsewhere for pain management tactics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate effectiveness of intermittent cryo-compression therapy versus standard ice&#xD;
           wraps for post - operative pain control through patient reported visual analog pain&#xD;
           scores and patient - reported opioid usage in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator&#xD;
           cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate effectiveness of intermittent cryo-compression therapy versus standard ice&#xD;
           wraps for reduction of post - operative tissue swelling in patients undergoing&#xD;
           arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine cost comparison of intermittent compression cryotherapy versus interscalene&#xD;
           catheter via historical controls as well as versus standard ice wraps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate effect of intermittent cryo-compression therapy versus standard ice wraps on&#xD;
           patient - reported quality of life via PROMIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are candidates for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and complete informed&#xD;
      consent process will be enrolled in study if no exclusion criteria are present. The study has&#xD;
      determined an enrollment goal of 100 subjects (50 intermittent cryo-compression therapy, 50&#xD;
      standard cryo -therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, patients enrolled in the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      using permuted blocks of sizes 2 and 4 to have post-operative cryotherapy using ice packs or&#xD;
      with the intermittent cold compression therapy unit. Randomization assignments will be&#xD;
      contained in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be prepared by an&#xD;
      individual not involved in patient consent or patient treatment. After the patient is&#xD;
      consented, the next envelope in the sequence will be opened and the patient will be assigned&#xD;
      to a group following the treatment listed in the envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, the subject will complete pre-operative data collection. The subject will&#xD;
      be given a tracking diary in order to record immediate post-operative data through the first&#xD;
      post-operative visit. Subjects will undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a single&#xD;
      surgeon as a standard of care procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the study group will have the compression sleeve for the NICE Recovery&#xD;
      SystemTM applied to the operative shoulder immediately post - operatively and those&#xD;
      randomized to the control group a standard gel ice pack with wrap. Each will use the assigned&#xD;
      version of cold therapy with a goal of 6 hours daily and will record overages using one half&#xD;
      hour as a minimum unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment and surgery, subjects will follow a post-operative follow-up visit schedule&#xD;
      including 2-days, first post-operative visit, 60 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.&#xD;
