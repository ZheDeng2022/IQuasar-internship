  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the effect of adding cabozantinib to avelumab versus avelumab&#xD;
      alone in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and avelumab together may further shrink the cancer&#xD;
      or prevent it from returning/progressing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of cabozantinib S-malate (cabozantinib) in combination with&#xD;
      avelumab on overall survival (OS) compared to avelumab alone in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial cancer (mUC) who did not progress during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      therapy, i.e. patients who had complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable&#xD;
      disease (SD) after completion of first line platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of cabozantinib in combination with avelumab on progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) compared to avelumab alone for maintenance treatment following initial&#xD;
      first-line treatment in patients who had a CR, PR or SD upon completion of first-line&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in combination with avelumab in&#xD;
      mUC compared to avelumab alone for maintenance treatment following initial first-line&#xD;
      treatment in patients who had a CR, PR or SD upon completion of first-line platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate activity of cabozantinib in combination with avelumab based on Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) compared to avelumab alone for maintenance&#xD;
      treatment following initial first-line treatment in patients who had a CR, PR or SD upon&#xD;
      completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while accounting for&#xD;
      the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the activity of cabozantinib in combination with avelumab compared to avelumab&#xD;
      alone based on PD-L1 status of patients' tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare quality-adjusted survival between patients randomized to receive cabozantinib&#xD;
      and avelumab vs. avelumab alone using the European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level&#xD;
      Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare patient-reported fatigue as assessed by the Patient Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-Fatigue 4a from baseline through 12 months between&#xD;
      patients randomized to receive cabozantinib and avelumab versus (vs.) avelumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare patient-reported global health status/quality of life as assessed by the&#xD;
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core (C)30 from baseline through 12 months between patients randomized to&#xD;
      receive cabozantinib and avelumab vs. avelumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare scale scores of the EORTC QLQ-Bladder Cancer Muscle-Invasive (BLM)30 (urinary&#xD;
      symptoms, urostomy problems, catheter problems, future perspectives, abdominal bloating and&#xD;
      flatulence, body image, sexual function) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months between patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive cabozantinib and avelumab vs. avelumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare scale scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (global health status/quality of life;&#xD;
      physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social function; symptoms) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months between patients randomized to receive cabozantinib and avelumab vs. avelumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each&#xD;
      cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of each cycle and&#xD;
      cabozantinib orally (PO) daily. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 24 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 30 days through 90 days,&#xD;
      then every 3 months for 5 years.&#xD;

                            applicable guidelines) and low-dose low molecular weight heparins&#xD;
                            (LMWH).Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor&#xD;
                            Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban in subjects without&#xD;
                            known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant&#xD;
                            for at least 1 week before first dose of study treatment without&#xD;
                            clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the&#xD;

          -  Physicians should consider whether any of the following may render the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled medical conditions which, in the opinion of the treating physician,&#xD;
                  would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who cannot swallow oral formulations of the agent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an appropriate method of&#xD;
             birth control throughout their participation in this study due to the teratogenic&#xD;
             potential of the therapy utilized in this trial. Include as applicable: Appropriate&#xD;
             methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives or double barrier method (diaphragm plus condom).&#xD;
