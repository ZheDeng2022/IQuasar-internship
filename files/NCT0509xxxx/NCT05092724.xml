  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a sudden public health incident (the corona virus disease [COVID-19]&#xD;
      epidemic) occurred in Wuhan, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical features of those with pneumonia include fever and cough, and in many cases a sudden&#xD;
      and accelerating respiratory distress originated from interstitial pneumonia . Many&#xD;
      hypotheses have explained hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients, such as hyperimmune reaction to&#xD;
      viral infection and cytokine storm that leads to serious lung tissue and alveolar damage or&#xD;
      even direct viral insult .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality are as high as 15% in critically ill patients requiring intensive care unit&#xD;
      admission and oxygen therapy , suggesting an urgent need to try therapeutic interventions in&#xD;
      addition to supportive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is more than one type of hemoglobin. In adults, Hb A or Adult hemoglobin which is the&#xD;
      main hemoglobin in the blood. But there is another type of hemoglobin called fetal&#xD;
      hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F, Hb F, or α2γ2) is the main oxygen carrier protein&#xD;
      in the human fetus. and the levels remain high after birth until the baby is roughly 2-4&#xD;
      months old . Hemoglobin F has a different composition from hemoglobin A and higher affinity&#xD;
      to oxygen . At birth, hemoglobin F accounts for 50-95% of the infant's hemoglobin and at&#xD;
      around 6 months after birth, hemoglobin A becomes the predominant type.The key feature that&#xD;
      allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having γ subunits (instead of β, in&#xD;
      Hb A for example). 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hypothesis for the low incidence of the COVID-19 infection in pediatric is the presence of&#xD;
      fetal hemoglobin (HbF) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study about the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies in different countries and&#xD;
      the mortality rate of COVID-19, it appears that the mortality is lower in countries with a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of hemoglobinopathies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mice treated with GBT1118 (a compound that enhances the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin) showed&#xD;
      a sustained significant increase in SpO2 over 4 h of hypoxia exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with haemoglobinopathies like sickle cell anemia or beta-thalassemia attributed with&#xD;
      high amount of fetal hemoglobin, become mostly asymptomatic or have mild symptoms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume of umbilical cord blood varies from 50 ml to 140 ml with a mean of 85 ml rich in&#xD;
      fetal hemoglobin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the clinical setting, not only for&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases but also for infectious diseases , and their safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      have been well elucidated . As a noninvasive treatment, hUC-MSC therapy is a very effective&#xD;
      and promising method for clinical application and promotion to treat severe COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators offer a solution by increasing fetal hemoglobin by cord blood containing&#xD;
      fetal blood transfusion in the critical patients as a trial to combat the course of the&#xD;
      disease and minimize the morbidity especially in sever cases who suffer from desaturation&#xD;
      until suppression of the immune dysregulation and avoidance of the impending death.&#xD;
