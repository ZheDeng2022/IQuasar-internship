      This randomized controlled trial tested the effect of culturally tailored and standard&#xD;
      electronic secure messages and mailings from patients' primary care physicians to encourage&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination among adults aged 65 and older. Patients who had not received a COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination or appointment after previous outreach attempts were randomized to receive (a) an&#xD;
      electronic secure message and/or mail outreach from their PCP, (b) similar outreach with&#xD;
      additional culturally tailored content, or (c) usual care. The primary outcome was receipt of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination during the 8 weeks after the initial study outreach date.&#xD;

Letters were sent to patients who had not signed up for the electronic health record portal. Study Outreach 2 was a postcard sent to all patients who had not been vaccinated or made an appointment by four weeks after Study Outreach 1.</description>
