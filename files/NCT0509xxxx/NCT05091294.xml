  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we investigated the effects of two different injection rates of local&#xD;
      anesthetic solution on the onset of sensory block, and the incidence and the onset of&#xD;
      hypotension in pregnant women undergoing spinal anesthesia. A total of 67 patients were&#xD;
      randomized into two groups: 120-second injection time (Group S; n = 33) and 15-second&#xD;
      injection time (Group F; n = 34). Maximum level of sensory and motor block, time to sensory&#xD;
      block at the level of T6, hemodynamic parameters, use of ephedrine and incidence of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting were recorded at different time points. Maximum level of the sensory block was&#xD;
      similar. The time to achieve adequate and maximum sensory block level was shorter in Group S&#xD;
      (p = 0.004 and 0.037, respectively). Incidence of hypotension was similar, but hypotension&#xD;
      occurred earlier in Group F (p = 0.011). Requirement for ephedrine and incidence of nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting was similar. This study showed that 120-second injection duration is associated&#xD;
      with similar onset of the sensory block and slower onset of hypotension. We conclude that&#xD;
      prolonging the duration of local anesthetic injection to 120-seconds is advantageous compared&#xD;
      with 15-seconds.&#xD;

      The anesthetist was blinded to the groups after the intrathecal administration of anesthesia&#xD;
      and followed up with the patients and collected the data. After blocking was achieved, the&#xD;
      patients were placed in the supine position, and the uterus was transported to the left by&#xD;
      tilting the table 15° to the left. The level of the sensory block was evaluated by bilateral&#xD;
      pinprick test, and the level of motor block was evaluated with the modified Bromage scale at&#xD;
      2-minute intervals in the first 15 minutes and at 5-minute intervals in the next 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the spinal injection. When the level of the sensory block reached an adequate level&#xD;
      (T6) the surgery was allowed to start. The patients whose block level did not reach T6 within&#xD;
      10 minutes were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the moment when the subarachnoid injection began as the onset time, the time to&#xD;
      reach the T6 level, maximum sensory block level and motor block (Bromage scale 3) level were&#xD;
      recorded in each patient. Motor block of the lower limbs was assessed using the Bromage scale&#xD;
      (0 = ability to raise extended leg; 1 = inability to raise extended leg, ability to flex the&#xD;
      knee; 2 = inability to flex the knee, ability to flex the ankle; 3 = inability to flex the&#xD;
      knee and ankle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peak heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (sBP) values of all patients were&#xD;
      recorded before the procedure; immediately after spinal anesthesia; and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,&#xD;
      13, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 minutes after the procedure. A decrease of systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (sBP) below 90 mmHg and more than a 30% decline in baseline blood pressure were&#xD;
      considered as hypotension. Any hypotension was treated with boluses of 5 mg ephedrine each&#xD;
      time until the systolic arterial pressure returned to normal ranges (&gt; 90 mmHg and &gt; 70%&#xD;
      baseline value). In the patients who received ephedrine, the time of first ephedrine&#xD;
      administration was considered as the time of first hypotension, and the total amount of&#xD;
      ephedrine used was recorded. In addition, the local anesthetic injection rate (mL/s) for each&#xD;
      patient was calculated as the ratio of local anesthetic injection volume (mL) to local&#xD;
      anesthetic injection times(s) and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated based on the T6 levels from a previous study (Singh SI. et al&#xD;
      2007). After setting the alpha error level at 0.05, beta error level at 0.20, effect size at&#xD;
      0.70, and difference in time at 0.9, the required sample size was determined as 26 for each&#xD;
      group (slow and fast). By considering the potential data loss, we averaged the total sample&#xD;
      size as 60 (30 patients for each group).&#xD;
