      This study is an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      phase III clinical trial in parallel groups evaluating the efficacy and safety of AV5080 in&#xD;
      patients with uncomplicated influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with mild to moderate influenza, without complications, will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Taking into account the seasonality of the pathology and the low percentage of&#xD;
      influenza in the general structure of ARVI incidence, for the successful inclusion of all&#xD;
      patients in the study during two epidemiological seasons. The study will enroll 700 patients&#xD;
      aged 18 to 65 years with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of influenza to treatment (AV5080)&#xD;
      and placebo cohorts (1:1).&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study is double-blind. Clinical center staff and patients will not know what therapy and in what doses are prescribed for each individual patient. Blinding will be achieved by masking the AV5080/placebo drug (each patient will take a pill corresponding to 80 mg or placebo) and dispensing the drug using IWRS. Each patient will be given the study drug in banks. Banks will have a unique identification number, otherwise they will be identical in marking.</masking_description>

    <description>The resolution of influenza symptoms is confirmed by the absence of symptoms or their reduction to mild severity (0-1 points) and a decrease in body temperature in the armpit to ≤ 37.2 °C for at least 24 hours. The time to resolve the flu symptoms is the start time of the 24-hour (or longer) interval.</description>
