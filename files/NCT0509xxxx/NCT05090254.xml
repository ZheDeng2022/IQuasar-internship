  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy (GDT) triggers fluid, vasopressor,&#xD;
      and inotrope administration assuming that optimizing cardiac output (i.e., global blood flow)&#xD;
      ensures adequate oxygen delivery and microcirculatory perfusion - that are usually not&#xD;
      directly monitored during goal-directed therapy. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      perioperative cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy may reduce postoperative&#xD;
      complications compared to routine hemodynamic management in high-risk patients having major&#xD;
      surgery. The effect of cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy algorithms on&#xD;
      perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption as well as microcirculatory perfusion, however,&#xD;
      is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate the effect of using different cardiac output-guided&#xD;
      goal-directed therapy algorithms on perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption as well as&#xD;
      sublingual microcirculatory perfusion compared to routine perioperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      management in patients having major abdominal surgery with general anesthesia.&#xD;

      Perioperative cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy (GDT) triggers fluid, vasopressor,&#xD;
      and inotrope administration assuming that optimizing cardiac output (i.e., global blood flow)&#xD;
      ensures adequate oxygen delivery and microcirculatory perfusion - that are usually not&#xD;
      directly monitored during goal-directed therapy. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      perioperative cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy may reduce postoperative&#xD;
      complications compared to routine hemodynamic management in high-risk patients having major&#xD;
      surgery. The effect of cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy algorithms on&#xD;
      perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption as well as microcirculatory perfusion, however,&#xD;
      is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With technological advancements a distinct monitoring of oxygen delivery and consumption as&#xD;
      well as microcirculatory perfusion in the perioperative period has become possible. Using new&#xD;
      technologies, a detailed understanding of the effect of cardiac output-guided goal-directed&#xD;
      therapy on perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption as well as microcirculatory&#xD;
      perfusion is of vital importance to further develop and improve perioperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot randomized-controlled trial, the investigators therefore aim to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of using different cardiac output-guided goal-directed therapy algorithms on&#xD;
      perioperative oxygen delivery and consumption as well as sublingual microcirculatory&#xD;
      perfusion compared to routine perioperative hemodynamic management in patients having major&#xD;
      abdominal surgery with general anesthesia.&#xD;
