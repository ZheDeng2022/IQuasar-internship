  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a benign gynecological condition where the uterine endometrium is located&#xD;
      outside the uterus. The condition affects up to 10% of women of fertile age and up to 70% of&#xD;
      women with endometriosis have symptoms with severe pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea),&#xD;
      pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), and/or chronic pelvic pain. Current treatments are&#xD;
      dictated by the primary symptom: pain and are limited to surgery and hormonal treatments with&#xD;
      often short-lived effects. Advances in the understanding of the condition have expanded to&#xD;
      focus on less invasive and non-pharmacological treatments. Systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses of observational studies have focused on the protective role of physical&#xD;
      activity and exercise on the risk of developing endometriosis. The results from these studies&#xD;
      have been inconclusive. However, the efficacy of physical activity and exercise on pain among&#xD;
      women with endometriosis has not been tested in high-quality randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the complexity of the disease, international clinical guidelines recommend that the&#xD;
      treatment of endometriosis-associated pain should come from a multimodal and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary perspective. Numerous non-pharmacological treatments have been proposed to&#xD;
      alleviate endometriosis-associated pain, such as physical activity. Physical activity was&#xD;
      introduced as a factor in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain over three decades&#xD;
      ago, with the possible beneficial effect that physical activity stimulates anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties that will impede the development of endometriosis and lower the pain. A recent&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis found one randomized controlled study that showed no&#xD;
      effect of physical activity on endometriosis-associated pain. They concluded that the&#xD;
      methodological quality of this study was low, and the need for future randomized controlled&#xD;
      studies was warranted. We, therefore, aimed to study the effect of pain education and&#xD;
      group-based physical activity versus pain education alone on women with&#xD;
      endometriosis-associated pain.&#xD;

    <description>Pelvic floor muscle maximal contraction and muscular endurance will be measured with manometer using a vaginal balloon catheter Camtech Sandvika Norge AS (cmH2O) will be assessed. This method has demonstrated good validity and reliability, by our research group.&#xD;
Resting tension and the ability to contract using surface electromyography (EMG) will be used with a vaginal probe (Quintet). We will also perform vaginal palpation to assess pain/tenderness and tone. (All women will be instructed on how to correctly perform a pelvic floor muscle contraction prior to assessment).</description>

    <description>All participants will attend a four-hour pain education session including gynecologist, psychologist, sexologist, and physiotherapist at Akershus University Hospital.&#xD;
The education will be held twice, with half of the participants at the time. The training group will then attend a 60 minutes weekly group training session led by a physiotherapist with specialist training in women's health, over a period of four months. In addition, participants will perform a progressive home exercise program performed daily over the same period. The focus will be general strength training using own body weight and cardiovascular fitness (walking, low-impact aerobic exercise), stretching, and relaxation.</description>
