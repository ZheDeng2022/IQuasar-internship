    <textblock>
      This proposal, entitled Community-Centered Interventions for Improved Vaccine Uptake for&#xD;
      COVID-19 (CIVIC): Getting to Yes, Michigan!, is designed to directly address and decrease&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake among populations that experience&#xD;
      COVID-19 related disparities. We will focus on the four counties within Michigan where a&#xD;
      disproportionate burden of COVID-19 is within African Americans and Latinx communities, i.e.,&#xD;
      Wayne, Genesee, Kent and Washtenaw Counties. Using a community-based participatory research&#xD;
      (CBPR) approach, CIVIC will leverage: its long term relationships with the communities&#xD;
      involved, an established CBPR Steering Committee developed and the knowledge gained as a&#xD;
      Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) grant recipient, the resources and networks of the&#xD;
      University of Michigan CTSA (MICHR), and the expertise of our academic partners to identify&#xD;
      and understand factors that contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in African Americans and&#xD;
      Latinx communities in Michigan. We will develop and test interventions based on&#xD;
      community-centered approaches to achieve a primary goal of increased vaccine uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will achieve this goal with the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase understanding of the barriers and drivers of vaccine uptake and hesitancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase vaccine uptake and decrease vaccine hesitancy through the implementation and&#xD;
           evaluation of a multilevel intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase vaccine uptake and decrease vaccine hesitancy through the implementation and&#xD;
           evaluation of an individual level tailored intervention; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Maintain, enhance, and evaluate the effectiveness of the CIVIC partnership to equitably&#xD;
           engage all partners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Like many states across the country, COVID-19 cases and deaths have impacted communities of&#xD;
      color in Michigan at disproportionately higher rates than whites. A staggering reality is&#xD;
      that while African Americans represent only 13.6% of Michigan's population, they represent&#xD;
      40% of the deaths from COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Half of the cases and deaths in Michigan occurred in Wayne County.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other Counties in the lower half of Michigan have similar disparities including Genesee,&#xD;
           Washtenaw, and Kent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Genesee County, where African Americans represent 20.3% of the population, they&#xD;
           represent 35% of COVID-19 cases and 45% of deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Washtenaw County, nearly half of the cases to date are located in two majority&#xD;
           low-income zip codes in the city of Ypsilanti. African American residents, who make up&#xD;
           12% of the Washtenaw population, disproportionately constitute more than a quarter of&#xD;
           the cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And in Kent County, while 10.8% of the population is Latinx, this ethnic group makes up&#xD;
           32.4% of COVID-19 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from the state reveal that these disparities will likely worsen due to&#xD;
      significant hesitancy, fear, mistrust and misinformation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine if&#xD;
      nothing is done to change current trends.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported COVID-19 Vaccine uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the start of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Vaccine Uptake will be measured by a multipart question which will start with, &quot;have you received any COVID-19 vaccination (also called the shot)? This will be answered Yes or No. It will be modeled as a binary outcome. As described in Approach, we will also inquire about which vaccine, how many doses completed, location it was delivered, and date of delivery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intention to uptake COVID-19 Vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vaccine Intentions will be assessed by asking, on a scale of 0-10, &quot;how likely is it that you will get the COVID-19 vaccine?&quot;, with 0 being very unlikely and 10 being very likely. This will be analyzed using linear regression as described in the data analysis section.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Motivational Interviewing of SMS and web content</intervention_name>
    <description>Our primary framework that will guide the web content is Self-Determination Theory (SDT). SDT differentiates between autonomous (conscious choice and are personally relevant) and controlled behavioral regulation (performed due to pressure or coercion by external or internal forces). Messages that enhance autonomy and perceived competence and are consistent with a person's values and goals will be more effective in changing behavior than messages focusing on external rewards. To link vaccination to broader values and goals, participants will select 3-4 goals from approximately 20 values/goals. Individually tailored messages will link each of these values to vaccination. We will also tailor testimonials based on member values and communication style preference.</description>
