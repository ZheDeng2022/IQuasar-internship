  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study of&#xD;
      STK-012 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with selected&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase 1a portion of the study will evaluate STK-012 monotherapy administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously weekly alone and in combination with pembrolizumab administered every 3 weeks&#xD;
      intravenously in a standard 3+3 dose-escalation study design. Patients with selected solid&#xD;
      tumor types will be enrolled who have progressed after standard of care treatments. The phase&#xD;
      1b dose expansion will evaluate STK-012 at the recommended phase 2 dose in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in selected solid tumor types.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Selected Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In dose-escalation (Phase 1a), patients must have selected tumor types and must have&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Available archived tumor tissue sample. In the setting where archival material is&#xD;
             unavailable or unsuitable for use, the patient must consent and undergo fresh tumor&#xD;
             biopsy. In some patients, a new pre-treatment and on-treatment tumor biopsy may be&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have been treated and be&#xD;
             asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Selected Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Received systemic anti-cancer therapy within 3 weeks of the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment or small molecule kinase inhibitors within 6 elimination half-lives of the&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Received definitive radiotherapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study treatment;&#xD;
             or palliative radiotherapy (&lt; 2 weeks of radiotherapy to non-central nervous system&#xD;
             [CNS] disease) within 1 week of the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Received prior IL-2-based or IL-15-based cytokine therapy&#xD;
