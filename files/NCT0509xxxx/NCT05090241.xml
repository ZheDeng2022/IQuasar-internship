  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Reunion Island, people encounter environmental and social conditions leading to premature&#xD;
      ageing and subsequent frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates tools, supported by the latest scientific advances in &quot;machine learning&quot;&#xD;
      to detect, identify and measure frailty in order to give health professionals the means to&#xD;
      act early through preventive actions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 5P research program is a 6-years program that started in 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its objective is to set up tools, supported by the latest scientific advances in &quot;machine&#xD;
      learning&quot; to detect, identify and measure frailty in order to give health professionals the&#xD;
      means to act early through preventive actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diversity and transversal nature of the research disciplines in this program make it&#xD;
      original. This allows it, through common protocols, to explore the concept of frailty and the&#xD;
      care pathway of the elderly through different prisms of complementary observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program is deployed in three stages: proof of principle, proof of concept (called&#xD;
      5P-PILOT) and &quot;the Scaling up&quot; (called 5P-ECHELLE). It combines an evaluation of the&#xD;
      acceptability of technological detection tools, a measurement of the impact of prevention&#xD;
      workshops on the loss of autonomy among independent frail elderly people and an evaluation of&#xD;
      tools to help detect frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ageing of the population poses a real societal challenge. The loss of autonomy, which is&#xD;
      the result of multiple individual or environmental factors for the ageing person, has a&#xD;
      costly impact in terms of recourse to care and on the people around them. It is therefore&#xD;
      urgent to act on the levers of frailty by acting as early as possible to prevent its&#xD;
      irreversibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;5P ECHELLE&quot; project aims to develop a semi-automatic and non-medical method for&#xD;
      detecting weak signals of frailty in older people, by combining standardized clinical&#xD;
      indicators for assessing their state of robustness with large-scale intelligent detection&#xD;
      devices that allow for longitudinal monitoring, while integrating the necessary participatory&#xD;
      dimension of the subject.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the number of falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in the number of falls to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of falls by diary with monthly telephone survey for 6 months. A fall is defined as an event in which an individual inadvertently falls to the ground or any other surface below the level of origin.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in balance performance to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The balance measurement was performed on a force platform. The senior citizen was positioned barefoot on the strength platform. The measurement was performed for 30 seconds with eyes open, then with eyes closed for 30 seconds. Postural control acquisition data, and more specifically the displacement of the center of pressure was measured in both the medio-lateral and antero-posterior dimensions. Small variations are better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gait performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in balance and gait performance to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The gait test was carried out using sensors to analyze and retrieve data from the participant's walk (gait speed, step length, duration of the double support phase). Four X-sens® Motion Tracker Wireless sensors were positioned on the clothes with headbands as follows: one at forehead level on the median sagittal line, the second opposite the L4 vertebra and the last two on the dorsal surface of the right and left feet at mid-foot level. Then, the patient walked 10 meters in a straight line, made a half turn and walked 10 meters again. Higher gait speed is better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frailty according to &quot;Fried et al&quot; criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Fried criteria are a list of 5 criteria to define the elderly frailty. Weight loss: &quot;In the last year, have you lost more than 3 kilograms unintentionally?&quot; If yes, then frail for weight loss criterion.&#xD;
Exhaustion: the following two statements are read. (a) I felt that everything I did was an effort; (b) I could not get going. The question is asked &quot;How often in the last week did you feel this way?&quot; 0 = rarely or none of the time (&lt; 1 day), 1 = some or a little of the time (1-2 days), 2 = a moderate amount of the time (3-4 days), or 3 = most of the time. Subjects answering &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; to either of these questions are categorized as frail by the exhaustion criterion.&#xD;
Walk Time: Cutoff for time to walk 4 meters criterion for frailty, &gt;= 7 seconds Grip Strength: cutoff for grip strength (Kilogram) criterion for frailty &lt; 30 for men, &lt;17 for women. A person is frail if 3 out of 5 criteria are found, pre-frail if 1 or 2 are found, or robust if no criterion are found.</description>

a memory task: memorize 3 words, then recall them,&#xD;
the drawing of a watch face: this is the simplified clock test,&#xD;
and according to the results of these first 2 tasks: 5 questions of orientation in space.&#xD;

The main interest of the EPICES score is to apprehend populations which, while not covered by traditional administrative indicators of precariousness, present the same health risks. The answer to each question is The sum of the 11 answers gives the EPICES score. The score is The score is continuous and varies from 0 (no precariousness) to 100 (maximum precariousness). The threshold of 30 is considered the precariousness threshold according to &quot;EPICES&quot;.</description>
