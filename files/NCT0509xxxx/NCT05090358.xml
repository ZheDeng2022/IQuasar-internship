  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to find out whether a very low carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet),&#xD;
      a low carbohydrate diet, or the study drug canagliflozin can prevent high blood sugar and may&#xD;
      improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy in people who are receiving standard treatment&#xD;
      with alpelisib and fulvestrant for their metastatic PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer.&#xD;
