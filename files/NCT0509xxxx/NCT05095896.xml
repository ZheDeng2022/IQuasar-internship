  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was retrospectively undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China.&#xD;
      In order to investigate the correlations between platelet indices, serum lipids and bleeding&#xD;
      symptoms in ITP.&#xD;

      Background: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune hemorrhagic disease characterized&#xD;
      by increased platelet destruction and impaired thrombopoiesis. Platelet indices changes&#xD;
      depending on the morphology and volume of platelets. Serum lipids have been found to affect&#xD;
      platelet formation and activity in certain diseases, thus induce the corresponding variation&#xD;
      of platelet indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate the correlations between platelet indices, serum lipids and&#xD;
      bleeding symptoms in ITP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The clinical data from 457 ITP patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed,&#xD;
      including platelet indices, serum lipids, hemorrhage and therapeutic regimen.&#xD;
