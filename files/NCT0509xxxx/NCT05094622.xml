    <textblock>
      Initially, it was suspected that Covid-19 would primarily affect the airways, but several&#xD;
      studies have now shown that it is a disease with multisystem manifestations. Covid-19 has the&#xD;
      potential to affect physical, cognitive and psychological functions in multiple ways. It has&#xD;
      been clear that a significant proportion of patients with Covid-19 develop long-term&#xD;
      symptoms. The term post-acute Covid-19 syndrome (PACS) is now used to describe the wide range&#xD;
      of prolonged symptoms following the infection. Patients who have been in hospital for&#xD;
      Covid-19 for a long time may need specialized rehabilitation, however, also non-hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with mild symptoms may need specific rehabilitation to be able to meet the complex&#xD;
      symptoms and problems that may arise. A more specific syndrome that seems to occur more&#xD;
      frequently than expected in the group of non-hospitalized patients who have had Covid-19 is&#xD;
      the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It is a form of chronic orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance in which upright posture is associated with an excessive increase in heart rate&#xD;
      (HR) with a &gt;6-month history of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of physical training in patients with POTS after Covid-19 a single&#xD;
      subject design will be used (the patient is their own control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients diagnosed with POTS after Covid-19 (N=30) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and outcomes: The primary outcomes are physical activity and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life. Secondary outcomes are: physical capacity, active standing test,&#xD;
      Malmö-POTS-questionnaire, Anxiety and depression, fatigue, self-reported outcome measure of&#xD;
      physical function and work ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially measurements will be performed several times during a period of 2-4 weeks to obtain&#xD;
      a baseline before the intervention starts. Then the included participants will undergo a&#xD;
      specially designed physical training program that will be performed 3 times /week during a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks. The intervention of physical training will consist of different exercises&#xD;
      to enhance muscle strength and endurance. The intervention will be individually adjusted with&#xD;
      a progression in dose, intensity, and position. The exercise is based on a program used in a&#xD;
      previous study. Measurements will then be repeated after completion of the intervention&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
      In August 2021, there are over 1 100 000 confirmed cases and over 14 000 deaths in Sweden.&#xD;
      Initially, it was suspected that Covid-19 would primarily affect the airways, but several&#xD;
      studies have now shown that it is a disease with multisystem manifestations. The impact of&#xD;
      the virus ranges from an asymptomatic infection to a severe and life-threatening disease that&#xD;
      can affect the cardiac, renal gastrointestinal, nervous, endocrine, and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      systems. Therefore, Covid-19 has the potential to affect physical, cognitive, and&#xD;
      psychological functions in multiple ways. It has been clear that a significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients with Covid-19 develop long-term symptoms. Signs and symptoms may arise from any&#xD;
      system in the body, often with significant overlap, and may develop over time. The term post-&#xD;
      acute Covid-19 syndrome (PACS) is now used to describe the wide range of prolonged symptoms&#xD;
      following the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue, decreased physical and psychological function have been reported in the initial&#xD;
      recovery phase, but still little is known on the long-term consequences. Patients who have&#xD;
      been in hospital for Covid-19 for a long time may need specialized rehabilitation, however,&#xD;
      also non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms may need specific rehabilitation to be able&#xD;
      to meet the complex symptoms and problems that may arise. Previous studies on the recovery&#xD;
      and rehabilitation after other coronavirus shows the importance to develop tailored&#xD;
      interventions so that these patients receive appropriate rehabilitation with a&#xD;
      multi-professional approach throughout the whole care chain. Some studies suggest that the&#xD;
      rehabilitation should be similar to pulmonary rehabilitation, but since a lot of patients&#xD;
      often have symptoms from different organ systems this is not yet fully investigated and needs&#xD;
      to be addressed from different perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more specific syndrome that seems to occur more frequently than expected in the group of&#xD;
      non-hospitalized patients who have had Covid-19 is the postural orthostatic tachycardia&#xD;
      syndrome (POTS). It is a form of chronic orthostatic intolerance in which upright posture is&#xD;
      associated with an excessive increase in heart rate (HR) with a &gt;6-month history of symptoms.&#xD;
      Patients with POTS may have problems such as hypermobile joints, exercise intolerance,&#xD;
      migraine headaches, sleep disturbances, and fatigue, symptoms that can be exacerbated by&#xD;
      simple activities of daily life and exercise. Few studies have investigated the effect of&#xD;
      physical exercise in POTS, and to date, no studies have evaluated the effect of individually&#xD;
      tailored rehabilitation in patients with POTS after Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an individually tailored rehabilitation&#xD;
      program and its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity, physical&#xD;
      and psychological function and work ability in patients with POTS after Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a individually tailored rehabilitation program will have an effect on&#xD;
      HRQoL and physical activity for individuals with POTS after Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of physical training in patients with POTS after Covid-19 a single&#xD;
      subject design will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients, diagnosed with POTS after Covid-19, at the outpatient clinic,&#xD;
      Karolinska university hospital will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are physical activity (ActivPal accelerometer) and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (EQ-5D-5L). The secondary outcomes are 6 minute walk test, physiological&#xD;
      responses during an active standing test, Malmö-POTS-questionnaire, anxiety and depression&#xD;
      (GAD-7, PHQ-9), fatigue (FSS), self-reported outcome measure of physical function (PSFS) and&#xD;
      work ability (WAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially measurements will be performed several times during a period of 2-4 weeks to obtain&#xD;
      a baseline before the intervention starts. Then the included participants will undergo a&#xD;
      specially designed physical training program that will be performed 3 times /week during a&#xD;
      period of 12 weeks. The intervention of physical training will consist of different exercises&#xD;
      to enhance muscle strength and endurance. The intervention will be individually adjusted with&#xD;
      a progression in dose, intensity, and position. The exercise is based on a program used in a&#xD;
      previous study (se references below). Measurements will then be repeated after completion of&#xD;
      the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multiple single case study with A-B-design. Demographic data and data on&#xD;
      feasibility (acceptance of the program, adverse events etc) and outcome variables will be&#xD;
      collected. Data will be collected for a total of (20 weeks total, 2- 4 weeks phase A and 12&#xD;
      weeks phase B) and on a weekly basis. This will allow for analyses with randomization testing&#xD;
      and meta-analytical approaches to evaluate the effect of the intervention. With several&#xD;
      measuring points and 30 participant the investigators estimate to have sufficient power in&#xD;
      relation to design and analyses plan and research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 has the potential to affect physical, cognitive, and psychological functions in&#xD;
      multiple ways and lead to a negative impact on quality of life in the long-term perspective.&#xD;
      Therefore, development of a rehabilitation program with specific tailored interventions will&#xD;
      be necessary to improve physical and psychological function, as well as health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and work ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 is a new disease and large knowledge gaps need to be filled. Previous studies&#xD;
      indicate that the patients are affected at several levels and a rehabilitation period is&#xD;
      necessary. It is of great importance that data is collected systematically and standardized.&#xD;
      If significant effects occur, the possibility to generalize the results to other individuals&#xD;
      with Covid-19, are promising. The physical interventions may thus improve the ability to&#xD;
      adjust to the implications of Covid-19, which can potentially have significant health&#xD;
      economic effects. For example, the interventions may prolong patients' meaningful activities&#xD;
      of daily living and their ability to return to their previous workplaces (conduct their&#xD;
      professions). This project will deepen the knowledge about the effects of specialized&#xD;
      rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has been approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. The participants will&#xD;
      receive verbal and written information about the study and informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from all participants.&#xD;
