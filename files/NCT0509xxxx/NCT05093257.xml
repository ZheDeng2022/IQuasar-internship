  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by bleeding&#xD;
      due to isolated thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 100 × 109/L. ITP is classified&#xD;
      based on course of disease into acute (3- &lt;12 months), and chronic (≥12 months). ITP usually&#xD;
      has a chronic course in adults whereas approximately 80-90% of children undergo spontaneous&#xD;
      remission within weeks to months of disease onset. The main pathogenesis of ITP is the loss&#xD;
      of immune tolerance to platelet auto-antigens, which results in increased platelet&#xD;
      destruction and impaired thrombopoiesis by autoantibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).&#xD;
      Platelet autoantibodies, particularly antiglycoprotein (GP) GPIIbIIIa and anti-GPIbIX, are&#xD;
      known to cause thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP. As a main component of cellular&#xD;
      immunity, T cells play an important role in body defense and peripheral tolerance. Changing&#xD;
      number and function of these cells is closely associated with various diseases, including&#xD;
      ITP.NK cells can also modulate cellular immunity in ITP patients.&#xD;

      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by bleeding&#xD;
      due to isolated thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 100 × 109/L.ITP is classified&#xD;
      based on course of disease into acute (3- &lt;12 months), and chronic (≥12 months). ITP usually&#xD;
      has a chronic course in adults whereas approximately 80-90% of children undergo spontaneous&#xD;
      remission within weeks to months of disease onset. The main pathogenesis of ITP is the loss&#xD;
      of immune tolerance to platelet auto-antigens, which results in increased platelet&#xD;
      destruction and impaired thrombopoiesis by autoantibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes&#xD;
      (CTLs).Platelet autoantibodies, particularly antiglycoprotein (GP) GPIIbIIIa and anti-GPIbIX,&#xD;
      are known to cause thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP. Auto-Abs production often occurs&#xD;
      due to the loss of self-tolerance and increased stimulation of the immune system. The immune&#xD;
      system includes a variety of B- and T cells which cooperate with each other in&#xD;
      T-cell-dependent antibody production reactions and play significant roles in humoral and&#xD;
      cellular immunity. Although the pathogenesis of ITP has not been clearly understood, the&#xD;
      autoreactive B- and T cells have been directly and indirectly involved in Auto-Abs&#xD;
      production, respectively. As a main component of cellular immunity, T cells play an important&#xD;
      role in body defense and peripheral tolerance. Changing number and function of these cells is&#xD;
      closely associated with various diseases, including ITP. It can be stated that CD4+ T cells&#xD;
      are indirectly involved in ITP pathogenesis by inducing the increased activity of B cells&#xD;
      during Auto-Abs production. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are another subgroup of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes characterized by the expression of CD8+ surface marker, destroying the pathogenic&#xD;
      factors via granzyme and perforin production. These cells are increased in ITP patients and&#xD;
      are involved in platelet destruction via augmented production of granzyme and perforin. NK&#xD;
      cells can also modulate cellular immunity in ITP patients.&#xD;
