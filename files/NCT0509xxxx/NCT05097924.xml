    <time_frame>Daily through study completion (age 2 to 5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Newborn Infant GI Tolerance eDiary will be completed daily (preferably in the evening) by parents, who will document the frequency and severity of diarrhea, gassiness, spitting-up, vomiting, reflux, abdominal pain, fussiness, crying, and sleep patterns using a 6-point scale (from Never to Always). Higher scores indicate more symptoms of GI discomfort.</description>

    <measure>Parent-reported individual GI- and feeding-related behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>At study completion (age 2 to 5 days)</time_frame>
    <description>At discharge, parents will complete the Gastrointestinal Tract Function sub-scale of the NeoEAT questionnaire (either the Bottle-Feeding or the Mixed-Feeding version, depending on the mother's chosen feeding mode) to document GI- and feeding-related behaviors using a 6-point scale (from Never to Always). Higher scores indicate more symptoms of GI discomfort and problematic feeding behavior.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Parent(s) must have independently elected, before enrollment, to formula feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infant age ≤ 24 hours after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child's parents / LAR are of legal age of consent, must understand the informed&#xD;
