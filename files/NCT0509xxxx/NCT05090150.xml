    <textblock>
      The investigators propose A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial of scalable&#xD;
      interventions for ART delivery in South Africa- the SMART ART study-a randomized study to&#xD;
      test adaptive ART delivery for persons with detectable viral load and/or not engaged in&#xD;
      care.The types of differentiated service delivery (DSD) that will be examined in this study&#xD;
      are incentives, community-based ART, and home delivery. The study plans to enroll up to 900&#xD;
      participants-people living with HIV and who are eligible for ART and living in KwaZulu-Natal,&#xD;
      South Africa. The study aims to maximize the proportion of ART eligible persons living with&#xD;
      HIV who achieve viral suppression at 18 months. The study will also evaluate the preferences&#xD;
      of clients and providers for differentiated service delivery, and evaluate the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of adaptive HIV treatment for those who are not engaged in care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the 8 million people in South Africa living with HIV, only 56% are on antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART), and 45% are virally suppressed, substantially below the UNAIDS goal of 73%.&#xD;
      Detectable viral load results in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality, and HIV&#xD;
      transmission. Patient barriers to care, such as missed wages, transport costs, and long wait&#xD;
      times for clinic visits and ART refills, are associated with detectable viral load. HIV&#xD;
      differentiated service delivery (DSD) has simplified ART delivery: incentives, multi-month&#xD;
      scripts, fast-track ART, and community or home ART delivery motivate clients, reduce the&#xD;
      frequency of clinic visits, and decongest clinics. DSD is standard for clients who achieve&#xD;
      viral suppression and engage in care; however, DSD needs adaptation to serve clients who are&#xD;
      not succeeding. Indeed, persons who are not engaged in care arguably need simplified,&#xD;
      client-centered approaches even more than those who can successfully engage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A suite of adaptive DSD strategies, including incentives strategies, community-based ART, and&#xD;
      home delivery, have been tested among stable clients with viral suppression. Lottery&#xD;
      incentives effectively change short-term behavior, increasing ART initiation.Community-based&#xD;
      and home ART delivery increase ART coverage and simplify ART access overcoming clinic&#xD;
      barriers11. For stable clients, these DSD activities are as effective as clinic-based care in&#xD;
      terms of achieving and maintaining viral suppression, although among stable clients they have&#xD;
      not shown superiority in viral suppression or cost savings. In contrast, DSD has the&#xD;
      potential to improve rates of viral suppression and retention in care and save costs among&#xD;
      persons not engaged in care. There is great potential that DSD systems can be&#xD;
      client-responsive and system-efficient for subgroups requiring additional services, matching&#xD;
      services with client needs. A sequential, comprehensive package of DSD approaches, with each&#xD;
      step increasing the intensity of service provision - adaptive DSD - has not been tested to&#xD;
      determine the proportion and characteristics of persons who would achieve viral suppression&#xD;
      and retention in care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase population level viral suppression, persons with detectable viral load need&#xD;
      responsive DSD interventions. A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART)&#xD;
      design facilitates evaluation of a stepped, adaptive approach to achieving viral suppression&#xD;
      with 'right-sized' interventions. The investigators are an experienced team and propose to&#xD;
      build on the strong partnerships to sequentially test adaptive DSD strategies for persons&#xD;
      with detectable viral load and/or not engaged in care: incentives, community-based ART, and&#xD;
      home delivery. As the Center for Community Based Research, the investigators maintain strong&#xD;
      connections with stakeholders including department of health, traditional leaders and ward&#xD;
      counsellors throughout the Greater Edendale Area (GEA) and the Vulindlela sub-district of the&#xD;
      uMgungundlovu District Municipality. Due to the size of the recruitment target, this work&#xD;
      will centre around the Caluza clinic but will extend into other parts of GEA and sub-district&#xD;
      of Vulindlela over the course of recruitment. The aim is to identify the most effective and&#xD;
      efficient HIV care delivery strategies.&#xD;
