    <description>participants will receive 15mg (starting dose)intravenous drop of 3D011-08,All subjects in each cohort will receive a single dose of 3D011-08 first, followed by a 7-day washout period (i.e. single-dose PK study period). Then, subjects will receive consecutive doses on 1,3,5day of each week (28 days/cycle) until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdraw of informed consent, whichever comes first.Dose of the study medication will be escalated sequentially till the dose limiting toxicity is achieved to determine the recommended part 2 doses (RPTD).</description>
