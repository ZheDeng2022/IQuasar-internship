  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is to suppress the activity of&#xD;
      the donor immune cells using steroid medications such as prednisone. Although most GVHD,&#xD;
      especially in children, responds well to treatment, sometimes (around 1/3 of the time) there&#xD;
      is either no response to steroids or the response does not last. In those cases, the GVHD can&#xD;
      become dangerous and even life-threatening. Unfortunately, doctors cannot predict who will&#xD;
      have a good response to treatment based on symptom severity or initial response to steroids.&#xD;
      As a result, nearly all children who develop GVHD are treated with long courses of high dose&#xD;
      steroids even though that means many patients receive more treatment than they probably need.&#xD;
      Steroid treatment can cause short-term complications like infections, high blood sugar, high&#xD;
      blood pressure, muscle weakness, depression, anxiety, and problems sleeping and long-term&#xD;
      complications like bone damage, cataracts in the eyes, and decreased growth. The risk of&#xD;
      these complications increases with higher doses of steroids and longer treatment. It is&#xD;
      important to find ways to decrease the steroid treatment in patients who do not need long&#xD;
      courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors conducting this research have developed a blood test (GVHD biomarkers) that&#xD;
      predicts whether a patient will respond well to steroids. The study team found that children&#xD;
      who have low GVHD biomarkers at the start of treatment and for the first two weeks of&#xD;
      treatment have a very high response rate to steroids. In this study, the study team will&#xD;
      monitor GVHD symptoms and biomarkers during treatment and taper steroids quickly in patients&#xD;
      who have GVHD that is expected to respond very well to treatment. The study team will assess&#xD;
      how many patients respond well to lower steroid dosing and what steroid complications&#xD;
      develop. The study team will also use surveys to obtain the patient's own assessment of their&#xD;
      quality of life (down to age 5 years).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with Minnesota standard risk GVHD that is also Ann Arbor 1 by biomarkers&#xD;
      will begin treatment at 0.5 mg/kg/d prednisone (or other steroid equivalent). Patients with&#xD;
      favorable clinical responses and biomarker scores at weeks 1 and 2 will have their steroid&#xD;
      doses tapered quickly on a weekly basis for four weeks. Patients whose GVHD does not respond&#xD;
      or have unfavorable biomarker scores will have their steroid doses increased and be removed&#xD;
      from study treatment. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients whose cumulative&#xD;
      steroid dose for the first four weeks is less than half of standard dosing.&#xD;

    <description>Proportion of patients who achieve a treatment response by day 28 of treatment. Treatment responses are defined as complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR). For a response to be scored as CR, VGPR, or PR on day 28, the patient must be in response on day 28 and have had no intervening systemic therapy for acute GVHD other than steroids.</description>

Serious infections are defined using the standardized criteria widely used for clinical trials at academic BMT centers, such as life-threatening fungal infections or hemorrhagic cystitis from BK viral infection and include clinically significant CMV infections that require anti-viral treatment regardless of end-organ damage, given the toxicity of such treatments. Serious infections include any viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections that requires systemic treatment.</description>
