      This study aims at determining clinical presentations and outcomes of patients with covid-19&#xD;
      pneumonia and also follow up of patients for up to 6 months to detect possibility of post&#xD;
      covid fibrosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the emergence of viral diseases represents&#xD;
      a serious public health risk. In the past two decades, several epidemics caused by viruses&#xD;
      such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 2002 to 2003, and&#xD;
      H1N1 influenza in 2009, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in&#xD;
      2012 have been described which have had a significant impact on global health. Since being&#xD;
      declared a global pandemic by the WHO, SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 has&#xD;
      spread to 223 countries with more than 178 million confirmed cases, and more than 3.8 million&#xD;
      deaths reported worldwide. The U.S. experienced the highest number of SARS-CoV-2 infections&#xD;
      and COVID-19 related deaths followed by Brazil and India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020 after heart&#xD;
      disease and cancer, with approximately 375,000 death reported . As of 22 June 2021, the&#xD;
      Alpha(B.1.1.7) variant has spread to 170 countries, the Beta (B.1.351) variant has been&#xD;
      reported in 119 countries, the Gamma (P.1) variant has been detected in 71 countries and the&#xD;
      Delta variant(B.1.617.2) has spread to 85 countries around the world based on the weekly&#xD;
      epidemiological update by the WHO . The WHO's current estimate of the global case fatality&#xD;
      rate for COVID-19 is 2.2%. However, the case fatality rate is affected by factors that&#xD;
      include age, underlying preexisting conditions, and severity of illness and significantly&#xD;
      varies between countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The common clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia in adults include fever, dry cough, sore&#xD;
      throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness . The disease manifestations in the&#xD;
      infected patients range from mild pneumonia (81%) to moderate pneumonia (hypoxia requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization, 14%), and critical illness (leading to invasive mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      multiorgan dysfunction and possibly death, 5%). The risk of death depends on age, underlying&#xD;
      comorbidities and severity of the disease, increasing up to 49% in critically ill patients.&#xD;
