      A Global, Multi-Center, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Clinical&#xD;
      Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Sequential Immunization of&#xD;
      Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Protein Vaccine (V-01) Against COVID-19 in Healthy Adults Aged&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III&#xD;
      clinical study. Approximately 10,722 participants aged 18 years and older who have completed&#xD;
      the 2 doses of administration of inactive vaccines (BBIBP-CorV or CoronaVac) will be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of V-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive dose of either 10 μg V-01 or a&#xD;
      placebo in a 1:1 randomization ratio. Assignment will be stratified by age (18-59 years vs. ≥&#xD;
      60 years), gender (male vs. female), whether or not being enrolled into immunogenicity&#xD;
      subgroup (yes vs no), and the types of inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV vs. CoronaVac).&#xD;
