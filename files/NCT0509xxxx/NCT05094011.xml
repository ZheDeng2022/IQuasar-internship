      MitoCell is an autologous stem cell product that cultures with the company's unique patented&#xD;
      medium. The mechanism of action of MitoCell is to improve the brain microenvironment in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease. MitoCell which like mesenchymal stem cells modulate the immune&#xD;
      response, and secrete more BDNF and SDF-1 neurotrophic factors than regular stem cell&#xD;
      products.Therefore, MitoCell can protect and repair damaged dopamine neurons (DA) and&#xD;
      stimulate DA regeneration.This project is a phase I open-label dose-escalation study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of autologous MitoCell intracranial&#xD;
      transplantation in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease which rating from stage 3 ~ 4&#xD;
      of modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr staging.&#xD;

    <description>Net change from baseline in BDI-II scores. BDI-II Scale is a 21-item self-reported questionnaire which measures the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Each of the 21 items on BDI-II tool represents a depressive symptom. The symptoms are each scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 to 3 (0=symptom is absent; 3=symptom is severe). Scores for each symptom are added up to obtain the total scores for all 21 items. Total score ranges from 0-63; of which 0-8 is considered no depression, 0-13 is minimal depression, 14-19 is mild depression, 20-28 is moderate depression and 29-63 is severe depression.</description>

    <description>Net change from baseline in HAM-D-17 scores. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item assessment used to assess the severity of depression and its improvement during the course of therapy. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. The total score was the sum of the scores from HAMD-17 Items 1 through 17 and ranged from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed).</description>

    <description>Net change from baseline in MMSE scores. The MMSE uses a 30 point questionnaire to measure cognitive impairment. The MMSE is scored from 0 to 30,with a score equal to or greater than 24 points indicating normal cognition, a score of 19-23 points indicating mild cognitive impairment, 10-18 points indicating moderate impairment and a score equal to or below 9 indicating severe impairment.</description>
