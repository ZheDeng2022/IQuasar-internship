  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The double lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) is the most widely-used device for single lung&#xD;
      ventilation in current thoracic anesthesia practice. In recent years, the routine application&#xD;
      of the videolaryngoscope for single lumen endotracheal intubation has increased; nevertheless&#xD;
      there are few studies of the use of the videolaryngoscope for DLT. The authors wondered&#xD;
      whether there were benefits to using the videolaryngoscope for DLT placement in patients with&#xD;
      predicted normal airways. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the performances of&#xD;
      the GlideScope®, the C-MAC®(D) videolaryngoscope and the Macintosh laryngoscope in DLT&#xD;
      intubation.&#xD;

      Patients randomly assigned into Macintosh group, GlideScope (Verathon Medical, Bothwell, UT,&#xD;
      USA) group, or CMAC(D) (Karl Storz GmbHand Co.KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) group. This will be&#xD;
      done using a closed envelope technique using a computer-generated block randomization method.&#xD;
      Before the study, the computerized randomization will be performed and the allocation results&#xD;
      will be placed in individual numbered and sealed envelopes. Patients remained blinded about&#xD;
      their intubation technique until post-operative assessment was completed. The researcher&#xD;
      responsible for recruitment will be blinded to the allocation result. After a patient will be&#xD;
      consented for the study, allocation will be revealed. All endotracheal intubations will be&#xD;
      performed by fthe same anesthesiologist with 10 years' working experience skilled in&#xD;
      videolaryngoscopy. Left-side or right-side 32Fr/35Fr Mallinckrodt™ DLTs (Mallinckrodt&#xD;
      Medical, Athlone, Ireland) will be selected for female patients and 35Fr/37Fr DLTs for male&#xD;
      patients depending on whether their heights were below or above 155 cm for females and 165 cm&#xD;
      for males. If the operation side will be the left, right-side DLT will be used; otherwise,&#xD;
      the left-side DLT will be used. To facilitate intubation, the distal 10-12 cm concavity of&#xD;
      the DLT (with the stylet in situ) will be molded along the blade convexity in each group. The&#xD;
      tracheal and the bronchial cuffs of the DLT tubes will be lubricated with sterile Surgilube.&#xD;
      No premedication will be given before induction. Standard monitoring prior to induction&#xD;
      included ECG, invasive arterial blood pressure, SpO2, and end-tidal carbon dioxide. After&#xD;
      pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen, anesthesia will be induced with intravenous midazolam 0.05&#xD;
      mg. kg- 1 , propofol 1.5 mg. kg- 1 , fentanyl 5 μg. kg- 1 , and rocuronium 0.6 mg. kg- 1 .&#xD;
      Two minutes after rocuronium administration, DLT intubation will be performed using the&#xD;
      allocated laryngoscope. The DLT will be inserted with the distal concavity facing anteriorly&#xD;
      until the bronchial lumen cuff passed the vocal cords. The stylet will be then removed, and&#xD;
      rotation will be performed while tube will be advanced. The left DLT rotated 90°&#xD;
      counter-clockwise, and the right DLT will be rotated 90° clockwise to enter the respective&#xD;
      mainstem bronchus. The number of intubation attempts, ease of laryngoscopy insertion, Quality&#xD;
      of view, Assist maneuvers, Intubation difficulty will be recorded. Hemodynamic changes will&#xD;
      be monitored during induction. If systolic blood pressure fell below 80 mmHg, ephedrine 5 mg&#xD;
      will be administrated intravenously. Atropine 0.5 mg will be given for heart rate below 50&#xD;
      beats per minute. After the tip of the DLT was located in the targeted bronchus, the tracheal&#xD;
      cuff will be inflated and ventilation of the lungs started. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic&#xD;
      assessment of adequate bronchial cuff placement will be followed by DLT placement. DLT&#xD;
      insertion time will be defined as from the time the laryngoscope passed the patient's lips&#xD;
      until three complete end-tidal carbon dioxide cycles were displayed on the monitor.&#xD;
      Intubation success rate at the first attempt will be recorded by the same observer. The&#xD;
      difficulty of DLT insertion and delivery will be assessed by the operator, using NRS ranging&#xD;
      from 0 to 10. The NRS results will be grouped as 0 = none, 1-3 = mild, 4-6 = moderate, and&#xD;
      7-10 = severe. C/L degrees were classified as four degrees (I, IIA, IIB, and III) and will be&#xD;
      assessed by the same operator. If the degree will be not class I, external laryngeal pressure&#xD;
      will be provided by an assistant. Time required to successful intubation. Intubation time is&#xD;
      defined as the time taken for insertion of the blade between the teeth till the tracheal tube&#xD;
      cuffٴ passed through the vocal cords. Failure of intubation was defined as any intubation&#xD;
      attempt of &gt;120 s or inability to intubate. Number of intubation attempts, Ease of&#xD;
      laryngoscope insertion, Quality of view by Cormack and Lehane grade . Assist maneuvers.&#xD;
      Intubation difficult score indicates the degree of difficulty of intubation using 7&#xD;
      parameters (0=easy intubation, 0 ˂IDS≤5 =slight difficulty, 5 &lt; IDS =moderate to major&#xD;
      diffculty, IDS= ∞ impossible intubation) . The time taken for fiberoptic bronchoscopy was&#xD;
      defined as the time from endobronchial intubation to placement confirmation using fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy. The operators examined blade surfaces for blood after removal. Hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters (mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate) will be recorded 10 min before&#xD;
      induction and 1, 3, and 5 min after intubation. After the assessment by fiberoptic&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and teeth will be examined for signs of&#xD;
      laceration or bleeding by an independent investigator who will be unaware of the type of&#xD;
      laryngoscope used. One day after surgery, an independent investigator will interview patients&#xD;
      to assess the presence of sore throat and hoarseness of voice.&#xD;
