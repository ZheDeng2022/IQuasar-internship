      Our study focuses on the question about cardiac rehabilitation (CR) patients with coronary&#xD;
      heart disease are concerned about demonstrating the association between the patients' view of&#xD;
      CR and socio-psychological associated factors. In our study, all participants are invited to&#xD;
      choose at least 5 questions in 15 questions or provide their questions regarding their doubt&#xD;
      about the CR after filling in their personal information. The selectable questions can be&#xD;
      categorized into five titles: the content or purpose of CR, the method of CR, the advantage&#xD;
      of CR, the adverse effect of CR, and the expenditure of CR.&#xD;
