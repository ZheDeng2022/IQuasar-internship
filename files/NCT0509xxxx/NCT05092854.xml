      The primary purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of a topical sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate lotion (PR Lotion, AMP Human, Park City, UT) on measures of hydration status and&#xD;
      fluid balance in humans when exposed to the heat while resting and during light/moderate&#xD;
      aerobic exercise. A secondary purpose is to examine these same effects with two differing&#xD;
      dosage patterns of the lotion. A tertiary purpose is to investigate the effect of an amino&#xD;
      acid rehydration beverage in comparison to a placebo on measurements of hydration, subjective&#xD;
      assessments of stress, and vestibular as well as musculoskeletal measures of fatigue for up&#xD;
      to 24-hours after the completion of both passive and exertional heat stress within a&#xD;
      dehydrated state.&#xD;

      Design This laboratory study will involve the inclusion of 20 male participants from the&#xD;
      local community and university who are within the age range of 18 - 45 years old and can be&#xD;
      classified as recreationally active adults as indicated by a VO2max minimum (45 ml/kg/min)&#xD;
      who choose to volunteer for this research study. This project will be conducted within the&#xD;
      thermal physiology laboratory, complete with a climatic chamber (Cantrol, CES +13/+44)&#xD;
      located within the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) at the University of Connecticut. We&#xD;
      expect data collection to take approximately 3-4 months for completion and each interested&#xD;
      individual will complete all five trials included within the study design within a&#xD;
      randomized, counterbalanced order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned de-identified codes, trial grouping orders, and&#xD;
      allocation of amino acid rehydration beverages (i.e., aminoVITAL Rapid Recovery or Placebo)&#xD;
      after approval has been provided and consent has been obtained. The order of participation&#xD;
      will be counterbalanced between participants to ensure that there is not an order effect with&#xD;
      each participant completing all 5 trials outlined in the study design. Additionally, for the&#xD;
      post trial amino acid rehydration portion of the study only, participants will be matched&#xD;
      based on an assortment of physiological variables measured (i.e., physical fitness [VO2max],&#xD;
      body mass index, body surface area, age, height, and/or weight) in regards to their assigned&#xD;
      allocation of the amino acid rehydration beverages (i.e., aminoVITAL Rapid Recovery or&#xD;
      Placebo) that will be consumed during the recovery period of the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental Conditions Session I as well as all Baseline Visits and matched-control 24-hour&#xD;
      Rehydration Sessions (i.e., AminoVITAL Rapid Recovery or Placebo) will be completed within&#xD;
      thermoneutral conditions. Moreover, all Dehydration Periods associated with completion of the&#xD;
      study will be completed by the participant outside of the laboratory. Finally, all&#xD;
      counterbalanced testing sessions (i.e., 0.8PR-Fluid, 0.4PR-Fluid, PLA-Fluid, 0.8PR-Dry, and&#xD;
      PLA-Dry) will be conducted within the climatic chamber set to a climate with an ambient&#xD;
      temperature at approximately 330C (91.40F) and relative humidity at approximately 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and VO2max Testing - Session 1 Session 1 will serve as a baseline testing session to&#xD;
      obtain an assortment of physiological, vestibular, strength, and cognitive measurements to&#xD;
      conduct an effective baseline measurement for each individual participating in this study.&#xD;
      Physiological assessments will include measurements of each individual's body composition&#xD;
      (height, weight, and body fat percentage), cardiovascular health (resting blood pressure,&#xD;
      heart rate, and HRV), and aerobic fitness level via assessment of maximal oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2max). Furthermore, participants will be assessed for their cognitive abilities (ANAM&#xD;
      testing battery), vestibular performance (BESS) and physical performance (grip strength and&#xD;
      grip endurance). For the completion of this testing session, participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to consume an efficient amount of fluids to ensure proper hydration for testing.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be instructed to refrain from eating or smoking for up to 3&#xD;
      hours before the beginning of their session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrival Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival, subjects will be asked if they have refrained from excluded nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation for the last 48 hours, exercise and alcohol consumption in the past 24 hours,&#xD;
      and caffeine for the last 12 hours. Next, subjects will provide their nude body mass and a&#xD;
      urine sample within a clean urine cup for the assessment of urine specific gravity (USG) and&#xD;
      urine color to determine hydration status. Privacy will be afforded for each participant&#xD;
      while obtaining body mass measures by taking measurements with the participant alone in a&#xD;
      private room and the research team member reading the scale outside of the room. Those with a&#xD;
      USG &lt;1.020 will be allowed to proceed with the exercise protocol. Those with a USG between&#xD;
      1.020-1.025 will be given approximately 500ml of water for immediate consumption with the&#xD;
      completion of an additional USG assessment to ensure participants are efficiently hydrated.&#xD;
      Those with a USG &gt;1.025 will be rescheduled for another day due to inadequate hydration. Upon&#xD;
      completion participants will have their height measured via stadiometer and body composition&#xD;
      assessed via air displacement plethysmography (BodPodÂ®; Cosmed, Software Version 4.2+,&#xD;
      Concord, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of all arrival procedures, participants will then be asked to don a heart&#xD;
      rate strap and rest for approximately five minutes before having baseline cardiovascular&#xD;
      measurements completed including resting heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), and blood pressure (BP). Afterwards, participants will then be asked to complete the&#xD;
      baseline measurement for their cognitive performance battery which will include the&#xD;
      completion of the Modified Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), hand grip strength and&#xD;
      endurance and the ANAM testing battery. Afterwards, participants will then be asked to&#xD;
      complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test performed via running on a motorized treadmill&#xD;
      within a thermoneutral environment. This assessment will be completed as a baseline&#xD;
      assessment for the participant's aerobic fitness (VO2max test) and the results (i.e., minimum&#xD;
      VO2max of 45 ml/kg/min) will be used as a final inclusionary criteria measurement for the&#xD;
      participant. Please see the Measurements Completed section for further information regarding&#xD;
      procedures completed when conducting these testing protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing of Biomedical Intervention - Climatic Chamber Testing Sessions Participants will be&#xD;
      eligible to initiate the testing phase of their participation approximately 48 hours after&#xD;
      the completion of all Session 1 baseline protocols. Furthermore, a minimum of 72 hours&#xD;
      (approximately 3 days) must pass between the completion of each testing session completed.&#xD;
      However, participants will be provided flexibility in scheduling through the option to&#xD;
      reschedule testing sessions if needed to accommodate their personal schedules or rescheduling&#xD;
      within the laboratory space. As previously outlined, the order of trials completed will be&#xD;
      randomized to limit the possibility of an order effect for responses obtained to be detected.&#xD;
      Each trial will include a predetermined amount (i.e., 0.8g/kg or 0.4g/kg) of the biomedical&#xD;
      intervention (PR lotion or Placebo lotion) to be provided by the project sponsor.&#xD;
      Differential amounts will be provided to investigate if a dose-dependent response may be&#xD;
      elicited for the benefits of application regarding the biomedical intervention. For all&#xD;
      trials, participants will undergo fluid restriction to attain hypohydration. Moreover,&#xD;
      participants will arrive to the laboratory in a dehydrated state (protocols regarding this&#xD;
      have been provided further below) and will either receive a pre-determined fluid bolus to&#xD;
      replace a portion of their previous day's losses (relative to their body composition) or no&#xD;
      fluid. This will allow us to assess the efficiency of the biomedical intervention for the&#xD;
      retention of fluids consumed during their exposure to both passive and exertional heat stress&#xD;
      while in a dehydrated state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visits and Dehydration Periods To properly induce dehydration within study&#xD;
      participants, they will be asked not to take in fluid or high fluid containing foods (i.e.,&#xD;
      soup, cereal with milk, etc.) for approximately 18-24 hours prior to their scheduled Climatic&#xD;
      Chamber Testing Session. However, before the initiation of this fluid restriction period,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to arrive to the HPL for the completion of a pre-testing Baseline&#xD;
      Visit that will need to be conducted before the beginning of each individual phase within the&#xD;
      study. This session will include the collection of the participant's nude body weight in&#xD;
      addition to a spot urine sample and a blood draw. The collection of the participant's nude&#xD;
      body weight and urine sample will be conducted within the privacy of a restroom within the&#xD;
      HPL. Additionally, a single blood draw will be conducted for the collection of approximately&#xD;
      11 mL (~0.75 tablespoon) of blood. These measurements will be collected in order to provide a&#xD;
      euhydrated baseline measurement to compare to the measurements collected at the beginning of&#xD;
      each Climatic Chamber Testing Session to confirm that proper dehydration has been attained.&#xD;
      At the completion of all the previously described tasks associated with this visit,&#xD;
      participants will be provided a urine jug for the collection of a 24-hour urine sample which&#xD;
      will be provided to the administrating research personnel upon arrival for their upcoming&#xD;
      testing session. Additionally, participants will also be asked to consume a similar dietary&#xD;
      intake between each lab visit (measured via completion of the dietary recall log), with the&#xD;
      exception of fluid and high fluid containing foods. This time period has been designed to&#xD;
      elicit an&#xD;
&#xD;
      ~1.5-3.0% loss in body mass and has been performed previously in our laboratory (See UCONN&#xD;
      IRB Protocol #H18-220, #H15-183, and #H10-043).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Testing Procedures The initial Climatic Chamber Testing Session can be completed after&#xD;
      approximately 48 hours have passed since the completion of all Session 1 baseline testing&#xD;
      procedures. This time period would include the completion of both the phase specific Baseline&#xD;
      Visit and Dehydration Period. Phases 2, 3, 4, and 5 will be completed approximately 24 hours&#xD;
      the completion of their phase specific Baseline Visit where participants will be instructed&#xD;
      to arrive at the HPL at the cessation of their Dehydration Period. Similar to Session 1,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to refrain from eating or smoking for up to 3 hours before&#xD;
      the beginning of their testing session. Additionally, participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      partake in an 18-24-hour fluid restriction period in order to exacerbate the dehydrated&#xD;
      response to both passive and exertional heat stress. For testing sessions only, upon arrival&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete a nude body mass in private to confirm that they have&#xD;
      achieved the desired level of dehydration from their baseline (~1.5-3%). In addition to the&#xD;
      body mass loss, participants will also be asked to provide their 24-hour urine sample&#xD;
      (collected during the dehydration period) and a spot urine sample. The spot urine sample will&#xD;
      be used to confirm dehydration indicated by a USG &gt;1.024, however this urinary measure will&#xD;
      not exclude participation but rather confirm the participant's hydration status. Next, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to don a heart rate strap and provide their completed thirst scale&#xD;
      and dietary recall log. Upon completion, resting cardiovascular measurements will be&#xD;
      collected including HRV, HR, and BP. Once completed, the participant will complete the&#xD;
      cognitive/performance battery which will include completion of the ANAM testing battery,&#xD;
      BESS, and hand grip strength and endurance. Afterwards, participants will have a venous&#xD;
      cannula inserted by an HPL trained research team member to allow for subsequent sampling of&#xD;
      blood without the need for multiple needle sticks. Upon a successful insertion of the venous&#xD;
      cannula a blood draw will be completed for the collection of 11 mL (~0.75 tablespoon) of&#xD;
      blood. Afterwards, the participant will have the Nix Biosensor applied to the pre-determined&#xD;
      location on their body (between the belly button and the rib cage) and will be provided the&#xD;
      predetermined amount (i.e., 0.8g/kg or 0.4g/kg) of the biomedical intervention supplement&#xD;
      (i.e., PR or Placebo Lotion) to be applied to their entire body (from neck to ankles) within&#xD;
      the privacy of a restroom. Finally, prior to entering the environmental chamber, participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to privately insert the rectal thermometer 10-15 cm beyond the anal&#xD;
      sphincter for the continuous monitoring of core body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection - Initial 95 minutes Once the subject has indicated they have successfully&#xD;
      completed all required arrival procedures, they will then be permitted to enter the&#xD;
      environmental chamber (~330C [91.40F], ~25% relative humidity) where they will be instructed&#xD;
      to sit down at a desk provided and begin a 15-minute period of environmental equilibration.&#xD;
      At the end of the environmental equilibration, identified as time point 0 in Figure 7, the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete an HRV assessment before having another 11mL blood&#xD;
      sample, nude body mass, and spot urine sample collected. Similar assessments will be&#xD;
      completed at time point 40. At time point 80, similar assessments will be completed in&#xD;
      addition to the cognitive battery (ANAM testing battery) and the performance battery (BESS&#xD;
      and hand grip strength and endurance). Furthermore, 2 additional 3 mL blood samples (~1&#xD;
      teaspoon total) will be collected at time points 20 and 60 of the protocol as illustrated in&#xD;
      Figure 7. Finally, three equal fluid boluses will be provided for three of the proposed&#xD;
      phases to be completed (0.8PR - Fluid, 0.4PR - Fluid, PLA - Fluid) at the 10-, 20-, and 30-&#xD;
      minute marks as illustrated in Figure 7. The fluid bolus amount will be relative to the&#xD;
      subject's body composition and will be enough to replace ~1% of the body mass lost between&#xD;
      body mass measured on the intervention trial day and body mass measured during their initial&#xD;
      baseline visit (Session 1). This fluid bolus will be provided for the assessment of fluid&#xD;
      retention in regards to the biomedical intervention and its associated amount applied to the&#xD;
      participant's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection - 120-minute Exercise Protocol At the completion of all data collection&#xD;
      procedures conducted at the 80-minute mark (i.e., passive heat stress), the participant will&#xD;
      immediately be escorted to the treadmill for the initiation of their exercise protocol. The&#xD;
      protocol will include the completion of aerobic exercise (walking or jogging) conducted at&#xD;
      ~40% of the participant's velocity measured during the last stage of their baseline VO2max&#xD;
      test (i.e., vVO2max). This portion of the protocol (i.e., exertional heat stress) will begin&#xD;
      with the participant donning the Hans Rudolph mask which will be attached to a breathing tube&#xD;
      for the measurement of expired air delivered to the metabolic cart system during the exercise&#xD;
      protocol. Similar to measurements collected during the participant's baseline VO2max test,&#xD;
      the metabolic cart will continuously measure respiratory exchange ratio (RER), oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) while being used by the participant.&#xD;
      This assessment will be used during three separate 5-minute intervals at the 100-, 160-, and&#xD;
      215-minute marks. Aerobic exercise completed between these time points will not require the&#xD;
      subject to wear the Hans Rudolph mask as indicated in Figure 7. Using the previously inserted&#xD;
      cannula, supplemental 3 mL blood draws will be completed at the 130- and 190-minute marks.&#xD;
      Additionally, one 11 mL blood draw will be completed at the 220-minute time mark. Finally,&#xD;
      assessments will be completed immediately after the completion of the exercise protocol and&#xD;
      will include the assessment of the participant's nude body mass and collection of a spot&#xD;
      urine sample in addition to assessment of the participants cardiovascular health (i.e., HR,&#xD;
      HRV, and BP) and completion of the cognitive battery (ANAM testing battery) and performance&#xD;
      tasks (BESS, hand grip strength, and hand grip endurance). Once all measurements have been&#xD;
      collected the participant will be directed to exit the environmental chamber for the&#xD;
      completion of their discharge from the HPL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study - 24-hour Rehydration Sessions At the completion of the participant's discharge&#xD;
      procedures, the participant will initiate their 24-hour recovery period where the progression&#xD;
      of their rehydration during the post-exercise recovery period will be compared between the&#xD;
      provision of one of two amino acid rehydration beverages (i.e., AminoVITAL Rapid Recovery or&#xD;
      Placebo). For the completion of comparisons between these two beverages, participants will be&#xD;
      matched on demographical information pertaining to their aerobic fitness level (i.e.,&#xD;
      VO2max), body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), and/or age. Once identified, the&#xD;
      beverage will be provided to the participant before the completion of each of their discharge&#xD;
      protocols to ensure completion for the 24-hour follow-up session. Moreover, participants will&#xD;
      be provided specific instructions pertaining to consistency in regards to their nutritional&#xD;
      intake and fluid consumption over the 24-hour period following exercise until they are&#xD;
      directed to come back to the HPL for the completion of follow-up testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehydration Protocol Before departing the HPL, participants will be provided four separate&#xD;
      bags where each will include all of the following items: (1) one jug provided for the&#xD;
      collection of urine throughout the predetermined time period; (2) one urine cup for the&#xD;
      collection of a spot urine sample at the end of each predetermined time period; (3) two&#xD;
      perceptual questionnaires (i.e., AD-ACL and CFS) for completion at the end of each&#xD;
      predetermined time period; and (4) the predetermined nutritional supplement (AminoVITAL Rapid&#xD;
      Recovery or Placebo) to be consumed at the beginning of each predetermined time period (See&#xD;
      illustration of timeline in Figure 8). Participants will be instructed on storage of all&#xD;
      materials and will be required to return all completed materials and collected biospecimens&#xD;
      upon their return to the HPL approximately 24-hours after the completion of their testing&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical Solution Procedures Supplies containing the topical solution will be provided to the&#xD;
      participant for application to their body within the privacy of a restroom. The amount of&#xD;
      lotion provided for application will be dependent on the session completed (i.e., 0.8g/kg or&#xD;
      0.4g/kg) and relative to the participant's body composition. To ensure the product usage&#xD;
      adheres to the drug facts label provided, research team personnel will ensure that the bottle&#xD;
      is well shaken prior to dispensing the lotion into the plastic bag. When it is time to apply&#xD;
      the product to their body, the participant will be instructed to wash their hands before and&#xD;
      after applying the product in addition to avoiding contact with any open orifices on their&#xD;
      face (i.e., eyes, mouth, nose, etc.) until their hands have been washed. In efforts to keep&#xD;
      the lotion from the participant's hands, the lotion will be provided within a plastic bag and&#xD;
      the participant will be instructed to insert their hand into the opposite side of the bag&#xD;
      while directly applying the lotion to the body from the bag. After the lotion has been&#xD;
      appropriately applied, the participant will return the used bag to the research team member&#xD;
      so that pre-application and post-application weight can be measured and compared for proper&#xD;
      assessment of lotion amount applied to the skin. Participants will be instructed to apply the&#xD;
      solution primarily to areas of their lower extremities (i.e., thighs, hamstrings, calves,&#xD;
      buttocks, etc.) in addition to their lower back, arms, midsection, and/or chest if enough&#xD;
      solution is available. Application will be considered complete when the solution has been&#xD;
      transmitted to the skin in a fashion where no residue from the lotion is visible by&#xD;
      researchers from the skin of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Urine Samples and Body Weight Measurements For the collection of all urine spot&#xD;
      samples, researchers will provide a clean cup and top to seal the capsule. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to provide a sample regardless of urgency to urinate at specific time points during&#xD;
      the trial. If the participant is unable to provide a sample at the time point requested, no&#xD;
      protocol deviation will be considered as the lack in sample provided will still be used&#xD;
      towards the completion of data analysis. Furthermore, if the participant must provide a urine&#xD;
      sample without being requested by a research team member, any urine expelled will be added to&#xD;
      the amount collected (if any) during the next urine sample collection time point.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be instructed to complete a measurement of nude body weight&#xD;
      completed before the provision of a urine sample. Both the collection of urine samples and&#xD;
      measurement of body weight will be completed within the privacy of a bathroom.&#xD;
