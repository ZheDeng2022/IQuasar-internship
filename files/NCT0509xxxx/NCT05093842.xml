  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot and feasibility study will enroll newly pregnant women at risk for high sedentary&#xD;
      behavior (SED) and elevated APO risk (n=53) and will randomize them to either a SED reduction&#xD;
      intervention or control. Research aims include to: 1) demonstrate our ability to decrease SED&#xD;
      and increase standing and light activity in pregnant women; 2) evaluate feasibility; and 3)&#xD;
      gather preliminary effects on clinical outcomes including APOs, cardiometabolic risk factors,&#xD;
      well-being, and fetal outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 1 in 4 deaths among women of reproductive age.&#xD;
      Decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO), e.g. hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, and preterm birth, could reduce this burden. APOs have serious&#xD;
      immediate health consequences and are recognized by the AHA as major risk factors for future&#xD;
      CVD. Yet, APOs are hard to prevent and treat, with a 20% prevalence that is increasing in the&#xD;
      U.S. Moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) reduces APOs, but less than 1 in 4&#xD;
      pregnant women achieve guidelines and pregnant women report unique barriers such as fatigue,&#xD;
      pain, medical restriction, and concern for the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting, or 'sedentary behavior' (SED) is a novel risk factor for CVD. Yet, sparse research&#xD;
      and no U.S. guidelines exist for SED in pregnancy. Our recent AHA-funded cohort study in&#xD;
      pregnant women (n=120) objectively measured SED and MVPA during each trimester. While MVPA&#xD;
      was not related to outcomes, pregnant women with high vs. low SED across pregnancy had&#xD;
      greater odds of APO and gave birth to babies at a reduced gestational age. Considering that&#xD;
      decreasing SED may be more feasible given the barriers to MVPA, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that a SED reduction intervention may be especially promising for reducing APOs and improving&#xD;
      cardiovascular health for women and their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the dearth of SED research, trials, or guidelines for pregnant women, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to use our preliminary data on behavioral targets, correlates, and determinants of&#xD;
      SED during pregnancy to adapt our previously successful SED reduction interventions. This&#xD;
      pilot and feasibility study will enroll newly pregnant women with high SED and elevated APO&#xD;
      risk (n=53) and randomize them to either a SED reduction intervention or control (2:1 ratio).&#xD;
      Research aims include to: 1) demonstrate our ability to decrease SED and increase standing&#xD;
      and light activity in pregnant women; 2) evaluate feasibility; and 3) gather preliminary&#xD;
      effects on clinical outcomes including APOs, cardiometabolic risk factors, well-being, and&#xD;
      fetal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete three assessment visits, one in each trimester, including 1-week&#xD;
      monitoring of SED and activity patterns with a thigh-worn activPAL and blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement using a standard protocol. Other outcomes will be assessed by self-report and&#xD;
      medical record review after the participant gives birth. Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will be provided with a fitbit, a sit-stand desk attachment, and will&#xD;
      complete virtual health coaching visits every two weeks throughout pregnancy to facilitate&#xD;
      reduced SED, increase standing, and increased stepping throughout the day.&#xD;
