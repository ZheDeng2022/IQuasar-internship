  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this study is to improve fall prevention efforts in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults with peripheral artery disease (PAD) to reduce falls. To&#xD;
      accomplish this, the investigators will conduct a feasibility study and pilot the addition of&#xD;
      a balance exercise component to existing supervised exercise therapy (SET) programs for PAD.&#xD;
      This intervention may be an effective way to help older adults with PAD self-manage their leg&#xD;
      pain and walking impairments as well as fall risk. The long-term goal of this research is to&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality associated with falls in older adults with symptomatic PAD&#xD;
      through the development and evaluation of a balance intervention component implemented within&#xD;
      existing exercise programs. Findings from this research may also be translated to the&#xD;
      implementation of disease management programs for other chronic conditions associated with&#xD;
      fall risk. The rationale for this research is to determine improve disease-specific,&#xD;
      comprehensive and fall prevention strategies for older adults with PAD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a growing public health concern as the proportion of aging adults will continue to&#xD;
      increase in the coming years and the prevalence of falls is high. Older adults with PAD have&#xD;
      previously demonstrated impaired static balance, higher prevalence of history of&#xD;
      stumbling/unsteadiness (41%) and falling (26%), and abnormal balance using computerized&#xD;
      dynamic posturography compared to non-PAD controls. Adults with symptomatic PAD also&#xD;
      demonstrate LE weakness and gait deficiencies due to impaired muscle power and biomechanics.&#xD;
      While still unspecified, muscle weakness and ischemic neuropathy could partially explain the&#xD;
      etiology for impaired balance in those with PAD. Other potential associations with increased&#xD;
      fall risk in PAD may include claudication, limited physical activity, and poor LE function.&#xD;
      Through expansion of disease-specific knowledge related to fall prevention interventions in&#xD;
      older adults with PAD, healthcare providers may find that targeted balance screening and&#xD;
      interventions to improve balance and strength are essential to disease management and the&#xD;
      prevention of disability. The proposed study is innovative as it is the first balance&#xD;
      intervention study in PAD and uses an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. Given the&#xD;
      known associations between PAD and balance, in addition to morbidity and mortality associated&#xD;
      with falls in the general population of older adults, the contribution of this knowledge is&#xD;
      unique in that it will improve understanding of interventional study designs, leading to&#xD;
      future revisions in prevention strategies for this sub-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from a recent systematic review of fall prevention interventions for&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults with chronic conditions suggest that the stage of&#xD;
      intervention development primarily lies within efficacy-based RCTs that focus on internal&#xD;
      validity, which limits the generalizability of these intervention effects for varying&#xD;
      contexts. Most of these interventional studies did not report detail related to adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance, such as recruitment of participants from the target populations and intervention&#xD;
      adoption by staff, which are critical to understanding how to implement these interventions&#xD;
      in clinical settings. There was also a lack of qualitative research methods use across the&#xD;
      studies, which limits the understanding of participants' acceptability and perceived&#xD;
      intervention effects. Most of these trials were conducted in controlled research setting&#xD;
      environments adjacent to, but not integrated within, clinical practice settings without staff&#xD;
      involvement, which impacts the adoption of these programs. While all of the studies in the&#xD;
      review included targeted, individuals, and moderately challenging balance exercises (some&#xD;
      with additional strength and aerobic training components), the dosing of balance exercises&#xD;
      was not sufficient to meet the exercise duration recommendations over the intervention&#xD;
      period. Due to the stage of development, it is challenging to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      implementation and public impact of these interventions with delivery performed by clinicians&#xD;
      and community partners who have direct contact with this target population. Despite the&#xD;
      inextricable relationships between fall risk and PAD, self- management interventions for fall&#xD;
      risk and PAD are currently not integrated into PAD treatment. Often, interventions for&#xD;
      self-management of chronic conditions and fall prevention are delivered separately. Given the&#xD;
      complexity, time, and effort required for PAD self-management programs, a separate stand-&#xD;
      alone program for fall prevention exercises is unlikely due to its added burden on patients.&#xD;
      Thus, there is a need to explore the feasibility of integrating evidence- based fall&#xD;
      prevention exercises into existing PAD programs. Some researchers have investigated the&#xD;
      integration of rehabilitation programs and fall prevention in patients with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease, where balance exercises were delivered as part of either&#xD;
      outpatient and inpatient pulmonary rehab. Although balance training has not been implemented&#xD;
      as a standard treatment for PAD subgroups, there is potential for its addition to established&#xD;
      PAD programs. Many older adults with PAD participate in outpatient supervised exercise&#xD;
      therapy (SET) walking programs, which are the most effective non-invasive method to mitigate&#xD;
      claudication and improve walking function in adults with PAD. In addition to mitigating fall&#xD;
      risk, the combined balance training within SET programs also has potential to improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Balance training could be an adjunct to the SET standard of care, which is designed&#xD;
      to improve claudication symptoms and address walking function. Although intermittent&#xD;
      treadmill walking is the optimal mode to maximize benefits from exercise training for PAD, it&#xD;
      is often contraindicated or refused due to poor balance. As walking demands adequate balance,&#xD;
      LE strength, and endurance, individuals with poor postural control may benefit from improving&#xD;
      their balance prior to or during the initiation of walking exercise to manage their vascular&#xD;
      disease. Thus, the simultaneous learning and mastering of balance exercises to reduce fall&#xD;
      risk may enable successful participation in treadmill walking, thus maximizing the benefits&#xD;
      gained from SET.&#xD;
