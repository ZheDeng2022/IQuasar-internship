  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if relapsing-remitting MS patients that have not had a relapse in&#xD;
      the past year would benefit from a switch to ofatumumab versus staying on their continued&#xD;
      current therapy. This study will also look at whether an elevated serum neurofilament light&#xD;
      (NfL) level predicts enhanced benefit from a switch to ofatumumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective study of up to 150 relapsing-remitting MS participants/&#xD;
      The study is looking to see if patients who have not had a relapse in the past year would&#xD;
      benefit from switching to ofatumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving consent, participants will have a 1 week screening/qualification period. If they&#xD;
      qualify to continue, they will start a a six month run-in period during which lab samples&#xD;
      will be collected. Patients that are relapse-free during the run-in period will continue into&#xD;
      next period of the study in which they will be randomized to either ofatumumab or continued&#xD;
      therapy for the next 15 months. Every 3 out of 5 randomized participants will be selected to&#xD;
      wear a digital study watch to collect physical activity, sleep, and vitals during this 15&#xD;
      month period. The study watch will be worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week but can be removed&#xD;
      during showers/bathing. At the end of the 15 month period, a study completion visit will be&#xD;
      held.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total study duration is 21 months plus 1 week for screening/qualification.&#xD;

    <description>Participants with a single baseline NfL≥10 pg/ml and NfL&lt;10pg/ml will be considered as achieved NEDA-3 if the participant has not had a clinical relapse (recurrence of a disease activity after a recovery), has not had an increase in disability and has no new radiological MRI activity (no new occurrences of contrast-enhancing lesions)</description>

    <measure>Annualized relapse rate in Months 3 to 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Months 3 to 15</time_frame>
    <description>Relapses are recurrences of a disease activity after a recovery. A confirmed MS relapse is one accompanied by a clinically relevant change in the EDSS performed by the EDSS Rater, i.e. an increase of at least 0.5 points on the EDSS score, or an increase of 1 point on two functional scores (FSs) or 2 points on one FS, excluding changes involving bowel/bladder or cerebral FS compared to the previous available rating (the last EDSS rating that did not occur during a relapse). Confirmation of MS relapse based on these definitions will be done centrally.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in the Time 25 Foot Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 3 and 15</time_frame>
    <description>This is a test of mobility and leg function. The patient is instructed to one end of a marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time to complete the test is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is performed again when the patient is directed to walk back the same distance. A walking device is permitted during this test.</description>

The patient picks up the nine pegs one at a time as quickly as possible, puts them in nine holes and once they are in the holes, the patient removes them again as quickly as possible one at a time, replacing them into the shallow container. The total time to complete the task is recorded. This test is performed with both the dominant and non-dominant hand.</description>
