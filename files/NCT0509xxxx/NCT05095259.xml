    <textblock>
      An experimental observational case-control study. The overall objective is to gain new&#xD;
      knowledge about mechanisms involved in adaptation to recurrent hypoglycaemia in diabetes by&#xD;
      investigating patients with type 1 diabetes and healthy controls. The knowledge to be&#xD;
      obtained may feed into experimental hypoglycaemic clamp studies to further elucidate the&#xD;
      effect of the adaptations during acute hypoglycaemia. Ultimately, it may lead to intervention&#xD;
      studies aiming at the maintenance of functional capability during hypoglycaemia in patients&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes to reduce their risk of severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study rationale The risk of severe hypoglycaemia is a major daily concern for people with&#xD;
      diabetes treated with insulin. Severe hypoglycaemia is the main barrier in achieving the&#xD;
      recommended glycaemic targets and may indirectly be the main driver for late diabetic&#xD;
      complications and related morbidity, mortality and health care costs. In people with&#xD;
      diabetes, recurrent exposure to insulin-induced mild hypoglycaemia leads to significant&#xD;
      adaptive physiologic responses. While the metabolism of the brain and hormonal responses to&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia have been studied extensively, this study will as the first, systematically&#xD;
      investigate the chronic adaptation of peripheral metabolism to recurrent hypoglycaemia in&#xD;
      diabetes. Knowledge about such responses can lead to interventions that attenuate the&#xD;
      devastating effects of acute hypoglycaemia induced by insulin in people with diabetes.&#xD;
      Thereby, the risk of developing severe hypoglycaemia can be reduced which ultimately will&#xD;
      improve long-term diabetes outcomes and reduce health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Patients with type 1 diabetes that are exposed to high-frequent recurrent&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia will adapt their metabolism in a way, which supports the preservation of brain&#xD;
      fuelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective The overall objective is to gain new knowledge about mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      adaptation to recurrent hypoglycaemia in diabetes by investigating patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and healthy controls. The knowledge to be obtained may feed into experimental&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic clamp studies to further elucidate the effect of the adaptations during acute&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia. Ultimately, it can lead to intervention studies aiming at the maintenance of&#xD;
      functional capability during hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes to reduce their&#xD;
      risk of severe hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;

    <intervention_name>insulin human</intervention_name>
    <description>Hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp studies require that insulin is administered at a steady continuous rate to achieve stable levels of hyperinsulinemia. To reach this, insulin needs to be infused intravenously using a standard intravenous pump system. The insulin dose will be adjusted according to the body surface area, aiming for insulin levels of ~170 mU/l, which is within the physiological range. Thus, for a subject with a bodyweight of 70 kg, body length of 180 cm and - consequently - a body surface area of 1.936 m2, the required insulin infusion can be calculated as: 1.936 x 60 x 60 ÷ 1000 = 7.0 units per hour</description>

After each adrenaline infusion, substrate response will be measured by blood samples of glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, alanine, β-hydroxybutyrate, glycerol and insulin. Furthermore, cardiovascular measurements such as pulse and blood pressure are monitored as well.</description>

    <description>With the study subject resting in the supine position, the skin is disinfected on the lateral side of the thigh around 15 cm above the knee, with chlorhexidine alcohol. Then 3-4 mL of local anaesthetic (lidocaine 20 mg/mL) is injected into the skin, subcutaneous tissue and in the upper part of the muscle with a very thin needle. When the anaesthetic effect has set in after a couple of minutes an insertion is made in the skin and the subcutaneous tissue through which the biopsy cannula is inserted into the muscle. A small piece (around 150 mg) of the muscle is collected, which may be experienced as somewhat unpleasant, but will last for a very short while ( ~1-2 seconds). The needle is removed, a sterile Band-Aid is applied, and the study subject can leave the site after termination of the trial. The biopsy may cause some muscular tenderness for 2-3 days corresponding to minor muscular trauma.</description>

    <description>With the study subject resting in the supine position, the skin is disinfected on one side of the abdomen around 5-10 cm lateral from the umbilicus to the knee, with chlorhexidine alcohol. Then 3-4 mL of local anaesthetic (lidocaine 20 mg/mL) is injected into the skin, subcutaneous tissue and in the upper part of the adipose tissue with a very thin needle. When the anaesthetic effect has set in after a couple of minutes an insertion is made in the skin and the subcutaneous tissue through which the biopsy cannula is inserted into the adipose tissue. A small piece (around 1 gram) of the adipose tissue is collected, which may be experienced as somewhat unpleasant, but will last for a very short while ( ~1-2 seconds). The needle is removed, a sterile Band-Aid is applied, and the study subject can leave the site after termination of the trial.

    <description>Subjects will undergo a hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic glucose clamp, as mentioned above, in the MRI scanning room. After 30 minutes of stable normoglycaemia, subjects are taken into the MRI scanner (Philips Achieva 7.0 T) where brain, liver, thigh and calf muscle are scanned. After every anatomically different area, the subjects must be taken out of the scanner, while scanning coils are replaced. All subjects are advised to lie still and press the alarm button if necessary.</description>

    <description>Resting metabolic rate will be estimated, after reaching stable plasma glucose level, via a hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp, as mentioned above. This will be done by indirect calorimetry, using a ventilated hood system (Jaeger Oxycon Champion, software version 4.3, Jaeger, Mijnhardt). Subjects are instructed to lie down and rest for a period of 30 minutes. Subjects are also instructed not to move, talk or sleep unless necessary during the period of measurement. The recorded measurement after 5 minutes to 30 minutes will be used for analysis.</description>
