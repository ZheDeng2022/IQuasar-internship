    <textblock>
      Total edentulism is a profound physical, psychic and social handicap, which affects 5 million&#xD;
      people in France. The most frequent complaint of edentulous patients rehabilitated by&#xD;
      conventional Complete Removable Prostheses (CRP) is the reduction of masticatory efficiency.&#xD;
      This alteration has medical repercussions and a negative psychological and social impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to evaluate the impact of an innovative protocol on the quality of masticatory&#xD;
      function, prosthetic treatment and, in fact, on the quality of life of the totally edentulous&#xD;
      patient. This protocol combines the Digital Denture system with the transcutaneous electrical&#xD;
      neurostimulation system (TENS®), in order to improve the balance of the dento-dental contacts&#xD;
      of CRP. This new protocol is called DDTENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the study is to compare the activity and balance of the masticatory&#xD;
      muscles at 1 month (T1) of wearing the prostheses, between an experimental group benefiting&#xD;
      from a CRP by the DDTENS protocol and 2 reference groups ( the first benefiting from a CRP by&#xD;
      the conventional procedure and the second by the Digital Denture procedure) in bimaxillary&#xD;
      total edentulous patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the number of sessions required to obtain a finalized bimaxillary total&#xD;
           removable prosthesis between the 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the quality of life of patients with their CRP between the 3 groups, at 1&#xD;
           month and 4 months of wearing the prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the activity and balance of the masticatory muscles when the prostheses were&#xD;
           put in the mouth (T0) and at 4 months (T4) of wearing the prostheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomised open-label controlled pilot study with blinded reviewer&#xD;
      assessment comparing 3 parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group: 10 bimaxillary edentulous patients rehabilitated by CRP using the&#xD;
           DDTENS protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group 1: 10 edentulous bimaxillary patients rehabilitated by CRP according to&#xD;
           the conventional method (gold standard technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group 2: 10 edentulous bimaxillary patients rehabilitated by CRP using the&#xD;
           Digital Denture procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits for patients in the DDTENS experimental group are the optimization of&#xD;
      occlusal balance, the optimization of the time of integration of the prosthesis in the mouth,&#xD;
      the time saving in the prosthetic treatment of the edentulous patient and the improvement of&#xD;
      eating behaviours and quality of life of edentulous patients which would delay the entry of&#xD;
      our patients into the sphere of dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results would allow the validation of a new rehabilitation protocol for the edentulous&#xD;
      patient, leading to a modification of clinical practices.&#xD;

      EPIDEMIOLOGY Total edentulism is defined by the total absence of teeth. It can be uni or&#xD;
      bimaxillary and represents a profound physical, psychic and social handicap, affecting 5&#xD;
      million people in France. Despite progress in prophylaxis, the number of patients with total&#xD;
      edentulism is constantly increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several explanations for this phenomenon in France:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in life expectancy According to INSEE, life expectancy in France will increase&#xD;
           from 75.2 years to 89.5 years for men and from 82.7 to 93 years for women between 2000&#xD;
           and 2050.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social precarity Social precarity is a societal problem that explains the delay or lack&#xD;
           of dental care, leading to a higher rate of total edentulism among the most&#xD;
           disadvantaged social class populations. Lifestyle behaviors such as smoking and alcohol&#xD;
           consumption worsen this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ageing of the population The arrival of the baby boomers in the 60+ age group and the&#xD;
           increase in life expectancy explain the inevitable ageing of the population (3). People&#xD;
           aged over 60 are expected to represent 1/3 of the population in 2050, whereas in 2005&#xD;
           they represented only 1/5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ageing is often associated with an alteration in physical and intellectual faculties.&#xD;
      The relative well-being of 60-75 year old is gradually giving way to frailty. The challenge&#xD;
      is to care for increasingly elderly edentulous patients. It is therefore essential to develop&#xD;
      prosthetic rehabilitation practices to improve patient comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adopting an adapted treatment by limiting the number of appointments while maintaining an&#xD;
      optimal quality of care is one of the objectives of our project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROBLEMATIC OF TOTAL EDENTULISM In the totally edentulous patient, certain physiological&#xD;
      functions are altered (mastication, swallowing, taste, phonation). The most frequent&#xD;
      complaint of edentulous patients rehabilitated by conventional Complete Removable Prosthesis&#xD;
      (CRP) is the decrease in masticatory capacity. The masticatory capacity of edentulous&#xD;
      patients is equivalent to 1/6 of dentate patients, not to mention the changes in eating&#xD;
      behavior with certain foods banned from daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observation has medical repercussions (nutritional deficiencies, change in eating&#xD;
      behavior, risk of misdirection, etc.) and a harmful psychological and social impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATUS OF THE ISSUE Chewing ability can be understood by the shape of the chewing cycle, by&#xD;
      bite force or by chewing efficiency. Studies have confirmed that conventional CRP do not&#xD;
      restore optimal and efficient masticatory function, due to a lack of precision in the&#xD;
      fabrication of the prosthesis and the empirical phase of occlusal balancing. Indeed, the&#xD;
      dento-dental contacts, governed by the prosthetic mounting of the teeth, have a major impact&#xD;
      on the functioning of the manducatory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These functional deficiencies can lead to a loss of physical and psychological autonomy, the&#xD;
      gateway to iatrogenic dependence of the elderly in our hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to improve masticatory efficiency in the totally edentulous patient? The placement of&#xD;
      implants can be an alternative to remedy the problem of CRP retention, but the implant&#xD;
      solution is not always feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How to improve masticatory efficiency in the totally edentulous patient without the help of&#xD;
      implants? The prosthetic equilibrium of an osteo-muco-portal prosthesis without implants is&#xD;
      intimately linked to the tissue equilibrium and the neuro-musculo-articular equilibrium.&#xD;
      Conversely, an unstable prosthesis leads to tissue damage and joint disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stability of the prosthesis is linked to the occlusal balance, the balance of the&#xD;
      dento-dental contacts between the two arches. The complexity of the treatment lies in the&#xD;
      determination of the inter-arch relationship or maxillo-mandibular relationship (MMR), in the&#xD;
      vertical and horizontal directions. Indeed, in the totally edentulous patient, we have no&#xD;
      reference points. The only usable determinants are the temporomandibular joints (TMJ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the conventional therapy or gold standard technique used for the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      the totally edentulous patient, consists in recreating a &quot;prosthetic substitution normality&quot;&#xD;
      by recording the maxillo-mandibular relationship, by putting the mandible in a reproducible&#xD;
      position: the position of centered relation. The definition of the National College of&#xD;
      Occlusodontics in 2001 tells us that it corresponds &quot;to the condylar reference situation&#xD;
      corresponding to a high, simultaneous condylo-disco-temporal coaptation obtained by non&#xD;
      forced control. It is reproducible in a given time and for a given body posture and&#xD;
      recordable from a mandibular rotation movement&quot;. The problem is that the TMJ is rarely&#xD;
      healthy resulting in a more or less empirical and operator-dependent mandibular position.&#xD;
      Errors in recording the mandibular position result in a loss of accuracy and an increased&#xD;
      number of adjustment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2020, the use of digital tools aims to optimize and improve the recording of useful&#xD;
      clinical data, the design and manufacture of a sustainable CRP. At present, no consensus&#xD;
      exists but 2 paradigms coexist: the partial use of the digital tool, which punctuates the&#xD;
      conventional steps and the use of protocols built entirely around the digital tool. These&#xD;
      protocols have emerged secondarily and propose complete systems in 2 or 4 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CADCAM) systems applied to the rehabilitation of the&#xD;
      totally edentulous patient are called Digital Denture protocols. Although CAD/CAM is a&#xD;
      digital tool that has been used for many years in dentistry for the dentate patient, the&#xD;
      Digital Denture system is not very widespread at the moment. This system ensures a better&#xD;
      adaptation of the complete removable prostheses, thanks to the type of manufacture of the&#xD;
      prostheses by machining, and a saving of time during the realization of the prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in all, there is still the problem of the precision of the recording of the&#xD;
      maxillo-mandibular relationship, which can lead to a number of additional adjustment&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From these clinical findings, the two issues of this project were born:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How to improve the registration of the maxillomandibular relationship and the accuracy&#xD;
           of occlusal balance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How to reduce the number of adjustment sessions? Ultimately, the answer to these&#xD;
           problems would influence the quality of the masticatory function and consequently the&#xD;
           quality of life of the totally edentulous person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INNOVATION The idea of the DDTENS protocol came from the reflection on the dentate patient&#xD;
      with cranio-mandibular dysfunctions. Indeed, a transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation&#xD;
      system (TENS®) is used in this clinical case, which allows muscular relaxation and the&#xD;
      optimization of dento-dental contacts and thus the rebalancing of bilateral muscular forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innovation consists in setting up an innovative protocol combining 2 existing systems:&#xD;
      the Digital Denture system and a neuromuscular and electromyographic approach, via the&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation system (TENS®), in order to improve the&#xD;
      registration and balance of dento-dental contacts in CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-operator depending on the maxillo-mandibular relationship recording with a&#xD;
           neuro-musculo-articular reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduction in the number of sessions for adjusting the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Optimization of the prosthetic treatment of edentulous patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improvement of the occlusal balance and therefore of the quality of the masticatory&#xD;
           function of edentulous patients (improvement of mastication, of eating behaviors (impact&#xD;
           on nutrition, digestion, etc.), making it possible to delay the entry of our patients&#xD;
           into the sphere of dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare, within the framework of a randomized controlled pilot study, the activity and&#xD;
           balance of the masticatory muscles at 1 month (T1) of wearing the prostheses, measured&#xD;
           by a digital system combining electronic recording of mandibular movements and surface&#xD;
           electromyography (K7 Evaluation System®), between an experimental group benefiting from&#xD;
           a CRP by the DDTENS protocol and 2 reference groups: the first group benefiting from the&#xD;
           performance of a CRP by the conventional procedure and the second by the Digital Denture&#xD;
           procedure, in bimaxillary total edentulous patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare between the 3 groups, the number of sessions necessary to obtain a finalized&#xD;
           prosthesis (prostheses are considered finalized when the prostheses worn by the patient&#xD;
           are occlusally balanced and do not cause any mucosal injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life of patients with their PRC (assessment of chewing power,&#xD;
           eating behavior, etc.), between the 3 groups, at 1 month and 4 months of wearing the&#xD;
           prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare, between the 3 groups, the activity and balance of the masticatory muscles when&#xD;
           the prostheses are put in the mouth (T0) and at 4 months (T4) of wearing the prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY The study design is a randomised, open-label, controlled pilot study with blinded&#xD;
      reviewer evaluation comparing 3 parallel groups (2 control group and 1 experimental group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects to be included is 30. The randomization will be centralized (Ennov&#xD;
      clinical software) and stratified by minimization on sex and age (60-69 and 70-75 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The masticatory muscle activity and balance are measured by a digital system combining&#xD;
      electronic recording of mandibular movements and surface electromyography system (K7&#xD;
      Evaluation System®)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of muscle activity = measurements will be made for all muscles at rest with&#xD;
           and without prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle balance analysis = comparison of right and left muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of the chronology of muscle contraction on the right and left = muscle&#xD;
           contraction symmetry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of sessions required to obtain a finished prosthesis recorded for each patient is&#xD;
      listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of life of the patients is assessed using a specific oral health measurement&#xD;
      questionnaire (GOHAI). The GOHAI includes 12 items with 3 sub-dimensions (functional,&#xD;
      psycho-social and pain/discomfort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each assessment (inclusion visit, 1-month post completion visit and 4-month post&#xD;
      completion visit), the 3 sub-dimensions will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must answer the 12 questions with &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;Rarely&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Often&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;Always&quot; (only one answer possible). Each answer is scored from 5 to 1 in this order, except&#xD;
      for questions 3, 5 and 7 where the values are reversed. The associated total score varies&#xD;
      from 12 to 60. The higher the score, the better the oral quality of life. The score obtained&#xD;
      is classified into three categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      12&lt; &lt;50: poor oral quality of life 51&lt; &lt;56: average oral quality of life 57&lt; &lt;60: good oral&#xD;
      quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits for patients in the TENS experimental group are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimization of maxillomandibular relationship registration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimization of occlusal balance and masticatory functions (dental and muscular)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimization of the integration time of prostheses in the mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of the eating behaviors and quality of life of edentulous patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time saving in the prosthetic treatment of the edentulous patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected risks are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle fatigue during TENS sessions if the application time is longer than 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of adjustment sessions equivalent to the current Digital Denture protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND PERSPECTIVES These results would allow the validation of a new gold&#xD;
      standard protocol for the rehabilitation of the edentulous patient, leading to a modification&#xD;
      of clinical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives : This study could serve as the basis for an inter-CHU multicenter study as well&#xD;
      as the creation and provision of a database (cohort) for artificial intelligence procedures.&#xD;
