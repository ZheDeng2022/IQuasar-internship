  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanical in-exsufflator (MI-E) is a medical device used to facilitate coughing when the&#xD;
      patients' cough is not efficient. Studies have shown positive results in helping airway&#xD;
      clearance in children and adults with neuromuscular disorders however there is lack of&#xD;
      evidence in older populations. This study's aim is to evaluate the feasibility of the MI-E in&#xD;
      older adults. The hypothesis is that the use of MI-E in older adults is feasible.&#xD;

      Background: One of the most frequent reasons for hospital admission of older adults are&#xD;
      respiratory disorders. Physiological aging processes decrease respiratory muscle strength and&#xD;
      can reduce the efficacity of cough. The mechanical in-exsufflator (MI-E) is a medical device&#xD;
      used to help coughing. Studies have shown positive results in helping airway clearance in&#xD;
      children and adults with neuromuscular pathologies however there is lack of evidence in older&#xD;
      populations. This study's aim is to evaluate the feasibility of the MI-E in older adults. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the use of MI-E in older adults is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Feasibility will be evaluated by outcomes such as the discomfort of each session&#xD;
      (use of a numerical scale of discomfort from 0 to 10) and the relief felt before and after&#xD;
      each session (use of a modified Borg scale to quantify dyspnea). Two sessions a day of MI-E&#xD;
      will be done for a total of four sessions. Furthermore, other outcomes shall be used, before&#xD;
      and after each session, such as vital signs (heart and respiratory rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation), auscultation as well as the measure of cough peak flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The protocol of this study is the first to evaluate the use of MI-E in&#xD;
      hospitalized older adults by the measure of discomfort and relief. In regard to literature on&#xD;
      the use of MI-E in patients suffering from neuromuscular pathologies and on the effects of&#xD;
      aging on the respiratory system, the hypothesis of the study seems justified. On top of&#xD;
      bringing physical benefits to the patient, the study will pave the way for other randomized&#xD;
      controlled studies.&#xD;
