  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of scientific publications show that high blood pressure is being&#xD;
      described in younger and younger children of African ancestry. It therefore makes sense to&#xD;
      seek for the causes of this raised blood pressure in the in utero events. Recent studies have&#xD;
      attributed and increased risk to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to the gestational&#xD;
      environment. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and oxidative&#xD;
      stress in the mother which may influence how the developing foetus interacts with the&#xD;
      external environment later on in life. Indeed scientific literature suggests that the&#xD;
      foeto-placental vascular endothelial dysfunction may cause epigenetic alteration in the&#xD;
      intrauterine environment of the foetus which may be at the origin of chronic diseases in&#xD;
      children, thus predisposing them to risk factors of CVD. However, very few studies in women&#xD;
      of African ancestry have been carried out to investigate whether or not children born of&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic mothers of African ancestry are at risk of developing CVDs. Hence, the aim of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the relationship between pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      in children born to pre-eclampsic mothers in a rural South African population. A prospective&#xD;
      case-control control design recruiting pre-eclamptic and normotensive pregnant women and&#xD;
      their offspring subsequently will be used. CVD risk will be accessed in the pregnant women at&#xD;
      30 weeks of gestation and in the offspring at birth and then six weeks later. The difference&#xD;
      in CVD risk between children born to these two groups of women will be assessed and the&#xD;
      correlation between maternal and offspring risks for CVDs determined. It is expected that&#xD;
      results obtained from this project will provide information on the cardiovascular effect of&#xD;
      in utero exposure to PE in a population of African ancestry. This knowledge will advise&#xD;
      policy on the management of women with pre-eclampsia with a view of preventing cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases in the offspring. Furthermore, the project will afford the opportunity for&#xD;
      scientific research capacity building in students in Walter Sisulu University and foster&#xD;
      collaboration between clinical and fundamental researchers.&#xD;

      Study design This will be a prospective case-control study involving babies born to&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic (cases) pregnant women as the case and babies born to normotensive mothers&#xD;
      (control). The mothers will be recruited at the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha,&#xD;
      Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. This is a tertiary hospital to which all specialist&#xD;
      cases are referred from the peripheral hospitals. Even though the prevalence of PE in South&#xD;
      Africa is just over 5% nationally, 18% of all obstetric cases consulted in the Nelson Mandela&#xD;
      Academic Hospital in Mthatha are PE cases (unpublished data). It will therefore not be a&#xD;
      great challenge to recruit the desired number of PE patients over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The study done by Amini et al, (2010) showed blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
      differences between neonates from normotensive and pre-eclamptic mothers5. The difference in&#xD;
      blood systolic BP (SBP) was very high (normotensive: 49.85±5.49 versus pre-eclamptic:&#xD;
      68.2±149). Because the SBP variance and standard deviation were very high in the&#xD;
      pre-eclamptic group, we decided to rather use the diastolic blood pressure values&#xD;
      (normotensive: 30.17±11.89 versus pre-eclamptic: 42.11±11.49) for sample size calculation.&#xD;
      The software - R was used: alpha = 0.01, mean difference = 11.94 and standard = 0.05&#xD;
      respectively were used. The results showed that total sample size is 97 (48 cases and 49&#xD;
      controls). We make the assumption that not all participants would return for the follow-up.&#xD;
      Thus we adjusted our sample size by 20% to compensate for possible loses to follow-up.&#xD;
      Therefore the total sample will be 97 + (97x20/100) = 117 neonates. However the study will&#xD;
      start with the recruitment of 117 pregnant women (58 pre-eclamptic women and 59 normotensive&#xD;
      pregnant women who meet the selection criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval Ethical approval and permission to carry out the research project has been&#xD;
      applied for from Faculty of Health Sciences Research and Ethics Committee (HRSEC) at Walter&#xD;
      Sisulu University (WSU). When the project is approved the Provincial and District Departments&#xD;
      of Health will be approached for clearance and approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent The purpose of the study will be explained thoroughly to potential&#xD;
      participants attending the antenatal clinic in the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha,&#xD;
      Eastern Cape Province. Pregnant women who meet the selection criteria and are willing to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be required to sign informed consent forms to participate in&#xD;
      the study and to allow their children to participate in the study from birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Protocol Pregnant women who meet the selection criteria will be recruited between&#xD;
      weeks 20-26 of gestation while data will be collected in week 30 of gestation. Participants&#xD;
      will be reminded of the hospital visit for data collection in advance to enable them make all&#xD;
      necessary preparation to spend some extra time at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline information: Maternal demographic, obstetric and medical history will be&#xD;
           collected from participant using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anthropometric measurements: Height and weight will be determined as per recommendations&#xD;
           of the NHANES, 2009-2010 recommendations24&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Confirmation of pre-eclampsia status: Hospital files will be used to confirm&#xD;
           pre-eclampsia status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood pressure measurements: Office blood pressure will be measured as described by&#xD;
           Putner et al., (2019)25&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Flow mediated dilatation. A Mobile Esaote MyLabTM Five portable ultrasound device&#xD;
           (Genoa, Italy) with an Esaote Doppler probe (LA523, 12 MHz) connected to computerized&#xD;
           software with edge detection technology (Quipu Cardiovascular Suite (CVS)™; Pisa, Italy)&#xD;
           will be used. Endothelial function will be measured as described by Strijdom et al&#xD;
           (2017)26&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Gestational ultrasound will be performed to determine placental morphometry,&#xD;
           architecture and vascularization. Uterine arteries, umbilical artery and middle cerebral&#xD;
           artery will be assessed and uterine artery mean pulsating index determined. Foetal&#xD;
           cerebroplacental ratio and anthropometry will be calculated when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Measurement of markers of oxidative stress : Fasting blood will be collected for&#xD;
           determination of oxidative stress in the maternal environment to which the foetus is&#xD;
           exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At birth: The Gestational age at delivery and mode of delivery will be noted. The APGAR score&#xD;
      (1-5 minutes), will be determined, weight and height/length of the child will be measured.&#xD;
      Cord blood will be collected for determination of titres of CVD risk as indicated below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Markers of endothelial function: Endocan and asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA),&#xD;
           markers of endothelial function will be assayed using ELISA kits as per manufacturers'&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Markers of oxidative stress: Lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity and&#xD;
           8-hydoxyl-2-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) will be determined using ELISA kits as per&#xD;
           manufacturer's protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lipid profile : Total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol,&#xD;
           and oxidised LDL-cholesterol will be measured as per manufacturer's protocol using&#xD;
           colorimetric kits as per manufacturers' instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Insulin Resistance: Fasting glucose, glycated haemoglobin and insulin concentrations&#xD;
           will be determined as per manufacturer's methods. The HOMA-IR formula will be used to&#xD;
           calculate insulin resistance from fast glucose and insulin as described by Mather et al,&#xD;
           1985)27.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Renal function indices: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine and albumin will be&#xD;
           determined using colorimetric kits as per manufacturers' instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood pressure measurements: The oscillometric technique (Dinamap 8100) will be used for&#xD;
           BP measurement according to the standard protocol for assessment of BP measurement in&#xD;
           newborns by Nwankwo et al. (1997)28.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Anthropometric measurements: All measures were done as reported by Meldere et al. (2013)&#xD;
           29.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Arterial stiffness will be assessed by measuring Brachio-femoral pulse wave velocity&#xD;
           (bfPWV) using an oscillometric device (Vicorder, Skidmore Medical) as reported by Alwan&#xD;
