  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project encompasses the development and implementation of an acute care, pediatric&#xD;
      concussion clinical pathway at 5 pediatric emergency departments in the province of Alberta&#xD;
      (Canada).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical pathways (CPs) do not currently guide the care of children with concussions&#xD;
      presenting to acute care settings in Alberta. The Alberta Health Services Maternal Newborn&#xD;
      Child &amp; Youth (MNCY) Strategic Clinical Network established a work group to develop&#xD;
      best-practice, evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of concussion&#xD;
      that are being translated into specific CPs for different clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research has three key objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Design an evidence-based, knowledge-user informed, and theory-driven approach to&#xD;
           implementation of a clinical pathway for acute care of pediatric concussion. Guided by&#xD;
           the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), the investigators will assess barriers and&#xD;
           facilitators likely to influence uptake of the CP in acute care settings. The results of&#xD;
           that assessment will inform implementation strategy design, again guided by the TDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the impact of the implementation of the CP on patient-centered outcomes using a&#xD;
           stepped wedge cluster randomised trial. Within the context of a stepped wedge cluster&#xD;
           randomised trial, the investigators will assess relevant process and clinical outcomes&#xD;
           to determine whether implementation of the CP results in significant uptake of the&#xD;
           pathway, as well as higher patient satisfaction and better health outcomes following&#xD;
           concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine whether the implementation and use of a CP for acute care of pediatric&#xD;
           concussion is associated with changes in health care utilization and associated costs.&#xD;
           Health care utilization and costs associated with care of concussion will be compared&#xD;
           before and after the implementation of the CP. Utilization and costs are expected to&#xD;
           remain stable or decline following implementation of the CP.&#xD;

These patients scoring as 'high risk' will be referred to one of three specialty clinics. High risk is defined as scoring 9 or higher out of 12 on the 5P score.</description>
