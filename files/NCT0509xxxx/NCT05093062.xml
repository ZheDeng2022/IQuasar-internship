      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the immediate, long-term and cumulative effects of Tian Jiu Therapy on&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of Tian Jiu Therapy on asthma is also long-term and will be accumulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting 167 asthma participants who received Tian Jiu Therapy under the primary study of&#xD;
      HKCTR-1128. All subjects should be above age 13 and receive the same Tian Jiu Therapy, 3&#xD;
      times per year from 2013 to 2015. A one-year follow-up after the last Tian Jiu treatment will&#xD;
      be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern USB PC-based Spirometer and Fingertip Pulse Oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plastering some stimulating Chinese herbal cubes on certain acupoints in the three hottest&#xD;
      days of each year, for three consecutive years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function Test, Blood Oxygen Test, Quality of Life and Standardized Questionnaire on&#xD;
      asthma attack and symptoms will be administered before treatment, after treatment of each&#xD;
      year and one-year follow-up after the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the parameters will be analyzed, the physical improvement (Cured, Remarkably effective,&#xD;
      Effective and Ineffective) will be recorded, and the differences in different treatment&#xD;
      courses will be investigated and compared with previous data obtained in the primary study of&#xD;
      HKCTR-1128 by using standard statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of Tian Jiu Therapy on Asthma is not only immediate but also long-term and will be&#xD;
      gradually accumulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tian Jiu Therapy will acquire better efficacy on asthma if this treatment was conducted&#xD;
      more years continuously.&#xD;
