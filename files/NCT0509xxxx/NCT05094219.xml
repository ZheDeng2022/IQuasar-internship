      Objective: Estimate the cost of disease and falls among people with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      living in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective cost-utility analysis (base year 2021) with one baseline and two&#xD;
      follow-up assessments at 6 months and 12 months Participants: Community-dwelling participants&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease of both genders of any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Nil Outcome measures: Self-reported questionnaires will be used to obtain&#xD;
      information about the healthcare utility. In addition, we will assess the number of falls,&#xD;
      the severity of Parkinson' disease assessed using the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating&#xD;
      Scale, level of disability using the Hoehn and Yahr scale, balance using the Mini Balance&#xD;
      Evaluation Systems Test and Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, risk of falls&#xD;
      using Falls Efficacy Scale International and quality of life using the Short-form Health&#xD;
      survey (SF-36). Predictors of cost include fall frequency, balance status, disease severity,&#xD;
      level of disability, quality of life, and duration of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: A multiple regression analysis will be conducted to determine which predictor&#xD;
      (independent variable) influence the overall cost. The level of statistical significance (Î±)&#xD;
      will be set at p&lt;0.05. A Tornado plot will be constructed for the individual items of both&#xD;
      direct and indirect cost having the minimum and maximum range set at the 25th and 75th&#xD;
      percentile. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will assess the differences in healthcare&#xD;
      cost among frequent, in-frequent and non-fallers. Spearman's or Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficient will assess correlations between quality of life and healthcare cost; disease&#xD;
      severity and healthcare cost; falls frequency and healthcare cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to healthcare and health Cost-estimation highlights information required to enhance&#xD;
      the health care service for the target population. Through a similar study among patients&#xD;
      with cerebellar ataxia, our team demonstrated specific challenges that need additional&#xD;
      support from the policy-makers such as employment following disability, visits to&#xD;
      specialists, home-care, and community participation for people with cerebellar ataxia in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. This study will highlight the strength and weakness of the current healthcare system to&#xD;
      people of Hong Kong with Parkinson's disease, this will inform the challenges for the&#xD;
      healthcare requiring additional attention which in turn will have a beneficial impact on the&#xD;
      future service.&#xD;

      Introduction Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder resulting in a range&#xD;
      of complications for both the individual and their families eventually leading to increased&#xD;
      burden to the healthcare system.1 Reports from the year 2012 indicated 13,000 (0.186%) people&#xD;
      in Hong Kong living with Parkinson's disease 2 and a recent global estimate in 2016 indicates&#xD;
      6.1 million people.3 Postural instability, freezing of gait and poor balance resulting in&#xD;
      frequent falls are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease 4. Falls constitute the greatest health&#xD;
      and injury risk related to people living with Parkinson's disease. 5, 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of falls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-six per cent of people with Parkinson's disease fall at least once every 3 months.7 A&#xD;
      recent report suggests 35% to 90% of people with Parkinson's disease fall at least once after&#xD;
      being diagnosed with the disease, with an average falls rate of 61%, with about 39% of these&#xD;
      being recurrent.8 The sequelae of accidental falls are associated with a decrease in quality&#xD;
      of life, increase in caregiver's burden, hip fractures, an increase in motor impairment,&#xD;
      decreases in mobility and an increase in disease severity. It is therefore imperative to&#xD;
      prevent falls in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls prevention framework in Hong Kong:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Elderly Health Service of the Department of Health, HKSAR has published the framework for&#xD;
      falls prevention and management.12 The current framework for preventive care for older adults&#xD;
      in Hong Kong emphasises fall prevention through physical exercise and pain management.&#xD;
      Physical exercises for falls management often include balance training as well as improving&#xD;
      muscle strength and mobility. However, these frameworks are for older adults in general.&#xD;
      These recommendations have not been developed for individuals with Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      specifically, who both (a) are arguably at more risk of falls and related injuries, and (b)&#xD;
      likely require special adaptations for common treatments, given their high rates of&#xD;
      disability. Thus, there is a critical need for a similar framework for people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease in Hong Kong. The proposed study is a necessary first step in the&#xD;
      development of such a framework and would provide data that would inform such a framework for&#xD;
      people with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this proposal is to estimate the economic burden of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      from a societal perspective of Hong Kong. To address this aim we have the following specific&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Estimate the total cost and determine the degree to which each direct and&#xD;
      indirect cost items influence the total cost per 12 months in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Assess the impact of falls frequency, balance status, disease severity, level of&#xD;
      disability, quality of life, and duration of disease on the overall healthcare cost among&#xD;
      people with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Estimate the frequency of falls and compare the cost consequence due to falls&#xD;
      between frequent, in-frequent and non-fallers with Parkinson's disease in Hong Kong for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4: Establish the correlation between disease severity, falls frequency and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Subjects We will include community-dwelling participants with a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of Parkinson's disease of both genders of any age and who are residing in Hong&#xD;
      Kong. The data will be collected via the Hong Kong Parkinson's Disease Foundation (attached&#xD;
      support letter). In addition, advertisement flyers for recruitment will be posted at the&#xD;
      Neighbourhood Advice-Action Council (NAAC) and Caritas (attached support letter) spread&#xD;
      across the three districts of HK (i.e., Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories).&#xD;
      Those who give written consent to participate and are willing to involve and complete a cost&#xD;
      questionnaire over 12 months period from the day for enrollment will be included. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be excluded if they (1) are wheelchair-bound or bed-ridden, (2) have atypical&#xD;
      Parkinson's syndrome and (3) other associated major illness such as stroke. All participants&#xD;
      will be assessed during the 'on' phase of the levodopa treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Our methodology is in line with the standard guidelines for cost estimation.24 The&#xD;
      ethics approval will be obtained from the Human Subjects Ethics Committee of the Hong Kong&#xD;
      Polytechnic University. This trial will be registered with the Clinical Trials Registry or&#xD;
      the Open Science. We will use self-reported questionnaires to obtain information about the&#xD;
      healthcare utility and the cost will be estimated for the base year 2021 in Hong Kong Dollars&#xD;
      (HKD). A baseline assessment will record the demographic data, while the disease severity,&#xD;
      fear of falls and quality of life will be assessed using standardized questionnaires and&#xD;
      outcome measures. The participants will be instructed to complete the cost questionnaire&#xD;
      every week over the 12 months follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This a prospective cost-utility analysis with one baseline and two follow-up&#xD;
      assessments at 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: We will enrol 90 participants with Parkinson's disease. Demographic data:&#xD;
      include age, age during disease onset, caregiver information, education level, past medical&#xD;
      history, ambulatory status, employment status, housing status and falls history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost data: The participant's healthcare utility will be recorded using an online-based&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaire. Printed versions of the questionnaires will be handed to&#xD;
      participants with limited access to the internet. We will use the cost-of-illness (COI)&#xD;
      analysis, also known as the burden of disease (BOD) for this estimation. The COI analysis&#xD;
      takes into consideration the impact of the health outcomes on the country, specific regions,&#xD;
      communities, and as well as individuals.25 COI evaluates the morbidity in relation to the&#xD;
      decrease in health status and quality of life (QoL), as well as the financial aspects&#xD;
      including direct and indirect expenditures that result from premature death, disability or&#xD;
      injury.25&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will estimate both direct and indirect cost using the self-reported questionnaires&#xD;
      available in both English and Chinese languages. The following criteria were used to choose&#xD;
      the individual items under direct and indirect costs: relevance to Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      relevance to falls and consequences of falls, how quantifiable the items are, based on the&#xD;
      commonly estimated items in similar economic, and to the extent to which the item reflects&#xD;
      and impacts the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease. Appendix 1 reports the&#xD;
      selected cost items and the charges adopted form the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong for the&#xD;
      base year 2021. The direct cost items and some of the indirect cost items will be obtained in&#xD;
      physical units and not the actual money spent. The physical units will then be converted into&#xD;
      monetary units using the human capital method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct cost: Direct costs refers to those expenditures that are directly related to the&#xD;
      intervention for the health condition. In this study, we will include the following cost&#xD;
      items: (a) inpatient care (general hospital admission due to Parkinson's disease, or falls or&#xD;
      other associated problems, visit emergency care for Parkinson's disease or falls of other&#xD;
      associated problems, admission at the Intensive care unit), (b) out-patient care (visit to&#xD;
      the general practitioner for Parkinson's disease or falls or other associated problems, visit&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine for Parkinson's disease or falls or other associated problems),&#xD;
      (c) drugs, (d) rehabilitation, (e) walking aids, and (f) miscellaneous including surgery. The&#xD;
      charges for these cost items are derived from the unsubsidized rate for healthcare in Hong&#xD;
      Kong published by the Hospital Authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect cost: Indirect cost refers to the expense that is related to the consequence of the&#xD;
      disease such as work absenteeism, early retirement, reduced work productivity. In this study,&#xD;
      we will include: (a) costs for hiring caregivers, (b) home modification, (c) productivity&#xD;
      loss due to the disease or falls, and (d) transportation. For estimating productivity loss&#xD;
      using the human capital method, each individual will be assessed using a 'market value' based&#xD;
      on the future earning of the individual if he/she was in good health status.25 Data&#xD;
      collection process One research assistant will be recruited to conduct the assessments and&#xD;
      will be supervised by the primary investigator. All the assessments and surveys will be&#xD;
      carried out at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus. For participants expressing&#xD;
      difficulty in reaching the venue, the assessments will be carried out at their residence.&#xD;
      After explaining the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study, participants will&#xD;
      complete the informed consent prior to data collection. The cost data sheet is a 52 items&#xD;
      self-reported spreadsheet to be completed by the patients or their caregivers (Appendix 1).&#xD;
      The disease severity of the participants will be assessed by the research assistant, trained&#xD;
      and supervised by the PI. Other than the assessor, stand-by assistance will be provided to&#xD;
      ensure safety. The total time required for the three tests was less than an hour.&#xD;
