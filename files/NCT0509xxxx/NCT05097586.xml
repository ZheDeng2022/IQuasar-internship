  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham-controlled trial to determine whether treatment with transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is superior to a sham condition at reducing the symptoms of&#xD;
      depression in pregnant people with moderate to severe depression. The study aims to enrol 156&#xD;
      participants across all sites. Data collection occurs at baseline, immediately after&#xD;
      treatment, every 4 weeks during pregnancy and 4-, 12-, 26- and 52-weeks postpartum&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique for the&#xD;
      treatment of depression that has great potential for filling the gap in treatment options for&#xD;
      moderate and severe depression in pregnancy. Participants are randomized 1:1 to active tDCS&#xD;
      treatment or sham control. After 3-5 in-person training sessions with the research team,&#xD;
      participants take the tDCS device home and self-administer 30-minute treatments 5 times per&#xD;
      week, for 3 weeks, for a total of 15 sessions. Rater-administered and self-report outcomes&#xD;
      are collected weekly during the 3-week active treatment phase, every 4 weeks during&#xD;
      pregnancy, and at 4-, 12-, 26- and 52-weeks postpartum. A mixed methods process evaluation is&#xD;
      embedded into the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Depressive symptoms are measured with the 10-item rater-administered Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).The MADRS is a standard rater-administered measure with good reliability and validity in clinical populations; interviewers can achieve and maintain high levels of inter-rater reliability. Nine items are based upon patient report and one on rater observation. Items are rated on a 0-6 continuum (0=no abnormality, 6=severe; score range 0-60). A MADRS score of &lt;11 indicates remission</description>

    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depressive Scale (EPDS), a self-report scale that has been validated for use in pregnancy and postpartum.
