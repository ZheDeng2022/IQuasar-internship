  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit significantly reduced cognitive functioning&#xD;
      (often difficulties with attention) compared to peers and siblings without SCD. EndeavorRx&#xD;
      (Akili Interactive Labs: Boston, MA) is an FDA-approved home-based, electronic&#xD;
      attentional-control training program designed to treat attention problems in youth. Users&#xD;
      access EndeavorRx on a tablet device for 25-30 minutes each day, 5 days per week, for 4&#xD;
      weeks. The program involves training in a game-like environment that repeatedly challenges&#xD;
      attentional-control abilities and adapts to user performance, becoming more difficult over&#xD;
      time as performance improves. This pilot study is examining the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of EndeavorRx in a sample of 20 children with SCD ages 8-16 who are&#xD;
      being treated with chronic blood transfusion therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit significantly reduced cognitive functioning&#xD;
      compared to peers and siblings without SCD. Cognitive deficits are greatest among those with&#xD;
      severe SCD genotypes, persistent anemia, and strokes and these deficits worsen over time.&#xD;
      These deficits often manifest as difficulties with executive functioning and attention due to&#xD;
      the predominance of cerebral infarcts (&gt;90%) that occur in the frontal cortex. Reduced&#xD;
      capacity to engage such cognitive skills has significant real-world implications, leading to&#xD;
      disruption to academic achievement and attainment, vocational outcomes, and quality of life.&#xD;
      EndeavorRx (Akili Interactive Labs: Boston, MA) is an FDA-approved home-based, electronic&#xD;
      attentional-control training program designed to treat attention problems in youth. Users&#xD;
      access EndeavorRx on a tablet device for 25-30 minutes each day, 5 days per week, for 4&#xD;
      weeks. The program involves training in a game-like environment that repeatedly challenges&#xD;
      attentional-control abilities and adapts to user performance, becoming more difficult over&#xD;
      time as performance improves. Data support effects of EndeavorRx on performance-based and&#xD;
      parent-reported measures of attention in youth with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD). Given the similarities in attentional functioning among youth with ADHD and those&#xD;
      with SCD, EndeavorRx holds promise as an intervention for patients experiencing SCD-related&#xD;
      cognitive deficits. This pilot study is examining the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of EndeavorRx in a sample of 20 children with SCD ages 8-16 who are&#xD;
      being treated with chronic blood transfusion therapy due to an identified high risk of stroke&#xD;
      or as a preventive measure to protect against additional stroke events.&#xD;

    <description>EndeavorRx is a digital intervention delivered through an action video game that is indicated to improve attention function. EndeavorRx users first complete two discrete tasks: 1) a perceptual discrimination/attention task in which users respond to target stimuli and ignore distractor stimuli (e.g., tapping the screen quickly only when red aliens appear) and 2) a sensorimotor navigation task in which users tilt their device to steer a hovercraft down a river while targeting or avoiding certain objects. Users are subsequently presented with a multitask training session where they complete the perceptual discrimination/attention task and the sensorimotor navigation task simultaneously. Algorithms adapt the program in both real-time and between sessions to automatically adjust the difficulty level.</description>
