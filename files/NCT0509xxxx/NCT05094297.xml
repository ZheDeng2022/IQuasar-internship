    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to investigate if the GH Method exercise program positively&#xD;
      affects body composition, improves physical abilities and can improve the overall sense of&#xD;
      wellbeing (e.g. depression, PTSD, etc.) in U.S. Veterans. Subjects will be asked to complete&#xD;
      94 total visits (four (4) study testing visits and 90 exercise visits). Enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will be tested for fitness, strength, and health risk factors at UIC 4 times and will&#xD;
      complete 90 exercise training visits at the GH FITLab over the next 18 months. Subjects will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete questionnaires about depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms and&#xD;
      thoughts about harming oneself.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 94 visits (4 study testing visits and 90 exercise visits). Subjects&#xD;
      will come to UIC for study testing visits at baseline (prior to starting the exercise&#xD;
      program), at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months (after ending the exercise program). Each of&#xD;
      those visits will take about 2-3 hours. After the initial baseline visit, subjects will come&#xD;
      twice weekly, for roughly 1 hour each session, for 6 months (52 visits). From 6-12 months,&#xD;
      subjects will come once a week, for roughly 1 hour each session (26 visits). From 12-18&#xD;
      months, subjects will come twice a month, for roughly 1 hour sessions (12 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Testing Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects agree to be in the study, subjects will be asked to do the following procedures&#xD;
      at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to confirm their employment status each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight will be measured and body mass index (BMI) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will measure the body fat composition and lean body mass&#xD;
      using a DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will ask subject's their age, race, number of injuries, number of&#xD;
           fractures, surgical history, medical history, areas of pain, list of pain medications&#xD;
           and allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure will be measured for general health markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise limit will be measured with a timed 8 foot walk down the hallway (if&#xD;
           applicable), a timed sit to stand test (sitting and standing 5 times in a row-if&#xD;
           applicable), maximum sit to stands, and a balance test (standing in 3 different&#xD;
           positions for 10 seconds each). These three tests combine to form a score called a short&#xD;
           performance battery score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength and frailty will be measured using a grip dynamometer (squeezing a hand held&#xD;
           device as hard as possible in their dominant hand three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate general health, mental health (e.g. depression, post-traumatic stress&#xD;
           disorder, etc.) and pain intensity, quality of life, measure of pain and disability, and&#xD;
           fatigue, questionnaires will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be asked to disclose the number of hospital visits they have had in the&#xD;
           last 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total weight lifted during training session will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Training Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial baseline visit, subjects will begin their exercise training intervention&#xD;
      which involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two days a week of exercise trainings for the first 6 months, and one day a week, from&#xD;
           6-12 months. From 12-18 months, subjects will then complete two days a month of exercise&#xD;
           training. Each visit will last roughly one hour and will incorporate approximately 5-10&#xD;
           minute light warm-up plus stretching and then the exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least twice weekly, GH Fitness staff will follow-up with subjects via text message,&#xD;
           email or a phone call to evaluate subjects physical progress and overall health and&#xD;
           energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Weeks 6, 13, 18, 25, 41, and 52 subjects will focus on cardio and endurance&#xD;
           exercises. These exercises may include running in place, or using a recumbent&#xD;
           (stationary) bike. All other weeks consist of basic strength training/resistance&#xD;
           workouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      List of All Possible Strength/Resistance Exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Chest: Smith Bench Press/Incline Glutes: Abductor Biceps: Cable Easy Curl/Free Bar&#xD;
      Quads: Leg Extension Calves: Calf Machine Biceps: Preacher Quads: Leg Press Abs: Decline&#xD;
      Back: Pull Down Behind Hamstring: Curl Machine Shoulders: Dumbbell Press / Smith Press Back:&#xD;

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>We expect participants will see improvements in their physical abilities after 18 months in the exercise training sessions. This will be assessed by comparing baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months using a Short Physical Performance Battery test. This test requires the assessment of walking speed (time to walk 3 meters), a balance test (standing in 3 different positions for 10 seconds each-tandem, semi tandem, and side by side), and the time it takes to sit and stand 5 times in a chair (see above). Scoring is based on a scale of 0-12, lower numbers representing worse performance.</description>
