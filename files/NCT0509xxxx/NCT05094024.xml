    <textblock>
      Background: Children with acute malnutrition have immature gut microbial communities compared&#xD;
      to age-matched children with healthy growth that can not be repaired by existing therapeutic&#xD;
      foods (Subramanian et al., Nature. 2014). Hence, investigators' recent work in Bangladesh has&#xD;
      focused on developing Microbiota-Directed Complementary Foods (MDCF) containing&#xD;
      locally-available food ingredients, that repair the gut microbiota of children with acute&#xD;
      malnutrition to a configuration that resembles that of healthy children living in the same&#xD;
      urban community (Raman et al., Science 2019; Gherig et al., Science 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently completed a randomized, controlled proof-of-concept (POC) study of&#xD;
      current lead microbiota-directed complementary food, MDCF-2 compared to a standard&#xD;
      ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF), in Bangladeshi children with moderate acute&#xD;
      malnutrition (MAM)(Chen et al., N Engl J Med 2021). Children who received MDCF-2 for 3 months&#xD;
      exhibited significantly greater repair of their gut microbial communities and faster rates of&#xD;
      ponderal growth compared to those treated with RUSF (a formulation that was not designed&#xD;
      based on knowledge of its effects on the gut microbiota). The superior effect of MDCF-2 on&#xD;
      gut microbiota repair and weight gain was even more notable as the RUSF was significantly&#xD;
      more energy dense than MDCF-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the aforementioned POC study, MDCF-2 was prepared fresh daily in icddr,b field kitchens&#xD;
      prior to distribution and supervised administration to study participants. The lack of a&#xD;
      shelf-stable, bio-equivalent formulation of MDCF-2 limits the ability to perform larger&#xD;
      studies in Bangladesh as well as in other geographic settings. This pre-POC study in&#xD;
      Bangladeshi children with MAM will assess the bioequivalence of MDCF prototypes that the&#xD;
      investigators have developed with the potential for improved storage stability compared to&#xD;
      current MDCF-2, using the degree of microbiota repair after 4-weeks of treatment as the&#xD;
      primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To develop a scalable, shelf-stable formulation that is bioequivalent to MDCF-2&#xD;
      with respect to microbiota repair in 8-12 month-old Bangladeshi children with MAM after&#xD;
      4-weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 5-arm, randomized single-blind pre-POC study will be conducted in 8-12-month-old&#xD;
      Bangladeshi children with MAM to compare the efficacy of alternative MDCF formulations in&#xD;
      repairing their gut microbiomes compared to the repair produced by the current kitchen&#xD;
      prepared MDCF-2 formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - Reference control: kitchen-prepared MDCF-2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 - Ready-to-use supplementary food&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3 - Individually packaged, pre-measured sachets of MDCF-2 ingredients, combined and&#xD;
      reconstituted in the home setting prior to consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 4 - MDCF-2 shelf-stable foil pouch formulation with green banana powder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 5 - MDCF shelf-stable foil pouch formulation with sweet potato instead of green banana.&#xD;

      Study site: The study will be conducted among residents of an under slum community in&#xD;
      Baoniabad of Mirpur, one of the 21 administrative units of the nation's capital, Dhaka.&#xD;
      Mirpur is selected as the study site because it is inhabited by poor and lower middle-class&#xD;
      families, residential and sanitary conditions are typical of any congested urban settlement.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators have established several field sites in the area and they&#xD;
      have ongoing research activities in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: A trained Field Research Assistant (FRA) will explain the study in detail, answer&#xD;
      any questions from the parent(s), and invite the parent(s) to enrol the child in the study.&#xD;
      If the parent(s) are interested to volunteer in the study, the designated staff will proceed&#xD;
      to screening and consenting. Screening will consist of a review of the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria listed above. If the subject is eligible to participate, the process will&#xD;
      proceed to consenting consisting of a thorough review of the written consent form in a manner&#xD;
      appropriate for the child's parents' literacy level. Prior to signing the consent form, the&#xD;
      parents of the participants will have an opportunity to ask any questions about the study. If&#xD;
      the FRA determines that participants have demonstrated adequate comprehension of the study,&#xD;
      the consent form will be signed by the FRA and the child's parent(s). If the parent(s) are&#xD;
      not sufficiently literate to read and/or sign the consent form, consenting and a thumbprint&#xD;
      signature will be obtained in the presence of a witness who is not associated with the study.&#xD;
      The child's parent(s) will be provided with a copy of the signed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will undergo thorough clinical assessment and laboratory tests (if needed) to&#xD;
      exclude any organic diseases or any other causes of secondary malnutrition. Detailed&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided separately below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study, information will be collected on the demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of the participants (family income, standard/type of housing, family&#xD;
      structure, parental education, etc.). FRAs will collect anthropometry data by recording the&#xD;
      child's weight using a digital scale with 2 g precision (Seca, model 728, Germany), length&#xD;
      (using infantometer, Seca, model 416, Germany), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) to the&#xD;
      nearest millimeter (using a non-stretch tape). Collection of anthropometric data will&#xD;
      subsequently occur at weekly intervals throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study will be 8 weeks in duration and comprise 5 arms, with a minimum of 23&#xD;
      children per arm required to complete the study. Children will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      the five arms using a computer generated randomization scheme. Efforts will be made to&#xD;
      balance arms with respect to gender. Mothers/primary caregivers will be be advised to&#xD;
      maintain their child's current dietary and breastfeeding practices throughout the study.&#xD;
      Following a 2-week 'run-in' phase with weekly fecal sample collection and a blood draw,&#xD;
      treatment will be initiated. The treatment phase will be for 4 weeks, during which time each&#xD;
      test product will be administered at the test center twice daily (50g/day) in 2 x 25g&#xD;
      servings, separated by at least 6 hours. The amount of each serving actually ingested will be&#xD;
      calculated by subtracting the leftover amount from the offered amount. Pre-weighed napkins&#xD;
      will be provided; any food that is regurgitated, vomited or spilled will be swabbed, weighed&#xD;
      and subtracted from the amount offered. Fecal samples will be collected weekly using&#xD;
      established SOPs for rapid cryopreservation. A second blood draw will be performed at the end&#xD;
      of the 4-week intervention period. There will be a 2- week post intervention phase during&#xD;
      which 2 additional fecal samples will be collected (at the end of weeks 7 and 8) to assess&#xD;
      changes in the microbiota that occur after cessation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be monitored daily by trained FRAs for any side effects/adverse events (e.g.&#xD;
      rash, urticaria due to food allergy, or any significant changes in clinical status). If any&#xD;
      adverse events are observed, children will be treated using appropriate management practices&#xD;
      at Dhaka Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection: Fecal samples will be collected weekly from each study participant&#xD;
      during the course of the 8-week study, including during the 2 weeks prior to treatment, the&#xD;
      four weeks of treatment, and the two weeks following cessation of treatment (11 samples/&#xD;
      child). Fecal samples will be used for culture-independent analysis of microbial composition&#xD;
      using existing SOPs, and for subsequent culture-based initiatives to characterize growth&#xD;
      promoting bacterial taxa (Raman et al., Science 2019, 365, eaau 4735; Gehrig et al., Science&#xD;
      2019; 365, eaau4732).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample collection: 5 mL of blood will be collected from each child immediately prior to&#xD;
      initiating treatment, and just after the 4-week period of treatment is complete. Plasma will&#xD;
      be prepared immediately and frozen at -80C prior to proteomics analysis as previously&#xD;
      described (Gehrig et al., Science 2019, 365, eaau4732; Chen et al., N Engl J Med 2021;&#xD;
      384:1517-1528). Additionally, status of different blood biomarkers (hormonal regulators of&#xD;
      appetite and satiety, micronutrient status, and systemic inflammation) will also be assessed&#xD;
      using the samples collected before and after the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimate: The estimate is informed by fecal 16S rDNA datasets generated in a&#xD;
      recent POC study in 12 to 18-month-old Bangladeshi children with moderate acute malnutrition&#xD;
      (MAM) who had been treated with the (&quot;reference&quot;) kitchen-prepared MDCF-2 formulation. This&#xD;
      formulation repaired the microbiota of these children and produced an improvement in the rate&#xD;
      of ponderal growth that was superior to that produced by the control Ready-to-Use&#xD;
      Supplementary Food (RUSF; Chen et al., 2021). In this POC study, the investigators identified&#xD;
      209 bacterial taxa (Amplicon Sequence Variants; ASVs) that were present above 5 counts in at&#xD;
      least 5% of the 939 fecal samples analyzed from 118 participants (Chen et al., 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI; mean ± 1.96 standard error) for&#xD;
      the change (delta) in abundance of each of the 209 bacterial taxa ASVs between day 0&#xD;
      (pre-intervention) and 4 weeks of intervention for the 59 children who completed treatment in&#xD;
      the MDCF-2 group of the POC study. The investigators used a bootstrapping approach with ASV&#xD;
      data from 5000 subsets of children from the MDCF-2 group and 5000 subsets of children from&#xD;
      the RUSF group and identified 121 ASVs whose mean changes in abundance fell within the 95% CI&#xD;
      of the mean changes for the MDCF-2 participants, but not in children that had received RUSF,&#xD;
      with 80% power using a subset (sample) size of 20 children per group (&quot;MDCF-2-responsive&#xD;
      ASVs&quot;). Therefore, we will aim to have a minimum of 20 children per arm complete this pre-POC&#xD;
      study. Taking into account potential drop-outs (15%), a minimum of 23 children will be&#xD;
      recruited per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan: To assess the comparability of microbiota repair elicited by&#xD;
      alternative/shelf-stable test formulations of MDCF-2 and the reference kitchen-prepared&#xD;
      formulation described in Chen et al (2021), the investigators sequence PCR amplicons&#xD;
      generated from bacterial 16S rDNA genes present in DNA isolated from fecal samples collected&#xD;
      from participants in the different study arms immediately prior to intervention (day 0) and&#xD;
      at the end of intervention (day 28). ASV data will be processed using DADA2 (Callahan et al.,&#xD;
      2016) and filtered as described in Chen et al. (2021). Using the same approach used for the&#xD;
      POC study above, the investigators will calculate 95% confidence intervals of the mean change&#xD;
      in abundance of each of the MDCF-2-responsive ASVs identified in this study, between day 0&#xD;
      and day 28, in children who received the reference MDCF-2 formulation, as well as the mean&#xD;
      change for each of these ASVs in participants receiving the test formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A test formulation will be considered comparable in efficacy to the reference&#xD;
      kitchen-prepared MDCF-2 if &gt;70% of the MDCF-2-responsive ASVs identified in this study have&#xD;
      mean changes in abundance (day 0 to day 28) for the test formulation that fall within the 95%&#xD;
      CI of their mean changes in abundance in the reference MDCF-2 arm over the same time period.&#xD;
      Another embodiment of the analysis of microbial community repair elicited by the reference&#xD;
      MDCF-2 and test formulations will involve a comparison of their respective effects after 4&#xD;
      weeks of treatment on the abundances of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) identified by&#xD;
      shotgun sequencing of the same fecal DNA samples used to produce 16S rDNA amplicons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory outcomes will include the effects of the test formulations on features of the&#xD;
      plasma and fecal proteomes, including MDCF-2-responsive proteins that are associated with&#xD;
      various facets of healthy growth, CNS development and immune function, using approaches&#xD;
      described in Chen et al., 2021.&#xD;
