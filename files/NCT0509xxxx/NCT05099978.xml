  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a genetic analysis of aberrations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients&#xD;
      in Asian countries. This study protocol is divided into parts describing several subanalyses&#xD;
      that differ in terms of cancer types, analytical methods, participating countries, and&#xD;
      participating institutions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NGS analysis will be performed on cfDNA extracted from peripheral blood samples of target&#xD;
      patients to determine the types and incidences of genetic abnormalities. Patient information&#xD;
      and gene abnormality data will be integrated, and the types and incidences of gene&#xD;
      abnormalities by cancer type will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Concordance rate is defined by the sum of concordance on positives with the denominator as the total number of genes in which a genomic alteration is detected, i.e., genes in which alterations are not detected by one of assays are excluded from both the numerator and denominator.</description>

    <description>This study consists of 6 cohorts; cervical cancer(n=100), ovarian clear cell cancer(n=50), nasopharyngeal cancer(n=96), ovarian cancer(n=100), breast cancer(n=100), endometrial cancer(n=60).&#xD;
In each cohort, the blood samples will be collected within 2weeks after registration. ctDNA will be extracted from blood samples and somatic gene abnormalities will be analyzed using NGS, PCR, and Sanger sequencing. In addition, the analysis of DNA methylation and RNA sequencing may be performed to obtain information related to gene expression.</description>
