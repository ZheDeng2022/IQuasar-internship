  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), estimated to be 1 in 68 in&#xD;
      the United States alone, ASD has become one of the fastest-growing pediatric concerns. The&#xD;
      deficits of children with ASD range across social communication and academic skills. One of&#xD;
      the effective interventions that have been used commonly for ASD is the model-lead-test,&#xD;
      which includes modeling, prompting children to practice target skills together, and providing&#xD;
      children with affirmative feedback or error correction. Previous research has demonstrated&#xD;
      that the model-lead-test is successful in teaching different skills for individuals with ASD,&#xD;
      including functional, social, and academic skills. The vast majority of the studies had&#xD;
      researchers, therapists, or teachers implement the intervention. However, there is clear&#xD;
      empirical support and implications for interventions mediated by more familiar persons, such&#xD;
      as parents and siblings, which may lead to better effects, maintenance, and generalization&#xD;
      due to more practice opportunities in the natural environments. Research has supported the&#xD;
      effectiveness of using parents or peers as agents to deliver interventions for individuals&#xD;
      with ASD, whereas fewer studies explored the use of siblings to deliver or mediate&#xD;
      intervention. As typically developing siblings are an essential part of the daily life of&#xD;
      children with ASD, it makes logical extensions to have siblings as mediators to deliver&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial findings, the investigators found the typically developing siblings can&#xD;
      accurately implement the model-lead-test procedure that improved various skills of their&#xD;
      siblings with ASD. This project will extend these findings by examining the efficacy of the&#xD;
      sibling-implemented intervention on early literacy (reading) and social reciprocity&#xD;
      (conversation and play) of children with ASD as well as the sibling relationship before,&#xD;
      during, and after the intervention.&#xD;

      Prescreening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, the investigators at each site will review existing assessment information&#xD;
      for each participant with autism, which may include age, gender, IQ, autism, and behavioral&#xD;
      scales, and verbal language functioning to confirm the children that meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dyad's involvement will last over the course of approximately 12 months. The first 3&#xD;
      months will be the intervention and data will be collected throughout. Follow-up data will be&#xD;
      collected 3, 6, and 9 months after the intervention is concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Assessmentsï¼š&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children with ASD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each dyad is enrolled, the research team assessor/evaluator will administer either the&#xD;
      Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) or Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).&#xD;
      Children with ASD in China will be assessed using CARS while the children with ASD will be&#xD;
      assessed with ADOS. Further, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales will be used for children in&#xD;
      both countries&#xD;
&#xD;
      For typically developing children:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current reading achievement of all typically developing siblings will be assessed by the&#xD;
      research team assessor. For siblings in the U.S., DIBELS GK-1 level will be used to assess if&#xD;
      the siblings will be able to read words and nonsense words fluently. For siblings in China,&#xD;
      different combinations of letters (pinyin) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For parents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will complete a demographic survey online using their participant ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretest/Baseline Early literacy: During each session, the research team assessor will ask the&#xD;
      children with ASD in the U.S. to read Grade K to Grade 1 letters, words, and nonsense words.&#xD;
      If the children could meet the Benchmark goals for core support per DIBELS benchmark goals&#xD;
      for Grade K-1, they will then be asked to read a narrative passage for 1 minute and answer&#xD;
      questions related to whom, where, and when as well as the actions and internal responses of&#xD;
      the characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children with ASD in China, the research team assessor will ask them to read pinyins&#xD;
      using the pinyin matrix. If the children could read 70% pinyins correctly, they will then be&#xD;
      asked to read a narrative passage with pinyin for 1 minute and answer questions related to&#xD;
      whom, where, and when as well as the actions and internal responses of the characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social reciprocity: Parents will place toys, games, and books in a location at home and ask&#xD;
      the siblings to play with each other for 15 minutes. The entire 15-minute session will be&#xD;
      video recorded and then coded using the Playground Observation of Peer Engagement (POPE) and&#xD;
      Reciprocity datasheets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment for early literacy and social reciprocity skills lasts for a minimum of five&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sibling Relationship Quality: Parents will complete one Sibling Inventory of Behavior scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sibling Self-Efficacy scale: The TD sibling will complete a self-efficacy scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sibling and parent interview: The investigators will interview the parents and siblings&#xD;
      regarding everyday sibling interaction and relationship and the influence of the sibling with&#xD;
      autism on the daily life of the typically developing sibling. The investigators will use some&#xD;
      guiding questions to begin the interviews. Questions that elicit additional details or&#xD;
      responses for examples and feelings (e.g., Tell me more. How do you feel? Do you have an&#xD;
      example?) may be used depending on the answers. The interview will take place online for&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour using a teleconference tool (e.g., Zoom), and interviews will be both&#xD;
      audio and video recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each country, children will be randomly assigned to a treatment-as-usual group and a&#xD;
      sibling-mediated intervention group with 10 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-as-usual/sibling interaction group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will place toys, games, and books in a location at home and ask the siblings to spend&#xD;
      time with each other for 20-30 minutes, at least three times a week for a total of three&#xD;
      months. All sessions will be video recorded. The families in the treatment-as-usual group&#xD;
      will receive the intervention after the procedure is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sibling-mediated intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sibling-mediated intervention will start with three 45-minute training sessions for the&#xD;
      typically developing sibling via telecommunication (e.g., Zoom) on how to use the&#xD;
      model-lead-test strategy (i.e., model the correct response, guided practice of the correct&#xD;
      response and test the correct response) and the self-monitoring checklist. During training,&#xD;
      parents will be present and may be asked to pretend to be learners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the training sessions, the first phase, Compliance Training Phase, will begin. At the&#xD;
      beginning of each session, parents will give the TD sibling an activity schedule consisting&#xD;
      of the tasks (e.g., a series of questions) for the session. The TD sibling will follow the&#xD;
      activity schedule to present the tasks (e.g., asking children with ASD a series of common&#xD;
      questions) and use the self-monitoring checklist to deliver model-lead-test when needed. In&#xD;
      the initial sessions, the instructor will be present to prompt the TD sibling to deliver the&#xD;
      intervention and correctly use the self-monitoring checklist. After each session, the&#xD;
      instructor will deliver feedback until the typically developing sibling meets the mastery&#xD;
      criterion (i.e., at least 85% correct across five sessions). Once mastery is met, the&#xD;
      research team instructor will then review videos every 3-5 days and deliver feedback to the&#xD;
      TD sibling. The compliance training phase will last for 9-15 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention phase, the research team interventionist will start by briefly&#xD;
      meeting with the TD sibling to introduce the self-monitoring checklists for early literacy&#xD;
      and social reciprocity. The TD siblings will then follow the visual activity schedule (e.g.,&#xD;
      the list of the tasks: reading, social play; the order of the activities may change daily)&#xD;
      and use the self-monitoring checklists when teaching reading and social reciprocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For reading, each week, the investigator will identify 3-5 words in a children's book, the&#xD;
      typically developing sibling will read the children's book to the sibling with ASD and&#xD;
      pausing upon the target words. The sibling with ASD will be asked to read the target words.&#xD;
      If the child with ASD could not read the target words, the typically developing sibling will&#xD;
      teach how to read words using model-lead-test. If the child with ASD read the target words&#xD;
      correct, the typically developing sibling will provide praise or any other rewards (e.g.,&#xD;
      high-five, tickle, etc.) as identified by parents. The book will be changed weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For social reciprocity, the parents will bring toys and games and ask the typically&#xD;
      developing sibling to play with their sibling with ASD. During the play, after a few physical&#xD;
      actions and verbalizations from the typically developing sibling, the typically developing&#xD;
      sibling will teach the sibling with ASD to respond with a reciprocal physical action and&#xD;
      conversation. If the sibling with ASD responds with a physical action along with&#xD;
      conversation, the typically developing sibling will provide praise or any other social&#xD;
      rewards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the compliance phase, the instructor will initially monitor and deliver feedback&#xD;
      over Zoom to the TD sibling in each session until mastery, followed by a variable schedule&#xD;
      (e.g., every 3-5 sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing data collection on the readings and social reciprocity from the children with ASD&#xD;
      will be conducted. The compliance training and intervention phases will last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posttest/Post-intervention The procedure for the posttest/post-intervention phase is the same&#xD;
      as pretest/baseline phase. In addition, both children in each dyad will complete a social&#xD;
      validity questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-month, 6-month, and 9-month follow-ups Three follow-ups will be conducted after 3, 6, and 9&#xD;
      months after the completion of the intervention. The procedure is the same as&#xD;
      pretest/baseline phase.&#xD;
