  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal spinal curvature can occur as a result of neurologic, orthopedic or idiopathic&#xD;
      factors. The role of physiotherapy is not only to prevent intrinsic changes that may occur in&#xD;
      the spine but also be used to correct postural abnormalities. this study will investigate the&#xD;
      impact of Schroth Exercise compared to Functional Electrical Stimulation in Adolescent With&#xD;
      Spinal Deformities (scoliosis and or kyphosis).&#xD;

    <description>Forced expiratory volume measures how much air a person can exhale during a forced breath. Forced vital capacity is the total amount of air exhaled during the Forced expiratory volume test. Maximal voluntary ventilation is defined as the maximum minute volume of ventilation that the subject can maintain for 12 to 15 s.</description>

    <description>The Schroth Method is a nonsurgical option for scoliosis treatment. It uses exercises customized for each patient to return the curved spine to a more natural position. The goal of Schroth exercises is to de-rotate, elongate and stabilize the spine in a three-dimensional plane. it will be applied 3 session per week for 3 months.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Functional Electrical Stimulation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>30 minutes of Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) three times a week for 3 months. Two electrodes were attached on the lateral parts of the convex side of the body, and two others on the erector spinae muscles. FES (CU-FS1; Novastim, Korea) was set at a frequency of 35 Hz, with a 250-Î¼s pulse width. Electrical stimulation lasted for 6 seconds, followed by a 6-second rest.</description>
