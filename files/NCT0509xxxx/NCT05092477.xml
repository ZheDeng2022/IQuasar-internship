  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn how therapy for breast cancer or DCIS/LCIS&#xD;
      affects cognitive function and beliefs about cancer/DCIS/LCIS and diabetes (DM). For this&#xD;
      portion of the study, the study team will integrate the information collected at previous&#xD;
      follow-ups to create educational modules to change disease and medication beliefs and improve&#xD;
      DM self-management behaviors (SMB). The educational counseling modules the study team plans&#xD;
      to pilot test are rooted in the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model, a theory that posits that&#xD;
      health behaviors are influenced by two parallel processes: cognitive (i.e., disease beliefs&#xD;
      and expectations) and affective (i.e., emotional responses).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team will develop and pilot an educational and counseling intervention to improve&#xD;
      SMB among breast cancer survivors with comorbid DM. Development of Counseling Modules to&#xD;
      Promote SMB: The study team will use triangulation analysis to integrate, compare, and&#xD;
      contrast the quantitative and qualitative data in order to identify modifiable beliefs and&#xD;
      emotional reactions that are associated with DM SMB and which could be the target of tailored&#xD;
      education and counseling interventions. The study team will develop modules that address&#xD;
      survivors' modifiable beliefs, provide coping skills for emotional reactions to illness, and&#xD;
      suggest self-management strategies that have been found to be successful among peers.&#xD;
      Triangulation analyses will be conducted following the methods outlined by Farmer beginning&#xD;
      with sorting findings from qualitative and quantitative interviews, convergence coding and&#xD;
      then convergence assessment, completeness assessment, researcher comparison and feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing the Counseling and Education Approach: The CSM has been used to develop behavioral&#xD;
      interventions for patients with low adherence to chronic disease SMB. It is similar to&#xD;
      DiMatteo's evidence-based 3-factor model of strategies (provide correct information, ensure&#xD;
      appropriate beliefs, and eliminate tangible barriers) that has been successfully used to&#xD;
      improve medication adherence. The study team will develop 3 basic modules addressing&#xD;
      determinants of SMB identified in the study team's quantitative and qualitative analyses and&#xD;
      that could be integrated into a future comprehensive self-management support intervention: 1)&#xD;
      Addressing DM and Breast Cancer Beliefs: The study team will use cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      techniques to address misconceptions about breast cancer and DM and medication adherence. For&#xD;
      example, some may believe that DM self-management is not important because breast cancer will&#xD;
      likely recur and progress quickly. These views can be &quot;reconstructed&quot; by teaching survivors&#xD;
      about timeline and consequences of breast cancer vs. DM allowing them to understand the&#xD;
      disease timelines relative to each other. Moreover, the study team will clarify the potential&#xD;
      impact of poor DM control on breast cancer outcomes. 2) Addressing Emotional Responses:&#xD;
      Anxiety and worries will be addressed with normalizing statements (e.g., &quot;Many patients feel&#xD;
      that way...&quot; &quot;It is natural to be worried about side-effects...&quot;). For those who report&#xD;
      elevated levels of cancer (or DM) worry and distress, the study team will offer relaxation&#xD;
      exercises, such as a deep breathing exercise coupled with stress reducing visualizations. 3)&#xD;
      Practical Strategies to Instill Routine SMB: Qualitative interviews will elucidate various&#xD;
      strategies that survivors have devised to support their SMB. These patient-identified&#xD;
      approaches will be collated and explored with participants as potential strategies the&#xD;
      participants might employ as well. Particularly for those with cognitive issues, strategies&#xD;
      might include using external aids (i.e., texted phone reminders, alarms, pill box organizers,&#xD;
      medication schedules, etc.), linking SMB to routine daily tasks, providing family support,&#xD;
      etc. The study team will also use strategies to enhance information comprehension and&#xD;
      retention by breast cancer survivors with cognitive dysfunction including teach-to-goal,&#xD;
      multi-modal communication, and optimized formatting of print materials.&#xD;

    <description>All pilot participants will be required to have a SMB target to be included in this study. A SMB target will be chosen by the participant after reviewing their 18mo follow-up responses with the Care Coach. Participants may endorse a maladaptive belief or emotional response; however, this is not required to participate in this intervention. At each follow-up session, the Care Coach will review the participant's SMB goal and progress, address participant's challenges and suggest alternatives, and correct further misinformation on the disease(s). Additionally, the Care Coach will reinforce or introduce techniques that could help overcome barriers to reaching SMB goal and recommend participants to continue improving on the same goal or begin action planning towards a new SMB goal.&#xD;
