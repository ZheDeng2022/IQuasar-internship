  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an aquatic occupational therapy group for children between the ages of 3-12 that have&#xD;
      an autism diagnosis. Intervention will focus on increasing the child's safety swim skills.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Information will be collected from participants' guardians during an intake visit regarding a&#xD;
      child's sensory processing deficits, movement abilities and exposure to swim skill&#xD;
      instruction prior to the group. The group will provide swim instruction using the Halliwick&#xD;
      approach to learning swim skills as well as other occupational therapy techniques such as&#xD;
      shaping, therapeutic relationship and behavior management. Groups will have a minimum ratio&#xD;
      of 1 staff to every 2 children, with the possibility of 1:1 ratio most days. There will be a&#xD;
      certified lifeguard present at all times. Qualitative interviews and a follow up survey will&#xD;
      be conducted with parents (ages 18+) to determine impact on families and individual&#xD;
      participants. Swim skills will be tracked at each session via goal attainment scaling and&#xD;
      daily documentation. Descriptive and correlational statistics will be completed as well as&#xD;
      coding of interview and survey data. Participants can participate for one, 10 week session,&#xD;
      or will have the option to participate in additional 10 week sessions until child&#xD;
      participants top out on the WOTA or plateau in progress of swim skills.&#xD;
