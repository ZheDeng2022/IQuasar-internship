  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1/2 trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose and whether selinexor and&#xD;
      radiation therapy work in treating patients with newly-diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine&#xD;
      glioma (DIPG) or high-grade glioma (HGG) with a genetic change called H3 K27M mutation. A&#xD;
      glioma is a type of cancer that occurs in the brain or spine. Glioma is considered high risk&#xD;
      (or high-grade) when it is growing and spreading quickly. The term, risk, refers to the&#xD;
      chance of the cancer coming back after treatment. DIPG is a subtype of HGG that grows in the&#xD;
      pons (a part of the brainstem that controls functions like breathing, swallowing, speaking,&#xD;
      and eye movements). Selinexor may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill tumor cells and&#xD;
      shrink tumors. Selinexor and radiation therapy together may be a beneficial treatment for&#xD;
      DIPG and H3 K27M-mutant HGG.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define toxicities and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of selinexor administered as an oral formulation in combination with standard of&#xD;
      care radiation therapy (RT), to pediatric patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma&#xD;
      (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).(Dose-finding phase) II. To estimate the&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS) distribution for diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant (DMG)/HGG&#xD;
      patients and overall survival (OS) distribution for DIPG patients associated with selinexor&#xD;
      plus RT, followed by selinexor in patients with newly diagnosed HGG (H3 K27M mutant DMG or H3&#xD;
      K27-wild type HGG) or DIPG, and to compare those outcomes to historical controls. (Efficacy&#xD;
      phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank tumor specimens and body fluids (blood and cerebrospinal fluid) for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase 1 dose-escalation study of selinexor followed by a phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients receive standard of care radiation therapy 5 days per week for&#xD;
      5-7 weeks. Starting on day 4 or 5 of radiation therapy, patients receive selinexor orally&#xD;
      (PO) on 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After a 2-week rest period, patients proceed to Maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive selinexor PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for year 1 (i.e.,&#xD;
      3, 6, 9, 12 months), then every 6 months for years 2-3 (i.e., 18, 24, 30, 36 months), and&#xD;
      finally once yearly for years 4-5.&#xD;
