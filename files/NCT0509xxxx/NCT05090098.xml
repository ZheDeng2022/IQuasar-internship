  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide. A significant number of&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors develop many complications. Breast cancer and survivors may develop a&#xD;
      fear of physical activity avoidance and movement, called kinesiophobia, due to upper&#xD;
      extremity pain, numbness, restricted arm/shoulder range of motion, and risk of lymphedema.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the present study, it is aimed to compare the effect of fear of movement on&#xD;
      physical activity, quality of life and psychological states in women who have had breast&#xD;
      cancer with healthy people.&#xD;
