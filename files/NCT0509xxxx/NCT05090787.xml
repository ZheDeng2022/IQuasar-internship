    <textblock>
      This study is a 6-month, prospective, comparative, multicenter, bilateral, parallel group,&#xD;
      randomized (2:1), subject/evaluator masked clinical investigation of the investigational&#xD;
      mDCB00 IOL as compared to the DCB00 IOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at up to 8 sites in countries where both the investigational and&#xD;
      control lenses are approved for market and/or for evaluation in a clinical study and will&#xD;
      include a total of up to 200 subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      the test lens or the control lens in both eyes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Preoperative best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) of 20/40 Snellen (0.5&#xD;
             Decimal) or worse with or without a glare source&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Normal corneal topography and no irregular corneal astigmatism&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Preoperative corneal astigmatism of 2.50 D or less in both eyes, including&#xD;
                  posterior corneal astigmatism (PCA) and surgically induced astigmatism (SIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear intraocular media, other than cataract&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability, willingness and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with&#xD;
             examination procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization or equivalent documentation necessary&#xD;
             to comply with applicable privacy laws pertaining to medical treatment in the&#xD;
             governing countries&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and respond to a questionnaire in English or the local language&#xD;
             in which the informed consent and questionnaires are provided&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: All criteria apply to each eye&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Requiring an intraocular lens power outside the available range of +17.0 D to&#xD;
                  +26.0 D&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, fixed pupils, or abnormally shaped pupils)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Recent ocular trauma or ocular surgery that is not resolved/stable or may affect&#xD;
                  visual outcomes or increase risk to the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior corneal refractive (LASIK, LASEK, RK, PRK, etc.) or intraocular surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Corneal abnormalities such as stromal, epithelial or endothelial dystrophies that&#xD;
                  are predicted to cause visual acuity losses to a level of 20/30 Snellen (0.66&#xD;
                  Decimal) or worse during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to achieve keratometric stability for contact lens wearers (see Section&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects with conditions associated with increased risk of zonular rupture,&#xD;
                  including capsular or zonular abnormalities that may lead to IOL decentration or&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision Prior, current, or&#xD;

                  (e.g., Flomax, Flomaxtra, Rapaflo) that may, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
                  confound the outcome or increase the risk to the subject (e.g., poor dilation or&#xD;
                  a lack of adequate iris structure to perform standard cataract surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Inability to focus or fixate for prolonged periods of time (e.g., due to&#xD;

                  suspected glaucoma, glaucomatous changes in the fundus or visual field, ocular&#xD;
                  inflammation, etc.). Note: controlled ocular hypertension without glaucomatous&#xD;
                  changes is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known ocular disease or pathology that may affect visual acuity or that may be&#xD;
                  expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical intervention during&#xD;
                  the course of the study (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, diabetic&#xD;
                  retinopathy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, is lactating or has another&#xD;
