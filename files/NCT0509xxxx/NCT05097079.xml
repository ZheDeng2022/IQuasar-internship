    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on Unstimulated Saliva Flow Rate (USFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The first co-primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Unstimulated Saliva Flow Rate (USFR; grams/minute) at Week 4 post-injection. The USFR is a measurement of the amount of saliva (grams) produced in a allotted duration of time (minutes). USFR is assessed at baseline prior to injection and at subsequent study visit post-injection. The difference in the USFR between baseline and post-baseline study visit is calculated. A change from baseline USFR that is &lt;0 grams/minutes represents a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The second co-primary endpoint is the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score at Week 4 post-injection. The CGI-C scale is a single item clinician assessment of how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to their state prior to treatment (injection). The CGI-C is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = &quot;Very much improved&quot;, 2 = &quot;Much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;Minimally improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;No change&quot;, 5 = &quot;Minimally worse&quot;, 6 = &quot;Much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;Very much worse&quot;. A CGI-C score &lt;4 represents a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on Parent/Guardian Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The key secondary endpoint is the Parent/Guardian Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score at Week 4 post-injection. The PGI-C scale is a single item parent/guardian assessment of how much the their child's illness has improved or worsened relative to their state prior to treatment (injection). The PGI-C is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = &quot;Very much improved&quot;, 2 = &quot;Much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;Minimally improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;No change&quot;, 5 = &quot;Minimally worse&quot;, 6 = &quot;Much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;Very much worse&quot;. A PGI-C score &lt;4 represents a better outcome</description>

    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on Unstimulated Saliva Flow Rate (USFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 8 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>The first additional secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Unstimulated Saliva Flow Rate (USFR; grams/min) at Weeks 2, 8 and 13 post-injection. The USFR is a measurement of the amount of saliva (grams) produced in a allotted duration of time (minutes). USFR is assessed at baseline prior to injection and at subsequent study visit post-injection. The difference in the USFR between baseline and post-baseline study visit is calculated. A change from baseline USFR that is &lt;0 grams/minutes represents a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 8 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>The second additional secondary endpoint is the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score at Weeks 2, 8, and 13 post-injection. The CGI-C scale is a single item clinician assessment of how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to their state prior to treatment (injection). The CGI-C is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = &quot;Very much improved&quot;, 2 = &quot;Much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;Minimally improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;No change&quot;, 5 = &quot;Minimally worse&quot;, 6 = &quot;Much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;Very much worse&quot;. A CGI-C score &lt;4 represents a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on (PGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 8, and 13</time_frame>
    <description>The third additional secondary endpoint is the Parent/Guardian Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score at Week 2, 8, and 13 post-injection. The PGI-C scale is a single item parent/guardian assessment of how much their child's illness has improved or worsened relative to their state prior to treatment (injection). The PGI-C is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 to 7, where 1 = &quot;Very much improved&quot;, 2 = &quot;Much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;Minimally improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;No change&quot;, 5 = &quot;Minimally worse&quot;, 6 = &quot;Much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;Very much worse&quot;. Successful therapy is indicated by a lower score (&lt;4) in subsequent testing. A PGI-C score &lt;4 represents a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC on Modified Teacher's Drooling Scale (mTDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The fourth additional secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Modified Teacher's Drooling Scale (mTDS) score at Week4 post injection. The mTDS is used to assess drooling severity and frequency. It is a single-item scale rated on a 9-point Likert scale (1-9) where 1=Dry: never drools; 2=Mild: only the lips are wet occasionally; 3=Mild: only the lips are wet; frequently; 4=Moderate: wet on the lips and chin; occasionally; 5=Moderate: wet on the lips and chin; frequently; 6=Severe: drools to the extent that clothing becomes damp; occasionally; 7=Severe: drools to the extent that clothing becomes damp; frequently;8=Profuse: clothing, hands, tray, and objects become wet; occasionally; 9=Profuse: clothing, hands, tray, and objects become wet; frequently. A change from baseline mTDS score &lt;0 represents a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of MYOBLOC Drooling Impact Scale (DIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The fifth additional secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Drooling Impact Scale (DIS) score at Week 4 post-injection. The DIS is used to assess the frequency, severity, and impact of your child's drooling. It is a 10-item questionnaire where each item is rated on a 10-point end-anchor semantic differential scale (1 to 10; where 1 = best outcome to 10 = worst outcome). The sum of all 10 items yields a total score (ranging from 10-100). A change from baseline DIS score &lt;0 represents a better outcome.</description>
