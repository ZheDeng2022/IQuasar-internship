      The main objective of the current study is to search predictors of non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
      support failure, like high -flow oxygen system (HFO) and pressure systems, Bilevel positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (BiPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), in patients with&#xD;
      acute hypoxemia produced by COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, we will do a retrospective review of the intermediate respiratory care&#xD;
      unit activity from March to May 2020 in the target population. In the second phase&#xD;
      development an interventional study. At admission all patients will be treated with HFS&#xD;
      monitoring clinical variables like respiratory frequency, oxygen saturation, gasometer&#xD;
      results and oxygen inspiration fraction. In case of HFO failure, the patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment with CPAP or BIPAP. The same clinical variables will be monitoring to&#xD;
      analysis their prediction capacity of failure therapy, defined as mortality or need to&#xD;
      intubation. The results will be adjusted comorbidity grade, age and initial severity&#xD;
      pneumonia. Secondary objectives of study are 90 days mortality, functional recovery at 90&#xD;
      days and to realise a cost-effectiveness valuation of non-invasive respiratory supports in&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonia caused by the SARS Cov-2 coronavirus is a viral infectious disease that is&#xD;
      characterized in some cases by the rapid and progressive respiratory failure of the&#xD;
      respiratory system, being the most serious affectation and the one that marks the prognosis.&#xD;
      Non-invasive breathing supports are therapies that help you breathe in severe respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Therefore, monitoring of respiratory exhaustion should be carried out in all&#xD;
      patients with SARS Cov-2 pneumonia. Within this follow-up, prognostic factors could be&#xD;
      identified that help to assess with what probability the treatment with these supports may or&#xD;
      may not be successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will carry out a prospective, descriptive study at this center in order to assess&#xD;
      respiratory clinical variables by telemetry recording and blood tests during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, we will carry out, during the follow-up of patients already diagnosed, or with a&#xD;
      new diagnosis of SARS Cov-2 pneumonia and respiratory failure, who require non-invasive&#xD;
      support therapy, an analysis on the first day of initiation of therapy, at 48 hours and at&#xD;
      the end of this therapy, we will also continuously monitor vital signs while these therapies&#xD;
      are used. We will compare the values obtained from patients who only require therapy with&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannulas and from patients who are not sufficient for this treatment and need&#xD;
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study who do not have sufficient respiratory support with high-flow&#xD;
      cannula therapy and feel exhausted, will be switched to non-invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomly assigned to one of two possible settings: setting A (continuous&#xD;
      pressure mechanical ventilation) or setting B (intermittent pressure mechanical ventilation).&#xD;
      This decision is made because to date there are no scientifically proven differences in which&#xD;
      configuration is best for the treatment of this disease. The data on the success of the&#xD;
      therapies will be compared, understanding as failure the need for orotracheal intubation to&#xD;
      perform invasive mechanical ventilation or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Germans Trias i&#xD;
      Pujol University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures and Possible Risks and Discomforts Vital signs will be recorded during the&#xD;
      time that non-invasive respiratory support therapy is performed continuously for the&#xD;
      assessment of respiratory status. This does not pose any additional risk, since it is a&#xD;
      non-invasive procedure and without exposure to ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 3 and 5 tests will be carried out during the study, which are the same as those&#xD;
      carried out in the usual clinical practice of this disease. They pose risks of pain due to&#xD;
      puncture and extravasation of a blood vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study would not produce any discomfort except those derived from the&#xD;
      non-invasive respiratory support therapies themselves. These are: epistaxis, runny nose,&#xD;
      excessive noise in the treatment with high-flow cannulas and skin ulcers in the case of&#xD;
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation. It does not imply an added risk to that of normal&#xD;
      clinical practice for health since an additional intervention will not be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information regarding your personal data (initials and medical record number) will be&#xD;
      coded, a non-consecutive alphanumeric code will be assigned, which will be called the patient&#xD;
      study code. This will only be known to the principal investigators, who will save this data&#xD;
      using a password-protected Microsoft Excel file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical information collected for the study associated with your patient code will be&#xD;
      stored in a Microsoft Excel type computer file located at the research center. The REDCAP&#xD;
      form will be used for data collection. To access it, you will need a second password&#xD;
      different from the first one. These data can only be re-identified by the study's principal&#xD;
      investigators or by collaborators authorized by them. They will be used exclusively for the&#xD;
      purposes specified here.&#xD;
&#xD;
