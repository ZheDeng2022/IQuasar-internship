  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to create a national database and gather vaccine-associated&#xD;
      serious adverse events/injury data from newly vaccinated individuals in the US in order to&#xD;
      identify the possible underlying causal relationships and plausible underlying biological&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goal is to establish criteria that enable classification of vaccine-induced&#xD;
      adverse events/injuries compare data from our database with the official Vaccine Injury Table&#xD;
      National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program on or after March 21, 2017.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccinations are typically administered to healthy persons and often are mandated by states&#xD;
      or federal authorities as a condition for school attendance or military service in order to&#xD;
      prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Because vaccines are either mandated or&#xD;
      recommended for vulnerable groups, such as children or the elderly, vaccines are often held&#xD;
      to a higher standard of safety by the FDA than other medical products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the vast numbers of vaccine doses administered in the US there is a need to gather&#xD;
      quality information on serious vaccine-associated adverse events leading to serious injury.&#xD;
      Vaccine-induced adverse events are typically reported in the CDC Vaccine Adverse Event&#xD;
      Reporting System (VAERS) database, which contains information on unverified reports of&#xD;
      adverse events (illnesses, health problems and/or symptoms) following immunization with&#xD;
      US-licensed vaccines. Reports are accepted from anyone and can be submitted electronically at&#xD;
      www.vaers.hhs.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal for this observational study is to establish an independent national&#xD;
      database to classify vaccine-associated serious adverse events/injury data from vaccinated&#xD;
      individuals. The plan is to gather survey data and health information from newly vaccinated&#xD;
      individuals who have experienced serious adverse effects in order to help understand the&#xD;
      possible causal relationships and plausible biological mechanisms underlying serious adverse&#xD;
      events/injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary goal is to gather medical history and survey data from recently vaccinated&#xD;
      individuals in order to develop a vaccine-injury risk assessment tool which may be used to&#xD;
      predict individual vulnerability to vaccine adverse events/injury.&#xD;
