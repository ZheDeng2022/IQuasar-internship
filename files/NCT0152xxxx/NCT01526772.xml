      Improvements in imaging technology have allowed for the development of small endoscopes&#xD;
      (&quot;slim scopes&quot;) half the size of a typical endoscope. These small endoscopes can be passed&#xD;
      transnasally into the esophagus and stomach with only local anesthesia to the nasal passage&#xD;
      without the need for deep sedation. They have been used in the detection of diseases of the&#xD;
      esophagus and stomach,3,4 but have not been used in the detection of complications in the&#xD;
      post bariatric population&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is an epidemic in the United States effecting 250 million people worldwide and over&#xD;
      30% of the population of the United Sates. Medical therapy for obesity is lacking in its&#xD;
      durability in maintaining weight loss. Currently surgical therapy is the most dependable and&#xD;
      durable treatment option. The Roux en Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was initially described in 1967&#xD;
      and is currently the surgical method of choice in the treatment of obesity. It involves the&#xD;
      creation of a small gastric pouch by restricting the gastric body and antrum and the creation&#xD;
      of a long roux limb with a gastrojejunal anastomosis, thus inducing satiety and creating a&#xD;
      malabsorptive physiology. Unfortunately this procedure maintains a significant complication&#xD;
      rate. Strictures at the gastrojejunal anastomosis occur in 6-20% of patients after bypass.1&#xD;
      Anastomotic ulcers occur in up to 16% .2 Symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, and&#xD;
      significant nausea. Unfortunately these symptoms are not specific to strictures or ulcers and&#xD;
      may occur spontaneously without a specific etiology, so often a transoral upper endoscopy&#xD;
      (EGD) is required to evaluate the anastomosis for significant pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGD in post bariatric patients is a safe procedure. However it typically requires deep&#xD;
      sedation administered by an anesthesiologist to overcome the patient's gag reflex and&#xD;
      discomfort. Sedation in obese patients can be challenging due to the risks of apnea and&#xD;
      challenges of tracheal intubation. For the procedure to be performed the patient must take&#xD;
      the day off from work and bring a driver to take them home, thus there are significant direct&#xD;
      and indirect costs to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in imaging technology have allowed for the development of small endoscopes&#xD;
      (&quot;slim scopes&quot;) half the size of a typical endoscope. These small endoscopes can be passed&#xD;
      transnasally into the esophagus and stomach with only local anesthesia to the nasal passage&#xD;
      without the need for deep sedation. They have been used in the detection of diseases of the&#xD;
