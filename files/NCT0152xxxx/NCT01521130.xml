    <textblock>
      This project examines how seizures, and abnormal brain activity, affect language skill in&#xD;
      children with Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centro-Temporal Spikes (BECTS). BECTS is a&#xD;
      common type of childhood epilepsy, and while BECTS patients stop having seizures by their&#xD;
      late teenage years, many studies have shown that these children have language problems that&#xD;
      may lead to academic and social difficulties. Using standardized language testing, monitoring&#xD;
      of brain activity, and MRI brain imaging, this project aims to determine what particular&#xD;
      combination of BECTS symptoms put children most at risk for language problems and whether&#xD;
      treatment with anti-epileptic medications may be helpful.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Benign Childhood Epilepsy with Centro-Temporal Spikes (BECTS), an extremely common type of&#xD;
      childhood epilepsy, is traditionally assumed to have a benign course, but recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that cognitive function, especially language, is often impaired in BECTS patients.&#xD;
      However, it is not clear whether ithe seizures, the centrotemporal spikes (CTS), or other&#xD;
      factors cause the negative cognitive consequences that may impact school performance and&#xD;
      social interaction. BECTS patients have scattered seizures but very frequent CTS, and may be&#xD;
      suffering with undiagnosed cognitive and language deficits. This suggests a causal role for&#xD;
      CTS that has not yet been investigated in detail. This project will examine the impact of&#xD;
      seizures and CTS on neurocognitive function in BECTS patients, at diagnosis and after one&#xD;
      year. We will gather critical information regarding the effect of the anti-epileptic&#xD;
      medication levetiracetam on CTS, which will inform a future Phase III clinical trial aimed at&#xD;
      eliminating CTS and improving long term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the interactions between CTS, seizures and neuropsychological&#xD;
      outcomes using Functional MRI of language in order to decipher changes in neural circuitry&#xD;
      that underlie language deficits found in children with BECTS. Using standardized&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing and fMRI at the time of diagnosis, this study will first&#xD;
      characterize the nature and incidence of language problems in children with BECTS, separating&#xD;
      the effects of CTS and seizures. It is expected that children with BECTS will perform below&#xD;
      normative standards on tests of language skill, accompanied by aberrations in the neural&#xD;
      circuitry supporting language processing as tested with fMRI. These data will also make it&#xD;
      possible to characterize which children with BECTS are most at risk for language problems, by&#xD;
      taking into account contributing factors such as number of seizures, age of onset, and&#xD;
      frequency and lateralization of CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed exploratory clinical trial will also provide key information needed to properly&#xD;
      design and conduct a future double blind Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) children&#xD;
      aimed at improving language outcome through elimination of CTS. Using an open-label&#xD;
      dose-ranging design and 1-year follow up, we will determine the best dose of levetiracetam to&#xD;
      control seizures, eliminate CTS and be well tolerated. We will also examine the extent of&#xD;
      changes in language function and neural circuitry of language with 1-year follow-up&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing and fMRI in LEV-treated and untreated BECTS compared to controls&#xD;
      (which will document the natural history of neuropsychological function in untreated BECTS&#xD;
      children and give additional information about the effect of LEV). The current study will&#xD;
      provide crucial information for a future double blind RCT that will the compare the selected&#xD;
      dose of levetiracetam to carbamazepine (the current standard of care) in BECTS. This would&#xD;
      change clinical practice by demonstrating the need for AED treatment in BECTS to eliminate&#xD;
      CTS, in turn improving long term language and cognitive outcome.&#xD;
