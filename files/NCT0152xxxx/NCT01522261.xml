      Does mechanical bowel preparation (complete bowel cleansing)help the Surgeon with&#xD;
      visualization of the operative field during laparoscopic pelvic reconstructive surgery?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to receive a complete MBP or not prior to their surgical&#xD;
      procedure. All patients will use 1 fleets enema the night before surgery and one the morning&#xD;
      of surgery to ensure that the rectum is empty of all stool. This will be done since some&#xD;
      surgeons use a rectal probe in the rectum to help with manipulation during the procedure.&#xD;
      Stool in the rectal vault could contaminate the surgical field and lead to an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized at their pre-op visit and provided instructions according to the&#xD;
      group assignment. On the day of surgery patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire in&#xD;
      the pre-op holding area to assess their overnight symptoms including insomnia, weakness,&#xD;
      abdominal distention, nausea, thirst and overall tolerability of the Bowel Preparation&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery, the primary surgeon will be asked to complete a visual analog&#xD;
      score sheet evaluating the ease of the procedure with regard to retraction of the large and&#xD;
      small bowel to help with visualization of the sacral promontory, retraction from posterior&#xD;
      cul-de-sac, and maintaining adequate positioning after retraction. All surgeons (attendings,&#xD;
      fellows, and residents) will be blinded re: the patients group assignment. Each primary&#xD;
      surgeon will be asked to assign a final grade to the procedure as easy, medium, or difficult&#xD;
      based on overall bowel retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At their 2 week follow up visit patients will be asked to report return of bowel function&#xD;
      (first bowel movement or flatus) in # of days after surgery and incidents of stool leakage&#xD;
      post op.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine whether there is there an added benefit in using a MBP with regard to positioning of the large and small bowel for exposure of key anatomic structures during pelvic reconstructive surgical procedures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Surgeons will be asked to complete a questionnaire re: their impressions of the visual field on immediately Post op.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this protocol is to determine whether there is truly an advantage for the surgeon (visually) in having patients complete a Mechanical Bowel Prep prior to surgery or if an enema completed the evening before and morning of the surgery is sufficient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate whether MBP (total bowel cleansing) delays the return of bowel function and/or increases the risk of perioperative leakage of stool (fecal incontinence)post operatively.</measure>
    <time_frame>We will be following the subject from the day of surgery through 2 weeks post op.</time_frame>
