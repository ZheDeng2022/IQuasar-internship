  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comprised of 2 parts, Part A and Part B, both in healthy male&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will investigate the safety of intravenous (IV) ketamine administration&#xD;
      after single oral doses of LY2979165 (capsules) or LY2140023 (tablets). Part A will be&#xD;
      completed before starting Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of this study will investigate whether different dose levels of LY2979165 or&#xD;
      LY2140023, when administered before ketamine, result in changes to the images on a brain scan&#xD;
      seen with ketamine alone. Brain imaging is currently used for a number of reasons including&#xD;
      understanding where in the brain medicines have their effects. Ketamine is an anesthetic used&#xD;
      in this study to activate particular regions of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single oral doses of LY2979165 to be used in both parts of the study are 20 and 60 mg&#xD;
      with matching dummy drug (placebo) for each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses for LY2140023 are 10, 40, and 160 mg with matching placebo for each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study and follow up 7-14 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug. The study will last up to 8-weeks for an individual&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
