    <textblock>
      This is an open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography) study for investigation of radiation dosimetry, plasma pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      biodistribution, safety and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      and lung cancer patients. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤ 40 µg&#xD;
      BNOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and lung cancer patients.&#xD;
      Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests, serum alanine&#xD;
      aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be collected from the&#xD;
      volunteers. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrin αⅤβ3 is an important member of this receptor family and expressed preferentially on&#xD;
      various types of tumor cells and the activated endothelial cells of tumor angiogenesis, but&#xD;
      not or very low on the quiescent vessel cells and other normal cells. Therefore, the integrin&#xD;
      αⅤβ3 receptor is becoming a valuable target for diagnosis and response evaluation of&#xD;
      malignant tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tri-peptide sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) can specifically bind to the&#xD;
      integrin αⅤβ3 receptor. Accordingly, a variety of radiolabeled RGD-based peptides have been&#xD;
      developed for non-invasive imaging of integrin αⅤβ3 expression via positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Among all the RGD&#xD;
      radiotracers studied, two PET imaging agents, 18F-Galacto-RGD and 18F-AH111585, have been&#xD;
      investigated in clinical trials, and the results demonstrated that both radiotracers allowed&#xD;
      the specific imaging of various types of tumors, and the tumor uptake correlated well with&#xD;
      the expression of integrin αⅤβ3. Recently, series of RGD dimeric peptides with PEG linkers&#xD;
      have been studied. The new types of RGD peptides showed much higher in vitro integrin&#xD;
      αⅤβ3-binding affinity than the single RGD tri-peptide sequence, and importantly, they&#xD;
      exhibited significantly increased tumor uptake and improved in vivo kinetics in animal&#xD;
      models. As a representative, 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 could be easily prepared and exhibited&#xD;
      excellent in vivo behaviors in animal models. No adverse reactions are observed in animal&#xD;
      models to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the further interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2, a open-label dynamic&#xD;
      whole-body PET/CT study was designed to investigate radiation dosimetry, plasma&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, safety and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and lung cancer patients. A single dose of nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2&#xD;
      ( ≤ 40 µg BNOTA-PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and lung cancer&#xD;
      patients. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.&#xD;
      Changes of blood pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      serum alanine aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be&#xD;
      collected from the volunteers. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.&#xD;
