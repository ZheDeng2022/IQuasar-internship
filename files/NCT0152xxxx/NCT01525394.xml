  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (vis-a-vis lenvatinib), randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      three-treatment, three-way crossover study in healthy subjects. There are two phases in this&#xD;
      study: Pre-Randomization and Randomization. The Pre-Randomization Phase consists of Screening&#xD;
      and Baseline Period 1. The Randomization Phase consists of five periods: Treatment Period 1,&#xD;
      Baseline Period 2, Treatment Period 2, Baseline Period 3, and Treatment Period 3. Completion&#xD;
      of study termination procedures will be performed at Visit 11.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Normal, healthy male and female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age at&#xD;
             the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All females must have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy&#xD;
             test result at Screening and Baseline. Females of child-bearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g., abstinence, an&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD), a double-barrier method such as condom + spermicide or&#xD;
             condom + diaphragm with spermicide, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive or&#xD;
             have a vasectomized partner) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after&#xD;
             study drug discontinuation. The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement&#xD;
             are postmenopausal women (defined as greater than age 50 and at least 12 months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea) or subjects who have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise&#xD;
             proven sterile (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
             dosing, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 2 months prior&#xD;
             to dosing). All women who are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
             product for at least 12 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use the same&#xD;
             contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male patients who are not abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy, who are&#xD;
             partners of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use a&#xD;
             highly affective method of contraception (e.g., condom + spermicide, condom +&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) starting for at least one menstrual cycle prior to&#xD;
             starting study drug(s) and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days (longer&#xD;
             if appropriate) after the last dose of study drug. Those with partners using hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (as&#xD;
             described previously).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Partners of male and female subjects must use an effective method of contraception&#xD;
             (e.g., barrier method, IUD), commencing prior to or at initiation of study drug and&#xD;
             continuing for the duration of the study and for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation. All females who are of reproductive potential and who are using&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptive product for at least 12 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use&#xD;
             the same contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug&#xD;
             discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Voluntarily provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol for the duration of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality, including a QTc interval of&#xD;
             greater than 450 msec, on 12-lead ECG at the time of the Screening Period, Baseline&#xD;
             Periods, or 30 minutes before administration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of myocardial infarction, syncope or cardiac arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a systolic pressure of greater than&#xD;
             140 mm Hg and diastolic pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A history of unstable heart disease or additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes&#xD;
             (TdP) including heart failure, hypokalemia, or a family history of congenital long QT&#xD;
             syndrome or unexplained cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with a history of gastrointestinal surgery (hepatectomy, nephrotomy,&#xD;
             digestive organ resection, etc.) that may affect PK profiles of lenvatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known intolerance to the study drug or moxifloxacin (Avelox) (or any of the&#xD;
             excipients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A positive result from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A antibody&#xD;
             (HAVAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb) tests at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A known or suspected history of drug or alcohol misuse within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             Screening, or who have a positive urine drug test or breath alcohol test at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug or&#xD;
             device within 4 weeks prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who received blood products within 4 weeks, or donated blood within 8 weeks,&#xD;
             or donated plasma within one week of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who have engaged in heavy exercise within 2 weeks prior to check-in (e.g.,&#xD;
             marathon runners, weight lifters, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to abide by the requirements of the study.&#xD;
