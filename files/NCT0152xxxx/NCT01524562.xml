      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Liver disease is a leading cause of death in people who have the human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV). It especially affects those who have both HIV and hepatitis B or C viruses. Most&#xD;
      research on HIV-related liver disease has been conducted in North America and Europe.&#xD;
      However, HIV-related liver disease in Uganda and other African nations may involve other&#xD;
      diseases that are not common in the West, and may not involve hepatitis B or C. Researchers&#xD;
      want to study HIV-related liver disease in Uganda to learn more about the differences between&#xD;
      Western and African trends of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study HIV-related liver disease in rural Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who were tested for possible liver disease. Some&#xD;
           participants will have HIV infection; others will be uninfected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be from rural areas of Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have at least two study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will complete a&#xD;
           questionnaire about health and quality of life. Blood, urine, and stool samples will be&#xD;
           collected. Participants will also have a liver scan to check for liver scarring, and an&#xD;
           ultrasound to take images of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who may have liver disease will visit a local hospital for more tests. A&#xD;
           liver biopsy will be performed to collect liver tissue samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With improved survival following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (HAART), liver disease has become a leading cause of death among HIV-infected persons in&#xD;
      Western cohorts, primarily affecting those co-infected with hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV,&#xD;
      HCV). However, data are sparse on liver disease in HIV-infected populations from Uganda and&#xD;
      other African nations, where the etiologies of liver disease are broader and include&#xD;
      aflatoxin, schistosomiasis and other infectious and environmental agents. Our previous&#xD;
      noninvasive study in rural, Rakai, Uganda indicates that the prevalence of significant liver&#xD;
      fibrosis is high among HIV-infected individuals (17%) and is 50% higher than in&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected persons, although the prevalence of viral hepatitis B co-infection is low&#xD;
      (5%). The study presented here is a biopsy-based study that follows up on these results with&#xD;
      the objectives of defining the etiology of liver disease and describing the mechanisms of&#xD;
      HIV-accelerated liver fibrosis in this setting.&#xD;

               2. Persons who are able and willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Persons who have a transient elastography score &gt;=9.0 kPa or have other evidence&#xD;
                  of liver disease, and who are willing to undergo an ultrasound and liver biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i) Other evidence of liver disease: Persons with an LSM &lt;9.0 kPa who demonstrate&#xD;
                  liver transaminases at least 2-times greater than the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
