      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a comprehensive post-discharge&#xD;
      disease management system is more effective in reducing the readmission rate for heart&#xD;
      failure patients compared to standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure, a disease that affects a large proportion of the aging population, continues&#xD;
      to be associated with poor outcomes especially in patients who require hospitalization. Each&#xD;
      year, nearly 1 million Americans are newly diagnosed with congestive heart failure and&#xD;
      currently, there are at least 5 million Americans living with this chronic disease. The&#xD;
      number of patients with heart failure is expected to reach 10 million by the year 2037.This&#xD;
      population consumes a large proportion of health care resources with the main cost being&#xD;
      hospitalization. The heart failure 30-day readmission rates hover around 25% nationally, with&#xD;
      an approximate cost of $7,000 per hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to improve care and reduce costs, heart failure disease management programs are&#xD;
      becoming more prevalent. Recent data suggests that multi-disciplinary disease management&#xD;
      programs may reduce mortality and hospitalizations as well as improve costs, patients'&#xD;
      ability to self-care, and quality of life. It provides a means to increase the use of&#xD;
      evidence-based therapies, improve patient education, and decrease resource usage. Heart&#xD;
      failure management programs involve early assessment, optimized treatment, easy access to&#xD;
      care, and education and psychosocial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized for decompensated congestive heart failure are among the highest risk&#xD;
      group for morbidity and mortality among people with chronic heart failure and a large&#xD;
      proportion of this risk occurs early after discharge. Thus, the goals of these programs&#xD;
      should include managing the gap between the inpatient and outpatient settings and should&#xD;
      ideally involve a multidisciplinary team in order to serve these patients in a comprehensive&#xD;
      manner. We propose to determine the relative efficacy of a post-discharge disease management&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the time to first hospital readmission&#xD;
      can be lengthened using a disease management model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, one year pilot study that will enroll patients admitted to Saint&#xD;
      Francis Hospital and Medical Center (SFHMC) with the admitting diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure that have been referred to the Congestive Heart Failure&#xD;
      Disease(CHF)Management Program by the attending physician. The patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study and followed for a maximum of 90 days post-discharge. A case control group of&#xD;
      60-100 subjects will also be established for primary endpoint analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet study criteria, informed consent will be obtained before hospital discharge&#xD;
      or at the first Disease Management visit. Patients will be followed for 90 days&#xD;
      post-discharge. Clinic visits, homecare agency and visits, heart failure education class&#xD;
      attendance, and dates of hospital readmission will be tracked. Descriptive characteristics of&#xD;
      patients will be recorded at the time of enrollment. Descriptive characteristics include&#xD;
      demographics, etiology of heart failure, symptoms, physical assessment, current medications,&#xD;
      lab results, and diagnostic test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In everyday practice, the Congestive Heart Failure Disease Management Program administers&#xD;
      clinical questionnaires to patients to assess quality of life and heart failure management&#xD;
      knowledge. The clinical questionnaires that constitute standard of care for these patients&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test: given to each patient at the first Disease&#xD;
           Management visit and after attending the Congestive Heart Failure educational series to&#xD;
           determine level of understanding of self-management of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kansas City Living with Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ): This is a validated quality&#xD;
           of life survey. The questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that&#xD;
           quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social&#xD;
           function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality. This survey is administered to each&#xD;
           patient upon enrollment into the Disease Management Program and prior to discharge from&#xD;
           the Disease Management Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from these questionnaires will be collected and enrollment and discharge scores will&#xD;
      be compared for improvement in level of understanding of self-management of heart failure and&#xD;
      overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred consecutive patients discharged from SFHMC with a primary diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure that have not been referred to the Congestive heart Failure&#xD;
      Disease Management Program will undergo retrospective chart review to establish a case&#xD;
      control group. The study team will perform a retrospective chart review to abstract the&#xD;
      following data: hospital admission date, hospital discharge date, attending physician, age,&#xD;
      and ejection fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND SAFETY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no physical or psychological risks associated with this study. The study does not&#xD;
      involve any experimental treatments or invasive therapies. There is a less than minimal risk&#xD;
      of disclosure of clinical information maintained in the file linking the patient's medical&#xD;
      record to the data. This file will be kept to allow follow up tracking for heart failure&#xD;
      re-admission. The file will be password protected and available solely to the site Principal&#xD;
      Investigator and Institutional Review Board-approved study staff. At the end of the study,&#xD;
      following data analysis and publication of an abstract and paper in appropriate peer reviewed&#xD;
      journal(s), the file linking the patient names to the case report forms will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL BENEFITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no potential benefits to patients whose records are entered into the database. The&#xD;
      potential benefit is to society and future patients diagnosed with heart failure.&#xD;
      Implementation of a disease management model may improve functional and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      through more productive interactions between patients and providers. A disease management&#xD;
      model may decrease hospital re-admission rates and the associated cost. If this disease&#xD;
      management model proves effective, the results will provide a framework for expanding care&#xD;
      opportunities and for establishing a new model for heart failure patients in this health care&#xD;
      system as well as in other systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be assessed as a continuous variable using Kaplan Meier survival&#xD;
      analysis. The time to all-cause readmission and readmission for heart failure will be&#xD;
      assessed using this methodology. The time to all-cause readmission and readmission for heart&#xD;
      failure in the CHF Disease Management Group will be compared to aggregate hospital&#xD;
      readmission data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QOL questionnaire will be analyzed using a t-test comparing enrollment and 2 month KCCQ&#xD;
      scores. The validity of each individual domain of this questionnaire has been independently&#xD;
      established and all components of the summary score are considered valid representations of&#xD;
      their intended domains.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will be assessed as a continuous variable. Survival curves will be produced using Kaplan-Meier analysis for both the CHF Disease Management Group and the case control group. A Cox regression-based test will be used to test differences in survival between the CHF Disease Management Group and the case control group. If case control subjects cannot be exactly matched on covariates to CHF Disease Management subjects, inverse probability of treatment weights (obtained via logistic regression) will be applied to correct for covariate imbalances between the two groups.</description>
