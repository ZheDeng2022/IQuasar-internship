      Purpose: To evaluate the safety and anti-depressive response of the H1 Coil TMS Device in&#xD;
      elderly patients suffering from major depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-seven (27) treatment resistance depressed-patients, 68 years of age and above,&#xD;
      currently in a depressive episode.All subjects will receive prefrontal deep rTMS of H1 Coil&#xD;
      (42 trains of 2 seconds, 10 Hz, with 20 seconds inter-train intervals, up to 120% of motor&#xD;
      threshold), for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, overall 20 sessions.Safety and efficacy tests will be&#xD;
      conducted before starting the trial (screening), once a week for the trial duration and one&#xD;
      month following end of treatment.&#xD;
