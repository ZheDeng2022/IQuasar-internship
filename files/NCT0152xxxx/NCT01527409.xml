      The Objectives of this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy for exercise, diet, and posttraumatic growth as a result of&#xD;
           participating in tailored program (Health Partnership Program) for 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy for quality of life, life satisfaction, health leadership,&#xD;
           anxiety, depression, impact of event, social support, cancer belief as a result of&#xD;
           participating in tailored program (Health Partnership Program) for 24 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the efficacy of such intervention compared with usual care in cancer patients&#xD;

      ***Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving cancer patients' quality of life has been increasing subject of research for&#xD;
      several years. Especially, the patients and their families who are needed to deal with&#xD;
      specific care on diverse aspects, such as social, spiritual, existential, psychological&#xD;
      aspect should be provided integrated program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidimensional characteristics of the health partnership program were addressed in National&#xD;
      Cancer Center (NCC) for exercise, diet, and posttraumatic growth based on transtheoretical&#xD;
      (TTM) model, social cognitive theory, health behavioral model, and coaching strategies. This&#xD;
      program points out the importance of behavioral approaches in managing their healthy life&#xD;
      according to improve patterns of three areas (exercise, diet, and posttraumatic growth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies that investigators mentioned above can lead those three areas to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To objective of this study is to support cancer patients to cope with exercise, diet, and&#xD;
      posttraumatic growth through tailored program (the health partnership program), and then&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the health partnership program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From evidence extracted from a literature review, contents of the program was elaborated, and&#xD;
      tailored from the TTM model. The curriculum is currently being reviewed and validated by&#xD;
      expert group of oncologists, nurse, psychologist and health education scientists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of the program (the health partnership program), a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After excluding patients with other causes (anemia, thyroid disease, co morbidities etc), 248&#xD;
      patients will be recruited based on statistical assumption of alpha (0.05), beta (0.20=power&#xD;
      80%), and dropout rate (15%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patients will be stratified according to their age, sex (male vs. female), cancer&#xD;
      types (stomach cancer, Breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal (except rectal cancer)&#xD;
      cancer, and lung cancer), and then allocated to an intervention or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When intervention group participates in the tailored program (the health partnership&#xD;
      program), they can receive various information which is related to health management and&#xD;
      improving quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health partnership program consists of 16 time's tele-coaching, a self leadership&#xD;
      workshop, and providing health materials (manuals, workbook, and booklet). Especially, those&#xD;
      will be dealt with managing three areas; exercise, diet, and posttraumatic growth based on&#xD;
      the transtheoretical model (TTM), social cognitive theory, health behavioral model, and&#xD;
      coaching strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients who are participated in the tailored program will be received tailored&#xD;
      feedbacks that enhance participants of the next level of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the control group could not participate in the health partnership program.&#xD;
      The control group could only be treated by usual care and a health education workshop with a&#xD;
      health booklet. However, the control group can participate in the health partnership program&#xD;
      after 12 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected before randomization, after intervention, and after a follow-up of 3,&#xD;
      6, and 12 months.&#xD;
