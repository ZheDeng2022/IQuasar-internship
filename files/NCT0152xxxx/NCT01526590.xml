  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the US, pancreas cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths. It was&#xD;
      estimated to have taken 36,800 lives in 2010. Unfortunately, curing pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      requires surgical removal. Surgical removal of the pancreas is associated with high morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, as well as high rates of complications. One way to aid surgeons in removing&#xD;
      pancreatic tumors is by providing them with a good idea of where the tumor is located and&#xD;
      what surrounding structures are involved. This currently happens through many different&#xD;
      modalities of imaging; usually computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound. Even with&#xD;
      these forms of imaging (and sometimes others), surgeons will occasionally open a patient and&#xD;
      find that the tumor cannot be removed due to its involvement with surrounding structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to avoid potentially unnecessary procedures or to help a surgeon navigate this&#xD;
      delicate procedure would be to provide more detailed information about the tumor. Several of&#xD;
      the techniques currently used to image the body have rapidly advanced over recent years.&#xD;
      Typical advancements come through better resolution of the images or contrast to enhance&#xD;
      desired parts of the images. Ultrasound has not seen such a two pronged advance. Ultrasound&#xD;
      has seen substantial advances in resolution to enhance picture quality, but contrast has not&#xD;
      been used clinically to assess pancreatic masses whereas it is for cardiologists to use&#xD;
      contrast to look at potential defects in the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contrast that is used with ultrasound is different from that of CT scans. CT scanners use&#xD;
      a dye that can be potentially hazardous. This dye can lead to serious kidney damage in some&#xD;
      patients. Ultrasound contrast, on the other hand, is made of small micro bubbles filled with&#xD;
      a harmless gas. Because of the way ultrasound works, these micro bubbles reflect the sound&#xD;
      waves differently than the surrounding tissue and thus provide contrast between normal tissue&#xD;
      and abnormal tissue. The contrast used in this study, Definity, and is the same contrast used&#xD;
      by Cardiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CE-EUS will be used for research purposes only and will not be used for any clinical&#xD;
      decision making. The surgeon will be blinded to the results of the research CE-EUS. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the research pre-operative contrast enhanced endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasounds images with already completed standard-of-care CT scans, the actual pancreatic&#xD;
      involvement seen in surgery and the pathology reports.&#xD;

      1. CT Scan of the abdomen - Standard Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The standard of care is that patients in question of pancreatic lesions undergo CT&#xD;
           scanning. After a CT scan, if it appears that the pancreatic mass may be resectable, the&#xD;
           standard protocol is to look at the pancreas while the patient is sedated with&#xD;
           endoscopic ultrasound for diagnostic tissue sampling and further staging. For this&#xD;
           reason, the endoscopist will not be blinded to the CT scan because it is the standard of&#xD;
           care that they interpret the results of the EUS with that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consent for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) - Standard Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Before being sedated and having endoscopic ultrasound, all patients are informed&#xD;
           about the risks of the procedure, alternatives, and what will be done. The patients who&#xD;
           decide to undergo endoscopic ultrasound will sign a consent form. Our goal is to enroll&#xD;
           30 patients (This number is limited by both the amount of contrast received from&#xD;
           Lantheus and the number of patients typically seen in a year. Ideally we will enroll as&#xD;
           many as possible for the purposes of power).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consent for Contrast Enhanced Endoscopic Ultrasound (CE-EUS) -- Performed exclusively&#xD;
           for research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. After the patient has been informed about the standard of care and signed a consent&#xD;
                form, the patient will be asked if they wish to participate in an experimental&#xD;
                study. If the patient is interested, they will be questioned about potential&#xD;
                structural heart defects, congenital heart defects, recent worsening of heart or&#xD;
                lung conditions, pulmonary hypertension, potential pregnancy, attempts to become&#xD;
                pregnant, if they are nursing, or allergies to the contrast. If they report any of&#xD;
                these relative contraindications, we will exclude them from participating in the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If they are free of all of those relative contraindications, they will be provided&#xD;
                information about the study (see included forms) and will be asked to sign a&#xD;
                consent form as well as a HIPAA authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. EUS - Standard of Care&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. At this point they will undergo an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas as per&#xD;
                standard protocol. They will have a peripheral IV started by the endoscopic&#xD;
                technician or nurse anesthetist. While the patient is being prepared, both research&#xD;
                questionnaires (EUS and CE-EUS) will be filled out ahead of time with the exception&#xD;
                of the findings, in order to reduce the time to complete the survey. The patient&#xD;
                will be sedated in one of two ways. Either they will be consciously sedated with&#xD;
                meperidine and midazolam under the surveillance of the attending gastroenterologist&#xD;
                or they will have propofol based sedation under the surveillance of an&#xD;
                anesthesiologist as per standard endoscopic ultrasound protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The patient will undergo their endoscopic ultrasound and video and images will be&#xD;
                recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. EUS Questionnaire - Preformed exclusively for research purposes. Duration less than one&#xD;
           minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The endoscopist will then fill out a survey (see attached) to record their&#xD;
                impressions of the tumor and the extent of its invasion into the vasculature. This&#xD;
                should not take more than one minute. EUS criteria for vascular invasion will be&#xD;
                loss of normal hyperechoic interface between the tumor and the vessel, irregular&#xD;
                tumor and vessel interface, tumor within vessel lumen, vessel encasement, or&#xD;
                collaterals with venous occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Decision about FNA - Standard of care, but important that it is done before CU-EUS a. If&#xD;
           the endoscopist feels that FNA is warranted they will make the decision at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. CE-EUS - Experimental Procedure performed exclusively for research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Dosing of Contrast - procedure performed exclusively for research purposes i. While&#xD;
           the patient is still sedated and before tissue sampling, the experimental aspect of the&#xD;
           procedure will begin. At this time, they will receive a dose of Definity intravenously&#xD;
           through their peripheral IV access after being agitated. The dose of Definity will be 10&#xD;
           microliters/kg given in one to two doses, and will not exceed 2cc. A saline flush will&#xD;
           follow the injection of the contrast and a timer will be started. The remaining contrast&#xD;
           will be properly disposed of in a sharps container.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Recording of CE-EUS images - procedure performed exclusively for research purposes.&#xD;
           Duration 3-4 minutes i. The endoscopist will perform an additional reading with the&#xD;
           contrast and record a 3-4 minute segment for review later using the harmonic mode of the&#xD;
           ultrasound probe at a mechanical index of 0.3. The mechanical index may need to be be&#xD;
           optimized, however a previous study found 0.3 to be optimal. Aspects that will be&#xD;
           analyzed later are sequence of filling (central vs peripheral), timing (arterial&#xD;
           [0-30s], venous [60-180s], post-venous/equilibrium phase [&gt;180s]), pattern of perfusion&#xD;
           (homogenous vs heterogenous, and with or without defect) and degree of venous washout.&#xD;
           After the experimental portion of the procedure the endoscopist will fill out a form&#xD;
           (see attached) to record their impressions of the characteristics of the tumor with&#xD;
           contrast. The images will be saved for further comparison with the CT scan and the&#xD;
           pathology results at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. FNA - Standard of care (if previously decided upon)&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If it was determined after the normal EUS but before the CE-EUS that the patient&#xD;
           needed tissue sampling, the patient will then undergo the sampling in the standard&#xD;
           fashion. If the patient was not to receive tissue sampling, the exam would be over. When&#xD;
           the exam is finished the endoscopist will fill out the remaining questionnaire while the&#xD;
           patient recovers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patient recovery in Endoscopy Suite - Standard of Care&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Patient transport to recovery room - Standard of Care&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. After the patient recovers in the endoscopy room, the patient will be transported&#xD;
                to the recovery room where they will be monitored for at least 30 minutes. The&#xD;
                patient will be informed of the findings of their EUS per standard care. The&#xD;
                patient will not be informed of the findings of CE-EUS as the significance is&#xD;
                unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If an incidental lesion is found on EUS then the patient will undergo the&#xD;
                appropriate follow-up for that lesion as per standard protocol. If an incidental&#xD;
                finding is not apparent on EUS or CT, but happens to show up with the CU-EUS, the&#xD;
                patient will be informed of the finding and its unknown significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Radiologist's Interpretation - Research purposes only&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. After CE-EUS and EUS, the images will be randomly ordered and interpreted by a&#xD;
           radiologist. An excel sheet will be made and the studies will be placed into three&#xD;
           separate blocks in chronological order Participant 1-10, 11-20, and 21-30. In a separate&#xD;
           column a random number generator will order the first block of 1-10's EUS into a random&#xD;
           order for and then again a different random order for CE-EUS. The radiologist will fill&#xD;
           out the attached questionnaire. The Surgeon will be blinded to these readings as they&#xD;
           are for research purposes only and not the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Surgery - Standard of Care with questionnaire after the procedure for research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The surgeon will record their impressions of the vascular involvement of the tumor on&#xD;
           the attached questionnaire after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Pathology review - Standard of care a. If the patient has pathology sent from surgery,&#xD;
           the surgeon will label the vessels encompassed and the pathologist will report whether&#xD;
           there was invasion into the vasculature. We will retrospectively review the pathology&#xD;
           results of the surgery for comparison.&#xD;
