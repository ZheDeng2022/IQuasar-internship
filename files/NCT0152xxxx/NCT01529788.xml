      The objective of the study is to compare the time to onset of Dysport® versus Botox® in the&#xD;
      treatment of lateral orbital rhytids (&quot;crow's feet&quot;). Thirty subjects were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study; specifically 30 male or female patients 18 years or older with moderate to severe&#xD;
      lateral orbital rhytids at maximum contracture. Each patient were randomized to be treated&#xD;
      with Dysport® on one side and Botox® on the other side. Both the injector and patient were&#xD;
      blinded to the injected toxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy endpoints were determined by investigator and subject live assessment of &quot;crow's&#xD;
      feet&quot; at rest and maximum contraction at each visit (every other day for 6 days&#xD;
      post-injection, every month for 9 months following) using a validated 5 point photographic&#xD;
      scale(no wrinkles [0], very fine wrinkles [1], fine wrinkles [2], moderate wrinkles [3] or&#xD;
      severe wrinkles [4]) used in previous studies. A written description of each photograph was&#xD;
      included to help standardize the application of the Photographic Scale.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysport® (Medicis, Scottsdale, AZ) is the formulation (previously known as 52120 and&#xD;
      Reloxin®) of Clostridium botulinum type A (BoNT-A) toxin-hemagglutinin complex to be used in&#xD;
      the United States (US) cosmetic clinical program. It is identical to the Ipsen product&#xD;
      marketed outside the United States and under clinical studies in the United States for&#xD;
      cosmetic and non-cosmetic use. Dysport® injections are used to relax the musculature of the&#xD;
      upper face, reducing the appearance of dynamic rhytids. Previously FDA-approved Botulinum&#xD;
      type A toxins have been utilized in the upper face to treat glabellar rhytids for nearly two&#xD;
      decades. Botox® Cosmetic (Allergan, Irvine, CA), is the first FDA-approved Botulinum toxin&#xD;
      type A to be approved in the United States for the treatment of glabellar rhytids. Its&#xD;
      efficacy and safety have been proven in multiple studies. However, no comparison to onset of&#xD;
      action exists amongst the different BoNT-A products. This study seeks to compare the onset of&#xD;
      action between two BoNT-A products, Dysport® and Botox® Cosmetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation of facial musculature is routinely accomplished for cosmetic use by the use of&#xD;
      Clostridium botulinum type A. Clostridium botulinum type A toxin reduces the recruitment of&#xD;
      specific muscle groups. Many studies have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals&#xD;
      regarding the cosmetic use of this biologic.2-11 Clostridium botulinum in the form of Botox®&#xD;
      Cosmetic is FDA-approved for cosmetic use in the treatment of rhytids in the glabellar&#xD;
      region. Dysport®, the brand name of the Ipsen product marketed outside the United States and&#xD;
      under clinical studies in the United States for cosmetic and non-cosmetic use, and the&#xD;
      current name now used under FDA-approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have demonstrated the effect of botulinum toxin on facial rhytids produced by&#xD;
      underlying coordinated muscle groups. Those of the glabellar area, upper forehead, lower&#xD;
      forehead, periocular and perinasal area are particularly well-documented. Previous reports of&#xD;
      Dysport® and Botox® Cosmetic medications show effective relaxation of glabellar rhytids after&#xD;
      injection.12-17&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse event (AE) seen following the use of Dysport® or Botox® Cosmetic for&#xD;
      the treatment of blepharospasm is ptosis. Some patients have reported diplopia or symptoms&#xD;
      resulting from the spread of effect to mid-facial muscles. Other AEs reported were injection&#xD;
      site reaction, skin rashes, influenza-like symptoms, dry eyes, tearing, bruising, and eyelid&#xD;
      swelling. Reversible ophthalmoplegia has been reported after excessive dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Phase II and III clinical studies have been conducted in North America to determine&#xD;
      the optimal dosing of Dysport® for cosmetic use in the glabellar area, and 50 units of&#xD;
      Dysport® is generally recognized as the optimal dosage for treatment of the glabellar region.&#xD;
      Dysport® to Botox® Cosmetic dosing is generally a 2.5:1 or 3:1 unit for unit conversion. For&#xD;
      the crows feet area, 10 units of Botox® Cosmetic at 4 injection points is used in a similar&#xD;
      fashion, producing comparable results to 25 units of Dysport® at the same four injection&#xD;
      points. What is not clear is whether one of these BoNT-A provide a quicker onset to action.&#xD;
      This study intends to compare onset of action of both of these BoNT-A by daily live&#xD;
      assessments of patients in the week following injection of either Dysport® or Botox®&#xD;
      Cosmetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysport® is the formulation (previously known as 52120 and Reloxin®) of Clostridium botulinum&#xD;
      type A toxin-hemagglutinin complex to be used in the United States (US) cosmetic clinical&#xD;
      program. Reloxin® is identical to Dysport, the brand name of the Ipsen product marketed&#xD;
      outside the United States and under clinical studies in the United States for cosmetic and&#xD;
      non-cosmetic use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysport® will be supplied as a white, lyophilized powder containing 500 units of Clostridium&#xD;
      botulinum type A toxin-hemagglutinin complex, 125 μg human serum albumin, and 2.5 mg of&#xD;
      lactose. Study medication will be reconstituted at the investigational center with sterile&#xD;
      physiological saline for injection without preservative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botox® Cosmetic is supplied as a 100 unit vial of Clostridium botulinum type A exotoxin,&#xD;
      sterilely prepared and vacuum-dried without preservatives. The vial also contains 0.5mg of&#xD;
      albumin (human) and 0.9 mg of sodium chloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE RATIONAL AND RISKS/BENEFITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive Dysport® (25 units) divided among 4 injection points (0.05 mL&#xD;
      [6.25 units] per injection point) in the lateral orbital rhytid on one side and Botox®&#xD;
      Cosmetic (10 units) divided among 4 injection points (0.05mL [2.5 units]) in the lateral&#xD;
      orbital rhytid region on the contralateral side on Day 0 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Study Purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • For study purposes, only one injection session will be performed at Day 0 of the study.&#xD;
      Subsequent follow-up visits will only monitor the effects of the single injection session at&#xD;
      time 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packaging, Labeling, and Storage Active drug (Dysport®) vials, bearing a unique lot number,&#xD;
      will be sent from Ipsen Biopharm Ltd. or Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation. Each vial will&#xD;
      be labeled with a batch/lot number and unique sequential pack number. Beaufour Ipsen&#xD;
      Industrie SAS will perform packaging and labeling of study medication vials in compliance&#xD;
      with all regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unused vials will be returned to Almedical or Medicis for final accounting and destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active drug (Botox® Cosmetic) vials, bearing a unique lot number, will be sent from Allergan&#xD;
      Inc, Irvine CA. Each vial will be labeled with a batch/lot number and unique sequential pack&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medications must be maintained during transit and storage within a temperature range of&#xD;
      2o to 8oC. Until dispensed to the patients, study medication will be stored refrigerated in a&#xD;
      secure location, separated from normal hospital/practice stocks, and accessible only to&#xD;
      authorized personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reconstitution Techniques Following the dilution instructions below, the investigator (or&#xD;
      trained designee) can prepare the individual patient's study dose for injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient's dose will be prepared as an isovolumic (0.2 mL of normal saline) of&#xD;
      BotoxCosmetic or Dysport injection for administration by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug accountability The investigator will be supplied with a sufficient amount of study&#xD;
      medications and confirm receipt of all batches of study medication in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will administer study medication only to patients included in this study and&#xD;
      following the procedures set out in this study protocol. Each dispensing will be documented&#xD;
      in the CRFs and the study medication dispensing log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications and Treatments Any medication the patient takes other than the study&#xD;
      medication specified in the protocol is considered a concomitant medication. This applies to&#xD;
      prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and to herbal supplements, whether taken&#xD;
      systemically or applied topically. In addition, any treatment the patient receives other than&#xD;
      the study medication is considered a concomitant treatment. This applies to cosmetic&#xD;
      treatments of the face and neck area. All concomitant medications and concomitant treatments&#xD;
      must be reco0rded in the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited medication classes and treatments are described under &quot;Exclusion Criteria&quot;. In the&#xD;
      event that a prohibited treatment (e.g. microdermabrasion, Intense Pulse Light,&#xD;
      light-emitting diodes, or radio-frequency) is received, it must be documented on the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the time to onset of action, efficacy and duration of Dysport® versus Botox®&#xD;
      Cosmetic in the treatment of lateral orbital rhytids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and presence of any adverse effects of Dysport® (25 units) versus&#xD;
      Botox® Cosmetic (10 units) in the treatment of lateral orbital rhytids.&#xD;
