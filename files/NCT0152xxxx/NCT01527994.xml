  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for opioid addiction would benefit by the addition of a non-opioid based&#xD;
      treatment medication. Recent behavioral studies have shown that the neurokinin-1 (NK1)&#xD;
      receptor is involved in opioid reward and withdrawal. This study proposes to study a&#xD;
      potential non-opioid treatment, the clinically available, FDA approved, NK1 antagonist&#xD;
      aprepitant, in opioid addicted patients. Based on the unique behavioral and pharmacological&#xD;
      characteristics of opioid addiction, and what is known of the currently employed treatments,&#xD;
      the investigators propose that the therapeutic mechanism of any potential opioid addiction&#xD;
      treatment medication must include the ability to reduce opioid withdrawal. This is of&#xD;
      particular importance during treatment initiation (eg. detoxification). In addition, for&#xD;
      long-term treatment and relapse prevention, it is important to manage drug craving and&#xD;
      inhibit the rewarding effects of opioids if patients do experience a slip. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to study aprepitant using human models of opioid withdrawal, craving&#xD;
      and acute opioid reward and reinforcement. The investigators will also include a&#xD;
      neuro-economics choice procedure paradigm.&#xD;
