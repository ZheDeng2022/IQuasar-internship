  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand whether there is any difference in the&#xD;
      amount of tasimelteon (including its breakdown products) in the blood of individuals with&#xD;
      severe renal impairment compared to individuals who have normal renal function. The safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of tasimelteon will also be assessed throughout this study.&#xD;
