  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a special form of treatment which pinpoints&#xD;
      high doses of radiation directly to cancer. Standard radiation (or photon radiation) is&#xD;
      commonly used for SBRT to treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Proton beam radiation is&#xD;
      a special type of radiation only available at a few institutions in the US and has not been&#xD;
      previously used in SBRT to treat NSCLC. The use of protons for SBRT may improve the accuracy&#xD;
      of the treatment and may help to minimize the dose delivered unnecessarily to healthy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of proton-based&#xD;
      SBRT for early-stage NSCLC located in the periphery of the lung.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo an electronic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) during which three&#xD;
      markers will be placed around their tumor which will guide the delivery of proton beam&#xD;
      radiation to their with more precision and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a CT scan to obtain images to plan radiation treatment. Proton&#xD;
      radiation will be delivered daily (4 or 5 consecutive days) on an outpatient basis at&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of proton radiation subjects will be followed for 5 years. Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to return at 3 months, and then every 3 months until 2 years, and then every 6&#xD;
      months until 5 years. Subjects will receive a chest CT, tumor assessment by CT or PET, chest&#xD;
      x-ray, pulmonary function tests and a physical exam.&#xD;
