    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, comparative interventional human subject trial. Patients&#xD;
      with a chronic venous ulceration of the lower extremity will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;
      These wounds must be recalcitrant to the standard treatment regimen. There are a total of two&#xD;
      arms in this study. One group will be randomly assigned to receive Vacuum Assisted Closure&#xD;
      (V.A.C. or VAC) by means of the ActiV.A.C. + Compression therapy group consisting of the&#xD;
      application of this device along with compression therapy. The other group will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into compression therapy only group. A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled into&#xD;
      this 6 week study. There will be a 2 week run-in period (prior to the onset of the&#xD;
      intervention) to ensure that the wound has not healed greater than 35% prior to intervention&#xD;
      and randomization. Wounds that heal within the 6 week trial period will have an additional&#xD;
      confirmatory visit 2 weeks after healing was identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If within the 6 week intervention period the wound bed is determined to be ready for a Split&#xD;
      Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) or Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue (BAT), the surgery or clinic&#xD;
      application will be scheduled within 4 weeks. Subjects deemed not to be a surgical candidate,&#xD;
      will have Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue (BAT) application in the clinic. This includes&#xD;
      patients who are medically unstable to receive a medical clearance for surgery or otherwise&#xD;
      not a candidate for Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) surgery (e.g. donor site skin is&#xD;
      compromised). During this period between the scheduled STSG surgery or BAT application, the&#xD;
      subjects will continue within the assigned treatment group. A confirmatory visit will also&#xD;
      occur 2 weeks after the application of a Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) or Bio-engineered&#xD;
      Alternative Tissue (BAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with a chronic venous ulceration will be assessed for study eligibility&#xD;
      during their initial clinical evaluation. Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will&#xD;
      be asked to enroll into the study (see Subject Recruitment). Subjects will be asked to sign&#xD;
      the informed consent form and receive a copy of the informed consent.&#xD;

      Application of Devices/Dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual consent forms that are part of the Standard of Care will be utilized per the Center&#xD;
      for Wound Healing at Georgetown University Hospital. All costs associated with the clinic&#xD;
      visit consistent with the Standard of Care will be billed in the customary fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care Wound Therapy (Debridement, Infection Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surface of the venous wound will be washed and rinsed with a wound cleanser at every&#xD;
      visit per Standard of Care. The need for debridement (utilizing a scalpel and/or curette)&#xD;
      will be dependent of the amount of nonviable tissue and/or biofilm detected on the surface of&#xD;
      the wound. The decision to debride will be made by the individual investigator at each visit.&#xD;
      The use of topical enzymatic debriding agents will be at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
      Further, the investigator may use topical antimicrobials as needed. The use of oral&#xD;
      antibiotics will also be at the discretion of the individual investigator. No other wound&#xD;
      healing modalities including topically applied treatments will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System is an FDA approved device for the treatment of venous&#xD;
      ulcerations. The ActiV.A.C.® System will be applied in a customary manner per manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations. Acticoat Flex 7™ will be applied as the contact layer on the wound surface.&#xD;
      Acticoat Flex 7™ is a fenestrated, silver-coated (anti-microbial), knitted polyester material&#xD;
      that is routinely used as a contact layer dressing for chronic wounds. The open cell foam is&#xD;
      then applied over the top of the Acticoat Flex 7™ (cut to shape of the wound). The adherent&#xD;
      transparent occlusive material will be applied over the open cell foam. The tubing is then&#xD;
      attached after cutting a small aperture through the occlusive material. Negative pressure&#xD;
      will be set at 125 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on continuous suction. The sponge and&#xD;
      canister will be replaced 2 times per week. This dressing change will take place once in the&#xD;
      clinic and once by the visiting home nurses. These nurses have had in-service training on the&#xD;
      proper application of negative pressure therapy and have experience with its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profore™ multi-layered compression bandaging system will be utilized. This includes the&#xD;
      application of a contact layer dressing using Acticoat Flex 7™. The compression bandage will&#xD;
      be applied per manufacturer's recommendations. The dressings will be changed 2 times per&#xD;
      week. This dressing change will take place once in the clinic and once by the visiting home&#xD;
      nurses. These nurses have had in-service training on the proper application of the&#xD;
      compressive dressing and have experience with its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care Post Split-Thickness Skin Graft or Application of a Bio-engineered&#xD;
      Alternative Tissue (BAT)-&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of a Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) or Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue&#xD;
      (BAT) will follow the Standard of Care. This Standard of Care applies to both interventional&#xD;
      groups. Split Thickness Skin Grafts will be applied in the operating room after debridement&#xD;
      of the venous wound which will be conducted per Standard Of Care. After the placement of the&#xD;
      Split Thickness Skin Graft onto the wound surface, a nonadherent dressing is placed onto the&#xD;
      graft followed by a silver impregnated dressing layer. The ActiV.A.C.™ open celled foam will&#xD;
      then be placed over the silver impregnated dressing in the customary fashion. Compressive&#xD;
      dressing will then be placed over the ActiV.A.C.™ occlusive material. The postoperative&#xD;
      dressings will be removed within 5-7 days. The wound site will then be redressed with a&#xD;
      nonadherent dressing as the contact layer, silver impregnated dressing, and Profore™. The&#xD;
      application of a BAT will take place in the outpatient clinic. This includes the debridement&#xD;
      of the wound and the application of a Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue (BAT) onto the wound&#xD;
      surface. The dressings include a nonadherent contact layer, followed by a silver impregnated&#xD;
      dressing, and finally a Profore™ compressive dressing.&#xD;
