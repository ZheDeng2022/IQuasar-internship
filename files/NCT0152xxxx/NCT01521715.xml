  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are classified according to Memorial&#xD;
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria in three risk-groups: favourable, intermediate&#xD;
      and poor. To our knowledge there is only one study which examined the poor risk group (Hudes&#xD;
      et al.), which led to the approval of temsirolimus in this population. However temsirolimus&#xD;
      demonstrated a low response rate of 8.6% according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumor (RECIST) criteria and a Progression free Survival (PFS) of 5.5 months and not all&#xD;
      patients are suitable for temsirolimus treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in clinical routine high-risk patients are also treated with multi Tyrosinkinase&#xD;
      Inhibitors (mTKI). To date, a prospective data acquisition and control of effectiveness of a&#xD;
      mTKI-treatment in high-risk patients has not been conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib was recently approved for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      in Europe and the USA. In the pivotal Phase III trial only nine patients in the pazopanib&#xD;
      group were poor risk according to MSKCC risk criteria and no analysis of this subgroup was&#xD;
      performed. Therefore further data in this group of patients with high medical need is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no well-established predictive or prognostic biomarkers in RCC-mTKI&#xD;
      treatment. This is one of the most important scientific questions in this field. In addition&#xD;
      to the clinical endpoints in this study, the comprehensive biomarker program seeks to&#xD;
      evaluate biomarker candidates and will help to learn more about the effects of pazopanib on&#xD;
      the human organism.&#xD;
