  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5-10% of people with asthma do not respond to to standard therapy and are&#xD;
      referred to as having difficult asthma. Evidence shows that this poor response is not always&#xD;
      related to asthma severity and non-adherence to treatment is recognized as a common&#xD;
      underlying problem, in 35% of these patients. Recognising non-adherence in the clinic is&#xD;
      problematic as there is no straightforward objective test to identify it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated up-regulation of FKBP51 gene expression following&#xD;
      treatment with steroids, making it a potential biomarker of steroid exposure. It is therefore&#xD;
      also a potential biomarker of non-adherence to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to assess the feasibility of distinguishing non-adherent subjects who are&#xD;
      by omission steroid naïve from adherent subjects, steroid exposed subjects using FKBP51 gene&#xD;
      expression in sputum and throat swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this the investigators will obtain throat swab and sputum samples from healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, steroid naïve asthmatics and adherent asthmatics on high dose ICS to assess if&#xD;
      FKBP51 gene expression is comparable in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then compare the FKBP51 gene expression response to directly observed&#xD;
      inhaled steroid therapy in steroid naïve, non-adherent and adherent asthmatics. This will&#xD;
      identify if the response in gene expression distinguishes steroid exposed (adherent) from&#xD;
      steroid naïve (non-adherent) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying non-adherence will benefit patients by enabling appropriate tailored management&#xD;
      for non-adherence to enhance treatment effectiveness. It will also identify patients with&#xD;
      therapy resistant asthma who have an unmet need and may benefit from expensive novel&#xD;
      therapies such as Omalizumab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This pilot study will investigate the following groups (n=10 per group):&#xD;

          3. Refractory asthmatics adherent to high dose inhaled steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Non-adherent asthmatics.&#xD;
