      The main objective of our study is to assess, after tooth extraction, the efficacity of PRF&#xD;
      in the prevention of healing delay and of jawbone osteochemonecrosis induced by&#xD;
      bisphosphonates&#xD;

      Scientific Context Bisphosphonates (BP) work by slowing down bone remodelling. They are used&#xD;
      in the management of different types of cancers and for the treatment of osteoporosis. Recent&#xD;
      studies warned that this drug could produce adverse effects on jawbones .In December 2007,&#xD;
      the AFSSAPS (French agency for the Sanitary Security of Health Products) alerted the health&#xD;
      professionals about the risks of spontaneous or induced osteonecrosis following invasive&#xD;
      odontological procedures on patients receiving BP. Prevalence of these osteonecrosis varies&#xD;
      from 6% to 10% after surgical intervention. A healing delay estimated between 20 to 25% of&#xD;
      cases frequently precedes the occurrence of osteochemonecrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the whole , the total rate of all complications amounts to 30%. We are extremely limited&#xD;
      in terms of prevention or treatment of an OCN patient. We intend to study a biological&#xD;
      autologous sediment obtained from a blood sample for its capacity to avoid these&#xD;
      complications supervening. The collection of a coagulum called Platelet Rich Fibrin or PRF&#xD;
      susceptible to provide the essential ingredients for the mucous membrane and the bone healing&#xD;
      is obtained by centrifugation. This biomaterial rich in autologous fibrin is a concentrate of&#xD;
      leukocytes, platelets and a number of factors favouring cicatrisation and immune response.&#xD;
      Clinical applications are already well documented in orthopaedic, thoracic and cardiac&#xD;
      surgeries and, also in dermatology. The use of PRF in dental surgery is more recent.&#xD;
      Literature on this topic is very limited but these new techniques give rise to high hopes.&#xD;
      Since February 2007,thanks to the classification as a medical treatment by the AFSSAPS, the&#xD;
      PRF technique has been authorized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To appraise after dental avulsion the PRF efficiency in preventing delay of&#xD;
      cicatrisation and jawbone osteochemonecrosis induced by BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This efficiency will be assessed by a retroalveolar X-ray performed at each visit. The main&#xD;
      criteria for evaluation is the discovery of cicatrisation delay at week 8 and/or&#xD;
      osteochemonecrosis during the follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studied population: current or previous patients treated with BP and referred for a dental&#xD;
      avulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General experimental procedure: A prospective, longitudinal, multicentric, randomized open&#xD;
      study. Patients will be randomized into two groups: dental avulsion only or dental avulsion&#xD;
      and PRF. For both groups the initial management is surgical (bone curettage + PRF for the PRF&#xD;
      group).The follow up is spread over one year with 10 visits. Each patient will undergo a&#xD;
      clinical and photographic examination with a complete radiological check up(OPT),a standard&#xD;
      biological blood test (blood count with haemogram (NFS) and a thorough calculation of the&#xD;
      quantity of BP administered. The appearance of OCN or of any delay in cicatrisation will be&#xD;
      documented by a histological biopsy, a bacteriological swab test and X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requisite number of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      270 patients are required to validate the expected objectives in this study. Their&#xD;
      recruitment will take place in 4 establishments: Metz-Thionville CHR (Regional Central&#xD;
      Hospital) and three university teaching hospitals (CHU) Dijon, Nancy and Reims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Duration of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated total duration will be 3 years: a 2 year recruitment with a 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and prospects To prove the interest of using PRF as a therapy able to&#xD;
      prevent a delay in cicatrization or an OCN induced by BP.&#xD;
