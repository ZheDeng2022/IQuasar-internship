  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of JNJ-26528398&#xD;
      using an intravenous (IV) endotoxin-induced model of acute, transient inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, single center, double-blind study (neither physician nor participant knows&#xD;
      the treatment that the participant receives). Part 1 is designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (level of drug in the blood) of a dosing regimen of an&#xD;
      investigational drug (JNJ-26528398) prior to its use in Part 2. In Part 1, participants will&#xD;
      be assigned by chance to receive either 3 mg/day JNJ-26528398 (6 participants) or placebo (3&#xD;
      participants) for 7 consecutive days while staying in the clinic for 10 days. Placebo is an&#xD;
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect.&#xD;
      Part 2 is designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory properties of JNJ-26528398 by measuring&#xD;
      markers of inflammation in the blood after intravenous (IV) administration of a substance&#xD;
      (endotoxin) which activates the immune system and temporarily causes flu-like symptoms. In&#xD;
      Part 2, participants will be assigned by chance to receive up to 3 mg/day JNJ-26528398 (6&#xD;
      participants) or placebo (4 participants) for up to 7 consecutive days while staying in the&#xD;
      clinic for 10 days. Endotoxin will be given on the last day of study drug administration.&#xD;
      Participants will remain in bed for at least 6 hours after endotoxin administration and will&#xD;
      be closely monitored by study personnel.&#xD;
