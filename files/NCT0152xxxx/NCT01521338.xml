    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to collect blood and urine samples from people who have&#xD;
      either the R117H type of CF or the non-G551D gating type of CF to be kept for future&#xD;
      research.We will also use some of the collected blood to measure the number of neutrophils.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      -  Blood Collection: Blood will be collected to be kept for research in the future and to&#xD;
           measure the number of blood cells called neutrophils. A small needle will be used to&#xD;
           collect blood from a vein in your arm. About 7-9 teaspoons of blood would be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sweat Collection: Your sweat will be collected with a special sweat collection machine&#xD;
           to test the amount of salt in your sweat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry: You will be asked to take a test that measures how well your lungs are&#xD;
           working. You will be asked to take a deep breath and then blow into a mouthpiece as hard&#xD;
           as possible and for as long as possible. This is the same test that is done when you&#xD;
           come to clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine Collection: Urine will also be collected to be kept for research in the future.&#xD;
           You will be asked to pee in a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical Information: We are asking you to share your medical information with study&#xD;
           researchers. Your medical information will not contain any of your personal&#xD;
           identification information, like your name and address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Induced Sputum Collection: If you say &quot;yes&quot; to collecting a sputum sample, you will be&#xD;
      asked to breathe in a salt water solution to help you cough out sputum. If you cannot breathe&#xD;
      in the salt water solution to cough out sputum for the last study visit, you will be asked to&#xD;
      cough mucus into a cup&#xD;
