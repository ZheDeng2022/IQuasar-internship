    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the potential of carbon monoxide (CO) to decrease&#xD;
      elevated blood pressure in the pulmonary artery. This symptom is seen in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease that causes fatigue, dizziness, and shortness&#xD;
      of breath because the blood vessels that supply the lungs narrow, forcing the heart to work&#xD;
      harder to push blood through. Previous studies in the laboratory have shown that carbon&#xD;
      monoxide has promise in treating these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in this study are being asked to undergo a new type of treatment to improve&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension by breathing CO gas. CO is a colorless, tasteless, odorless&#xD;
      gas usually found in car exhaust or cigarette smoke. It is administered with a continuous&#xD;
      flow of air. Subjects will undergo a screening process during which it will be determined if&#xD;
      they are eligible for the study. After the screening process, if subjects meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for the study, they will begin carbon monoxide treatment through a cushioned mask&#xD;
      that is placed over the nose and mouth. This treatment will last for sixteen weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains an uncommon debilitating and fatal disease, and&#xD;
      is clinically marked by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to&#xD;
      right heart failure and ultimately death. Currently the treatment options available for those&#xD;
      suffering from PAH target cellular dysfunction that leads to constriction of the vasculature.&#xD;
      Although there is some evidence that available therapies have secondary effects on vascular&#xD;
      remodeling there are currently no therapies that target abnormal cell proliferation in PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gaseous molecule with known toxicity and lethality to living&#xD;
      organisms when exposed to high concentrations for sustained periods. However, CO has shown&#xD;
      promise in preclinical models of pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      mammalian cells have the ability to generate endogenous CO primarily through the catalysis of&#xD;
      heme by the heme oxygenase enzymatic system and there is ample evidence demonstrating that CO&#xD;
      behaves as a signaling molecule in cellular and biological processes. Furthermore, CO has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to exert key physiological and protective functions in various models of&#xD;
      tissue inflammation and injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of inhaled CO in subjects with&#xD;
      severe PAH. Over forty subjects with severe PAH despite best available therapy will be&#xD;
      screened from the UIC pulmonary vascular disease clinic, of which twenty subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited for participation in the trial. The trial will consist of an initial screening&#xD;
      period to determine subjects' eligibility for the study. This will be based on a previous&#xD;
      echocardiogram, a six minute walk test and right heart catheterization done as part of&#xD;
      standard care for subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Following the initial&#xD;
      screening, the trial will last sixteen weeks, during which subjects will receive inhaled&#xD;
      carbon monoxide up to three times weekly at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&#xD;
