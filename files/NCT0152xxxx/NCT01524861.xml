  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress (tako-tsubo) cardiomyopathy (SC) is a rapidly reversible form of acute heart failure&#xD;
      reported to be triggered by stressful events and associated with a distinctive left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) contraction pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SC mimics acute coronary syndrome and is accompanied by reversible left ventricular apical&#xD;
      ballooning in the absence of angiographically significant coronary artery stenosis.&#xD;
      sympathetic activity dysfunction appears to play a very important role in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, myocardial scintillography with 123Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) showed&#xD;
      altered captation of the radiotracer in several heart segments. In particular, the apical&#xD;
      myocardium has poor sympathetic innervations and an uptake reduction in MIBG tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hypothesis for this finding could be that the intense discharge of adrenalin, acting on&#xD;
      heart segment with different and abnormal innervation, may produce a transient heart failure&#xD;
      characterized by a particular shape of the left ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While studies have shown that heterogeneous MIBG distribution, decreased MIBG uptake and&#xD;
      increased norepinephrine content were completely prevented by α-lipoic acid or by L-acetyl&#xD;
      carnitine administrations in diabetic cardiomyopathy, no studies have examined the effects of&#xD;
      these therapies on tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this basis, the investigators study will evaluate whether the dysfunction of adrenergic&#xD;
      cardiac innervation, evaluated by MIBG, persist after previous experience of transient&#xD;
      stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, the investigators will assess whether the&#xD;
      medications that restore sympatho-vagal alterations in diabetic cardiomyopathy, such as&#xD;
      α-lipoic acid and L-acetyl carnitine, will improve the adrenergic cardiac innervation, in&#xD;
      patients with SC.&#xD;

      Study design Each patient will be assessed with history and physical examination, 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG, serum troponin, coronary arteriography, and LV angiogram (an average of 6 hours after&#xD;
      admission to the hospital), with echocardiography and 123Imetaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)&#xD;
      myocardial scintillography. All patients were admitted to the cardiac care unit after&#xD;
      coronary angiography. Currently recommended treatments for acute coronary syndromes (ACS),&#xD;
      with therapy directed at relieving myocardial ischemia and preventing thrombotic&#xD;
      complications, were provided to all patients. For each patient, the Charlson score index, 8&#xD;
      which represents the most studied and evaluated comorbidity index, will be calculated. At&#xD;
      discharge, surviving patients with established SC will be managed and followed for 12 month&#xD;
      after the event, as outpatients. At discharge, the surviving patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg/day treatment (ALA group), or L-acetyl carnitine 1000&#xD;
      mg/day treatment (LAC group) or placebo (control group). With regard to the full medical&#xD;
      therapy, the protocol stated that the use of concomitant treatment should be uniform, between&#xD;
      the groups, and according to evidence-based international guidelines for ACS in all patients.&#xD;
      Following discharge, patients were asked to return to our outpatient clinic for follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation at 6 and 12 months after the initial event of SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary Angiography Coronary angiograms at baseline, immediately after percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) will be performed in at least 2 orthogonal views after intracoronary&#xD;
      nitroglycerin. The analyses of all angiographic data will be performed by operators who were&#xD;
      unaware of the study groups (Toshiba, Infinix CS-i).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography LV function will be evaluated in all patients by two-dimensional&#xD;
      echocardiography at admission, 6 and 12 months after the discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIBG imaging. MIBG imaging will be performed in all patients shortly after admission and at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months after the discharge. MIBG will be performed with a The standard protocol for&#xD;
      123I-MIBG cardiac imaging requires that drugs that interfere with 123I-MIBG uptake be&#xD;
      withheld. A comprehensive listing of prescription and over-the-counter drugs that interfere&#xD;
      with 123I-MIBG biodistribution, and the time for which they should be withheld, has been&#xD;
      published . Thyroid uptake of unbound 123I is blocked with 500 mg of potassium perchlorate&#xD;
      given orally 30 min before 123I-MIBG injection. Between 148 MBq and 370 MBq of 123I-MIBG are&#xD;
      injected intravenously at rest. Both planar and SPECT images are acquired 15 min after&#xD;
      injection (early) and 4 h after injection (delayed). A dual head gammacamera (ECAM Siemens,&#xD;
      Erlangen - Germany) equipped with a low-energy - high resolution collimator was used. A 20%&#xD;
      window is usually centered over the 159-keV photopeak of 123I for imaging. Anterior planar&#xD;
      images of the chest are acquired using a 256 x 256 matrix. single photon emission computed&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) images are acquired using a 64 x 64 matrix over 180°, from the right&#xD;
      anterior oblique position to the left posterior oblique position. Planar imaging allows for&#xD;
      global assessment of cardiac innervation, whereas SPECT allows for regional evaluation.&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluations will be performed with a standard protocol previously described.&#xD;
