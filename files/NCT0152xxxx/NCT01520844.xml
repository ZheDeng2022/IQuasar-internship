    <textblock>
      Two cohorts of patients with a phenotype of HIV resistance exist in France. The ANRS CO15 ALT&#xD;
      cohort was set up in 1994. 71 patients were enrolled defined on immunological criteria: CD4 T&#xD;
      cell count above 600/mm3 with a stable or increasing count (positive or zero slopes) on at&#xD;
      least three consecutive exams performed during the last 5 years whatever the viral load was,&#xD;
      with a known HIV infection for at least 8 years. A consortium of research teams has studied&#xD;
      the immunovirological characteristics of these patients. After 16 years of follow-up, 6&#xD;
      patients are still actively followed. The main results have shown the lack of deletion in&#xD;
      viral genes nor any functional viral defects, a small size for the viral reservoir, and&#xD;
      distinctive genetic characteristics of the host (HLA, chemokines) which lead to potent immune&#xD;
      cell responses associated with virus control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANRS CO18 HIV Controller cohort set up in 2009 is stemming from the French National&#xD;
      Observatory of HIV Controllers which was active between 2006 and 2008 (Study ANRS EP36). 152&#xD;
      patients are enrolled who are defined on virological criteria: the last 5 plasmatic viral&#xD;
      loads should be below 400 copies/mL without any antiretroviral treatment, in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients for more than 5 years. A consortium of research teams has studied these patients and&#xD;
      has shown that Controllers are infected with replication-competent HIV, that HIV infects CD4&#xD;
      T cells but that the viral replication in CD4 T cells is fully controlled by CD8 T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the ANRS EP47 VISCONTI study identified 14 patients who had been able to&#xD;
      maintain plasmatic viral loads below 400 copies/ml for more than 7 years in the absence of&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment. Differently from HIV controllers, naïve of antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment, the patients from the VISCONTI study started therapy within ten weeks of primary&#xD;
      infection and kept it for a median of three years before treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      (Post-Treatment Controllers or PTC). The initial analyses revealed important clinical and&#xD;
      immunogenetic differences between post-treatment and natural controllers, suggesting that PTC&#xD;
      were not naturally predispose to control infection and that they succeeded thanks to initial&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention. The mechanisms associated with long-term control in post-treatment&#xD;
      controllers also appear different from the main mechanisms identified in HIV controllers. The&#xD;
      main objective now is to gather in a common cohort patients with a particular resistance to&#xD;
      HIV infection, either with an immunological control (ALT) or a natural (HIV Controllers) or&#xD;
      induced virological control (PTC). The enrolled patients will be the patients already&#xD;
      enrolled in the cohorts CO15 and CO18, the ANRSEP47 VISCONTI study, and new patients. This&#xD;
      will allow common physiopathological studies to precise the mechanisms leading to the virus&#xD;
      control and CD4 homeostasy. A better knowledge of the mechanisms of viral control and immune&#xD;
      response preservation is very important in the setting of vaccine perspectives and in the&#xD;
      perspective of implementing new therapeutic interventions to induce remission of HIV&#xD;
      infection. This cohort will allow common research projects with common funding, a better&#xD;
      visibility both for clinicians who see patients with unusual phenotypes and for international&#xD;
      research. Such a cohort will be unique in the world by its size and the presence of these&#xD;
      three complementary groups of patients. The two main objectives for the &quot; Extreme &quot; cohort&#xD;
      (ANRS CO21 CODEX) are clinical and immunovirological. We wish to precise the impact of a&#xD;
      prolonged untreated HIV infection, to describe the frequency of the &quot;immunological escapes&quot;&#xD;
      (CD4 T cell decrease) or &quot;virological escapes&quot; (permanent or transient viral load increase),&#xD;
      and to identify predictive markers of HIV control. We wish to study the genetic&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients and those of their viruses, the innate and adaptative immune&#xD;
      responses directed against HIV and other viruses, the consequences of inflammation, and the&#xD;
      characteristics of the loss of control.&#xD;
