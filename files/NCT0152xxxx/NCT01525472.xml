  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous epidemiological studies clearly showed the relationship between the excessive growth&#xD;
      of visceral adipose tissue and risk of developing insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      other cardiovascular risk factors. However, the mechanisms contributing to the deleterious&#xD;
      role of visceral adipose tissue remain to be elucidated. Several observations suggest that&#xD;
      adipose tissue depots exhibit distinct metabolic and secretory capacities according to their&#xD;
      locations. We have recently shown that visceral fat depots display higher immuno-inflammatory&#xD;
      cells infiltration than that of subcutaneous fat. In addition, the endothelial cells of&#xD;
      visceral compared to subcutaneous adipose tissues express a pro-inflammatory phenotype and&#xD;
      several markers related to aging. Finally, we have shown that visceral adipocyte-derived&#xD;
      secretions promote the endothelial cell senescence in an extent higher than subcutaneous&#xD;
      adipocyte-derived products. These data suggest that senescence 1) might be a phenomenon&#xD;
      related to the location and therefore the microenvironment of adipose tissue and 2) might be&#xD;
      responsible for an abnormal activation of proinflammatory response, favouring the development&#xD;
      of metabolic and secretory dysfunction of adipose tissue in obesity. Our working hypothesis,&#xD;
      based on these observations, is that the visceral adipose tissue provides a microenvironment&#xD;
      that promotes accelerated aging. This senescence may be responsible for the establishment of&#xD;
      an inflammatory reaction, alteration of the metabolic activity and adipocyte differentiation&#xD;
      capacity of progenitor cells leading to the development of obesity associated diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is a descriptive cross-sectional pathophysiological study .The aims are&#xD;
      1) to better define the process of senescence in human adipose tissue, 2) to precise the&#xD;
      mechanisms and 3) to analyse the cellular and functional consequences of aging on&#xD;
      inflammation, adipose tissue development and metabolism. 200 morbidly obese candidates for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery will be studied. The collection of clinical and laboratory data and the&#xD;
      collection of biological samples (plasma, blood cells and subcutaneous and visceral adipose&#xD;
      tissues) will be made at the inclusion and during surgery (obesity center, Hôpital Louis&#xD;
      Mourier). Analyses of adipose tissue will be performed at INSERM U1048 and will focus on in&#xD;
      vitro approaches of the cells of the adipose tissues (mature adipocytes, endothelial cells,&#xD;
      progenitor cells and immuno-inflammatory cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will permit to better understand the pathogenicity associated with the excessive&#xD;
      growth of visceral adipose tissue and may reveal new therapeutic targets to limit&#xD;
      obesity-associated pathologies.&#xD;

      Main objective: The main objectives are 1) to compare the state of senescence of subcutaneous&#xD;
      versus visceral adipose tissues and 2) to define the senescent cell populations in&#xD;
      subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues in morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Secondary objectives are 1) to precise whether the state of senescence&#xD;
      is attributable to microenvironment, 2) to determine the impact of aging on cellular&#xD;
      function, 3) to establish a link between the state of senescence of subcutaneous and visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissues and obesity-associated pathologies.&#xD;
