  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II trial evaluating the antitumor activity and safety of the&#xD;
      oral Histone Deacetylase (HDAC)-Inhibitor LBH589. The treatment consists of 20 mg LBH589&#xD;
      three times a week in patients with chemo-refractory HDAC overexpressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach, esophagogastric junction or lower esophagus (Barrett&#xD;
      carcinoma). One cycle lasts 21 days. A total of 28 patients will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
      In patients experiencing LBH589-related toxicity requiring treatment rest or dose reduction&#xD;
      dose may be reduced. Subsequent dose adjustment will be permitted based on outcome. Treatment&#xD;
      will continue until disease progression or intolerable adverse events. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      patients will be followed-up for one year.&#xD;
