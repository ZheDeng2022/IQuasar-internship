  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients present with both a chronic disease and depression, family physicians agree&#xD;
      that treatment and follow-up is more complicated and that patients' health suffers as a&#xD;
      result. Programs to help depressed patients learn skills to help manage their mood have been&#xD;
      developed (depression self-care), using workbooks and audio-visual materials. The programs&#xD;
      show promise, but little is known about how these self-care programs may work for patients&#xD;
      with depression and chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are proposing a study to evaluate a depression self-care programme for patients&#xD;
      age 40 and over who have at least mild depressive symptoms as well as a chronic physical&#xD;
      illness and who are treated primarily by a family physician. All study participants (250&#xD;
      patients selected from different family medicine clinics in Montreal) will receive a package&#xD;
      of depression self-care materials which include the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, developed&#xD;
      in Canada, available in French and English, and used in several provinces in depression&#xD;
      self-management programs; a video on depression; a mood monitoring tool; an information&#xD;
      booklet to give to family members; and information on additional resources (books, internet&#xD;
      materials, and local community groups). The participants will be assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups randomly (like a coin toss): one group will receive the materials only, the other&#xD;
      group will receive the materials as well as regular telephone support for up to 6 months by a&#xD;
      trained coach who will answer any questions the participant may have on the materials they&#xD;
      are working with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who agree to be in the study will be interviewed three times: once at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study, then at 3 months and finally at 6 months. Patients' depression scores&#xD;
      will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the self-care programme with and without&#xD;
      the support of the coach. Researchers will also look at the effect that self-care may have on&#xD;
      use and costs of health services, and whether engaging in self-care has an impact on health&#xD;
      behaviours (like exercise, taking medications correctly and smoking and alcohol consumption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be anonymous; any information that could potentially allow identification&#xD;
      of a participant will be removed.&#xD;

&#xD;
      1. PRINCIPAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES We propose to conduct an RCT to measure the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a telephone-based supported self-care intervention for depression in&#xD;
      comparison to an unsupported self-care intervention among community-dwelling persons aged 40&#xD;
      and over with depression (diagnoses and symptoms) and comorbid chronic physical illnesses in&#xD;
      primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a pragmatic trial that will be relevant to health policy. In keeping&#xD;
      with this, we will endeavor to make the methods of recruitment and intervention delivery&#xD;
      similar to those that would be used in &quot;real-life&quot; implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be assessed at the end of the intervention (6 months). Because the effects&#xD;
      of the intervention on healthcare services utilization may not be seen within this time&#xD;
      window, we will assess utilization and costs at both 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question: What is the effectiveness of the supported versus unsupported&#xD;
      intervention as evaluated by the severity of depressive symptoms at 6 month follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What effects does the intervention have on the following (at 6 months unless otherwise&#xD;
           specified): self-reported utilization of health-related services; utilization and costs&#xD;
           of physician and hospital services at 12 months; general health status; depression&#xD;
           diagnoses and treatments; severity of anxiety symptoms; activation and self-efficacy;&#xD;
           health behaviors (exercise, social and leisure-time activities, smoking and alcohol&#xD;
           consumption, medication adherence); self-care tool use; and patient satisfaction with&#xD;
           the intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are the effects of the intervention on the primary depression outcome mediated by the&#xD;
           following: use of the self-care tools; activation; self-efficacy; or health behaviors?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does the effectiveness of the intervention vary by the following baseline variables:&#xD;
           patient sociodemographics (age, sex, level of education, family income, language of&#xD;
           intervention); physical health (physical function, multimorbidity, chronic pain); mental&#xD;
           health (severity of depression, comorbid anxiety, alcohol abuse, mild cognitive&#xD;
           impairment); level of activation; level of self-efficacy; type of primary care clinic;&#xD;
           FP involvement in study; family involvement in chronic disease self-care; date of&#xD;
           randomization, and time elapsed between screening and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are patient perceptions of the support for self-care of their family member(s) or&#xD;
           friend(s) who provide the most tangible and emotional support?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are family physician (FP) perceptions of the self-care intervention(s) and the&#xD;
           information provided to them on the patients' depressive symptoms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED? This trial proposes an intervention designed&#xD;
      to be applicable within Canadian healthcare, as modeled in Quebec urban areas. The study will&#xD;
      use some aspects of the participatory research model and integrated knowledge translation,&#xD;
      including input and feedback from national and local stakeholders in aging and mental health.&#xD;
      An Advisory Committee has been formed, with members from various stakeholder groups: Canadian&#xD;
      Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health, Action on Mental Illness Quebec. Input will be sought&#xD;
      from these individuals and groups prior to, during, and after the trial, with the goal of&#xD;
      optimizing use of the results in a collaboratively-developed strategic action plan for&#xD;
      implementation of results for submission to stakeholders at national, provincial, and&#xD;
      regional levels across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. TRIAL DESIGN The trial design adheres to the CONSORT criteria, the CONSORT extension for&#xD;
      pragmatic trials, and guidelines for behavioral trials. The trial is a single blind,&#xD;
      individually randomized, pragmatic trial of a telephone-based supported self-care&#xD;
      intervention for depression compared with an unsupported self-care intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from a range of different Montreal-area primary care settings&#xD;
      (including family medicine groups, CLSCs, solo and small group practices). In keeping with&#xD;
      the pragmatic nature of this trial, screening/referral options will be flexible and may&#xD;
      include: 1) waiting room or other screening methods; and 2) provider referral. [We will be&#xD;
      conducting focus groups in September with FPs who participated in the pilot study to discuss&#xD;
      other screening methods.] Eligible subjects will be invited to a face-to-face meeting with a&#xD;
      research assistant at which the study will be presented and the patient will be invited to&#xD;
      sign the consent form. The baseline interview will follow informed consent, and the patient&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups. Follow-up interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      at 3 and 6 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.1 Recruitment of Clinics A purposive, convenience sample of Montreal area family medicine&#xD;
      clinics within practical travel distance from the St. Mary's Research Centre will be created,&#xD;
      aiming for representation from the following common types of practice: CLSC, family medicine&#xD;
      group, other group, and solo practice. Clinic directors and / or individual doctors will be&#xD;
      approached to determine their interest in participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.2 Patient Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Described elsewhere in this record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.3 Patient Recruitment Patients will be recruited in 4 steps: 1) referral of potentially&#xD;
      eligible patients; 2) screening interview; 3) recruitment meeting; and 4) randomization.&#xD;
      (Contact principal investigator for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Described elsewhere in this record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 RANDOMIZATION METHOD We will randomize patients individually rather than in clusters&#xD;
      (e.g, by FP). Based on our experience in the pilot study, we expect minimum contamination&#xD;
      among the 2 intervention groups, and very little interaction between patients and FPs&#xD;
      regarding the intervention. Patients will be randomized to the experimental and control&#xD;
      interventions using randomization stratified by clinic/FP and method of recruitment&#xD;
      (screening vs referral). Within each stratum, randomization sequence was created using random&#xD;
      block sizes of 2 or 4 with an allocation ratio of 1:1. SAS software version 9.3 was used to&#xD;
      generate and randomly assign patients to one of the two groups. Electronic or telephone-based&#xD;
      randomization methods are not appropriate in the context of a face-to-face interview, often&#xD;
      in the patient's home. Therefore, the planned randomization assignment will be provided in a&#xD;
      sealed, opaque envelope to the RA who administers the baseline interview following the&#xD;
      patient's written consent. The sealed envelope will be opened after completion of the&#xD;
      interview, and the patient will be provided with the appropriate package of materials (either&#xD;
      in person, or by sealed courier delivery). If the patient does not consent, or if the&#xD;
      interview is never completed (patient does not present to the meeting, or is never available&#xD;
      for a phone interview), the envelope will be used for the next patient within the same&#xD;
      stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 PREVENTION OF BIAS It will not be possible to blind subjects or their FPs to study group&#xD;
      assignment. However, the patient assessments will be blinded as far as possible: follow-up&#xD;
      interviewers will not be informed of the subject's study group, and will have no contact with&#xD;
      either coaches or FPs. Interviewers will also specifically request that patients do not&#xD;
      divulge information on the type of intervention they received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 TREATMENT DURATION The supported intervention will be delivered for up to 6 months from&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 FREQUENCY, DURATION AND METHOD OF FOLLOW-UP Participants will be followed up at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after enrolment using telephone interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Described elsewhere in this record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9 PATIENT MEASURES We will collect patient data on the following 5 occasions: 1) at step 1&#xD;
      identification of interested patients; 2) at step 2 telephone screening for eligibility; 3)&#xD;
      at the baseline interview; and 4-5) at 3- and 6-month telephone follow-up interviews.&#xD;
      (Contact the principal investigator for details on baseline, outcome and process of care&#xD;
      measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.9.1 Adherence to the coaching intervention In the supported self-care arm, patient&#xD;
      compliance with the intervention protocol will be examined using data from the coach logs and&#xD;
      the 3 and 6-month summaries. Coaches will record all contacts attempted and completed,&#xD;
      duration of completed contacts, topics covered, and patient progress with self-care&#xD;
      intervention, the tools they recommended and problems that arose. At 3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      randomization, coaches will summarize for each patient the specific tools recommended by the&#xD;
      coach to date, and which tools the patient used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also measure coach adherence to the intervention protocol. Coach contacts will be&#xD;
      recorded for qualitative analysis and for monitoring the fidelity of the intervention. The&#xD;
      coach trainer will be responsible for monitoring the integrity of these interventions by&#xD;
      rating of a 20% random sample of recorded sessions (2 sessions per patient), using a scale&#xD;
      developed for the study. A random sample of 50 assessments will be selected, to include a&#xD;
      total of five calls for each of the following types of call: 1)1st call, 2) 2nd call, 3)&#xD;
      interim call, 4) penultimate, 5) last call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.10 QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION AND SAMPLE SIZE During the 6 month follow-up interview,&#xD;
      patients are asked open-ended questions about what they liked most about the self-care&#xD;
      program and what could be improved. A sample of 40 patients' audio-recorded interviews will&#xD;
      be selected to be transcribed and analyzed to help explain how process factors may have&#xD;
      impacted the effectiveness of the intervention and will also help to guide future research&#xD;
      and practice by informing the development of a framework for outlining processes that support&#xD;
      positive self- care experiences. Using the principle of segmentation, two groups will&#xD;
      comprise patients who were satisfied with the intervention (one group for each type of&#xD;
      intervention) and two groups will comprise patients who were not satisfied with the&#xD;
      intervention (one group for each intervention type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-month time point, participants will be invited to designate the family member or&#xD;
      friend most involved with management of their chronic physical illness and/or mood. If the&#xD;
      patient consents, we will collect this person's contact information. We will mail identified&#xD;
      family members an invitation to participate in a structured interview, with 2 copies of the&#xD;
      consent form, along with a pre-paid return envelope. One reminder mailing will be sent 3&#xD;
      weeks after the first mailing. A research assistant will follow-up by telephone to schedule a&#xD;
      1 hour telephone interview with family members who return the consent form. We estimate that&#xD;
      ~30 patients will provide their family member's contact information and that ~10 family&#xD;
      members will consent to participate. As we are currently preparing the next phases of this&#xD;
      research program, these structured interviews will allow researchers to explore the ways in&#xD;
      which family members and friends could be a source of support for people using depression&#xD;
      self-care tools. Consent forms and interview guides will be approved by the ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.11 SAMPLE SIZE FOR QUANTITATIVE DATA Our target sample size is 100 for each of the 2 arms.&#xD;
      Assuming a 20% attrition rate over 6 months, we will recruit 125 patients into each arm, for&#xD;
      a total sample size of 250. This sample size of n=100 in each group at 6 months, will give us&#xD;
      sufficient power (&gt;80%) to detect, at the 5% level of significance (2-sided test), an effect&#xD;
      size of at least 0.4 for the primary outcome PHQ-9, as well as for other continuous scale&#xD;
      outcomes. Cohen considers such an effect size as small to medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the binary secondary outcomes (e.g. major depression diagnoses at 6 months), in the&#xD;
      &quot;worst case scenario&quot; (i.e. one of the two proportions is equal to 50%), a sample size of 100&#xD;
      patients in each group will have 60% power to detect a difference of 15% between the two&#xD;
      proportions at the 5% level of significance. The power will increase as the two proportions&#xD;
      are assumed to be lower than 50%. Based on the pilot study, most of these proportions are&#xD;
      likely to vary between 10% and 30%. For example in the pilot study, the proportion of major&#xD;
      depression at 6 month was 23%, the power to detect the same difference of 15% will then be&#xD;
      66%. The proportion of heavy use of alcohol at 6 month is 13%, the power to detect the same&#xD;
      difference of 15% will then be 77%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculations are conservative in that stratification (i.e. randomization&#xD;
      within clinics and method of recruitment (screening or referral) and the longitudinal aspect&#xD;
      of the design (repeated measurements at baseline, 3 and 6 months) are not taken into account.&#xD;
      However, at the analysis stage both aspects will be taken into account; as a result, power to&#xD;
      detect differences should be higher than computed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.12 PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE AND LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP The sample of 250 will be&#xD;
      recruited over a period of 8 months, an average of 7-8 patients per week. We estimate a&#xD;
      maximum attrition rate of 20% for the primary outcome. In our pilot study, the attrition rate&#xD;
      at 6 months was 55/63 (13%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.13 PROPOSED QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of missing data on measures All the validated scores will be pro-rated, providing&#xD;
      that the percentage of missing items does not exceed 25%. When more than 25% of the items are&#xD;
      missing, the score will be treated as missing. The SF-12 score involves more complex scoring,&#xD;
      a simple imputation algorithm will be applied in cases of missing data. When the percentage&#xD;
      of missing values of a categorical variable does not exceed 1%, imputation by modal values&#xD;
      will be performed. For a categorical variable for which the percentage of missing values&#xD;
      exceed 1% , 'missing' will be defined as an additional level of the variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question: What is the effectiveness of the supported versus unsupported&#xD;
      intervention as evaluated in terms of the severity of depressive symptoms at 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up? After the direct comparison of the two study groups, we will investigate possible&#xD;
      clinically relevant baseline imbalances in prespecified important covariates. In the event of&#xD;
      baseline imbalance, the salient patient characteristics will be included as covariates in the&#xD;
      appropriate regression model. This is consistent with the recommendations in the CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines and in particular, see Altman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome PHQ-9 (depression severity at 6 months) is a continuous variable measured&#xD;
      at the patient level, and patients are clustered within clinics and FP. The comparison&#xD;
      between treatment and control groups will be based on the linear mixed model; this will allow&#xD;
      us to model the multi-level structure of the RCT by treating the clinic and the FP effects as&#xD;
      random effects (random intercepts).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis of the characteristics of the drop-outs (at 3 and 6 months) will be&#xD;
      performed to investigate the mechanism of missing values, in an attempt to assess the missing&#xD;
      at random (MAR) hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of this primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat (ITT). However, a strict ITT&#xD;
      analysis may be hard to achieve: for example, preliminary data suggest that a considerable&#xD;
      proportion of patients drop out before the 6 month assessment (about 20 % in each group). Our&#xD;
      primary method to address the missing data problem will be the Inverse Probability Weighting&#xD;
      (IPW) approach. To implement IWP, we plan to use all available outcome information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our choice of the IPW approach is based on several reasons. Of these the most important one&#xD;
      in our situation is that IPW requires fewer assumptions. Indeed, IPW requires a model for the&#xD;
      probability that an individual is a complete case; in contrast, MI requires a model for the&#xD;
      distribution of the missing data given the observed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sensitivity analyses will be conducted: 1) Analysis of available data only (completed&#xD;
      information of the outcome variable at 6 month) 2) MI using available patient information;&#xD;
      results across 10 imputed data sets will be combined. Note that MI will give unbiased results&#xD;
      if the MAR hypothesis is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both IPW and MI are based on a predictive model with study group and other patient&#xD;
      characteristics as predictors. We will develop this model using the baseline patient&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that in the results we will report the actual p-values of the tests and a confidence&#xD;
      interval of 95% for the effect sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research question 1: What effects does the intervention have on the following&#xD;
      outcomes (at 6 months unless otherwise specified): self-reported utilization of&#xD;
      health-related services;utilization and costs of physician and hospital services at 12&#xD;
      months; general health status; depression diagnoses and treatments; severity of anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms; activation and self-efficacy; health behaviors (exercise, social and leisure-time&#xD;
      activities, smoking and alcohol consumption, medication adherence); self-care tool use; and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with the intervention? We have selected 5 main secondary outcomes. For&#xD;
      these analyses we will consider complete data only as the main approach for handling missing&#xD;
      data. Baseline imbalance will be handled as for the primary outcome, adjusting for the same&#xD;
      list of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the overall costs outcomes, we will work with total costs over a period of 12 months. To&#xD;
      compare treatment and control groups, we will use regression models that take account of the&#xD;
      skewed and censored nature of cost data (generalized linear models, conditional density&#xD;
      estimation, and hurdle models, among others). All the other main secondary outcome (all&#xD;
      continuous) will be analyzed the same way as the primary outcome (linear mixed model).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the remaining secondary outcomes we will adopt an exploratory, flexible approach. For&#xD;
      example, we will consider a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of these outcomes in search of&#xD;
      clinically interpretable dimensions, and define scores which can then be used as summary&#xD;
      (secondary) outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research question 2: Are the effects of the intervention on the primary depression&#xD;
      outcome mediated by the following: use of the self-care tools; activation; self-efficacy; or&#xD;
      health behaviors? Using approaches developed by Van der Weele and colleagues we will estimate&#xD;
      the extent to which overall effects on the primary outcome are mediated through changes in&#xD;
      the mediating variables of interest. These methods, based on potential outcomes&#xD;
      (counterfactual) theory and inverse probability weighted marginal structural models, allow&#xD;
      estimation of the mediating effects while preserving the structure of the randomization.&#xD;
      Briefly, a marginal structural model is built for the outcome as a function of each mediator&#xD;
      and randomization. The controlled direct effect of the randomized intervention, i.e., the&#xD;
      effect of intervention holding the mediator(s) constant, is easily estimable from this model,&#xD;
      while under further assumptions the so-called &quot;natural&quot; indirect effect, i.e., the effect&#xD;
      mediated through individual mediators, can also be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research question 3: Does the effectiveness of the intervention vary by the&#xD;
      following baseline variables: patient sociodemographics (age, sex, level of education, family&#xD;
      income, language of intervention); physical health (physical function, multimorbidity,&#xD;
      chronic pain); mental health (severity of depression, comorbid anxiety, alcohol abuse, mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment); level of activation;level of self-efficacy;type of primary care&#xD;
      clinic; FP involvement in study; family involvement in chronic disease self-care; date of&#xD;
      randomization, and time elapsed between screening and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this analysis we will consider complete data only as the main approach for handling&#xD;
      missing data. Also, baseline imbalance will be handled as for the primary outcome, adjusting&#xD;
      for the same list of variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pre-specified modifier variables, which we consider of primary importance, we will&#xD;
      perform subgroup analyses. The remaining covariates will be introduced in the regressions and&#xD;
      the corresponding interaction effects with treatment will be tested. For covariates with&#xD;
      significant (p&lt; 0.1) interactions we will conduct stratified analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.14 PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSES No interim analyses of outcomes will be conducted.&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of experimental and control groups (age, sex, PHQ-9 score, chronic&#xD;
      diseases) will be monitored, in order to detect and rectify possible important imbalances&#xD;
      occurring by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.15 PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES The role of 5 selected modifiers will be examined in sub-group&#xD;
      analyses: age, level of education, depression diagnosis, cognitive impairment, and perceived&#xD;
      family support with chronic disease self-care. [Despite the importance of sex as a modifier,&#xD;
      we do not plan sub-group analysis by sex because of the small sample of men enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Age We hypothesize that the supported intervention will be equally effective as the&#xD;
      unsupported intervention in the following age groups: 40-54, 55-64, 65+. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is no evidence to date that age per se modifies the effectiveness of self-care&#xD;
      interventions. Age was not associated with improvement in PHQ-9 scores in our pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the supported intervention will be more effective than the unsupported&#xD;
      intervention among participants with the following patient characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression diagnosis Prior research on differences in effectiveness of depression&#xD;
           self-care intervention suggests that a diagnosis of major depression will be associated&#xD;
           with greater effectiveness of the intervention. The metaanalysis by Gellatly found that&#xD;
           RCTs with patients with pre-existing depression (vs those at-risk) was associated with&#xD;
           greater effectiveness. Jerant studied an intervention to enhance patient self-efficacy&#xD;
           for self-managing chronic illness, and found that individuals with more depressive&#xD;
           symptoms were more likely to experience self-efficacy gains. We will analyze the&#xD;
           following sub-groups: major depression, minor depression, neither.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher level of education We hypothesize that participants with higher education will&#xD;
           benefit more from the intervention. People with less education have higher rates of&#xD;
           discontinuation of self-care interventions. A nurse-administered minimal psychological&#xD;
           intervention for depressive symptoms among diabetics found that the intervention was&#xD;
           effective only in higher-educated persons. We will analyze the following education&#xD;
           sub-groups: university, high school, less than high school)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of cognitive impairment People with cognitive impairment may have greater&#xD;
           difficulty in understanding the self-care materials. In our pilot study, greater&#xD;
           cognitive impairment was associated with less improvement in the PHQ-9 outcome. We will&#xD;
           examine participants with a BOMC score of 5-9 (versus less than 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater perceived family support with chronic disease self-care. We hypothesize that&#xD;
           participants who receive more frequent help from family or friends with chronic disease&#xD;
           self-care will benefit more from the intervention. Studies of self-management for&#xD;
           chronic physical illnesses have found a positive relationship between social support and&#xD;
           self-care, especially for diabetes, and for dietary behavior. In our pilot study, we&#xD;
           found that patients' use of the behavioral tools was positively associated with&#xD;
           patients' report of support from family/friends for the depression intervention, and&#xD;
           with family/friend reports of assistance with instrumental activities of daily living.&#xD;
           We propose to examine 3 sub-groups defined by the mean frequency per week of assistance&#xD;
           in 5 self-care activities (healthy eating, exercise, medications, symptom monitoring,&#xD;
           medical care): 1) never, 2) rarely- some days, and 3) many days - almost every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional potential modifiers will be analyzed using exploratory techniques, as described in&#xD;
      section 2.15, secondary research question 3: sex, family income, language of intervention,&#xD;
      physical function (PCS), multimorbidity, chronic pain, severity of depression symptoms (PHQ-9&#xD;
      score), comorbid anxiety, alcohol abuse, level of activation; level of self-efficacy; type of&#xD;
      primary care clinic; FP involvement in study; date of randomization, and time elapsed between&#xD;
      screening and randomization.&#xD;

&#xD;
      3.1 ETHICAL ISSUES In accordance with relevant guidelines in the Tri-Council Policy Statement&#xD;
      and in the Plan d'action ministériel en éthique de la recherche et en intégrité scientifique,&#xD;
      study protocols, consent procedures and forms will be submitted to institutional research&#xD;
      ethics committees. Patient identifiers will be removed before entering into databases for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff and trainees who have patient contact will be trained to identify potential risks to&#xD;
      study participants, including suicidality, severe depression and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suicidality. Depressed patients may bring up suicidal thoughts during research interviews&#xD;
      (including the screening interview) or during coach contacts. Staff (interviewers or coaches)&#xD;
      are trained to follow-up in those cases and determine whether the patient has any intent or&#xD;
      plan to act on these thoughts. If a patient expresses any intent to act on suicidal thoughts,&#xD;
      staff will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ask whether we may inform the FP of the subject's feelings. If the subject consents, the&#xD;
           FP office will be contacted immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ask whether the subject would like to speak with the study psychologist (see 3.1). If&#xD;
           the subject consents, subject's contact information will be provided to the study&#xD;
           psychologist who will follow-up within 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All subjects will be provided with the telephone numbers of the emergency psychiatry&#xD;
           nurse at St. Mary's Hospital and will be provided with the number of Suicide Action&#xD;
           Montreal's hotline. Subjects will be encouraged to use these numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with suicidal plans identified at the screening interview will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. Subjects with suicidal plans during follow-up will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe depression. The following protocol will be followed for subjects who have severe&#xD;
      depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score of 20 or more) at enrollment into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. subjects will be informed that they have severe depressive symptoms and will be&#xD;
           encouraged to see their family doctor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if the subject consents, the FP will be informed and an appointment arranged; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the subject will be provided with the telephone number of the St. Mary's Hospital&#xD;
           Emergency Psychiatry Nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment. For subjects with cognitive impairment during the telephone screening&#xD;
      interview, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ask whether we may inform the FP of the subject's possible memory problems. If the subject&#xD;
      consents, the FP office will be notified.&#xD;
