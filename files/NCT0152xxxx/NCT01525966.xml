  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel before surgery work in&#xD;
      treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is inflammatory or has spread from&#xD;
      where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the&#xD;
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test the hypothesis that carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulation) therapy will demonstrate a promising neoadjuvant pathologic&#xD;
      complete response (pCR) rate for eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To test the hypothesis that carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel therapy will demonstrate a&#xD;
      promising Symmans 0-1 pathological response rate for eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I To evaluate the overall survival and event-free survival of eligible patients treated with&#xD;
      carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the toxicities and tolerance of carboplatin + nab-paclitaxel therapy in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the role of laboratory correlates in response, toxicity and survival&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To procure tissue and perform analysis of gene and protein expression profiles of&#xD;
      pre-treatment primary tumor (estimated success rate: 80%) and residual tumors (25%) and lymph&#xD;
      nodes including the study of tumor niche (50%), studying sequential assessment of cellular&#xD;
      characteristics and gene and protein expression profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify specific mutations in tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in comparison to&#xD;
      adjacent tissue and germ line DNA procured prior to, during, and subsequent to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and to detect/measure, as feasible, the presence of such mutations in&#xD;
      fragmented circulating DNA from plasma, and to correlate these mutations with the&#xD;
      presence/characteristics of circulating tumor cells in order to identify prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive indicators of persisting/relapsed disease and targets for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess ribonucleic acid (RNA) (using Mammaprint/Blueprint and 44,000 Agilent platform&#xD;
      gene array), (micro) miRNA and exosome and protein profiles in tumor, adjacent tissue and&#xD;
      plasma prior to, during, and at completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in order to establish&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive indicators of outcome, markers of persistent/relapsed disease, and&#xD;
      targets for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To analyze tumor DNA and genomic DNA from plasma by microarray and reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to assess copy numbers/single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms (SNP)/genomic polymorphisms in genes for the purposes of establishing&#xD;
      prognostic and predictive indicators of outcomes; markers of persistence/relapse disease,&#xD;
      drug resistance, and drug metabolism; and targets of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess the prognostic and predictive value of conventional pathological features&#xD;
      (stage, estrogen and progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor [HER-2]&#xD;
      status, presence of lymphovascular invasion, high grade tumor status) in comparison to such&#xD;
      values derived from the molecular approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To procure tumor from the primary and definitive surgical specimen for the purpose of&#xD;
      establishing breast cancer stem cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To procure blood samples for the purpose of identifying and characterizing circulating&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes once weekly.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 4 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 1 year and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
