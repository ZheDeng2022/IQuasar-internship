  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine abuse and addiction are widespread and is causing increasing pressures on&#xD;
      social, public health and criminal justice systems worldwide. Some of the risk for developing&#xD;
      addiction may be genetic. Identifying specific genotypes and understanding their interactions&#xD;
      with the environment may help predict who is at risk for developing a disease. In this study&#xD;
      the investigators are evaluating the contribution of differences in one genotype - called&#xD;
      CYP2D6 to the removal of methamphetamine from the body. Methamphetamine is removed from the&#xD;
      body by special enzymes in the liver. One of these enzymes is called Cytochrome P450 2D6. The&#xD;
      activity of 2D6 is genetically determined. Some people have no active 2D6 whereas in others&#xD;
      2D6 is very active. One group of scientists found that people with low 2D6 activity were less&#xD;
      likely to become methamphetamine addicts. In this study the investigators will determine the&#xD;
      activity of your 2D6 by looking at the CYP2D6 genotype. If low levels of 2D6 decrease the&#xD;
      risk of methamphetamine addiction it may be because there is less of the chemicals (called&#xD;
      metabolites) made by 2D6. The first step in the metabolism (the process of removal of drugs&#xD;
      from the body) of methamphetamine by 2D6 is conversion of methamphetamine to amphetamine and&#xD;
      para-hydroxymethamphetamine. 2D6 then converts these to inactive chemicals. In addition to&#xD;
      determining your genotype, the investigators are interested in the relationship of genotype&#xD;
      with the methamphetamine metabolism. Thus, as part of this study, you will be given a modest&#xD;
      oral dose of 5 milligrams of methamphetamine. After receiving the methamphetamine you will&#xD;
      need to collect your urine for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of genetic variation in CYP2D6 on the&#xD;
      disposition of methamphetamine in the human body as well as its pharmacologic effects to&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is healthy, as judged by a responsible physician, with no clinically&#xD;
             significant abnormality identified on the laboratory or medical evaluation, including&#xD;
             12-lead ECG, at screening. A subject with a clinical laboratory or laboratory&#xD;
             parameter outside the reference range (adjusted for age, if appropriate), may be&#xD;
             included only if the Investigator considers that the abnormal finding does not pose&#xD;
             additional risk and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, aged 18-55 years inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body weight over 50kg (110 lbs) and body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 30 kg/m2&#xD;
             inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have normal cardiac function including normal blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have normal renal function as evident by a creatinine clearance &gt;70 ml/min and normal&#xD;
             serum creatinine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol at screening or prior to the start&#xD;
             of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a clinical history of current alcohol or illicit drug use which, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with&#xD;
             the dosing schedule and protocol-specified evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active Psychiatric disease: DSM-IV diagnosis of a current alcohol, opiate, or sedative&#xD;
             hypnotic dependence disorder requiring medical detoxification, history of&#xD;
             decompensated schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder; Severe&#xD;
             mania, hypomania, agitated behaviour, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress&#xD;
             disorder within the past 90 days; presence of suicidal behavior two years prior to&#xD;
             enrolment or suicidal intent within the past 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research&#xD;
             trial within 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of&#xD;
             any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of any prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, herbal and dietary&#xD;
             supplements within seven days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential CYP2D6 enzyme&#xD;
             inhibitor) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             mediation, unless, in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor, the medication will&#xD;
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal&#xD;
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the&#xD;
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Examples of conditions&#xD;
             that could interfere with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility include&#xD;
             gastrointestinal bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy, small bowel resection,&#xD;
             vagotomy, malabsorption, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal or urinary&#xD;
             obstruction, or celiac sprue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of hypersensitivity to amphetamine-type drugs, or history of drug or other&#xD;
             allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible, contraindicates their&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy or fertile women without adequate means of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any other medical or psychosocial condition that would preclude useful, safe or&#xD;
             consistent participation.&#xD;
