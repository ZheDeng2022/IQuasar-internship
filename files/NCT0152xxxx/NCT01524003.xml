    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a community based preventive healthcare&#xD;
      model using cervical cancer screening as the target medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first conduct 2 pilot studies to refine their preventive healthcare&#xD;
      model based on the principles of community based participatory research (1000 participants).&#xD;
      The investigators will then apply the model to screen 9000 women for cervical cancer over a&#xD;
      period of 7-9 days. This 10,000 patient trial will explore the ability of a community to&#xD;
      conduct their own screening program to identify who needs medical intervention based on&#xD;
      self-collection and centralized high-throughput low cost human papillomavirus (HPV) testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening and prevention programs in general, throughout the world, suffer from major cost&#xD;
      constraints, poor participation, lost to follow-up, and concerns about sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 15 years the investigators have been studying self-collection as a way to reach&#xD;
      the medically underserved for cervical cancer screening. In a recent 10,000 patient&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial they demonstrated that a self-collected sample is equivalent in&#xD;
      accuracy to a physician obtained endocervical specimen and can be done less expensively and&#xD;
      with higher throughput than all current and proposed accurate testing modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the majority of the worlds' medically underserved now living in middle income countries,&#xD;
      it is no longer necessary to think small, slow, and simple, with poor quality control. It is&#xD;
      totally achievable with self-collection to have centralized, high-throughput, low cost per&#xD;
      case processing, and to reach millions of women in a short period of time. Again, these&#xD;
      concepts need not be restricted to the medically underserved, but the clarity of this&#xD;
      paradigm is a realistic solution for a critical developing world healthcare problem. In&#xD;
      addition, we now have solid media specimen transport cards, thereby avoiding the logistics of&#xD;
      dealing with personal use of alcohol-based liquids, concerns about exposure temperature, and&#xD;
      ease of transportation. Using PCR-based technologies in a self-collection algorithm has the&#xD;
      ability to not only make the testing highly sensitive, but help to address another key issue&#xD;
      and that is how to manage the positives. In the investigators' proposed centralized model,&#xD;
      since the primary output of the testing provides genotyping a reasonable option for tailoring&#xD;
      the management of the positives would exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now the need is to focus on developing the models that will enable them to efficiently place&#xD;
      the existing technologies next to the women who need them the most. Developing community&#xD;
      based systems that remove the identification of who is abnormal from the medical model, will&#xD;
      markedly affect the cost of preventive healthcare. In addition with community involvement in&#xD;
      the design of the program, it is expected that their participation in the &quot;campaigns&quot; and&#xD;
      follow-up will be significantly improved. Sustainability also becomes a simpler problem&#xD;
      because of the &quot;campaign&quot; or &quot;event&quot; type model (possibly once/year, or per every 5-10years).&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the patient recruitment and loss to follow up observed in&#xD;
      screening programs conducted in the developing world, have their roots in asking large&#xD;
      numbers of patients, who are not presently ill, or symptomatic, to travel long distances and&#xD;
      interrupt their daily life. The investigators believe that a much more effective program can&#xD;
      be designed by the community, and using a self-collection model will ensure greater&#xD;
      recruitment and participation, minimizing loss to follow up. This project CHICAPS is designed&#xD;
      to further develop the community based screening model and in addition randomize treatment&#xD;
      options to explore a technology more suited to rural environments&#xD;

In the Experimental arm VIA will be done to determine acceptability for cryotherapy [R/O high-grade CIN too large for cryotherapy (usually 3-4 quadrant disease) or cancer].
