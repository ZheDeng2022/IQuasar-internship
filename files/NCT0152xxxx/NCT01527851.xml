      Introduction: Currently, bariatric surgery appears to be the most effective treatment to&#xD;
      improve the health of morbidly obese population. However, the massive weight loss induced by&#xD;
      this intervention can create excess loose skin in various parts of the body contributing to&#xD;
      the feeling of failure in their desire to feel better in some patients. Several studies show&#xD;
      that people are once again disappointed and dissatisfied with their body appearance due to&#xD;
      the mass of unsightly loose skin that disrupts their quality of life. However, very few&#xD;
      studies have focused on the barriers that this excess skin could create in everyday physical&#xD;
      activity. The aim of the investigators pilot study is to assess the impact of excess skin on&#xD;
      the practice of physical activity in women who underwent bariatric surgery and evaluate if&#xD;
      there is a relationship between physical activity and the level and location of excess skin.&#xD;
      Also, the investigators will explore, the benefits of plastic surgery in patients who had&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: About twenty women who underwent bariatric surgery and a dozen who had&#xD;
      subsequent plastic surgery will be included in this pilot study. Anthropometry, weight loss&#xD;
      post bariatric and plastic surgery, motivational stage on the practice of physical activity,&#xD;
      usual practice of physical activity, functional and physical ability, perceived benefits and&#xD;
      barriers of physical activity, self-esteem and quality of life will be assessed. After&#xD;
      analyzing the results, a group discussion will be established to further evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of excess skin on the practice of physical activity. The evaluation will be identical for&#xD;
      monitoring the effects of plastic surgery but the discussion group will also address the&#xD;
      benefits and satisfaction related to plastic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Excess skin could be a barrier to physical activity by limiting the&#xD;
      functional and physical capacity. Thus, plastic surgery could improve the practice of&#xD;
      physical activity with a direct improvement of functional discomfort, the subjects'&#xD;
      motivation to be physically active, perceived benefits and barriers to physical activity,&#xD;
      self-esteem and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Issue project: This pilot project will generate data that will allow us, depending on the&#xD;
      relevance of the results, to continue the investigators investigation with a larger cohort.&#xD;
