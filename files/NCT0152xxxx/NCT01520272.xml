      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide and in&#xD;
      Uganda. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). A vaccine against HPV was offered for&#xD;
      all 10-year-old girls in the Nakasongola district of Uganda from October 1, 2008, to October&#xD;
      31, 2009. The HPV vaccine requires three doses; however, some girls received only one or two&#xD;
      doses. Researchers want to compare vaccine immunogenicity in girls who received all three&#xD;
      doses with those who had only one or two doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine the immunogenicity (antibody levels) of girls in Uganda who received only one,&#xD;
      two or three doses of HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Girls who will be at least 12 years old by October 31, 2011, and had at least one dose&#xD;
           of the HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will come from the Nakasongola district of Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and answer questions about their medical history&#xD;
           and HPV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a single blood sample for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment and vaccines will not be provided as part of this study. Girls who did not&#xD;
           receive all three doses of the HPV vaccine will be given information about the nearest&#xD;
           health center. Health centers will provide the missed doses free of charge.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experience with HPV vaccine implementation in low resource settings has suggested that&#xD;
      high vaccine coverage for all three doses could be achieved provided programs are planned&#xD;
      well and have full and complementary components in place. However, some locations experienced&#xD;
      substantial rates of partially vaccinated girls, those who received only one or two doses.&#xD;
      From the vaccine trial data published thus far, we know that the vaccines produce high levels&#xD;
      of type-specific anti-HPV antibodies which begin to stabilize past 24 months&#xD;
      post-vaccination. Without an immune correlate of protection, it is difficult to know whether&#xD;
      girls who received one or two vaccine doses will still experience the same benefit of&#xD;
      protection from HPV infection as those who received all three doses of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data from a trial of a two-dose regimen of vaccination of girls aged 9-13 years in&#xD;
      Vancouver, Canada have suggested that the immune response of girls who received only two&#xD;
      doses was non-inferior both to that of girls who received 3 doses and to that of adult women&#xD;
      aged 16-25 years who also received 3 doses. In a complementary study in Guanacaste, Costa&#xD;
      Rica, vaccine efficacy (defined as 12-month vaccine type-specific infection persistence)&#xD;
      among adult women who received either one or two doses of HPV vaccine as a part of the Phase&#xD;
      IIb clinical trials of Cervarix (GSK) was similar to women who received all three vaccines&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study would provide additional insight into the immunogenicity of HPV vaccine&#xD;
      among partially vaccinated girls in Uganda, which could add supportive evidence in an African&#xD;
      adolescent population (currently not represented in any clinical studies of HPV vaccines) of&#xD;
      the immunological implications of receiving less than 3 doses of HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether the anti-HPV 16 and/or anti-HPV-18 immune responses elicited by the&#xD;
      bivalent vaccine for girls who received one dose and those who received two doses are similar&#xD;
      at greater than or equal to 24 months (after last dose) to girls who received all three doses&#xD;
      of bivalent HPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls who received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine, 12-20 years of old, in apparent good&#xD;
      general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional immunogenicity study with three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - 200 girls who received only one dose of HPV vaccine as a part of the PATH-UNEPI HPV&#xD;
      vaccine demonstration project;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - 200 girls who received only two doses of HPV vaccine as a part of the PATH-UNEPI&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPV vaccine demonstration project; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - 200 girls who received all three doses of HPV vaccine as a part of the PATH-UNEPI&#xD;
      HPV vaccine demonstration project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll girls (by group) within one district of Uganda from an HPV vaccine&#xD;
      registry maintained by the district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody level will be parameterized as the geometric mean titre of serum antibody to HPV&#xD;
      types 16 and/or 18 at greater than or equal to 24 months after last dose of vaccine. Titres&#xD;
      will be measured using the polyclonal Direct VLP ELISA.&#xD;
