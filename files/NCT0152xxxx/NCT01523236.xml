  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical equivalence of the test formulation&#xD;
      of mometasone furoate anhydrous 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray (manufactured by Teva&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and distributed by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA) to the marketed&#xD;
      formulation Nasonex速 (mometasone furoate monohydrate) nasal spray, 50 mcg/actuation&#xD;
      (Schering) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the efficacy of both the test and reference nasal sprays will be compared to a&#xD;
      placebo nasal spray and safety will be compared.&#xD;

             method the patient must have been on their regimen for at least 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented positive allergic skin test, performed within the previous 12 months, to&#xD;

             enrolled in the randomized, active treatment period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Under 12 years of age.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who suffer from chronic signs and symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis&#xD;
             (PAR) should be excluded from the study unless the Investigator assesses that the&#xD;
             patient's current signs and symptoms are a clear exacerbation of Seasonal Allergic&#xD;
             Rhinitis (SAR) rather than chronic PAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who suffer only from perennial allergic rhinitis of seasonal allergic&#xD;

             pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A total score of less than 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) or a&#xD;
             score less than 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; or a score less than 2 for all 3 remaining&#xD;
             symptoms. Any patient who meets the minimum rTNSS requirements at the start of the&#xD;
