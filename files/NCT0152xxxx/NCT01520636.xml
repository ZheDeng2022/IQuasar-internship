    <textblock>
      This study is designed to observe the respective effects of 2 types of physiotherapy early&#xD;
      after a cerebral stroke. The hypothesis is that an intensive physiotherapy early delivered&#xD;
      (Day 2 to D15) after a stroke could induce faster motor control recovery than a conservative&#xD;
      physiotherapy aiming at preventing complications.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intensive and active physiotherapy delivered as soon as D2 post stroke could induce faster&#xD;
      motor control recovery and autonomy than could do an usual conservative treatment aiming at&#xD;
      preventing complications. The benefits could be a shortened inpatient stay (both in stroke&#xD;
      unit and rehabilitation centre), a reduction of the secondary complications with a cut in of&#xD;
      the total cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare two strategies of physiotherapy on the evolution of motor control recovery during&#xD;
      the first 3 months post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare two strategies of physiotherapy on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor control deficiency on D15, D30, D45, M3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total length of stay as inpatient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomy on D15, D30, D45, M3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of unexpected events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life on M3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Living place on M3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -First criterion : Evolution of the motor control deficiency assessed by the Fugl Meyer (FM)&#xD;
      scale modified by LINDMARK between day 0 and month 3.-Secondary criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor control deficiency assessed by the FM scale on D15, D30, D45, M3 and by the time&#xD;
           requested before being able to walk 10 meters without human assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total length of stay as inpatient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomy assessed by the Functional Independence Measure (motor subscale) on D30 and M3&#xD;
           and by the Rankin scale on D15, D30, D45, M3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unexpected events recorded on D30 and M3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale on M3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Residency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a &quot;Zelen&quot;, single-blinded, randomised, controlled, multicentric trial aiming at&#xD;
      comparing intensive physiotherapy after a stroke with the usually more conservative&#xD;
      physiotherapy provided. Treatment is applied from the inclusion to the end of the stroke unit&#xD;
      stay or until D15 post stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: daily physiotherapy aiming at preventing complications, going with the patient&#xD;
           progress capacities, passive mobilisation, sitting as soon as possible, walking when&#xD;
           possible, respiratory physiotherapy. 15-20 minutes total per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: physiotherapy as described above added to verticalisation as soon as possible;&#xD;
           active, intense and repeated motor exercises for limbs and trunk with all the available&#xD;
           techniques. 60 minutes total per day.&#xD;
