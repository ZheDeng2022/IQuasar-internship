  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK573719 is a high-affinity specific muscarinic receptor (mAChR) antagonist which is being&#xD;
      developed for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The long&#xD;
      duration of action of GSK573719, when administered via inhalation to humans supports the&#xD;
      potential for use as a long acting bronchodilator.This is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, 5 period cross-over study in healthy male and female volunteers. The&#xD;
      study will measure lung function after single inhaled doses from two configurations of the&#xD;
      Novel Dry Powder Inhaler. Key assessments will include clinical relevant PD parameters: sGaw,&#xD;
      FEV1&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male or female as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based&#xD;
             on a medical evaluation including [medical history, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
             tests and cardiac monitoring]. A subject with a clinical significant abnormality or&#xD;
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may&#xD;
             be included only if the Investigator believes that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method.]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  until 10 days after last dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Response to ipratropium bromide defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  an increase in sGaw of ≥25% over pre-dose baseline at 2 h following 80μg&#xD;
                  ipratropium bromide; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a documented increase in sGaw of ≥25% over pre-dose baseline at 2 h following&#xD;
                  inhalation of 80 μg of ipratropium bromide within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are able to use the Novel DPI satisfactorily&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who are capable of giving written informed consent, have signed and dated&#xD;
