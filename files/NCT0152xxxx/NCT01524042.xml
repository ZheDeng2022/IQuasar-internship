  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently colonoscopy has gained importance as screening programs for colon polyp, cancer and&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease in the United States and other countries. The number of&#xD;
      colonoscopy performed has been increased year by year. To make an increased compliance with&#xD;
      colonoscopy in both screening and clinical surveillance programs, consideration of anxiety,&#xD;
      shame and satisfaction in examinee is regarded to be important. During colonoscopy patients&#xD;
      wear conventional single pants where there is no hole for insertion of scope. Patients take&#xD;
      off the conventional single pants below the buttocks and expose their buttocks and perianal&#xD;
      area during colonoscopy. Exposing perianal and perineal area during colonoscopy can make&#xD;
      patients feel shameful and anxious and diminish satisfaction of colonoscopy. Recently&#xD;
      considering the factors affecting satisfaction has been regarded to be important because&#xD;
      patient satisfaction could be one of the quality indicators for colonoscopy. To diminish&#xD;
      shame and anxiety by exposing perianal and perineal area of patients wearing conventional&#xD;
      single pants during colonoscopy, we developed novel double pants with a hole in inner pants.&#xD;
      Novel double pants are composed of double fabrics from hip to thigh and single fabric under&#xD;
      the thigh such as common pants. In the inner pants of double pants, there is a hole for&#xD;
      insertion of scope. The hole is 25 cm wide and 15 cm long. The outer pants are same as&#xD;
      conventional single pants. If the patients dropped outer pants below hips, only hip and&#xD;
      perianal area are exposed through the hole (25cm*15 cm) for insertion of scope without&#xD;
      dropping inner pants. Therefore novel double pants minimized the exposed area of hips than&#xD;
      conventional single pants because hips are exposed only the hole of inner pants. Smaller&#xD;
      exposed area of hips by novel double pants can minimized the shame and anxiety by diminishing&#xD;
      exposing perianal and perineal area during colonoscopy. Therefore advantage of novel double&#xD;
      pants is decreasing shame and anxiety and increasing satisfaction by minimizing the exposed&#xD;
      area of perianal and perineal area compared with conventional single pants. This study is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled study. The investigators will survey the examinees older than 20 years&#xD;
      who performed the colonoscopy at Severance Hospital from Feb. 2012 to Jul. 2012 to compare&#xD;
      the effect on the satisfaction, shame, and anxiety during colonoscopy between the two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty examinees will wear conventional single pants and another eighty examinees will wear&#xD;
      novel double pants randomly. Examinees who underwent colonoscopy within 3 years, with history&#xD;
      of bowel resection surgery, cancer, colostomy or ileostomy, psychotic disease such as&#xD;
      depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive disorder, treated with emergent colonoscopic&#xD;
      procedure, and pregnant or lactating women, an illiterate person and foreigners will be&#xD;
      excluded. Questionnaires before colonoscopy are educational background, martial status,&#xD;
      indication of colonoscopy, examinee's preference of doctor's gender, and State-trait anxiety&#xD;
      level of examinee. Questionnaires after colonoscopy are shame and trait anxiety level, and&#xD;
      satisfaction of examinee during colonoscopy. We will also investigate colonoscopy specific&#xD;
      quality Indicators such as the ASA status (American society of anesthesiologist's physical&#xD;
      status), complications, procedure success. Finally we will compare the difference of&#xD;
      satisfaction, shame, and anxiety during colonoscopy between examinees wearing novel double&#xD;
      pants and conventional single pants&#xD;
