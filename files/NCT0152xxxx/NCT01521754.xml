      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational registry is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness, safety&#xD;
      and performance of market-released Medtronic Neuromodulation products for Deep Brain&#xD;
      Stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. In addition, healthcare resource&#xD;
      use and patient reported outcomes, such as health related quality of life will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and Duration Patients meeting the eligibility criteria for the implantation of the&#xD;
      Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy for Epilepsy will be included in the registry. Approximately 200&#xD;
      patients meeting all the eligibility criteria will be prospectively enrolled over an expected&#xD;
      two-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 centers, mainly from across Europe will participate. Center selection could&#xD;
      also be extended to sites outside Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will perform follow-up visits according to clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration of the registry will be approximately 49 months (24 months for the&#xD;
      enrollment phase, 24 months for follow-up visits and 1 month for final data collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fulfilling the criteria of labeling indications of Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy for Epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with diagnosis of refractory epilepsy as defined by 1981 ILAE (International&#xD;
           League Against Epilepsy) classification, who have been implanted or will be implanted&#xD;
           with Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy for Epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For both cohorts, completed at least two full consecutive months diary information on&#xD;
           seizure type and frequency prior to DBS implant (seizure type should be classified at&#xD;
           least as simple partial, complex partial, partial evolving to secondarily generalized&#xD;
           seizures, and generalized). In regard to the prospective cohort, the patient will be&#xD;
           conditionally enrolled at the enrolment visit, and the criterion will be reassessed at&#xD;
           the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient or patient's legally authorized representative able to understand and to provide&#xD;
           written informed consent and/or authorization for access to and use of health&#xD;
           information, as required by an institution's IRB/MEC or local law and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incomplete and/or unreliable patient seizure diary based on the physician's judgment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent drug, surgery&#xD;
           and/or device study that may confound the results of this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the physician has determined that a patient meets all of the eligibility criteria, the&#xD;
      physician will enroll the patient in the registry by completing the Patient Informed Consent&#xD;
      or Data Release Consent Form process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, patients will be followed at least for 24 months or until their&#xD;
      discontinuation from the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will occur according to clinical practice, approximately every 6 months&#xD;
      after the first visit post-implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and/or device events will be reported as they occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will occur at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Visits (over a period of minimum two years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following follow-up visits are scheduled according to the clinical practice,&#xD;
      approximately every 6 months for at least two years or till the closure of the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate the change in seizure rate&#xD;
      from baseline over 2 years following DBS implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the demographics of the population undergoing Medtronic® DBS™ Therapy&#xD;
           for Epilepsy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess adverse events related to the device, implant procedure, and/or therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize seizure type and severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize co-treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the change in health-related quality of life following DBS by means of&#xD;
           QOLIE-31 (Quality of life in epilepsy-31) and SF-36 (Short-form 36).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in depression score over time Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess use of health care resources specifically associated with epilepsy following&#xD;
           DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize DBS implant technique and device/feature utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the factors that better predict the response level of the DBS therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification The purpose of the registry is essentially observational and&#xD;
      exploratory; hence no sample size calculation was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)&#xD;
