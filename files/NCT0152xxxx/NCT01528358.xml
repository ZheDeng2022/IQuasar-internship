      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the acute phase of early illness, tissue oxygen saturation and vascular occlusion&#xD;
           test (VOT) are important adjuncts in differentiating severe critical illness requiring&#xD;
           ICU admission from patients benefiting from less aggressive therapies (non-ICU&#xD;
           admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An early feature of severe sepsis is abnormal microcirculatory vasoreactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Microvascular reactivity can be measured by means of vascular occlusion test (VOT) using&#xD;
           non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure tissue Oxygen saturation&#xD;
           (StO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Microvascular reactivity is significantly deranged in patients with early severe sepsis&#xD;
           and is quantifiably different from non-septic critically ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Other measures of microcirculatory perfusion ie. sublingual orthogonal polarization&#xD;
           spectral (OPS) video microscopy, are abnormal and will directionally correlate with VOT&#xD;
           and StO2 in severe sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. In severely septic patients response to therapy can be assessed by VOT and StO2&#xD;
           monitoring and will correlate with prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A management protocol incorporating VOT and StO2 monitoring in addition to conventional&#xD;
           hemodynamic and biochemical parameters as a guide to therapy will result in improved&#xD;
           outcomes in severely septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate the use of a non-invasive near infrared light (NIR) device in&#xD;
      conjunction with brief arm compression to measure the microcirculation in critically ill&#xD;
      patients. It is know that in patients with overwhelming infections, their blood vessels do&#xD;
      not respond normally and the NIR device can help measure how abnormal their blood vessels&#xD;
      are. This type of testing is non-invasive and can be performed repeatedly without harm to the&#xD;
      patient and may provide an earlier way to determine whether they have overwhelming sepsis and&#xD;
      also may help to optimize the treatments they receive and better tailor their treatments to&#xD;
      the degree of blood vessel abnormalities that are found. If our hypotheses are correct, this&#xD;
      simple non-invasive test could provide a very rapid means of assessing patients that could be&#xD;
      done more safely and quickly than some of the current methods. This would have an important&#xD;
      effect to enhance patient safety and improve outcomes in such critically ill patients.&#xD;

      Project Overview: This project is focused on the early diagnosis and management of septic&#xD;
      shock using tissue near infrared spectroscopy (tNIRS) for continuous and non-invasive&#xD;
      assessment of microcirculatory vasoreactivity as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in&#xD;
      critically ill patients. A novel aspect of this study is that point of entry of patients will&#xD;
      be via the Critical Care Outreach Team (CCOT) which will ensure patients are assessed in the&#xD;
      early phases of their disease prior to and co-incident with admission to Critical Care Unit&#xD;
      (CCU). The investigators will employ tNIRS to assess peripheral tissue oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (StO2) in all patients assessed by CCOT (n = 1031 patients in 2009) and in addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will employ the NIRS vascular occlusion test (VOT) using a brief episode of&#xD;
      forearm ischemia to quantify microvascular (dys)function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to CCU via CCOT (n = 230 patients in 2009) will have StO2 monitored and&#xD;
      VOT assessment sequentially throughout the course of their critical illness. Biomarkers to&#xD;
      assess severity of illness, inflammatory processes and microcirculatory reactivity will be&#xD;
      obtained, and in a subset of patients (n = 30), correlations between these parameters and&#xD;
      other indices of microvascular perfusion using sublingual orthogonal polarization spectral&#xD;
      (OPS) imaging videomicroscopy will be sought. As it is estimated that 20-30% of CCOT&#xD;
      admissions are for sepsis (n = 40-60), the inclusion of other critically ill non-septic&#xD;
      patients will enable discrimination of various parameters of VOT to be contrasted between&#xD;
      groups to determine relative diagnostic and prognostic significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the diagnostic utility of tNIRS StO2 and VOT in early assessment of critically&#xD;
           ill patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether significant and pathognomonic differences exist in StO2 and indices&#xD;
           of VOT between septic patients versus other non-septic critically ill patients and&#xD;
           healthy age matched volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether correlations exist between biomarkers of inflammation and&#xD;
           vasoreactivity and measures of StO2 and VOT in severely septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether incorporation of StO2 and VOT into a treatment protocol can&#xD;
           positively impact clinical outcomes in critically ill patients.&#xD;

Number of survivors, length of ICU stay, SOFA and Apache scores on discharge from ICU will be compared between patients with either use or non-use of VOT-derived reperfusion slope which will be employed as a guide to monitor adequacy of tissue microcirculation and response to therapy.</description>
