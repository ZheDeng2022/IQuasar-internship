  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been a very successful surgical intervention in the&#xD;
      geriatric population. Numerous studies have reported good mid and long term results of THA in&#xD;
      patients over the age of 60 years. With the reported high success rate of this surgical&#xD;
      intervention, the THA surgery is being performed in younger patients who have significant&#xD;
      joint disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical trial, using a randomized blinded design, was undertaken to compare the functional&#xD;
      outcome of 1) alumina heads/alumina liners, and 2) alumina head/Crossfire polyethylene liners&#xD;
      in patients 60 years of age or younger with non-inflammatory arthritis of the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were assessed preoperatively and at one and five years postoperatively. Ten-year&#xD;
      follow-up is currently underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary measures were the&#xD;
      RAND-12, as well as measurement of complication and revision rates. The patient's demand on&#xD;
      the implant as calculated by the patient's age, weight, health status and activity level was&#xD;
      also measured.&#xD;
