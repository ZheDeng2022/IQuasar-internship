  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This preliminary study will examine the feasibility of conducting a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      of Yoga Based Psychotherapy (YBPG) and standard care mental health (SCMH) treatment compared&#xD;
      to SCMH for children ages 8-12 years who have a history of neglect and maltreatment (trauma).&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to inform the method and sample size for a larger randomized trial&#xD;
      to study the effect of YMBT with SCMH compared to SCMH in improving child regulation of&#xD;
      behavior, emotions, and daily functioning. Children who have experienced trauma, including&#xD;
      sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, exposure to community or domestic violence,&#xD;
      parental substance abuse, mental health disorders, and incarceration are at risk to have&#xD;
      dysregulation of mood, emotions and behavior. In addition, children exposed to neglect and&#xD;
      trauma may have poor attachment to caregivers and poor peer relations. It is hypothesized the&#xD;
      using YBPG as an adjunct to SCMH may improve children's regulation of emotion and behavior.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred fifty children (ages 8-12 years) treated at the Center for Child and Family&#xD;
      Traumatic Stress (CCTFS) for at least 3 months and their caregivers (total n=300 individuals)&#xD;
      will be eligible to be enrolled in this randomized preliminary study if CCTFS Clinician&#xD;
      identifies that the child is continuing to have difficulty with behavior and emotional&#xD;
      regulation. Children will be invited to participate in the study. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained following explanation of the study. If the child meets both Stage 1 and 2 Screening&#xD;
      criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child receives a T-score &gt; 60 on any of the Child Behavior Checklist Parent Rating Scales,&#xD;
      and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      KKFC Psychiatric evaluation (Child Psychiatrist will be masked to study status). Child&#xD;
      Psychiatrist evaluation will determine whether medication is appropriate for the child and&#xD;
      whether the child/family environment is stable and safe. If the child is deemed appropriate&#xD;
      for psychotropic medications, other than stimulants, the child will not be eligible for the&#xD;
      study (due to the possible changes in one of the outcome measures, heart rate variability,&#xD;
      that will likely result from use of psychotropic medications that can not be stopped 24 hours&#xD;
      prior to study evaluation). [Children on stimulant medication will be asked to stop&#xD;
      medication one day prior to study evaluation and of the day of evaluation.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child will be randomized to Group 1: to continue Standard Care Mental Health (SCMH)&#xD;
      treatment or Group 2: Standard Mental Health and Yoga Based Psychotherapy Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with T-scores lower than 60 will continue in Standard Mental Health Treatment.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place over three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A block randomization design (block size 4) will be used to ensure roughly equal distribution&#xD;
      of YBPG and SCMH patients over the enrollment time. An opaque bag with four colored marbles&#xD;
      (two red, two black) will be utilized for the randomization. The child, in the presence of&#xD;
      the parent, will be asked to select a colored marble out of the bag; the marbles will be&#xD;
      replaced after enrollment of sets of 4 children. Depending on the color of the marble the&#xD;
      child will be assigned to either YBPG or SCMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children randomized to YBPG must be cleared by their pediatric care provider (Appendix 1).&#xD;
      Children in YBPG group will participate in YBPG as outlined in Appendix 2; participation&#xD;
      duration is expected to be 12 weeks. Parents in the YBPG group will participate in a&#xD;
      psychoeducational intervention to learn about YBPG and support the child's practice of YBPG.&#xD;
      Following 12 weeks of YBPG children will resume SCMH if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be assessed following informed consent, at 3 months (following YBPG or 6 months&#xD;
      of SCMH), 6 months, and 12 months following randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline EKG and respiratory rate (RR) will be measured for 5 minutes. Heart rate&#xD;
           variability will be measured using a data collection system that will take EKG and&#xD;
           respiratory rate recordings for 5 minutes, and analyzed using the CardioBatch software&#xD;
           from the Brain Body Center of the University of Illinois. The Trier Social Stress Test&#xD;
           13 for children will be administered. The Trier consists of the research assistant&#xD;
           telling the child the beginning of a story and having the child complete the story in 5&#xD;
           minutes. Then the child is asked to perform math problems for 5 minutes. EKG and&#xD;
           respiratory rate (RR) will be re-measured for 10 minutes after the Trier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 14;15. The CBCL is a written measure designed to assess&#xD;
           behavioral and emotional problems in children. There are several forms including a&#xD;
           version for children from 1 1/2 to 5 years and a version for children 6-18 years 14;15.&#xD;
           There are also Parent, Youth, and Teacher rating forms. The Youth Behavior Rating will&#xD;
           be used to obtain a self-report of the child's behavioral and emotional status. Each&#xD;
           version yields standard scores (Mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) to assess behavior&#xD;
           problems in several specific areas; these scores are also combined into three global&#xD;
           scores: an Internalizing score for emotional problems, an Externalizing score for&#xD;
           behavior problems, and a Total problem score. The Parent Questionnaire form of the CBCL&#xD;
           will be used. The CBCL is expected to take 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (TSCYC) and Trauma Symptom Checklist for&#xD;
           Children (TSCC) 16: The TSCYC is a 90-item parent report of children's symptoms&#xD;
           associated with traumatic events (e.g., child abuse, peer assaults, community violence).&#xD;
           The TSCYC is normed and standardized as a trauma measure for children ages three to 12&#xD;
           years and includes measurements of validity of parent report and norms for the number of&#xD;
           waking hours the parent spends with the child during an average week. The instrument&#xD;
           includes nine subscales, Post-traumatic Stress-Intrusion, Post-traumatic&#xD;
           Stress-Avoidance, Post-traumatic Stress-Arousal, Post-traumatic Stress-Total, Sexual&#xD;
           Concerns, Dissociation, Anxiety, Depression, and Anger/Aggression. The TSCYC is expected&#xD;
           to take 15-20 minutes to complete. Alpha values on a multi-site clinical sample of&#xD;
           traumatized children ranged from 0.81 for Sexual Concerns to 0.93 for Post-traumatic&#xD;
           Stress-Total17. The TSCC is a 54 item child questionnaire that has Anxiety, Depression,&#xD;
           Anger, Posttraumatic Stress, Dissociation, and Sexual Concerns. Alpha values range from&#xD;
           0.77 for Sexual Concerns to 0.89 for Anger. The TSCC is expected to take 10-15 minutes&#xD;
           to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Behavior Emotional Rating Scale (BERS-2) 18: The BERS-2 is a 52-item Likert scale that&#xD;
           measures the children emotional and behaviors strengths through parent, child, and&#xD;
           observer report. The BERS-2 is designed for children ages 5 years to 18 years and is&#xD;
           divided into five subscales, namely, (1) Interpersonal Strengths, (2) Family&#xD;
           Involvement, (3) Intrapersonal Strengths, (4) School Functioning, and (5) Affective&#xD;
           Strengths. Teacher/Clinician, Parent, and Youth Rating Scales will be used in this grant&#xD;
           to assess child behavioral and emotional functioning. Cultural/ethnic normative sample&#xD;
           were representative of the United States population. Internal consistency ranges from&#xD;
           0.77 to 0.99. The BERS is expected to take 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The University of California Los Angeles-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (UCLA-PTSD) is&#xD;
           used to screen both for exposure to traumatic events and for DSM-IV PTSD symptoms in&#xD;
           children and adolescents who report traumatic experiences. The UCLA PTSD is expected to&#xD;
           take approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The Ontario Child Neglect Index (CNI) is a clinician administered assessment designed to&#xD;
           identify types and severity of different forms of child neglect. It is designed for use&#xD;
           with families already identified by a child protective service agency. The CNI is a&#xD;
           6-scale index and utilizes a 4- to 5-level rating of severity (e.g., adequate,&#xD;
           inconsistent, inadequate, seriously inadequate). The score is interpreted as a severity&#xD;
           rating of neglect, rather than a binary (yes/no) neglect score. Scores can range from&#xD;
           0-80. The recommended cutoff score is 50. The CNI is expected to take approximately 5&#xD;
           minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Demographic information (e.g, gender, age, race/ethnicity, parental age, education,&#xD;
           employment, marital status, etc.) will be collected. In addition, medical information&#xD;
           including medications, psychiatric diagnosis, birth history, history of maltreatment and&#xD;
           psychosocial history will be obtained by parent interview or electronic record review.&#xD;
