      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a treatment for heart failure in patients who also&#xD;
      suffer from ventricular dyssynchrony, a form of uncoordinated contraction of the ventricle&#xD;
      (lower pumping chamber of the heart). In the past decade, CRT has become an established&#xD;
      treatment for heart failure patients who are in normal rhythm, called sinus rhythm. An&#xD;
      important subset of heart failure patients are those with atrial fibrillation (AF), who make&#xD;
      up around 1 in 4 HF patients, and are over-represented amongst HF patients with more advanced&#xD;
      symptoms. In heart failure patients with AF, CRT has proven not to be as effective as in&#xD;
      sinus rhythm, due to competition between beats generated by the CRT device and beats&#xD;
      conducted from the heart's own electrical conduction system. In the current study, we aim to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that ablating the AV node, which controls electrical conduction from the&#xD;
      heart's atria (top chamber) to its ventricles (lower chambers), will improve survival and&#xD;
      heart failure symptoms in CRT patients with co-existent AF. The results are important,&#xD;
      because they will provide a way of passing on the benefits of CRT, such as improved survival,&#xD;
      less heart failure symptoms, and better quality of life, to heart failure patients who also&#xD;
      suffer from AF.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is an established treatment in heart&#xD;
      failure (HF) patients with ventricular dyssynchrony who remain in sinus rhythm. Available&#xD;
      clinical data has shown inferior outcomes of CRT in HF patients with co-existent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF), who comprise up to 27% of HF patients, and are over-represented in&#xD;
      advanced HF classes. We hypothesize, based on the results of a systematic review we recently&#xD;
      published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, that AV nodal ablation may&#xD;
      improve survival, heart failure and functional outcomes in CRT recipients with co-existent&#xD;
      AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study will be a multicentre, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients&#xD;
      with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy heart failure (NYHA II, III or ambulatory class&#xD;
      IV), left ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤ 35%), prolonged intraventricular conduction (QRS&#xD;
      duration ≥ 120ms), and persistent or permanent AF will be considered for the study.&#xD;
      Persistent AF will be defined as patients where obtaining and maintaining sinus rhythm is&#xD;
      deemed either not worthwhile, or to be ineffective in the long term, or where both the&#xD;
      patient and the physician accept the presence of AF, where rhythm control intervention is, by&#xD;
      definition, no longer pursued. Permanent AF is defined as AF where sinus rhythm cannot be&#xD;
      restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of two arms: (1) CRT-D plus AV nodal ablation&#xD;
      (&quot;AV nodal ablation arm [AVNA]&quot;) or (2) CRT-D alone (&quot;rate control arm&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: 590 subjects, with 295 subjects in the AV node ablation arm and 295 subjects in&#xD;
      the control arm, will be enrolled. Study patients will undergo stratified randomization at ≥&#xD;
      30 days after CRT implant. Participants in will sign informed consent and be screened prior&#xD;
      to randomisation. After CRT implant, patients will have at least 30 days for optimisation of&#xD;
      heart failure therapy, prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: A computer-generated web-based randomisation schedule will be used.&#xD;
      Randomisation will be stratified by trial centre. Randomisation is considered the trial entry&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary endpoint is a composite of all cause mortality and non-fatal heart&#xD;
      failure events. Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      (including classification in terms of suddenness and arrhythmic mechanism by prespecified&#xD;
      Hinkle-Thaler criteria), non-fatal heart failure events, 6-minute walking test distance,&#xD;
      quality of life, unplanned hospitalization, and ventricular arrhythmias requiring device&#xD;
      therapy, inappropriate shocks, cardiovascular MRI prediction of response, percentage pacing&#xD;
      and prediction of response to therapy, ventricular reverse remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan: The study is powered to find a 25% relative reduction in event rate, with&#xD;
      sample sizes calculated assuming a two-tailed α=0.05,1-β=0.80, and 10% sample size increment&#xD;
      allow for to drop in the event rate (AV nodal ablation arm), drop out or cross-over&#xD;
      (feasibly, control to AVNA arm only). It is planned to perform three interim (0.25, 0.5 0.75&#xD;
      information fractions) and a final analysis requiring 295 patients per arm with a final&#xD;
      P-value at ≤ 0.045; stopping rules according to the method of O'Brien and Fleming. The&#xD;
      boundaries (z scores: ±4.332, ±2.963, ±2.359, ±2.014; and nominal P-values: 0.000015, 0.0031,&#xD;
      0.014, 0.044)) were derived using the statistical package PASS (V12). Outside of these&#xD;
      defined analyses, the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will have access to data reports&#xD;
      and will be able to stop the trial at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The primary (binary)&#xD;
      mortality-outcome will be analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic and logistic&#xD;
      regression with pre-specified (baseline) covariates. Time-to-event analyses will be initially&#xD;
      undertaken by the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis approach. Key secondary outcomes such as&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, and rates of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia episodes will be analysed using either Cox proportional hazards models&#xD;
      or Fine and Gray competing risks regression as appropriate. Continuous secondary outcomes&#xD;
      such as the 6-minute walking distance, Short Form 36 (SF36) scores, Minnesota Living with&#xD;
      Heart Failure (MLWHF) score will be compared between randomised groups over time using linear&#xD;
      mixed effects models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Impact: The study will answer a central clinical question directly impacting&#xD;
      the care of HF patients with AF, and will be expected to change current HF management&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
