  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 9-week single-centre, open-label, dose-escalating study evaluating the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Quetiapine XR given as monotherapy in the treatment of non-lactating, post-partum&#xD;
      women diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder. Subjects will need to visit the study doctor up to&#xD;
      8 times over a period of 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, subjects will be receiving a treatment with Quetiapine XR. The&#xD;
      starting dose of quetiapine that subjects will receive is 50mg. The response to the treatment&#xD;
      of quetiapine will determine whether the study doctor will increase the dosage of the&#xD;
      subject's quetiapine. If the study doctor increases the quetiapine during the study, the&#xD;
      maximum dosage allowable during the study is 300mg.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will help clinicians increase their awareness of the existence of Bipolar II&#xD;
      Disorder in the perinatal population and provide guidance in terms of appropriate treatment.&#xD;
      Since this diagnosis in the postpartum population is done by elimination, this study will&#xD;
      provide evidence of the merits of identifying and treating this order on time. When selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fail for symptom relief in women diagnosed with&#xD;
      unipolar depression, postpartum onset, clinicians tend to either augment or combine a variety&#xD;
      of psychotropic medications for treatment response. It is probably likely that these patients&#xD;
      are Bipolar II Disorder who continue to cycle through the treatment. Adding an atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic is often an afterthought. Therefore, the unique aspects of treating this&#xD;
      specific population right at the outset when a diagnosis of mood disorders is made is&#xD;
      optimal. Clinicians not only need to actively consider bipolar type II in their differential&#xD;
      diagnosis, but also to initiate treatment as soon as possible to relieve further suffering.&#xD;
      This study will help diagnose postpartum Bipolar II Disorder and test the unique action of&#xD;
      quetiapine with its mood stabilizing and antidepressant properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quetiapine XR will be effective in the treatment of postpartum depression in women with&#xD;
      Bipolar II Disorder.&#xD;
