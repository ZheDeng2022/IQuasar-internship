    <textblock>
      Asthma affects 1 in 8 children in the UK. Up to half of these are treated with preventative&#xD;
      medicine in the form of low-dose steroids using an inhaler. The National Asthma Treatment&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend when this treatment is not working other treatments are started. Studies&#xD;
      to support this have taken place in adults but not with children. If patients are instructed&#xD;
      how to use inhalers and are given information about asthma, they can control their disease&#xD;
      much better. The first part of this study, lasting 4 weeks, will make sure the children and&#xD;
      their families understand how to use their inhaler. All children will be given the same&#xD;
      steroid inhaler to use and after 4 weeks those still with symptoms will enter the study&#xD;
      proper which lasts for 48 weeks. During this part of the study the children will be given one&#xD;
      of three treatments. These are:- a steroid inhaler + a dummy tablet, an inhaler containing a&#xD;
      steroid and a long-acting reliever + a dummy tablet or a steroid inhaler + an active tablet.&#xD;
      In this way the patient, the family and the researchers will not know which of the three&#xD;
      treatments the child is taking until the code is broken at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What matters to children is how they feel, are they able to run around and play with friends&#xD;
      and are they well enough to go to school. The investigators will assess which of the above&#xD;
      treatments best allow these to happen by asking the parents and children to fill in&#xD;
      questionnaires on 4 occasions during the study. The investigators will also see which&#xD;
      treatment best prevents the need for short courses of steroids tablets during the study.&#xD;
      These are commonly given when asthma symptoms worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most children will be started in the study through their general practitioner clinic. It will&#xD;
      take one year to enroll all 900 children. Once enrolled the children will be followed-up in&#xD;
      hospital centres. Much of the funding will be required to recruit and follow-up the children,&#xD;
      train everyone to the same standard and develop and administer the questionnaires and health&#xD;
      economic assessments. Asthma care is an expensive. The investigators will look at the costs&#xD;
      and assess which treatment offers most benefit. The team has experience and ability in this&#xD;
      field and will ensure the results are well publicised. Any child can withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma remains the most common medical condition seen in children in primary care and the&#xD;
      most frequent cause for medical paediatric hospital admission. It affects 1 in 8 children&#xD;
      nationwide, approximately 50% of whom are prescribed low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).&#xD;
      When treatment with low-dose ICS fails to control asthma symptoms, the National Guidelines&#xD;
      suggest ensuring compliance, maximising inhaler technique and giving appropriate information&#xD;
      about the disease to children and their families. Once these measures have been established&#xD;
      and if asthma symptoms persist, the Guidelines recommend changing the treatment (Step 3 of&#xD;
      the National Guidelines). The evidence at this step of the Guidelines is much weaker in&#xD;
      children than it is in adults. The reasons for this are that few studies have been undertaken&#xD;
      in children and most that have taken place have used adult-based outcomes such as lung&#xD;
      function measurements. This is unsatisfactory because we know that as a chronic disease&#xD;
      entity asthma in children is much more variable than in adults and between periods of&#xD;
      symptoms, lung function is often normal. Pharmaceutical company studies have really only been&#xD;
      conducted as part of their requirements to obtain a license to market their product. These&#xD;
      studies have generally been of short-term duration. They have not added to clinicians'&#xD;
      understanding of how and where to use the medications. They have not necessarily selected a&#xD;
      representative population due to their entry criteria and their intensive study requirements.&#xD;
      Such requirements mean that &quot;real-life&quot; compliance does not occur. In the independent&#xD;
      National Dutch Study which attempted to enter patients uncontrolled on low-dose ICS, three&#xD;
      treatment groups were employed: inhaled corticosteroids alone, inhaled corticosteroids in&#xD;
      double the dose and inhaled corticosteroids + a long-acting beta2 agonist. There was&#xD;
      essentially no difference in outcome measures between the three treatment groups as once&#xD;
      again the primary outcome measure was that of lung function (FEV1). Comparing this study with&#xD;
      a similar adult study6 both of which used lung function as the primary outcome measure, the&#xD;
      mean FEV1 on entry into the paediatric study was approximately 89% expected for the&#xD;
      children&quot;s heights. In the adult study the mean FEV1 on entry into the study was 74%&#xD;
      expected. It is therefore not surprising that the paediatric study was unable to show any&#xD;
      differences between the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not have the scientific information about how to treat children with asthma who are not&#xD;
      well controlled on low-dose ICS therapy. It used to be recommended that when low-dose ICS&#xD;
      were not effective their dose should be doubled. Studies in children, however, have&#xD;
      investigated this statement and the results are not impressive7 . There is no scientific&#xD;
      evidence that when control is poor in children with asthma, the dose of the inhaled steroid&#xD;
      should be increased. We have therefore decided not to introduce into this study a treatment&#xD;
      limb with a higher ICS dosage. There is anecdotal information, however, from many studies&#xD;
      undertaken within the pharmaceutical industry that when children enter a study which is&#xD;
      controlled and double-blind in nature, up to 30% of them improve, their symptoms reduce and&#xD;
      their lung function increases8. It is therefore surprising that approximately one third of&#xD;
      children receiving ICS are prescribed high-dose inhaled steroid therapy (â‰¥ 800micrograms and&#xD;
      unlicensed beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent) or they are commenced on &quot;add-on&quot;&#xD;
      therapies such as long-acting beta2 agonists (LABA) or leukotriene receptor antagonists&#xD;
      (LTRA) in addition to low-dose ICS. Concerns about the safety of high-dose ICS have been&#xD;
      raised in relation to growth impairment9, hypoglycaemia10 and suppression of the adrenal&#xD;
      cortex11 resulting in warnings on prescribing from the Medicines &amp; Healthcare Products&#xD;
      Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK12 and from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the&#xD;
      USA. It is therefore unacceptable that approximately one third of children with asthma are&#xD;
      being treated with the above regimes. Asthma is a very common condition and the worth of&#xD;
      these regimes has not been proven by appropriately devised paediatric studies. The National&#xD;
      Guidelines have been developed in a &quot;stepwise&quot; manner, the amount of medication increasing at&#xD;
      each step if symptoms are not controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as stated above, it may be that childhood asthma differs from that in adults. It&#xD;
      seems that relatively poorly controlled asthma in children who exhibit frequent symptoms do&#xD;
      not necessarily show abnormal lung function between their periods of symptoms. It is for this&#xD;
      reason that in our study we will be concentrating on outcome measures such as exacerbations&#xD;
      and quality of life although we will have the opportunity to measure spirometric values at&#xD;
      the first (T0) and last (T48) visits in the randomised part of the study. It could be that an&#xD;
      increase in medication may only be needed for a short time in children with asthma and there&#xD;
      have been suggestions that once control is achieved children should have their add-on therapy&#xD;
      reviewed. To incorporate such a step within the present study would make it excessively&#xD;
      complicated and would have major implications on the number of patients included. The&#xD;
      inclusion of such a step would make the study impractical within the UK. A study is needed&#xD;
      which is simple, pragmatic (but placebo-controlled and double-blinded), has outcomes which&#xD;
      will be of practical benefit to children and will provide evidence for the use of add-on&#xD;
      medications in the most cost effective and efficient way. Children dislike exacerbations.&#xD;
      School attendance, daily activity and general well-being increase when asthma is well&#xD;
      controlled. Once families understand sufficiently about asthma, inhaler technique has been&#xD;
      evaluated and optimised, and compliance issues addressed, one of the reasons why a specific&#xD;
      medication may be less effective could be related to the genetic make-up of the patient. In&#xD;
      this study we will have the opportunity, through a separate consent process, to collect and&#xD;
      store DNA specimens from saliva for later analysis of specific genetic polymorphisms in&#xD;
      relation to asthma severity and outcome. This aspect will bring added value to the study.&#xD;
