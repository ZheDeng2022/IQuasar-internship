      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best schedule of vaccine therapy with or&#xD;
      without sirolimus in treating patients with cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) expressing solid&#xD;
      tumors. Biological therapies, such as sirolimus, may stimulate the immune system in different&#xD;
      ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed&#xD;
      with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells&#xD;
      that express NY-ESO-1. Infusing the vaccine directly into a lymph node may cause a stronger&#xD;
      immune response and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy works&#xD;
      better when given with or without sirolimus in treating solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety of DC205-NY-ESO-1 vaccine (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401)&#xD;
      with and without sirolimus. Toxicity as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood frequency of CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore time to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo standard collection of peripheral white blood cells via leukapheresis over&#xD;
      90-240 minutes for vaccine preparation. Patients are assigned sequentially to Cohorts 1a-1d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1a: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 intranodally on days 1,&#xD;
      29, 57, and 113.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1b: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and&#xD;
      sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-14, 29-42, and 57-70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1c: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and&#xD;
      sirolimus PO or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube on days 15-28, 43-56, and&#xD;
      71-84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1d: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and&#xD;
      sirolimus PO or PEG on days 1-84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 2: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in the Cohort (1a-1d)&#xD;
      that is determined to be safe and produces optimal immunological effects and sirolimus PO on&#xD;
      days 1-14 as in Cohort 1b dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
