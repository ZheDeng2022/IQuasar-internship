      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability activity of TH-302 and&#xD;
      dexamethasone with or without bortezomib or pomalidomide in subjects with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the initial study of TH-302 in subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. It&#xD;
      is an open-label dose-escalation study to determine the DLTs, MTD, safety and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of TH-302 and dexamethasone with a Simon two-stage expansion at the MTD. The study&#xD;
      will also investigate the DLTs, MTD, safety and preliminary efficacy of TH-302, dexamethasone&#xD;
      and bortezomib; and the DLTs, MTD, safety and preliminary efficacy of TH-302, dexamethasone&#xD;
      and pomalidomide. As such, the study is separated into four parts. Treatment will be&#xD;
      administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or 12 cycles (Arm A, Arm B&#xD;
      and Arm C) or 9 cycles (Arm D) have been completed.&#xD;
