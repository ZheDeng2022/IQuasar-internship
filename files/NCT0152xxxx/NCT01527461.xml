    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that dogs are able to detect cancer in sweat samples.&#xD;
      This potentially would be the base for developing a new efficient, non invasive and&#xD;
      inexpensive diagnosis tool of lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among all cancers which harm the population, lung cancer is the most lethal type, responsible&#xD;
      for 1.3 million deaths per year worldwide, for 28% of all cancer deaths.The 5 year survival&#xD;
      rates are low, only 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in its early stages could increase the 5-year-survival&#xD;
      rate by 3-4 fold with a potential for cure. Therefore, efforts are being made to develop new&#xD;
      sensitive specified screening tools for detecting lung cancer at its' earliest stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new emerging strategy for early detection of lung cancer is based on the recognition of the&#xD;
      tumors metabolic signature, on the identification of specific biomarkers for the disease,&#xD;
      such as the volatile organic compounds (VOC). Research has demonstrated that these compounds&#xD;
      are released from the cancerous tissue from the early stages of the disease, and can be found&#xD;
      in different bodily secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects, lung cancer patients and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients,&#xD;
      would be given cotton T-shirts with instructions to wear them without previously applying&#xD;
      deodorant or any other similar personal hygiene products. Then, the shirts would be collected&#xD;
      and 8 pieces (size:1cm*3cm from the armpit areas) would be cut from each one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dogs for this study would be trained by the &quot;Dogs for People&quot; association. In the initial&#xD;
      stage, 40 mixed breed dogs and 3-4 Springer spaniels would be exposed to sweat sample&#xD;
      collected from cancer patients in order to get them acquainted with the scent. Then, it would&#xD;
      be demanded of them to locate boxes containing T-shirt sample taken from cancer patients,&#xD;
      from decoy boxes holding naïve T-shirts. Every sequence will include 4 boxes with a different&#xD;
      ratio between the specimens(each time a different number of boxes will contain samples taken&#xD;
      from cancer patients, 0,1,2,3 or 4 when the rest of the boxes would contain naïve T-shirts).&#xD;
      The dogs would mark the specimen by sitting next to each relevant box (they will ignore the&#xD;
      decoy boxes after sniffing them and identifying them as irrelevant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most prominent 8-9 dogs would continue to the experiment phase. Each training course&#xD;
      would last for 5-10 minutes or for 8 successful identifications, depending on the training&#xD;
      dog needs. Dogs would be rewarded with a treat (a dog biscuit) or with play time, depending&#xD;
      on the dogs' nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental phase, the decoy boxes would hold sweat samples collected from COPD&#xD;
      patients instead of naïve T-shirts. The dogs would be asked to locate boxes containing the&#xD;
      T-shirt sample taken from the lung cancer patients, from the decoy boxes. Every sequence will&#xD;
      include 4 boxes with a different ratio between the specimens (each time a different number of&#xD;
      boxes will contain samples taken from cancer patients, 0,1,2,3 or 4 when the rest of the&#xD;
      boxes would contain samples collected from COPD patients). The dogs would mark the specimen&#xD;
      by sitting next to each relevant box (they will ignore the decoy boxes after sniffing them&#xD;
      and identifying them as irrelevant).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trainer would be oblivious to the targets' location.&#xD;
