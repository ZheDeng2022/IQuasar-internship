      Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of pancreatic parenchyma and subsequent fibrosis. Patients with chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis can be treated with medical management, endoscopic therapy and surgical&#xD;
      treatment. Among the various theories of causation of pain in chronic pancreatitis, there is&#xD;
      theory of ductal hypertension. In this the pancreatic duct obstruction resulting in ductal&#xD;
      dilatation, ductal hypertension and parenchymal hypertension is thought to be the cause of&#xD;
      pain. For patients with dilated ducts, ductal decompression is advocated. Ductal&#xD;
      decompression can be achieved by endoscopy and by surgery. Surgery comprises of lateral&#xD;
      pancreaticojejunostomy with or without headcoring. Endoscopic treatment includes&#xD;
      sphincterotomy, dilatation of strictures, removal of stones with or without extracorporeal&#xD;
      shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and stenting. The pros and cons of endoscopic versus surgical&#xD;
      therapy are debated. Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy relieves chronic abdominal pain in&#xD;
      65%-93% of patients. Morbidity and mortality rates are generally low, averaging 20% and 2%,&#xD;
      respectively. Long-term follow-up of patients after lateral pancreaticojejunostomy reveals&#xD;
      that up to 50% of patients develop recurrent symptoms and 10%-35% fail to obtain pain relief.&#xD;
      Studies indicate that more than 60% of patients undergoing pancreatic endotherapy are pain&#xD;
      free 1 year after the procedure. There are only two randomized controlled trials comparing&#xD;
      endoscopic treatment with the surgical therapy. In this study the investigators will be&#xD;
      conducting a randomized trial, to compare endoscopic and surgical treatment of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis. Outcome variables measured in the study will include pain relief, quality of&#xD;
      life, morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and changes in pancreatic function.&#xD;

      Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of pancreatic parenchyma and subsequent fibrosis. The prevalence of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis has been found to be very high in southern India (114-200/100 000 population).&#xD;
      Alcohol is the most common etiology worldwide, while idiopathic pancreatitis is the most&#xD;
      common type in India and China, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis. It is a cause of considerable morbidity in the form of pain, steatorrhea and&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Natural history of chronic pancreatitis is characterized by variable&#xD;
      course stretching over decades with recurrent acute pancreatitis in the early stage and&#xD;
      steatorrhea, diabetes and pancreatic calcification in the later stages. Pain is a prominent&#xD;
      clinical feature of chronic pancreatitis and the most troublesome symptom for which medical&#xD;
      attention is often sought. Unfortunately, despite much work, the pathophysiology of pain in&#xD;
      CP remains poorly understood. Multiple factors have been suspected, which include&#xD;
      inflammation, encasement of sensory nerves by the fibrotic process and neuropathy, and duct&#xD;
      obstruction, which can lead to high back pressure and parenchymal ischemia. Increased&#xD;
      pressure in the main pancreatic duct is likely to be an important cause of pain, particularly&#xD;
      in patients with duct dilatation. This explanation forms the conceptual basis for both&#xD;
      endoscopic and surgical drainage procedures. Approximately one half of patients with pain&#xD;
      owing to chronic pancreatitis come to an intervention aimed principally at pain relief, along&#xD;
      with relief of bile duct, duodenal, and major venous obstruction. Patients with chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis can be treated with medical management, endoscopic therapy and surgical&#xD;
      treatment. For patients with dilated ducts, ductal decompression is advocated. The pros and&#xD;
      cons of endoscopic versus surgical therapy are debated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The modified Puestow or lateral pancreaticojejunostomy is the most commonly employed surgical&#xD;
      procedure. Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy relieves chronic abdominal pain in 65%-93% of&#xD;
      patients. Morbidity and mortality rates are generally low, averaging 20% and 2%,&#xD;
      respectively. Long-term follow-up of patients after lateral pancreaticojejunostomy reveals&#xD;
      that up to 50% of patients develop recurrent symptoms and 10%-35% fail to obtain pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall more than 60% of patients undergoing pancreatic endotherapy are pain free 1 year&#xD;
      after the procedure. There are only two randomized controlled trials comparing endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment with the surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dite et al. reported the first trial. Surgery consisted of resection (80 %) and drainage (20&#xD;
      %) procedures, while endotherapy included sphincterotomy and stenting (52 %) and/or stone&#xD;
      removal (23 %). In the entire group, the initial success rates were similar for both groups,&#xD;
      but at the 5-year follow-up, complete absence of pain was more frequent after surgery (37 %&#xD;
      vs. 14 %), with the rate of partial relief being similar (49 % vs. 51 %). In the randomized&#xD;
      subgroup, results were similar (pain absence 34 % after surgery vs. 15 % after endotherapy,&#xD;
      relief 52 % after surgery vs. 46 % after endotherapy). The increase in body weight was also&#xD;
      greater by 20 - 25 % in the surgical group, while new-onset diabetes developed with similar&#xD;
      frequency in both groups (34 - 43 %), again with no differences between the results for the&#xD;
      whole group and the randomized subgroup. The authors concluded that surgery is superior to&#xD;
      endotherapy for long-term pain reduction in patients with painful obstructive chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cahen et al. reported the second trial. All symptomatic patients with chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      and a distal obstruction of the pancreatic duct but without an inflammatory mass were&#xD;
      eligible for the study. Thirty-nine patients underwent randomization: 19 to endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment (16 of whom underwent lithotripsy) and 20 to operative pancreaticojejunostomy.&#xD;
      During the 24 months of follow-up, patients who underwent surgery, as compared with those who&#xD;
      were treated endoscopically, had lower Izbicki pain scores (25 vs. 51, P&lt;0.001) and better&#xD;
      physical health summary scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General&#xD;
      Health Survey questionnaire (P=0.003). At the end of follow-up, complete or partial pain&#xD;
      relief was achieved in 32% of patients assigned to endoscopic drainage as compared with 75%&#xD;
      of patients assigned to surgical drainage (P=0.007). Rates of complications, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, and changes in pancreatic function were similar in the two treatment groups,&#xD;
      but patients receiving endoscopic treatment required more procedures than did patients in the&#xD;
      surgery group (a median of eight vs. three, P&lt;0.001). Authors concluded that surgical&#xD;
      drainage of the pancreatic duct was more effective than endoscopic treatment in patients with&#xD;
      obstruction of the pancreatic duct due to chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both these trials had a small sample size. The population studied was also different. ESWL&#xD;
      was not included in protocol in one of the trials. In one of the trials only pancreatic duct&#xD;
      drainage was chosen as the surgical therapy. The proposed study will compare surgery with&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy in Indian population with chronic pancreatitis. The outcomes compared&#xD;
      would include pain relief, quality of life, morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      changes in pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function.&#xD;
