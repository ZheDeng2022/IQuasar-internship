  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-traumatic osteonecrosis is a painful disorder of the hip characterized by a necrosis of&#xD;
      the osteomedullary tissue, which leads to subchondral bone collapse and joint destruction.&#xD;
      Core decompression is currently the treatment of choice for early stage osteonecrosis of the&#xD;
      femoral head. This method consists in decompressing the rigid intra-osseous chamber to&#xD;
      promote revascularization, thus halting progression of the disease and stimulating repair.&#xD;
      Still this treatment remains highly controversial, since the success rates of the first&#xD;
      studies have not been repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact pathology mechanisms involved in osteonecrosis have not yet be fully elucidated.&#xD;
      Several hypotheses have been evoked, including fat embolism, trabecular bone microfractures,&#xD;
      microvascular tamponade and, more recently, impaired bone and/or mesenchymal cells&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies have indicated the potential clinical benefits of cell-based approaches for the&#xD;
      treatment of osteonecrosis (Hernigou 1997, Hernigou &amp; Beaujean 2002, Gangji et al. 2004).&#xD;
      This is on the basis of these observations that a proprietary population of autologous&#xD;
      osteoblastic cells (PREOB®) has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 3 study aims at demonstrating the efficacy and safety of PREOB® in the treatment&#xD;
      of early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. More specifically, the purpose of the study&#xD;
      is to demonstrate that core decompression/PREOB® implantation into the necrotic lesion is&#xD;
      superior to core decompression/placebo implantation in relieving hip symptoms and halting (or&#xD;
      reverting) radiological progression of the disease.&#xD;
