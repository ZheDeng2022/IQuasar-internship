  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device while reducing the&#xD;
      amount of drainage from surgical wounds following large flap surgical procedures, in this&#xD;
      case abdominoplasty, as compared to the standard of care (closure techniques). It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the use of the Cohera device will facilitate reduction or closure of dead&#xD;
      space when applied to planar surfaces created during an abdominoplasty procedure.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid accumulation in dissected tissue planes has been a longstanding problem following&#xD;
      surgical procedures. The common use of closed suction drains has been associated with&#xD;
      infection risk, wound healing complications, additional scarring, and patient discomfort.&#xD;
      Additionally, seroma formation after drain removal often requires invasive treatment.&#xD;
      Therapies that can reduce fluid accumulation and decrease the need for drains will have a&#xD;
      positive impact on surgical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish that the use of TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive is a safe and effective&#xD;
           alternative to drains (standard of care) for fluid management following abdominoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive on post-operative invasive&#xD;
           treatments, and seroma formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of TissuGlu® Surgical Adhesive on post-operative subject&#xD;
           satisfaction and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the type and duration of adverse events associated with TissuGlu® used&#xD;
           during an abdominoplasty procedure as an alternative to drains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized trial comparing standard wound closure technique with drains in 130&#xD;
      subjects (control group n=65) to standard wound closure techniques plus TissuGlu® and no&#xD;
      drains (test group n=65) during Abdominoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects randomized into the Test Group, TissuGlu® will be applied to one surface of the&#xD;
      exposed tissue flap using the custom applicator during a standard abdominoplasty procedure&#xD;
      followed by normal wound closure (suturing technique) without drain placement. The applicator&#xD;
      device will deliver an array of drops spaced equidistant apart. The user may then reposition&#xD;
      the device to the next area and repeat the application process. Each device will dispense&#xD;
      approximately 5 ml of adhesive. It is expected that one 5 ml device will suffice for the&#xD;
      average sized subject (400-500 sq cm tissue flap). The TissuGlu® is applied using the&#xD;
      disposable applicator to the tissue surfaces to be adhered just prior to standard closure.&#xD;
      The tissue is then approximated, and the wound is closed using standard suturing techniques.&#xD;
      TissuGlu® will begin to cure upon exposure to moisture in the tissue. The cure process takes&#xD;
      approximately 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that are randomized to the Control Group will undergo normal wound closure (suturing&#xD;
      technique) and placement of two size 12 Blake drains.&#xD;
