  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed cord clamp of at least 30 seconds in neonates under 37 weeks has shown that these&#xD;
      infants have higher circulating blood volume in the first 24 hours, less need for blood&#xD;
      transfusions, and less incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. Delayed umbilical cord&#xD;
      clamping has also been shown to increase the initial hematocrit and decrease the need for red&#xD;
      blood cell (RBC) transfusions compared with no intervention in infants born between 27 and 33&#xD;
      weeks' gestation. However, a delay in cord clamping of 30-45 seconds may theoretically&#xD;
      interfere with neonatal resuscitation. There have been few studies that addressed the active&#xD;
      milking of the cord and its effect on neonatal resuscitation. Active milking of the umbilical&#xD;
      cord towards the baby prior to clamping (rather than passive) should take less than 5 seconds&#xD;
      to perform and should not interfere with neonatal resuscitation. Umbilical cord milking, as&#xD;
      an alternative to delayed cord clamping, has been shown to increase the circulatory blood&#xD;
      volume expressed as the hemoglobin value. Active milking of the cord prior to clamping,&#xD;
      however, is not considered standard of care and only 1 Japanese randomized control study has&#xD;
      reported that umbilical cord milking reduces the need for RBC transfusions, thus reducing the&#xD;
      number of infants requiring a RBC transfusion as compared with control conditions. Our study&#xD;
      aims to test the hypothesis that active milking of the umbilical cord will reduce the need&#xD;
      for transfusion in preterm infants.&#xD;

      The proposed design is a randomized controlled trial. Pregnant women at risk for delivering a&#xD;
      singleton preterm infant between 24 and 28 weeks gestation will be randomized prior to&#xD;
      delivery into one of two treatment arms. Common reasons for needing to be delivered at this&#xD;
      early gestational age include but are not limited to: preterm labor not responding to&#xD;
      tocolytic medications, incompetent cervix with cervical dilation and no contractions,&#xD;
      clinical chorioamnionitis requiring delivery for maternal/fetal benefit, severe preeclampsia,&#xD;
      severe growth restriction with a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. The first arm will&#xD;
      include active milking of the umbilical cord toward the neonate's umbilicus prior to cord&#xD;
      clamping at delivery while the second arm will not include this intervention and will have&#xD;
      their respective cord immediately clamped in the usual fashion post delivery (control).&#xD;
