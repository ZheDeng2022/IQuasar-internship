    <textblock>
      The REDUCE trial was conducted to determine whether dutasteride reduces the risk of incident&#xD;
      prostate cancer, as detected on biopsy, among men who are at increased risk for the disease.&#xD;
      Dutasteride was compared with placebo for 4 years period. Results showed a relative risk&#xD;
      reduction of 22.8 % (95% CI: 15.2 to 29.8)in prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For REDUCE, biopsies were defined as &quot;protocol biopsy&quot; if performed at certain timeframes,&#xD;
      and &quot;for cause&quot; if outside these predetermined timeframes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a post hoc analysis that would allow them to include biopsies that&#xD;
      really justified a clinical indication, but were excluded from &quot;for cause&quot; analysis based on&#xD;
      occurring at either the 2 or 4 year timeframes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the investigators propose analysis of both REDUCE groups by every yearly timeframe as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1--dutasteride group biopsied &quot;for cause&quot; using several definitions: biopsy of patients&#xD;
      who received dutasteride whose PSA rose from nadir as defined in your own protocol,who had a&#xD;
      PSA rise&gt;0.2 ng/ml or who had a new abnormal DRE or had a free PSA&lt;12% . The investigators&#xD;
      define these as such because this would reasonably instigate biopsy if the clinician had a&#xD;
      patient with this scenario in the non-study setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2--placebo group biopsied &quot;for cause&quot; using several definitions, regardless of&#xD;
      timeframe but reported at each year of the study and aggregate, with the aggregate number&#xD;
      being the primary outcome. Thus the investigators would request results of biopsy of patients&#xD;
      who received placebo To establish differences in biopsy positive rates the groups as per each&#xD;
      definition listed, to determine if dutasteride decreased the likelihood of &quot;for cause&quot; biopsy&#xD;
      compared to &quot;not for cause&quot; biopsy, and if there is a difference in cancer detection risk&#xD;
      rate depending on cause vs. no cause in that group compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Purpose: Determining the likelihood of prostate cancer detection in men taking dutasteride&#xD;
      when biopsy is performed 'for cause'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The population of interest is the REDUCE Biopsied population, that is, all&#xD;
      subjects in the Efficacy population who have at least one post-baseline biopsy reviewed by&#xD;
      the Central Pathology Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Initial interest will be focused on data from the Year 1-2 time period, to avoid&#xD;
      the potential effect of the cancer diagnoses from the Year 2 scheduled biopsies on the&#xD;
      assessments utilized in the &quot;for cause&quot; definitions. Only PSA data from Years 1-2 and&#xD;
      baseline will be utilized in the computation of the various PSA metrics, and only Central&#xD;
      Pathology results from Years 1-2 will be utilized to establish post-baseline diagnoses. PSA&#xD;
      values on or within 42 days after date of biopsy will be excluded from the analyses, to avoid&#xD;
      potential effects of biopsy on the PSA value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the 2 groups of subjects, the following will be summarized: number of subjects&#xD;
      meeting the corresponding criteria, number and % of subjects diagnosed with prostate cancer,&#xD;
      number and % of such subjects diagnosed with Gleason 7-10, and number and % of subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with either prostate cancer, HGPIN or ASAP. Summaries of the numbers of subjects&#xD;
      meeting each of the specific criteria for group 1 (a through e) and Group 2 (a through h)&#xD;
      will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, summaries investigating the effect of baseline variables (such as age, family&#xD;
      history of prostate cancer, prostate volume, percent free PSA, number of cores at the entry&#xD;
      biopsy) on the occurrence of prostate cancer diagnoses and Gleason 7-10 diagnoses may be&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
