      The projects aim is to investigate the intestinal function of patients suffering from&#xD;
      Prader-Willi Syndrome. The methods used are ultrasonographic measurement of the rectal&#xD;
      diameter and gastrointestinal transit time&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a congenital genetical disease characterized by moderate&#xD;
      retardation, food-seeking behavior and a serious risk of developing health threatening&#xD;
      overweight, low stature, abnormal body composition and a lack of growth- and sex-hormones.&#xD;
      They can not live an independent life and are reliant of help from care personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with PWS react abnormally to signals from their own bodies. E.g. they have a reduced&#xD;
      sense of pain and can have a lacking urge to urination despite a full bladder. Most of the&#xD;
      patients also have a relatively slow pulse, which can be consistent with a dysfunction in the&#xD;
      nervous system (the parasympathetic nervous system) which also has large significance for the&#xD;
      bladder- and bowel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intestinal function in people with PWS is a sparse described subject, which has not been&#xD;
      systematically examined in scientific context. We therefore want to examine whether the bowel&#xD;
      function in people with PWS are different from the bowel function in healthy people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is elucidated by a medical examination, a questionnaire, a registration of toilet&#xD;
      habits, a measurement of the rectal diameter by an ultrasound scan and a measurement of the&#xD;
      colonic transit time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be compared to findings in normal healthy people. Because no normal material&#xD;
      exists for rectal diameter measured by ultrasound, we will establish one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of the project will increase our knowledge of possible bowel dysfunctions such as&#xD;
      constipation, in people with PWS and can immediately lead to improved care for and optimized&#xD;
      treatment of the patients.&#xD;
