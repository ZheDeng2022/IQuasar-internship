      Objectives: 1. Primary objective: To Evaluate the rate of sustained virological response&#xD;
      (SVR) of pegylated interferon alfa-2b (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) plus nitazoxanide (NTZ)&#xD;
      in patients coinfected by HIV and HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4), never treated before (naïve) and&#xD;
      with a treatment failure to a standard therapy with Peg-IFN plus RBV (experienced), and to&#xD;
      compare it with the rate of SVR of these patients with Peg-IFN plus RBV is a historical&#xD;
      cohort. 2. Secondary objectives: In naive, as well as in experienced patients: a) To evaluate&#xD;
      the virological activity at weeks 4 and 12 after starting the combination of Peg-IFN plus RBV&#xD;
      plus NTZ in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients. b) To analyze the safety of Peg-IFN plus RBV plus&#xD;
      NTZ in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pilot clinical trial without control to evaluate efficacy and safety (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Individuals with HIV infection and with confirmed chronic HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: NTZ 500 mg every 12 hours during 4 weeks, followed by NTZ 500 mg every 12 hours&#xD;
      plus Peg-IFN plus weigh-adjusted RBV for 48 weeks. Total duration of therapy: 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary variable: The proportion of patients with HCV RNA ≤10 IU/ml 24 weeks after finishing&#xD;
      the programmed length of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary variables: 1. The frequency of individuals with HCV RNA ≤10 IU/ml 12 weeks after&#xD;
      finishing the programmed length of treatment. 2. The proportion of patients with HCV RNA ≤10&#xD;
      IU/ml at 4 and 12 weeks after adding PegIFN plus RBV to NTZ. 3. The frequency of severe&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

      Main Objective To evaluate the SVR rate of treatment with Peg-IFN alfa-2b plus RBV and NTZ in&#xD;
      patients coinfected with HIV and HCV genotype 4, both never exposed to therapy against HCV or&#xD;
      who failed a previous treatment with Peg-IFN plus RBV, and to compare with the SVR rate&#xD;
      obtained in patients with Peg-IFN plus RBV in a historical cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: In naive, as well as in experienced patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the virological activity at weeks 4 and 12 after starting the combination of&#xD;
           Peg-IFN plus RBV plus NTZ in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the safety of Peg-IFN plus RBV plus NTZ in HIV/HCV-4-coinfected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Single arm pilot clinical trial to evaluate safety and efficacy (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease or disorder under study Coinfection with HIV and HCV genotype 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs under study Nitazoxanide 500 mg every 12 hours for 4 weeks followed by nitazoxanide 500&#xD;
      mg every 12 hours plus pegylated interferon alfa-2b 1.5 mcg/kg/week and weight-adjusted&#xD;
      ribavirin for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and total number of subjects Patients infected with HIV-1 with chronic HCV&#xD;
      genotype 4 who meet the selection criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients included in the study: 45.&#xD;
