             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects of PF-00299804 is unknown. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown risk of potential adverse effects in infants, secondary to&#xD;
             maternal treatment with PF-00299804, breastfeeding should be discontinued if mother is&#xD;
             treated with PF-00299804.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients positive for HIV being treated with antiretroviral combination therapy. These&#xD;
             patients are not eligible due to potential pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;

             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. HIV-positive patients not on&#xD;
             antiretroviral combination therapy, are eligible if the disease is controlled at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator.&#xD;

             or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial&#xD;
             participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of test results and that,investigator's discretion, make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this trial. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including,&#xD;
             but are not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness / social&#xD;
             situations that limit the compliance of study requirements.&#xD;

          <description>Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 occur in the vast majority of low grade gliomas and secondary high grade gliomas. These mutations change the function of the enzymes, causing increased methylation in gliomas. Gliomas with mutated IDH1 and IDH2 have improved prognosis compared to gliomas with wild-type IDH</description>

It describes a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.). The scale ranges from 0 (fully independent), 1 (Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory ), 2 (Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities), 3 (Capable of only limited selfcare), 4 (Completely disabled) to 5 (death).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Important limitations of our study are the small sample size and the nonrandomized design, which preclude drawing firm conclusions, EGFR amplification, which has been used as a primary laboratory assessment, was tested in the primary tumor, and we have no evidence of the stability of this alteration in the recurrent GBs.</limitations_and_caveats>
