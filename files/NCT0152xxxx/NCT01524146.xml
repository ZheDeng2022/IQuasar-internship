  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, very few centers offer Photodynamic therapy for unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma in&#xD;
      the United States. Several European studies have reported the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) for Cholangiocarcinoma, however, only a few studies have reported&#xD;
      the same in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of a registry to capture all PDT cases within and outside US can help the&#xD;
      investigators evaluate a larger and non-ambiguous sample population. This would help the&#xD;
      investigators evaluate the technical success rates, clinical success rates, feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of PDT for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. With more endoscopists considering PDT as&#xD;
      a therapeutic option along with adjuvant treatment for cholangiocarcinoma, there is a need to&#xD;
      further evaluate the efficacy and safety of such combined procedures as well. The ultimate&#xD;
      objective is to assess if PDT with or without additional or adjuvant treatment options&#xD;
      prolongs survival duration and improves quality of life in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter registry has been initiated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the impact of PDT on the clinical management of unresectable&#xD;
           cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical and technical success rates of PDT for unresectable&#xD;
           cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PDT offers a number of practical advantages; it is minimally invasive and has a low&#xD;
      complication rate, the procedure can easily be performed by a trained endoscopist, and it is&#xD;
      well tolerated. In the trial conducted in Germany, the adverse events of PDT were mild to&#xD;
      moderate, predictable, and relatively easy to control. Photosensitivity was the only systemic&#xD;
      side effect (seen in only three patients). However, provided that simple guidelines for light&#xD;
      exposure are followed, there is minimal risk to the patient, as shown by the low incidence of&#xD;
      photosensitivity reactions in this study which all resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study from the Mayo group included 25 patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who&#xD;
      were treated with PDT from 1991 to 2004 showed that the time interval between diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment with PDT is an important predictor of survival following PDT even when adjusted for&#xD;
      other potential factors that affect survival such as age, gender, Bismuth stage, presence of&#xD;
      tumor mass on imaging and presence of extra biliary spread. Early treatment with PDT may lead&#xD;
      to greater preservation of liver function. A recent study by the primary investigator has&#xD;
      also recently reported improved survival in patients receiving PDT and stent compared to&#xD;
      stent only (16.2 months vs 7.4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several other European studies have reported the efficacy and safety of PDT for&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma; however, only a few studies have reported the same in the United States.&#xD;
      This is again due to the fact that PDT is not offered as a therapeutic option for&#xD;
      unresectable cholangiocarcinoma within US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the establishment of a registry to capture all PDT cases within and outside US can&#xD;
      help the investigators evaluate a larger and non ambiguous sample population. This would help&#xD;
      the investigators evaluate the technical success rates, clinical success rates, feasibility&#xD;
      and safety of PDT for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The involvement of international sites is crucial, as the advanced endoscopists all over the&#xD;
      world are offering photodynamic therapy for managing unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
      However, because of the non-existence of a registry, and the fact that PDT is not offered in&#xD;
      more than a few centers in the US; these cases are often reported with a smaller sample size.&#xD;
      The registry hopes to combine all such comparable cases and collect enough relevant data for&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With more endoscopists considering PDT as a therapeutic option along with adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      for cholangiocarcinoma, there is a need to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of such&#xD;
      combined procedures as well. The ultimate objective is to assess if PDT with or without&#xD;
      additional or adjuvant treatment options prolongs survival duration and improves quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>PDT is a therapeutic approach that specifically targets neoplastic cells.&#xD;
â€¢ PDT involves three components:&#xD;
Photofrin or a similar Photosensitizing agent that would be injected 3 days prior to laser activation of the agent.&#xD;
Laser System - For laser energy delivery to activate the photosensitizing agent and induce tumor tissue necrosis&#xD;
Optic Fiber - Delivery Fiber used along with the laser system to achieve Photoactivation of the photosensitizing agent.&#xD;
Technique:&#xD;
Subjects will be injected with Photofrin or similar drug. 3 days post injection, the subject will receive photodynamic therapy during an Endoscopic Retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. Subject will undergo stenting as part of standard of care procedure post photodynamic therapy.&#xD;
Subject may undergo multiple photodynamic therapy sessions with a gap of at least 3 months.</description>
