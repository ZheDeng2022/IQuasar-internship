  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 18-65 with acute demyelinating optic neuritis where treatment with high dose&#xD;
      corticosteroids are already been chosen by the patient and the diagnosing physician will be&#xD;
      contacted for screening and enrollment. Patients will then be randomized to receive&#xD;
      equivalent doses of either intravenous (IV) or oral corticosteroid treatment. Optic nerve&#xD;
      function assessments will be compared at baseline, prior to treatment, one and six months&#xD;
      post corticosteroid treatment. This will allow for a comparison on whether the route of&#xD;
      medication plays a role in the effectiveness of treatment with high dose corticosteroids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blind, randomized comparison study between 1000mg IV methylprednisolone&#xD;
      daily for three days and 1250mg oral prednisone daily for three days of the recovery of optic&#xD;
      nerve function in acute demyelinating optic neuritis. We will be comparing assessments at&#xD;
      baseline, prior to corticosteroid treatment, with assessments at one and six months post&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study patients with acute demyelinating optic neuritis where treatment with&#xD;
      high dose corticosteroids is being considered. This presentation can be either the first&#xD;
      presentation of a demyelinating event (CIS) or in a patient with a previous diagnosis of CIS&#xD;
      or MS but must be the first presentation of ON in the affected eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from out-patients assessed for acute demyelinating optic neuritis&#xD;
      by neurology, ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology at London Health Sciences Center and St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Health Care Center in London, Ontario. Subjects will be included only if the first&#xD;
      visit takes place within 14 days of symptom onset. Only subjects where the physician who&#xD;
      identifies/diagnoses the optic neuritis is considering corticosteroid treatment will be&#xD;
      contacted for potential screening and enrollment. To ensure treatment is chosen based on the&#xD;
      clinical judgement of physician diagnosing ON, the investigators will only contact potential&#xD;
      subjects after the decision to use corticosteroids has been made by the patient's treating&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measure will be the P100 latency of the Visual Evoked Potential in the affected&#xD;
      eye at six months. Secondary measures will include high contrast visual acuity and contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity at one and six months post corticosteroid treatment and the P100 latency at&#xD;
      one-month post corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Evoked Potentials VEPs will be recorded with Teca Synergy equipment (Viasys&#xD;
      Healthcare). To ensures consistency in technique, the same technician will perform all three&#xD;
      assessments (day 0, 30 and 180) on the same patient. The subject's skin will be cleaned for&#xD;
      electrode placement. The scalp electrodes will be placed relative to bony landmarks, as per&#xD;
      International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standards (40). The&#xD;
      electrodes will be positioned 5 cm above the inion for Oz (active), mid-forehead for Fz&#xD;
      (reference) and on the right arm for the ground, following ISCEV guidelines. The patient will&#xD;
      be positioned comfortably in a chair with the eye at a distance of 1 meter from a 17-inch&#xD;
      cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, which has been found to be superior to an LCD monitor as the&#xD;
      latter can cause a delay in the latency. The room will be darkened to minimize extraneous&#xD;
      light that produce responses in the visual cortex and interfere with the VEP response. The&#xD;
      same room will be used for every VEP in this study. The subject will be monitored for&#xD;
      fixation as poor fixation can affect the P100 peak time and an eye patch used to isolate&#xD;
      vision from one eye only. Monocular stimulation will occur at a frequency of 2 Hz, beginning&#xD;
      with the unaffected eye, averaging 200 individual responses for each trial. A minimum of two&#xD;
      trials per eye will be performed as per ISCEV guidelines. Further averaging of additional&#xD;
      trials may be done if there are obvious technical problems (with visual fixation for&#xD;
      instance). As the test is dependent on subject compliance, the following will take place to&#xD;
      maximize compliance and technical aspects of the recording: talking and gum chewing will be&#xD;
      prohibited; the subject will be instructed to relax all muscles of the head and neck&#xD;
      specifically the jaw; feet will be resting flat on the floor with hands relaxed in the&#xD;
      subject's lap; coaching will take place to help diminish any anxiety; the importance of&#xD;
      fixation will be emphasized and the need to resist following the changes in colour of the&#xD;
      checkerboard pattern and to continue fixating on the red fixation square in the centre of the&#xD;
      monitor will be explained. The interpretation of the VEPs will be done by an assessor blinded&#xD;
      to the treatment arm received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Acuity Visual acuity will be measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy&#xD;
      Study (ETDRS) charts and standard protocol as it the gold standard for ophthalmology clinical&#xD;
      trials using visual acuity as an outcome. Testing acuity occurs initially at 4 meters&#xD;
      initially and only testing at 2 meters if there are no abnormalities noted at 4 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast Sensitivity Contrast sensitivity will be measured using the Low Contrast Sloan&#xD;
      Letter Charts that was found to be valid and reliable for the MS population&#xD;
