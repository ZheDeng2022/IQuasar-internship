      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of temsirolimus and metformin that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is designed to block a protein called mTOR (a protein that is thought to cause&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow) inside the cancer cell. This may interfere with the growth or spread of&#xD;
      cancer cells or possibly kill them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin was designed to treat patients with diabetes. It may be able to block the protein&#xD;
      mTOR and slow the growth of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temsirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Metformin is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The combination of these drugs to treat advanced&#xD;
      cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 104 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of temsirolimus and metformin based on when you join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of&#xD;
      temsirolimus and metformin will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose&#xD;
      level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group&#xD;
      will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were&#xD;
      seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the combination of temsirolimus&#xD;
      and metformin is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found, there will be one&#xD;
      group of up to 40 endometrial carcinoma patients enrolled in a tumor-specific expansion&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study cycle is 42 days and each cycle after that is 28 days. Before you start&#xD;
      taking both drugs in Cycle 1, you will take metformin only for the first 2 weeks. This is&#xD;
      called a titration period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 15, 22, 29 and 36 of Cycle 1, you will receive temsirolimus by vein over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes. For each cycle after that, you will receive temsirolimus by vein over 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you receive temsirolimus, you will receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) by vein over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes to help lower the risk of allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take metformin by mouth every day at about the same time each day with a meal and&#xD;
      cup of water (about 8 ounces). You should take it at home except on the days when you have a&#xD;
      study visit. On study visit days, you may take the metformin before you receive the&#xD;
      temsirolimus. Depending on your dose, you may take metformin 1-3 times daily. Your study&#xD;
      doctor will tell you how to take this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking metformin before you start this study, the study doctor will let you know&#xD;
      how often you will take the metformin and if you will skip the titration period visits&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a letter to take to your home doctor(s) about your study drug&#xD;
      administration as part of your care provided outside of MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about your health, any other drugs you are taking,&#xD;
      and if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exams and tests will be performed before you receive the study drugs that day. Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
      tests and exams may not have to be repeated if done within 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are part of the expansion group, within 7 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD testing&#xD;
           measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are part of the expansion group and have a certain mutation, you will have a&#xD;
           biopsy for PD testing. The tumor biopsy will be collected using either a fine needle&#xD;
           aspiration or a core biopsy, depending on the location and size of the tumor. To perform&#xD;
           a core biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that has a&#xD;
           cutting edge. To collect a fine needle aspirate, a small amount of tissue is withdrawn&#xD;
           through a needle. If you have questions about your mutation status, the doctor can&#xD;
           discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (titration period):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will be asked to not eat&#xD;
           anything for 8 hours before your blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Week 1 only, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycle 1 (titration period), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 and Day 29 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Week 1 only, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 and Day 36 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are part of the expansion group, on Day 37 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are part of the expansion group and have a certain mutation, you will have a&#xD;
           biopsy for PD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will be&#xD;
           asked to not eat anything for 8 hours before your blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycles 2 and beyond, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 8 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or PET/CT scan to check&#xD;
      the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, they will be performed&#xD;
      more often.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After about 6 months (about 6 cycles) of taking the study drugs, you will have the CT scan or&#xD;
      MRI scan every 2-4 cycles if your study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over when you have completed the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will return to the clinic. The&#xD;
      following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are part of the expansion group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PD testing if the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are part of the expansion group and have a certain mutation, you will have a&#xD;
           biopsy for PD testing if the disease gets worse.&#xD;
