  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, four period incomplete block,crossover thorough QT&#xD;
      study to estimate the effect of repeat dose GSK573719/GW642444M (Vilanterol) combination and&#xD;
      GSK573719 monotherapy on the QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects compared with&#xD;
      placebo. At least 100 subjects will receive, four of five possible, 10-day repeat dose&#xD;
      treatments. Treatments are placebo with a moxifloxacin placebo on day 10, placebo with&#xD;
      moxifloxacin (400mg) on day 10, GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (125/25μg) with moxifloxacin&#xD;
      placebo on day 10, GSK573719/Vilanterol combinatio (500/100μg) with moxifloxacin placebo on&#xD;
      day 10, or GSK573719 (500μg) with a moxifloxacin placebo on day 10. All treatments are double&#xD;
      blind except for moxifloxacin (400mg) and moxifloxacin placebo controls, given as a&#xD;
      single-blind single dose on Day 10 of the appropriate treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints are individual time-matched changes from baseline QTcF for&#xD;
      GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (125/25μg) and GSK573719 (500μg), 0-24 hours after dosing on&#xD;
      Day 10. Secondary endpoints will include individual time-matched changes from baseline in&#xD;
      QTcF for GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (500/100μg) and moxifloxacin (400mcg) 0-24 hours&#xD;
      after dosing on Day 10. Also changes from baseline in QTci, QTcB, QT, QRS, RR, PR and&#xD;
      ventricular rate at each time point after 10 days dosing of each GSK573719 and&#xD;
      GSK573719/Vilanterol treatment and single dose moxifloxacin (400mg). Maximal change from&#xD;
      baseline 0-24hours after dosing on day 10 will be derived for QTcF, QTci and QTcB for each&#xD;
      treatment. Plasma concentrations on Day 10 (0-24 hours) and pharmacokinetic parameters of&#xD;
      GSK573719 and Vilanterol will also be derived. Key assessments: 12- lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), pharmacokinetics. Safety will be assessed by blood pressure, heart rate, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events (AEs).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator believes that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk&#xD;
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;147&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  until after the Follow Up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 45 kg and BMI within the range 18 - 29.5 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following&#xD;
             specific requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ventricular rate ≥ 40 beats per minute&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PR interval ≤ 210msec&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The waveforms must enable the QT interval to be clearly defined&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QTcF interval must be &lt; 450msec (machine or manual reading).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A 24 hour Holter ECG at screening that demonstrates no clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormalities or finding that could interfere with interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results, when assessed by an appropriately trained and experienced reviewer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are able to use the Novel DPIsatisfactorily.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent and a signed and dated written informed&#xD;
             consent is obtained, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions&#xD;
             listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history&#xD;
