  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if circulating tumor cells (CTC) can be accurately&#xD;
      detected and isolated from the blood of participants with melanoma using novel laboratory&#xD;
      techniques. Blood samples will be collected from participants with melanoma, and also from&#xD;
      participants with other solid tumor cancers and healthy volunteers for purposes of&#xD;
      comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant information will be collected from participant's medical record and stored in a&#xD;
      coded manner in a password-protected format. This information will be used to look for&#xD;
      correlations of research results on blood samples to participant's medical condition. Test&#xD;
      results will not be given to participants or their physicians. In some cases, CTC may be&#xD;
      grown for long-term cell lines for further research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A strong correlation has been established between CTC and the progression of breast, colon&#xD;
      and prostate cancers. The number of CTC appears to act as a prognostic marker for relapse and&#xD;
      survival in a number of epithelial cancers. Unfortunately, current CTC assays are not&#xD;
      effective in reliably detecting circulating melanoma cells and the assay procedures damage&#xD;
      cells prohibiting further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the TrueCells assay, a&#xD;
      novel approach to isolate and preserve cells for further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate feasibility and reproducibility of isolation of CTC using TrueCells technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optimize quantitative CTC recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide preliminary data concerning correlation of these measurements with other methods&#xD;
           of CTC recovery such as immunofluorescence, lipid-based staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore correlation of immunofluorescent CTC assay and TrueCells CTC cultures with&#xD;
           response to treatment by objective and immune response criteria, progression free&#xD;
           survival, 1 and 2-year survival landmarks, and overall survival in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attempt to isolate long-term tumor cell lines for evaluation of somatic gene mutations,&#xD;
           and gene and protein expression patterns related to individual tumors (not intended to&#xD;
           identify familial or inherited mutations), and to test drug and biologic sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolate plasma RNA and DNA to assess expression tumor-specific markers (e.g.,&#xD;
           tyrosinase, B-FRAF, V600E, etc.) and metastasis-associated genes (e.g., MSH-1,&#xD;
           thymidylate synthase, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform ongoing developmental testing to continue to develop and optimize novel&#xD;
           technical approaches to facilitate isolation of intact CTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected from patients with melanoma (200), prostate cancer (200),&#xD;
      other solid tumor cancers (up to 400), benign hematologic conditions (100), and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (up to 100). Sequential samples will be obtained from selected patients during&#xD;
      disease progression or treatment response to allow exploration of potential correlation of&#xD;
      CTC with response to treatment, progression-free survival and overall survival. Samples will&#xD;
      be immediately de-identified and assigned a numerical code, dated and sent to TrueCells, LLC.&#xD;
      Once donated, sample ownership passes to TrueCells, LLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research studies include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTC independently counted using immunofluorescent staining of thick smear prepared from&#xD;
           entire buffy coat of two tubes of blood (tubes 1 &amp; 2), stained with appropriate primary&#xD;
           pan-tumor monoclonal antibody or lipid markers with confirmatory secondary antibodies to&#xD;
           exclude inadvertent inclusion of leukocyte and endothelial subsets and verify&#xD;
           recognition of the patient's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukocytes (containing CTC) isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The buffy coat&#xD;
           is plated into TrueCells proprietary cell culture medium and tumor cells grown and&#xD;
           propagated (tubes 3 &amp; 4). Cell colonies enumerated and compared to number of colonies&#xD;
           identified by immunofluorescent staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In some cases CTC may be able to be grown as long-term cell lines. These cells may be&#xD;
           subject to further analysis such as evaluation of somatic gene mutations as well as gene&#xD;
           and protein expression patterns to identify characteristics of individual tumors as well&#xD;
           as drug and biologic agent sensitivity. There may be additional future in vitro&#xD;
           experimental applications for these de-identified early-passage cell lines that have not&#xD;
           yet been identified or anticipated in this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma (byproduct of leukocyte isolation process from tubes 3 &amp; 4) will be collected and&#xD;
           temporarily frozen for DNA and RNA isolation for molecular assays of melanoma molecular&#xD;
           markers and metastatic gene expression. These samples are consumed in the assay&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical information will be abstracted from medical records and de-identified and stored in&#xD;
      a password-protected spreadsheet. Information to be collected includes age, gender, T, N, M&#xD;
      status, other health conditions, serum LDH, any specific tumor markers (e.g. PSA),&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (if analyzed by commercial assay), somatic genetic mutations present&#xD;
      in cancer (e.g. B-RAF V600E in melanoma patients) mitotic rate of tumor, date of tumor&#xD;
      diagnosis, treatment history, date of regional and metastatic progression and date of death&#xD;
      (if applicable).&#xD;
