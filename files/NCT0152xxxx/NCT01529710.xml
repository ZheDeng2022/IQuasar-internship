      Clinical Trial Phase:Phase III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare Mirazid and Praziquantel cure rates for both Schistosoma species.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare Mirazid and Praziquantel effect in lowering the intensity of infection for both&#xD;
           Schistosoma species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:Identify and compare the types and severity of side and adverse effects&#xD;
      between the Mirazid and Praziquantel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:200 Schistosomiasis infected persons of both types of Schistosomiasis aged&#xD;
      from 15-35 years. Those subjects will be selected from among those screened.Subjects will&#xD;
      include both genders excluding chronically ill such as chronic liver disease patients and&#xD;
      those with both types of Schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Period:3 months and subjects follow up for another 3 months followed by 3 months&#xD;
      for statistical analysis and report writing Study Duration: Total study duration is expected&#xD;
      to be 9 months: 3 months for recruitment, 3 months for follow up and 3 months for data&#xD;
      management and report writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Will be measured at 3 months of successful administration of treatment either&#xD;
      Mirazid or Praziquantel as per the randomization scheme. By then, final assessment of the&#xD;
      response to treatment will be done by examining urine or stool of the subject for presence of&#xD;
      Schistosoma eggs and its density if found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three negative urine or stool samples collected 2-days apart at 12 weeks post treatment will&#xD;
      indicate treatment success. One positive sample collected at week 12 will indicate infection&#xD;
      with Schistosomiasis.&#xD;

      Study Design:This is a phase III, open-label randomized non-placebo-controlled Study in which&#xD;
      the investigators will compare the efficacy and safety of Mirazid to Praziquantel as a&#xD;
      treatment for Schistosomiasis. After screening, positive subjects for one of the&#xD;
      Schistosomiasis will be recruited in the study. They will be treated by Mirazid as 600 mg&#xD;
      oral (Soft Gelatin Capsules) for 6 consecutive days or 40mg/Kg body weight of Praziquantel as&#xD;
      a single oral dose. Subjects will be evaluated for success of treatment at 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Evaluation will be done by examining urine or stool samples for Schistosomiasis&#xD;
      including egg counts for the positive cases.&#xD;

    <description>Mirazid is an antischistosomal drug available in the local Egyptian market since 2001 (MirazidÂ®). It originates from Myrrh a medicinal herb that has been used for thousands of years. Myrrh (Arabian or Somali Myrrh) is an oleo-gum resin, obtained from the stem of various species of Commiphora (Burseraceae) growing in northeast Africa and Arabia.</description>
