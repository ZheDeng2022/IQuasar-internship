  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to study the course and outcome of illness in individuals who&#xD;
      present with a first episode of depression or mania, or who have a recurrent disorder but&#xD;
      have never received treatment. We plan to examine psychological, physical, social and&#xD;
      environmental factors that may affect long-term outcome in these disorders&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective naturalistic study of patients with a first treated&#xD;
      episode of mania or depression. Patients male or female between the ages of 16 and 50&#xD;
      inclusive with a Mood Disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. Control subjects will also be&#xD;
      recruited for this study and undergo the same initial testing. Follow-up visits every second&#xD;
      year will be requested of control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through Family Physicians, and referrals to the Mood Disorders&#xD;
      Program. We will respond to referrals with a brief telephone screening interview, and&#xD;
      appropriate referrals will be prior to the initiation of medication. Study patients will be&#xD;
      treated according to clinic practice guidelines for major depressive disorder and bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, as well as for comorbid psychiatric conditions. At intake, a variety of measures&#xD;
      will be used to collect data on symptoms and co-morbidity, cognitive processing, social&#xD;
      functioning, family and personal history, life events, substance use, mood symptoms,&#xD;
      personality functioning and characteristics, and physical well-being (baseline blood work and&#xD;
      urine, heart rate, blood pressure, weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address issues regarding both structural and functional brain changes that&#xD;
      occur in mood disorders by including both imaging and cognitive tests on subjects at entry&#xD;
      into the protocol, as well as re-testing with cognitive tests annually and study end-point.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging will be used to obtain data on anatomic structures in the brain.&#xD;
      MRI's will be repeated every two years. A small number of subjects (15) from each group of&#xD;
      depressed patients (first episode, never treated and multiple past episode patients, never&#xD;
      treated) as well as in healthy control subjects will along with the MRI be asked to complete&#xD;
      a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and a functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodes of mood elevation and depression will be monitored and recorded with respect to time&#xD;
      of onset, level of symptoms, time to remission and recovery, and time to relapse or&#xD;
      recurrence if applicable. Subjects will be monitored by clinicians on a regular basis as&#xD;
      indicated by their degree of illness and their individual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to clinical care, all subjects will complete a diagnostic work up which will take&#xD;
      approximately 4 hours and include diagnostic, functional, cognitive and physical assessments&#xD;
      including routine blood and urine tests. Then weekly visits/contacts for up to one (1) hour&#xD;
      in duration for at least eight (8) weeks, then monthly follow-up visits of up to one (1)&#xD;
      hour. Brief clinical assessments and self-report questionnaires will be completed at these&#xD;
      visits and further blood tests every six months will be required along with weight, waist/hip&#xD;
      circumference, blood pressure and pulse rate. Additional blood tests may be required as&#xD;
      clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact number of visits will depend on the degree of illness and the speed of recovery.&#xD;
      Euthymia Testing will be completed after achieving two (2) weeks of Ham-17 ratings less then&#xD;
      7, which will include the following assessments: CVLT, CFQ, MOS, Sub-syndromal Scale, COPE,&#xD;
      SAS-R, NEO-PI-R and the &quot;Mood Induction&quot;. Annual (on subjects' entry into the study) Testing&#xD;
      will be completed; at which time a repeat of the initial assessments will be done. The&#xD;
      duration of this study is two years with a possible extension of two more years if the&#xD;
      subjects has completed the study requirements and are interested in continuing their&#xD;
      participation. Each subject will be asked to complete the final visit(s), which would include&#xD;
      a repeat of the initial assessments and a MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who require ongoing clinical care will continue to be followed by their treating&#xD;
      psychiatrist following completion of the study protocol. This process will provide a database&#xD;
      through which patient characteristics at the time of initial presentation may be examined in&#xD;
      relation to the onset and course of illness, prognosis, and response to various forms of&#xD;
      treatment. While some of these factors have been examined in previous studies, little&#xD;
      information is available on patients who are treatment naive at time of study entry. This&#xD;
      project seeks to explore these issues and to provide a basis for further research in the area&#xD;
      of first episode mood disorders.&#xD;
