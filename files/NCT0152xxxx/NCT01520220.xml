             platelets ≥50,000 for PV or ET participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have discontinued all previous approved therapies for MF, including any chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunomodulating therapy (for example, thalidomide, interferon-alpha),&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy (for example, corticosteroids &gt;10 mg/day prednisone or&#xD;

             experimental agent that has not received regulatory approval for any indication&#xD;

             (CYP)3A4 with a narrow therapeutic margin (for example, alfentanil,&#xD;
             cyclosporine,diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and&#xD;
             tacrolimus) or CYP2B6 (for example, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen,&#xD;
             efavirenz, propofol, methadone, and bupropion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor,&#xD;
             may affect the interpretation of the results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not&#xD;

             Class greater than 2 (NYHA Class 1 and 2 are eligible), unstable angina, recent&#xD;
