    <textblock>
      5 Children &gt; 3months and &lt; 16 years with Gram-positive meningitis will receive a single dose&#xD;
      of daptomycin 24 hours after the first dose of ceftriaxone. 4-8 hours after daptomycin&#xD;
      administration a second lumbar puncture is performed to determine the peak concentration of&#xD;
      daptomycin in the cerebrospinal fluid. In parallel peak and trough level of daptomycin will&#xD;
      be measured in the plasma. The investigators anticipate that daptomycin penetrates into the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid in bactericidal concentrations&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute bacterial meningitis is a severe infection, which leads to persistent neurological&#xD;
      deficits in up to 50% of patients, despite optimal medical treatment. Although, the incidence&#xD;
      of acute bacterial meningitis has declined in developed countries since the advent of&#xD;
      vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, this is not yet true&#xD;
      for developing countries. Also, the impact of serotype replacement in invasive pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease cannot be estimated to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute bacterial meningitis causes brain injury most prominently in the cerebral cortex, the&#xD;
      inner ear and in the hippocampus. In the hippocampus, a brain region functionally important&#xD;
      for learning and memory, the brain damage is characterized by apoptosis of cells in the&#xD;
      hippocampal dentate gyrus. Autopsy studies demonstrated the occurrence of apoptosis in&#xD;
      neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in the majority (&gt; 75%) of human autopsy cases, who&#xD;
      died of acute bacterial meningitis. Children are particularly vulnerable to this form of&#xD;
      brain damage because of ongoing development of neurological functions and they have a higher&#xD;
      risk of neurologic deficits after bacterial meningitis than adults. The 3 most common&#xD;
      pathogens in childhood meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and&#xD;
      Neisseria meningitidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with the greatest risk for&#xD;
      fatal outcome or persistent neurological deficits. In the most recent prospective study&#xD;
      hearing loss was the most common major sequelae in half of the patients, followed by&#xD;
      cognitive deficits (40.0%), seizures (21.2%), and motor deficits (21.2%); one third of these&#xD;
      patients had multiple defects.The pathogenesis of brain damage in meningitis is driven by the&#xD;
      host's owns inflammatory reaction to the invading pathogens in the subarachnoid space. This&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction is triggered by the release of subcapsular bacterial components.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, β-lactam antibiotics, current standard of care in bacterial meningitis, induce&#xD;
      bacteriolysis leading to a brisk accumulation of subcapsular bacterial components in the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which in turn trigger an over-shooting inflammatory reaction&#xD;
      contributing to brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First evaluated more than 50 years ago, adjunctive corticosteroids still are the only&#xD;
      approved therapy to minimize this inflammatory reaction in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children the benefit of a combination therapy with dexamethasone and ceftriaxone has only&#xD;
      been proven in the reduction of permanent hearing loss after Haemophilus influenzae type b&#xD;
      meningitis, a pathogen that today is virtually eradicated in regions that implemented the&#xD;
      vaccination. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of dexamethasone administration in&#xD;
      meningitis have been challenged repeatedly. A recent prospective study and two meta-analyses&#xD;
      show conflicting results considering the benefit of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment for&#xD;
      neurological outcome in children with acute bacterial meningitis. Furthermore, adjunctive&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment does not seem to benefit patients with acute bacterial meningitis in&#xD;
      developing countries. Even more worrying are results in experimental meningitis, which&#xD;
      indicate that dexamethasone might lead to neuronal injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daptomycin (Cubicin¨, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel Switzerland) is a cyclic lipopeptide&#xD;
      antimicrobial agent active against most Gram-positive bacteria including strains that are&#xD;
      resistant to methicillin, vancomycin or linezolid. It binds to the membrane of Gram-positive&#xD;
      bacteria and causes rapid depolarization of membrane potential leading to bacterial cell&#xD;
      death. Thereby, daptomycin exerts a bactericidal, but non-bacteriolytic effect and does not&#xD;
      cause release of subcapsular bacterial components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been proven for experimental pneumococcal meningitis that daptomycin leads&#xD;
      to a substantially reduced inflammatory reaction compared to ceftriaxone. Additionally, it&#xD;
      has been shown that compared to ceftriaxone monotherapy, daptomycin plus ceftriaxone lowers&#xD;
      the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and reduces brain&#xD;
      damage in the form of hippocampal apoptosis and hearing loss in infant rat pneumococcal&#xD;
      meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the experimental data summarized above, it appears reasonable to assume that the use&#xD;
      of daptomycin, followed by the administration of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent in&#xD;
      children with pneumococcal meningitis, or other Gram-positive meningitis, would lead to a&#xD;
      reduced inflammatory response and, ultimately, to a reduced incidence of permanent&#xD;
      neurological deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it has been established that the pharmacokinetics (PK) of daptomycin in children are&#xD;
      age-dependent 6, only scarce data exist on the extent of penetration of daptomycin into the&#xD;
      inflamed CSF. Anecdotal evidence indicates that in humans with inflamed meninges daptomycin&#xD;
      penetrates into the CSF in sufficient amounts. This is supported by animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently two pediatric studies ongoing in the United States of America. DAP-PEDS-&#xD;
      09-01 will assess pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of Daptomycin in 18 children ages 3-24&#xD;
      months with Gram-positive bacterial infections. DAP-PEDS-07-03 will assess efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of multiple daptomycin doses in 339 children aged 2 - 17 years with skin and skin&#xD;
      structures infections. Design and dosing of both studies are based on previous findings in&#xD;
      two pediatric studies involving 25 children ages 2-17 years and 12 children ages 2-6 years.&#xD;
      None of these studies will or has investigated daptomycin penetration into the CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a first step to establishing optimal dosing recommendations for daptomycin in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with meningitis, the present pharmacokinetic study attempts to document adequate CSF&#xD;
      penetration of daptomycin in children with acute bacterial meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize the extent to which daptomycin penetrates into the CSF of children with acute&#xD;
      bacterial meningitis. Because determination of AUC in the CSF is not feasible, Cmax of&#xD;
      daptomycin in the CSF will be taken as a surrogate marker&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between the ages of 3 months to 16 years with acute bacterial meningitis will be&#xD;
      recruited. After obtaining baseline blood parameters including muscular enzymes, renal&#xD;
      function, hepatic function, and blood cultures, a lumbar puncture is performed and standard&#xD;
      of care therapy with ceftriaxone 100mg/kg (top dose 4g i.v.) is initiated. 24 hours after&#xD;
      hospitalisation a single dose of daptomycin at an age- dependent dosage, is administered i.v.&#xD;
      over 15 min. shortly before or after the second dose of ceftriaxone. 4-8 hours after&#xD;
      daptomycin administration a second lumbar puncture is performed to obtain a CSF sample for&#xD;
      measurement of peak daptomycin levels. Serum concentrations of daptomycin are measured&#xD;
      immediately after i.v. administration, at the time of lumbar puncture and 24 hours after&#xD;
      daptomycin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daptomycin therapy is discontinued after one dose, while standard of care antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy is continued for a total of 7 to 10 days.&#xD;
