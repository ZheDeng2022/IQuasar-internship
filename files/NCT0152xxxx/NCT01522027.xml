      Critically ill patients or patients under prolonged unconsciousness need a tube inserted into&#xD;
      their windpipe to provide oxygen. This tube, called a tracheostomy tube, can be connected to&#xD;
      a ventilation device to allow the patient to breathe when they cannot do it for themselves.&#xD;
      In the hospital, doctors will perform a percutaneous tracheostomy (PT), where a needle is&#xD;
      inserted through the skin of the neck into the windpipe, providing a guide for a tube that&#xD;
      will dilate the tissue and create a hole that the tracheostomy tube can be inserted into.&#xD;
      Although this is a common procedure in critical care units, it does carry some risks to the&#xD;
      patient and is not always successful. The needle may puncture the back or side of the&#xD;
      windpipe if it is inserted too far, or it can miss the windpipe altogether, causing damage to&#xD;
      surrounding structures. We believe that doctors who perform PT would benefit from a method&#xD;
      that improves the success rate of the procedure. We wish to test a device that alerts the&#xD;
      doctor performing PT to when the needle tip is in the air-filled windpipe. The device has&#xD;
      been proven to aid needle insertion in cadavers, but it needs to be tested on live patients.&#xD;
      Since many intensive care patients undergo PT, we wish to test our technique on this&#xD;
      population. It will be a controlled environment and the clinicians are experienced in PT.&#xD;
      This technique should save valuable time, result in more accurate needle insertion, and&#xD;
      lessen the risk of damaging other structures and tissues in the neck.&#xD;

      Background: Critically ill patients occasionally require a tracheostomy tube to breathe. A&#xD;
      percutaneous tracheostomy can be performed, where a needle/catheter is inserted into the&#xD;
      trachea, followed by insertion of a guidewire and a tube that dilates the tissue, creating a&#xD;
      hole for the tracheostomy tube. Although this is a common procedure, it does pose risks to&#xD;
      the patient, including accidental puncture of nearby structures. We wish to test a device&#xD;
      that alerts the doctor to when the needle tip is in the tracheal lumen. The device has been&#xD;
      proven to aid needle insertion in cadavers, but it needs to be tested on live patients. Since&#xD;
      many intensive care patients undergo PT, we wish to test our technique on this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nerve stimulator in aiding needle&#xD;
      tracheostomy in live patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Nerve stimulation equipment will help the physician guide and insert the needle&#xD;
      tip into the tracheal lumen faster and with more accuracy than conventional techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: speed and accuracy of needle tip placement in the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: This study will involve recruiting consenting adult patients from the University&#xD;
      of Alberta Hospital General Systems Intensive Care Unit (ICU) who require percutaneous&#xD;
      tracheostomy to insert a tracheal tube. In this population, a tracheostomy is usually&#xD;
      performed as a means to provide long-term assisted ventilation without the need for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation. Briefly, the patient is sedated, the skin on their neck disinfected,&#xD;
      and a local anesthetic injected into the anterior neck. A bronchoscope is inserted down the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube to aid in visualization and localization of needle puncture. The&#xD;
      cricothyroid membrane is located by palpating the anterior neck and an incision is made over&#xD;
      the membrane. A small needle is inserted through the membrane to act as a guide for a larger&#xD;
      needle-catheter assembly. Both needles are removed and a guidewire is inserted through the&#xD;
      catheter. Using forceps, the insertion site is widened and a tube to dilate the opening is&#xD;
      inserted. The tracheostomy tube is then inserted and the dilation tube and guidewire are&#xD;
      removed. The endotracheal tube is removed and the ventilation apparatus is connected to the&#xD;
      tracheostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will supply ICU physicians with a commonly used nerve stimulator (Stimuplex HNS 12,&#xD;
      B.Braun, Germany) to attach to the needle-catheter assembly used to make the first insertion&#xD;
      into the trachea. The nerve stimulator will be connected to a current meter, and a ground&#xD;
      electrode will be attached to the body. When the needle tip is in contact with body tissue&#xD;
      (i.e., tracheal wall), the electrical circuit will be closed, producing a reading of 1.0 mA&#xD;
      on the current reader. Suspension of the needle tip in the airway will interrupt the circuit,&#xD;
      producing a reading of 0.0 mA. In addition, an audible signal built into the nerve stimulator&#xD;
      will alert the user to a change in current, warning that the needle tip has advanced too far&#xD;
      and is in contact with the posterior or lateral tracheal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physician will perform percutaneous tracheostomy on 20 ICU patients that require&#xD;
      endotracheal extubation and insertion of a tracheostomy tube. This will help support our&#xD;
      preliminary observations which showed that the nerve stimulator was helpful in guiding needle&#xD;
      insertion using human cadavers. By showing that the technique is equally as effective when&#xD;
      used on live patients, we can argue that a nerve stimulator or similar device can ensure&#xD;
      accurate, quick, and safe needle insertion when accessing the airway percutaneously.&#xD;
