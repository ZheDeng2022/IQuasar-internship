  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose and objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the MET V&#xD;
      System for the treatment of individuals with mixed hearing loss.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MET V System is an investigational, fully-implantable middle ear hearing prosthesis. A&#xD;
      mixed hearing loss has both a sensorineural component and a conductive component that results&#xD;
      when sound being delivered to an impaired cochlea is attenuated by a disordered outer or&#xD;
      middle ear.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CNC Word Recognition Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Occurs at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change in the implant ear from CNC word recognition (unaided for mixed hearing loss and aided with hearing aid for sensorineural hearing loss) scores at the six month follow-up.&#xD;
The secondary efficacy endpoints include a speech perception outcome (BKB-SIN) measure and a subjective questionnaire (APHAB). The endpoint for the BKB-SIN is the mean change in score at the six month follow-up compared to the control. The endpoint for the subjective questionnaire (APHAB)is post-operative responses compared to the pre-operative control responses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BKB-SIN and Subject Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be monitored to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary safety endpoint is the mean change from baseline (average across 0.5, 1, 2, 3 4 kHz) in the implanted ear for pure tone bone conduction thresholds at the 6-month study visit, and safety will be monitored to 12 months.&#xD;
Secondary safety endpoints include assessments of adverse events and device failures.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Adult men or women, 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe mixed hearing loss, as a result of a combination of sensorineural&#xD;
             hearing loss and chronic ear disease, prior failed tympanoplasties, severe&#xD;
             otosclerosis, radical mastoidectomy, or congenital abnormality as evidenced by the&#xD;
             following in the ear to be implanted:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone conduction thresholds are measurable at 0.5,1,2,3 and 4 kHz&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone conduction thresholds are 20 dB or poorer at greater than 2 kHz&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Air conduction thresholds are 35 dB or poorer at 0.5,1,2,3 and 4 kHz&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Air-bone gap in ear to be implanted is greater than 15 dB at three or more frequencies&#xD;
             from 0.5 - 4 kHz&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Word recognition appropriate for sensorineural component of loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-fluctuating and stable hearing status&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. as defined as by no significant change or progression in the bone conduction&#xD;
             thresholds &gt;15dB at two consecutive octaves for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English Speaking (fluent)&#xD;

          -  Vestibular disorder, including Meniere's Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurring otitis media over the past year (&gt;2/year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-organic hearing loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Retrocochlear hearing loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Central auditory nervous system disorder&#xD;
